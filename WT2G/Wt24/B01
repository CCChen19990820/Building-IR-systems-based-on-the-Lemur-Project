<br><font size=3 color=#993300> ——————————————————————————————————————————————— </font><p>
<font size=6 color=#003333 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial">W</font>hat do visitors to Richmond think when they first arrive at the monument to Robert E. Lee and the great stone structure that supports the general and his horse? For starters, they probably are astonished by its size and probably by its grandeur, as Lee surveys everything below him.
<p>What does this largest, handsomest of the Monument Avenue monuments say about the Richmond of today? Arguably nothing. Drive around it enough times and it’s no longer there.
<p>In 1890, when the Lee statue was unveiled, people from all over the country, including many Civil War veterans, formed a parade four miles long to celebrate the day. It was a red-letter event in defining the postwar South, on a scale unimaginable today.
<p>Now stands athlete, author and humanitarian Arthur Ashe on the very same boulevard as general, scholar and statesman Lee. On July 10 of this year, the crowd at the unveiling of the Ashe statue comfortably filled the intersection of Roseneath Road and Monument Avenue. There was no parade this time, merely a gathering, a happening of sorts. Taking solemn, and sometimes stoic turns at the podium, everyone from Ashe’s relatives to little children  sought to capture the meaning of the moment, the symbolism of the day, the significance to Richmond. But in a sense, the pageant was anticlimactic.
<p>The real event unfolded over many months before July, with Richmonders engaging in a conversation on race relations that few will forget. To call it a controversy is to sell the experience short. Something changed here, if only a little, and old scores over race and rights came that much closer to being reconciled.
<p>After the dedication speeches, when chairs were folded, the media in retreat, and the cars starting again through the revised intersection, as Arthur Ashe stood there for anybody to approach, the real meaning of the monument came through — on a personal level, for individuals to decide what they thought of it, one on one.
<p>The statue attracted visitors at all hours of day and night.
<p>Did the statue absolve racists of their sins? Hardly. Did it strike a blow at the old Confederate generals? Of course not.
<p>But did it make a statement about contemporary Richmond? Most would say yes. Just as Lee’s statue says a lot about 1890, Ashe’s statue tells us something good about Richmond in 1996. Admittedly, we acted with the world looking over our shoulder, waiting to see us stumble or even fall. But that didn’t happen. Those dangers were evaded. And we learned a lot about ourselves in the process.
<p>Here is a celebrated man, acknowledged in bronze like the remarkable men who came a century or more before him. Here is a storied boulevard with a breath of new life — its first sign of life since 1929 when a brooding Matthew Fontaine Maury took his seat where Belmont crosses Monument.
<p>Two Richmonders never flinched in their commitment to honor Arthur Ashe. They pulled many others into the effort and quite possibly a city along with them. Inspired by Ashe’s visit to a city park near his home, artist Paul DiPasquale executed the symbolic work, defended its merit and flawlessly held his course through the storm.
<p>Introduced to Ashe when they were both boys, Thomas N. Chewning was driven to memorialize his dear friend, who died of AIDS in 1993. And it was Chewning who led many others in the drive to see Richmond honor her native son, and not forfeit the opportunity to some other town Ashe lived or worked in, for Ashe was unapolo-getic about being a citizen of the world.
<p>DiPasquale and Chewning are Style Weekly’s 1996 Richmonders of the Year.

<br><font size=4 color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Principal fund-raiser for the Ashe Monument</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#993300> ———————————————————————————————————————————————</font><br>
<font size=5 color=#000000 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><b>T</b></font>alking to his chief financial officer in London over the speaker phone, Tom Chewning, 51, seems a highly unlikely sort to stir the civic conscience. As the president and CEO of Dominion Energy Inc., he is all about business, stock prices and corporate performance in the world marketplace. But long before he landed the corner office, he met fellow Richmonder Arthur Ashe. He didn’t know the Ashe who was seeded above him in a West Virginia tournament. They had never been in the same tournaments back home because blacks and whites did not play each other there.
<p>“I thought it was a prank,” when Ashe’s name was posted over his own in the 18-year-old boys draw, Chewning says.
<p>A friendship was formed, and Chewning made his way up the corporate ladder while Ashe scaled even greater heights.
<p>And then in 1993, they were segregated again, this time parted by death. A little more than three years later, Chewning had led a quiet, determined fund-raising effort that garnered $420,000 plus $100,000 for the city budget. “There was hardly a day when you didn’t hear from both sides,” on the statue debate, he says. “Even if it didn’t work out, it wouldn’t have been a total loss.”
<p>As he solicited contributions from corporate Richmond, Chewning says he found near unanimous support for the statue, regardless of some firms’ inability to contribute. In the end, local money paid the bill.
<p>Ironically, Chewning belongs to First Baptist Church, once seen as a white society landmark that Ashe mentioned in his writings. And from that Baptist faith, Chewning says he took moral solace in building the monument while others around the debate took swipes at everything from the art value of the statue, to the need to respect the avenue’s historical Confederate heritage. Through it all, the scathing write-ups in The New York Times, the ripping editorials, the leaderless hearings in City Hall, Chewning says he held on because honoring Ashe on Monument was simply right.
<p>“There’s a price for anything you do,” he says, accounting for what the Richmond Times-Dispatch dubbed a “furor” at its peak. “And I really think Richmond won.” Bringing the discussion up to the moment, Chewning says, “Things don’t have to be perfect to be done.” Maybe that was the problem here — some ideal symbol in some ideal place just couldn’t be found. Somebody had to resolve to put Ashe somewhere, and that’s what Chewning’s organization did.
<p>“It was really that we wanted to be on the right side spiritually,” Chewning says, because “it’s wrong to stop something because it’s inconvenient.” And for the first time in his life, winning or losing meant less than simply trying to do something, he says.
<p>In a Dec. 1, 1996, article in The Washington Post, that paper’s critic wrote, “But only with the Ashe statue did this once-segregated boulevard  adjust with fitting symbolism to the importance of African Americans in Richmond’s life. Placing a statue of Arthur Ashe at a prominent spot on historic Monument Avenue is one of the best things to happen to Richmond in the entire 20th century.”
<p>Since July, Chewning and his family have stopped at the monument several times to mingle with people who are there to see the statue. It’s not unusual for somebody to recognize him as the executive who helped make it happen. The public’s response has exceeded what he imagined. “There is an aura there, and it’s more than the monument itself.”
<p>He’s fond of one vignette: An elderly black woman from Tidewater had brought her grandson to Richmond to see the monument. She told Chewning that she had grown up in the same circumstances as Ashe, and had she made the same kind of choices he did in life, she might be looking upon a monument of herself: “Here is somebody who saw everybody as their fellow man,” she said.
<p>“I did not understand how much the success of the monument meant to the African-American community — it says that people of value are included on Monument Avenue, regardless of any other factor,” Chewning says.
<p>That sudden, long-overdue inclusiveness on Monument Avenue means a lot to him, Chewning says.
<p>And among his own circles in white society — and they reach as high as they get in this town —  Chewning says an occasional colleague or friend will drop in or call to say they went to see the monument and that they liked it, and maybe, that they had misjudged it from the media.
<p>Looking back, Chewning says he felt it was a privilege to lead the effort to memorialize Ashe. “It was a healthy dialogue, to get the demons out. I learned to respect people who disagreed with me. A lot of the criticism had nothing to do with race or Arthur.”
<p>He hopes the example of the Ashe monument will open the door to future monuments and perhaps even change the way Richmonders take up civic challenges to come. “We should be more upbeat,” he says. “Richmond has a better reputation outside of Richmond than inside of Richmond.”

<font size=6 color=#aa6633 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><p><b>Paul DiPasquale</b></font>
<br><font size=4 color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Sculptor, project spearhead</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#993300>———————————————————————————————————————————————</font><br>
<font size=5 color=#000000 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><b>S</b></font>eated at a small dinette table in the loft of his Fulton Hill studio, artist Paul DiPasquale uses a rusty can opener to get into a tall can of V-8 juice. He offers a cup and takes one for himself.
<p>A light December rain plays on the roof. It’s a good place to reflect on the year.
<p>Now that people can visit the Ashe statue for themselves and the city’s opinion of the work is no longer driven by the critics, DiPasquale says he feels validated. His sense is that the monument has been well received by the public. (He was confident of this all along.)
<p>People needed an opportunity to make up their minds about the sculpture, the setting, the scene, and the symbolism without the cacophony that accompanied this headline-grabbing process — and many needed a chance to change their minds, too, DiPasquale says, to see the monument through unfiltered eyes.
<p>Six months have passed since he stepped back and let his work do the talking. As the statue makes its mark with visitors, DiPasquale says it silently performs the function it was always intended to do, to honor the person on the pedestal. And with Ashe as a subject, DiPasquale says, “We simply were not going to be dissuaded, given the man.”
<p>In some Richmonders’ minds, DiPasquale’s work was inferior. A group calling itself Citizens for Excellence in Public Art organized a late effort to solicit other artists to the Ashe project, supplying yet another front to the battle.
<p>At hearings and in news reports, critics pressed DiPasquale to quit or at least step aside so another artist might be considered to do the work. When DiPasquale held his ground, they assailed his character and his motives.
<p>Perhaps in another place or time, the artist would not have been the spearhead in the process. But in Richmond, DiPasquale was, which says something about the whole process, where leaders for the statue’s cause were few. Or they weren’t willing to stand up to the challenge.
<p>DiPasquale was speaking at public hearings, at commission meetings, with the local and national media, with the Ashe and Cunningham (Arthur’s mother’s side) families, wherever the fight was, he was.
<p>As one local politician described what it’s like to lead in Richmond, “When one crab tries to climb out of the basket, all the other crabs conspire to pull it back down because they can’t stand to see another emerge on top.”
<p>Less than a year after City Council’s approval of the statue and site, DiPasquale says, it’s evident the Ashe statue process reaped important dividends for Richmond, namely in understanding our heroes and the creation of symbols to honor them. “People say that what the statue stands for is more important than the art, thinking they will offend me. I agree with them, but the two are inseparable,” he says. “I think that is what is supposed to happen. The process reflects a new interest in our heroes, as monuments are an appropriate symbol of times; and it engages people in our heritage. You can’t ignore the history.”
<p>And Arthur Ashe, who was admired around the world like no Richmonder in the last 50 years or more, deserved his hometown’s acknowledgment, with more than a basketball gym or an elementary school.
<p>As DiPasquale and Virginia Heroes set out to erect the statue, three or four sites were considered before Monument Avenue came up. Once the meaning of that placement was explored, no one could ultimately block it.
<p>There was, however, a compromise in City Hall among the various parties:  Should the African-American Sports Hall of Fame be built, DiPasquale’s statue of Ashe would be moved there. Backers of that hall, which Ashe himself thought would be an appropriate place for his statue, say that Virginia Union University would be their preferred site.
<p>DiPasquale, who says the compromise was made in the heat of the moment and should not be carried out, is wary of the consequences of moving the statue. As one newspaper asserted, moving Ashe from the boulevard of Confederates to the historically black college would be tantamount to cultural apartheid, an observation DiPasquale doesn’t dismiss.
<p>“People don’t know what they’re asking for when they talk about moving a monument,” he says. “I think it would be foolish. Richmond would be cutting off its nose.”
<p>In the end, if the process is truly over, DiPasquale’s interests shared the same road as Richmond’s — the willingness, the need and the opportunity to honor a black man where only whites had gone before. Regardless of many critical viewpoints, issues and the varied opinions about Monument Avenue vs. Byrd Park or other sites, what cannot be challenged about this very public artist is the way he carried himself in the face of the very public storm.
<p>It was a remarkable performance — with DiPasquale showing an eloquence, a verve, an absolute cool as detractors erupted all around him. Having shown how to bend without breaking and how to succeed against daunting odds, DiPasquale might be the model for future Richmonders who want to get something accomplished that’s never been done before. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=5 color=#003366 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>A</b></font> few dozen people sit in the audience of the elegantly furnished School Board meeting room in Richmond’s City Hall. The board’s nine members, charged with running the city’s troubled schools, sit around a large table at the head of the room. 
<p>A presentation of the school system’s preliminary budget is announced. Packets of budget papers circulate to each School Board member. A schools employee projects a slide on the wall behind the board’s table. 
<p>Then things turn rather odd. Jeremy Lazarus, an aggressive reporter for the Richmond Free Press, complains that journalists haven’t been given copies of the preliminary report. He notes that any presentation made in public implies that the report is public information accessible to the press. 
<p>A hurried, whispered conversation takes place between Patricia Conn, superintendent of schools, and the man sitting beside her, Melvin Law, chairman of the School Board. 
<p>Law picks up a microphone. Lazarus’ objection has been noted, Law says; he and Conn agree that the budget material will be given to the journalists present. He warns reporters to use the numbers cautiously in stories referring to them. 
<p>Conn suddenly seizes Law’s arm and speaks urgently into his ear. Law listens. His eyebrows go up slightly. After a moment, he raises the microphone again and explains to all assembled that he had misunderstood Conn — she had in fact tried to tell him that the preliminary budget report should not be given to reporters. The public presentation is abruptly canceled. 
<p>A simple 30-second conversation between the head of the school system and the head of the School Board casts an embarrassing light on their utter dysfunction. The city’s business is stalled. 
<p>Though larger issues are decided this night, the moment crystallizes what is happening to Patricia Conn, a woman who in recent months has become the subject of praise and pillory. 
<p>In the first 18 months in her first job — and, she says, her last — as superintendent of a school system, the 55-year-old Conn has attempted a complete re-engineering of the bureaucracy she inherited; fought to increase participation in the schools by business people and corporate interests; battled publicly with the Richmond Education Association, which represents schools employees; been the subject of scathing criticism by almost all members of the School Board; and tried to wend her way through the city’s mine field of race and history — with varying success. 
<p>Few hold ambivalent views about this small woman with a broad, gap-toothed smile. Her critics call her harsh, incompetent and dictatorial. Her fans say she is strong, tough and patient. 
<p>She says she’s forcing the school system through revolutionary changes — and people, naturally, are upset and confused. 
<p>One thing is sure: Conn surfaced at the top of Richmond’s school system in record time, peers in education say, and with little background in school administration. Managing the city schools would frustrate Job: It’s a bureaucratic, politics-riddled colossus with 28,000 students — many of them poor. There are nearly 2,000 teachers and thousands of other employees, moldering schools, and a multimillion-dollar budget to manage. 
<p>Conn’s critics say her quick ride to superintendent reveals her lack of experience. Her friends say it’s a sign of her brilliance. 
<p>Crisis after crisis has rolled down upon her: A furious war exploded with the REA over teachers’ attendance at a college basketball tournament, ending in Conn’s humiliating defeat. Hundreds of students walked out of their classes and marched to City Hall over a plan to retool two high schools. The School Board even stripped Conn of the power to transfer her employees. 
<p>She has polarized School Board members — the people who hired her and who control her destiny with the school system — like a magnet tossed into a pile of iron filings. 
<p>“I’m sure that she’s not deliberately trying to destroy the school system,” says McEva Bowser, a School Board member, with a small sigh.
<p>“Patricia Conn,” retorts fellow School Board member Alexina Fagan, “is a very direct, very focused, very levelheaded person who knows her job.” 
<p>At the center of this hurricane rests Conn herself. She knows that many of her bosses are all but calling for her head — how could she not know? It’s in the newspapers. It’s on the nightly newscasts. 
<p>Still, she professes complete calm. “I feel no acrimony toward them,” Conn says of the School Board members. “I think they’re in a learning mode. They’re learning about very complex organizational ideas, and it’s frustrating. I understand that. ... 
<p>“I see them as developing human beings, like all of us,” Conn continues peaceably. “When people say negative things, I realize that’s all that they can do at their stage of development.” 

<hr>
<p>Conn’s own development began in Anniston, Ala., a blue-collar city of about 30,000 people. The daughter of two school principals, she seemed destined for an educator’s life. 
<p>Conn grew up in a tightly knit family that emphasized religion, education, the arts and hard work — and frowned upon socializing. 
<p>“My parents didn’t encourage a lot of contact with outsiders,” recalls Thelma Ozojiofor, one of Conn’s six siblings who, like most of her family, remains in Alabama. “I guess it was to protect us.” 
<p>The family’s isolation was so complete, Ozojiofor adds, that “I didn’t even know that people cussed until I left home.” 
<p>All nine family members lived in a three-bedroom house even when Conn’s parents earned enough to buy a larger home. “We kept trying to get them to get a bigger house,” Ozojiofor recalls, “but my parents were not the kind of people who went after material things.” 
<p>The father, Nelson Coleman, became a Lutheran minister and was active in the NAACP; he died in 1988. His wife, Vesta Coleman, was principal of a Lutheran school and is the sort of woman who cheerfully entered beauty contests while in her 70s — and won first runner-up, third runner-up and Miss Congeniality. 
<p>The parents stressed the importance of poetry, literature and music; Patricia learned piano and played in weekly family concerts. 
<p>The Colemans also taught their children a sense of their own self-worth. “My parents taught me not to worry about what other people say about you,” Conn says now, “which serves me very well in this job.” 
<p>Conn, her sister recalls, “was always a go-getter. [Grades] came pretty easy for her, but she still worked. She went after things. She likes striving for perfection. She wants to get things done just right. She always had goals, and she wasn’t satisfied until she reached them. She always tried a little bit more.” 
<p>Her parents encouraged civil disobedience in their children in the days of segregation and the civil-rights movement. The children defiantly drank from “whites-only” fountains, for example. 
<p>“My [children] were never segregated,” Vesta Coleman, Conn’s 82-year-old mother, says proudly. “Regardless of the law, they just got in their minds that this or that person is no better than they are.” 
<p>To illustrate her experience in the civil rights era, Conn often tells reporters about a cross burning staged in her family’s yard, but Conn’s mother doesn’t recall any such incident.
<p>Coleman says that race relations in Anniston were primarily a matter of small, behind-the-scenes battles and victories over, say, getting jobs — not the stuff of Southern Gothic novels. “It was never really that bad,” she says. “Blacks and whites mostly got along just fine.” 
<p>Conn’s mother emphatically denies that a cross ever burned in her front yard. “Not in front of my house,” she says. “I think I’d remember that. Whoever’s telling that is just using their imagination.” 
<p>(Conn says that her mother simply doesn’t remember the cross burning. “The KKK was very active,” Conn says. “My mother always sees the good side of things. She is incapable of seeing the bad.” Conn concedes that she never actually saw the burning cross, but overheard people talking about it.) 
<p>Conn graduated from high school at age 15, having skipped a grade in elementary school. She headed for Talladega College, a small black liberal-arts college founded by former slaves near Birmingham. She majored in English. 
<p>“My family was so large,” Conn reflects, “with seven children, that the socialization took place within the family. That can have its disadvantages. When I got to college, I had to learn to socialize with other people. ... I was very shy.” 
<p>So Conn joined practically any group that offered her a berth: She wrote for the student magazine; she debated for the school club; she sang in the choir. 
<p>But the family never let her get too far away — they visited regularly, parents and siblings traipsing to Talladega every weekend. “By the time I got to my senior year,” Conn says wryly, “that got kind of annoying.”
<p>Her senior thesis — the college required one of every senior — was a three-act play based on a verse from the Bible’s Book of Ecclesiastes that begins: “Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.” She remains proud of that work and refers to it often. 
<p>“I was looking at the cycle that life always takes,” she says. “It’s like sitting by a river and watching the water. It can go through so many changes, but it always seems to come back to the shape it was. ... 
<p>“Some people find change very disruptive,” she adds, circling back to her favorite theme. “I don’t.” 
<p>She received her degree in 1961. Three years later she headed to Washington, D.C., to become a teacher. She spent the next 14 years teaching English, reading, geography and drama in high school and junior high. 
<p>The D.C. schools were moribund, poor and badly administered — run so poorly that this year their administration was stripped of all authority amid allegations of financial incompetence. 
<p>She married Gerald Harrison and had two daughters, Tahoma and Jill. Harrison left the family in 1976, a subject the family understandably prefers not to discuss. “He just left,” says Conn’s daughter Tahoma Lewis, 25, who now lives in Maryland. “That’s all.” 
<p>Conn was left to raise the girls alone. Money was tight; Conn’s mother remembers that as children Tahoma and Jill “sold candy to help themselves.” 
<p>Two years later, Conn returned to college and received her master’s degree in education from the University of Maryland, while continuing to work for the Washington schools. 
<p>By 1982 she had begun selling real estate part-time, a job that unexpectedly changed her life: She sold a condominium to a man named Paul Conn. They dated for the next 12 years and married in 1994.
<p>The ’80s proved to be Conn’s period of slow, steady growth, a sort of rest for the burst of activity to come. She rose in the D.C. school system to become assistant principal of a high school. She wrote grants, began a “pre-architecture” program for students and worked on a drug-free school program that was recognized by the DEA and the U.S. Department of Education. 

<hr>
<p>The real shift came in 1990. Both daughters announced that they were getting married. And Conn decided she would go back to school for her doctorate. 
<p>Not just any school, either. Conn chose Harvard.
<p>She got in and became one of 10 students accepted nationwide for the university’s nascent urban-superintendents program. The next few years began Conn’s swift ascent as an administrator.
<p>“Pat is driven ... in the positive sense,” says Howard Peterkin, director of Harvard’s urban superintendents program and Conn’s adviser while she was a student there. 
<p>Peterkin, who considers himself Conn’s friend, remembers her as a hard-working, intense student whom he later asked to serve on his advisory board. 
<p>“She did extremely good work,” Peterkin says. “She is very direct, and that sometimes can rub people the wrong way. ... But that’s the thing we give them. Pat feels very strongly the urgency of the need to reshape public education, as do I. ... I’m really impatient with people who are messing around with children’s lives. 
<p>“A consultant once [told me] that his city wanted ‘cautious change,’” Peterkin adds, to illustrate his philosophy. “I said I didn’t know what that was.” 
<p>Conn’s Harvard training didn’t cover the politics and diplomacy of working with school boards, unions and officials, Peterkin says, though those issues have since been added to the Harvard program. 
<p>As part of Conn’s coursework, she worked in Philadelphia as an intern with the superintendent of schools there. 
<p>“I found Patricia to be very intelligent, very committed to children and to quality education,” says Constance Clayton, superintendent of Philadelphia schools during Conn’s internship. 
<p>Clayton was impressed enough to give Conn the job of helping overhaul the system’s middle schools — no small task, as Clayton notes. “You’re talking about a definite change in culture.” Conn excelled in helping along this sort of sweeping change, Clayton says. 
<p>Conn also took on a project requiring great delicacy and tact: exploring the best way to provide Philadelphia students with sex education and condom use. In a city that is majority Catholic, this proved complex. 
<p>“We were being accused of encouraging promiscuity by one side,” Clayton says, “and of acting too slowly by the other. ... It was very controversial.” 
<p>Conn, Clayton says, “was not a steamroller. She did not steamroll anyone.” 
<p>The sex-education project was Conn’s graduate thesis, and today Peterkin judges it “excellent.” She graduated from the program in three years — half the time most students require. 
<p>She then went to Rochester, N.Y., to become deputy superintendent of its 36,000-student school system, which is larger than Richmond’s. 
<p>“She was very honest, straightforward and confident,” recalls Augustin Melendez, supervising director of human resources for Rochester schools. Melendez worked closely with Conn. “I wouldn’t characterize her as abrasive. ... Her assertiveness made her confident. ... She hit the community running. She was very active. She did not come here to hide. Pat was not bashful to tell you how she felt. As a new player, people may want to sit quietly and not ruffle others’ feathers. She was not hesitant to do that.” 
<p>Another Rochester schools official who asked not to be identified, however, notes: “When she came to us, we took a major gamble. She had very little practical experience. ... She was a deputy superintendent who was learning on the job. It was going to take time. If you go in and learn by trial and error, you’re going to piss off a lot of people. She used to do a lot of that.”
<p>Many times, the schools official recalls, Conn irritated School Board officials by bringing up ideas in formal meetings that they had never heard before — a charge familiar to Richmond school officials. 
<p>“In a public-school, urban environment,” the Rochester schools official concludes, “you are not going to be very successful unless you can deal with the politics. She did not.” 

<hr>
<p>Within two years she was hired by Richmond to run its school system. “I was very surprised to hear that she was coming to Richmond,” Melendez says. “I don’t think she had the substance and the experience behind her.” 
<p>Conn was a compromise candidate for Richmond’s superintendency, a job that has devoured four superintendents in eight years. 
<p>School Board member Mark Emblidge interviewed Conn in Rochester for the job and says her style impressed him. “You want an aggressive superintendent,” Emblidge says. “We’ve been looking for an aggressive leader with ideas.” 
<p>But, adds Emblidge, who publicly supported Conn but recently became critical, “That’s just a piece of it.” 
<p>Emblidge and other critics present a laundry list of Conn’s missteps, misstatements and general disregard for tact in dealing with sensitive issues. 
<p>A few months after arriving in Richmond, Conn spoke to PTA members at Fox Elementary, a school that draws students from all over the city because of its reputation as one of the city’s best. 
<p>Conn, Emblidge recalls, told the parents that she was opposed to the city’s long-standing policy that allows students to attend any school that had space for them. Saying this in a roomful of parents of children who strongly favored the policy, Emblidge says, resulted in a barrage of telephone calls to him from concerned and outraged parents. 
<p>Conn says she never told the parents she would change the policy, simply that she is philosophically opposed to it. 
<p>The fate of Maggie Walker High School, the long-closed, nostalgically remembered school drew more criticism. “We met on a Wednesday before Thanksgiving,” Emblidge says, “to look at the superintendent’s recommendation to the board for Maggie Walker. She recommended opening [the school] with a West African-Japanese emphasis. ... We made some recommendations [to her] about how to broaden that emphasis.” 
<p>When Conn next came to the board, however, “out of the blue she was recommending opening Westhampton [School],” Emblidge says. “She said it would cost $6 million to $8 million to renovate it. ... Those figures were based on a renovation of Open High School, which has 250 students.”
<p>Conn suggested moving Richmond Community High School from the Westhampton building into Thomas Jefferson High School, which was home to TJ students and the Governor’s School for the Gifted. The Governor’s School and Community High then would share a building; Jefferson students would move into Westhampton; and Maggie Walker would reopen in 2004. 
<p>After some additional study, the School Board concluded it would cost as much as $15 million to renovate Westhampton. 
<p>“She needed to do some homework, because the figures she was using to justify [opening Westhampton] simply weren’t going to work,” Emblidge says. 
<p>The School Board didn’t even bother to vote on Conn’s advice. They simply ignored it. 
<p>Perhaps Conn’s greatest gaffe came in February, when she excoriated teachers for allegedly taking sick days to attend the CIAA basketball tournament.
<p>Conn repeatedly said that as many as 478 of Richmond’s teachers left school for the tournament, essentially halting learning at some schools. That led to nationwide criticism of the schools and their teachers.
<p>Emblidge and other School Board members stood by Conn’s remarks for a time, even as the Richmond Education Association attacked their accuracy. 
<p>It turned out that at most 189 teachers were absent during the tournament’s three days the previous year, an average of 63 a day — lower than on many non-tournament school days. 
<p>“Get your facts straight,” rages Emblidge almost a year later. “The inaccurate number was used over and over again. ... We supported her in actions — we supported her based on her facts. Well, we started to get a little squeamish when we found out that ... the numbers were not accurate.”
<p>Though Conn since has repeatedly apologized, many in the school system say that error irreparably damaged her reputation. “It’s hurt her tremendously,” says Lola McDowell, president of the REA, who waged a protracted battle with Conn over the CIAA debacle. 
<p>A personal tragedy added to Conn’s troubles. During her battle over the teacher attendance, her husband died unexpectedly. “He was like my rock,” she says now, eyes misting with tears. 
<p>Still, Conn hasn’t slowed down. She’s tried to tie principals’ evaluations to classroom results. She’s provided incentive grants for teachers, providing them with additional funds so they can be more creative in the classroom. She’s created a special “School Improvement” team to assist schools in trouble. 
<p>But battles continue to dog her. Last summer, Conn attempted to reassign about a dozen principals, some of whom had not met the system’s goals. Unlike previous years, the School Board halted most of the reassignments when some of the principals complained.
<p>Her authority to manage personnel was quickly being undermined by a School Board that would no longer back her up. In September, the board stripped Conn of her power to transfer the employees she oversees — making her the first Richmond superintendent without that power since 1978. 
<p>“The School Board took away her right to transfer employees as a direct result of employee discomfort. It’s an unheard-of action,” says Conn’s most voluble School Board defender, Alexina Fagan. “This is a system run by employees for employees — not for children.” 
<p>Fagan says Conn is being attacked by hidebound teachers and bureaucrats who hold the School Board hostage to their interests. 
<p>“There are board members who spend a whole lot of time undermining everything she does,” Fagan says. “They’ve done a number on [School Board member] Eugene Mason — he used to like her.”
<p>Mason, contacted for comment, offers Conn lukewarm support. “I think the board has been very supportive of Dr. Conn,” he says, contradicting the opinion of all other observers. 
<p>He declines to detail his thoughts on Conn, explaining: “The media just has not been supportive of the [school] system.” Conn, he adds, however, “is getting support through the media.” 
<p>Through all this, Conn says she intends to stick it out. 
<p>She has several strong cards in her favor: As she did in Rochester, Conn has worked successfully to create partnerships between corporations and the schools. The city’s schools are attracting the interest — and the money — of suburban business people. 
<p>Perhaps more importantly, Conn works in a school system with a nationwide reputation for firing superintendents — and paying them hundreds of thousands of dollars in severance pay. That legacy looms over this School Board. Paying off another fired superintendent’s contract wouldn’t sit well with city voters, either, who now elect the School Board.
<p>Nonetheless, School Board members won’t give odds on Conn surviving another year as superintendent. Several note that she’s long overdue for her annual job assessment, which was scheduled for June 1996. 
<p>In the eye of this swirling storm, Conn awaits her fate with complacency. If she loses this job, she says, she won’t take another job as superintendent as most of her predecessors have. She might become a writer. 
<p>Meanwhile, she waits. 
<p>“Most people have an us-and-them take on life,” she reflects. “But that’s not my philosophy at all. I’m trying to dismiss ego and move toward harmony in my life. ... I’m completely at peace with myself. There’s no internal conflict here. 
<p>“I’ve chosen Richmond as my home, and I’m going to be here regardless of what happens. This is where I’m going to stay. I’m going to stay right here.” 
<p>She smiles. Peacefully. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<font size=4 color=#333366 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i>by Edwin Slipek Jr.</i></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=5 color=#333333 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>“I</b></font> was reading a book the other day.”
<p>It’s an unremarkable line, but when spoken by Jean Harlow in a white satin gown as she slinks across a parlor in the ’30s film classic “Dinner at Eight,” the remark elicits incredulous double takes. Playing a former hat-check girl who married well, she continues: “It’s all about civilization or something. ... This guy said machinery is going to take the place of every profession.”
<p>Eyeing the shapely platinum blonde, another guest retorts archly: “That’s something you’ll never have to worry about.”
<p>On the eve of the opening of three major new technologically “wired” libraries in Richmond, the venerable institutions have already asked themselves a similar question: Is the computer going to replace the printed page?
<p>The answer, from The Library of Virginia, Union Theological Seminary and Virginia Union University, is yes ... and no. Libraries no longer are exclusively physical repositories of information — anyone with a modem and a computer can “visit” any number of libraries around the world. Instead, libraries are evolving into information conduits. These three state-of-the-art libraries, set to open in early January, will help the high- and low-tech browser find the information, whether in the form of last month’s National Geographic or a Web site about Belize. Libraries are not just the destination, they are the way to get there. And in that sense, they’ll continue to do what the best libraries have always done — open doors to new destinations.
<p>“Young people know how to use CD-ROM and the Internet: They are not afraid but excited about the new technology,” says Vonita Foster, library director at Virginia Union where the new L. Douglas Wilder Library and Learning Resources Center opens Jan. 9. “But people are checking out books; our circulation is soaring.”
<p>Beyond replacing antiquated facilities half a century old (or older) with libraries that are technologically state-of-the-art and larger (their combined running shelving could stretch from Richmond to Norfolk), these three new libraries share a broader and more public agenda: architecture as image-maker. In each situation, the critical need for technology and expanded and modernized space coincides with the chance to raise the visibility and changing educational mission of libraries. 
<p>At Union Theological Seminary, a Presbyterian-affiliated graduate school in Ginter Park with an international and interdenominational student body, one of the goals for the new library was to create a topnotch facility that will attract, if not dazzle, prospective students.
<p>Historically, libraries are buildings with two main functions — storage and reference. But according to Craig Hartman, a principal architect with Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, designer of the new Library of Virginia,  the proliferation of the computer technology has replaced the physical connection between storage and reference with a “virtual” one. This reduced the spacial needs of both.
<p>“As the need for storage decreases, the service functions of libraries may increase proportionately,” he says. “Many of those services already exist today, but their importance will increase: teaching, for example, so that people can master the new equipment and information services; new methods of organizing and analyzing data; new methods of conveying ideas and information; and access to information.”
<p>“The biggest challenge is maintaining the 19th-century library while making the leap to the 21st century and the digital era,” says Virginia Commonwealth University’s director of library services, Barbara Ford, who serves currently as president of the American Library Association. “The challenge is not to do away with the old [systems] before we know the new [technology] will work,” she cautions. “We are learning that technology is not necessarily as ubiquitous and as easy to use as some had thought. Technology is only as good as the people developing the data, so libraries are increasingly important — to help you interpret information when you get there.”
<p>Hardly the somber, low-keyed libraries of old, Richmond’s three new libraries are designed to be service-oriented, welcoming spaces — each has a soaring, multistory entrance atrium flooded with natural light. The areas where patrons seek assistance are clearly delineated. And each new library boasts expanded and attractive areas for displays, rare book holdings and special collections.
<p>“We wanted a building that was inviting and would attract more visitors and scholars,” says Andrew H. McCutcheon, board chairman of the state’s official library, The Library of Virginia, speaking of the imposing new edifice on East Broad Street. “And had parking.” Where the old library had just one indoor spot and that was for book drop-off, the new library has 100 indoor parking spaces for patrons. 
<p>“There will always be a need for places in libraries that are friendly and bring people and ideas together,” says VCU’s Ford.
<p>So despite opening their doors in an era of belt-tightening at both public and private educational institutions, and with fierce competition for shrinking humanities dollars, each of Richmond’s new libraries seems to say confidently: Come in, discover our treasures, plug in — and return often.

<p><img src="./images/feat52-2.jpg" width=198 height=300 align=right border=1><font size=4 color=#333366 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><b>Virginia Union University</b></font>
<hr size=1>Although its expanses of masonry-block walls stand in stark, contemporary counterpoint to the procession of turn-of-the century, turreted buildings that could be the stuff of Charles Addams cartoons, there is no question that the first new building to be constructed on the 1,500-student Virginia Union campus in some 30 years is tradition-laden:
<p>• First, there is the choice of dark gray stone block for its exterior walls that echo the somber, late-19th-century buildings that distinguish the gently rolling North Side campus on Lombardy Street. The Livas Group, a Norfolk architecture firm, has given contextualism to the building through a series of peaked roofs and oversized round windows.
<p>• The building stands in place of “The Dust Bowl,” a tract of no-man’s land next to the train tracks and an elevated stretch of Interstate 95. Alumni from here and afar parked there for tailgate picnics when the Panthers played football at home. 
<p>• Then there is the famous name emblazoned on the facade: The L. Douglas Wilder Library and Learning Resource Center. The facility is named for the nation’s first elected African-American governor and one of the school’s most celebrated alumni. The inner sanctum contains an archival area featuring a permanent exhibit on Wilder’s life and times. The walls are a virtual photo album of the governor’s travels: a photo of Wilder with former South African President F. W. de Klerk — and another with Nelson Mandela. 
<p>• A visitor cannot enter the large, gray- and maroon-trimmed atrium (gray and maroon are the school’s colors) without looking northward through plate-glass windows and back toward the campus’ extraordinary old facility that this new library replaces — the Belgian Building with its slender modernistic tower anachronistically pushing above the treeline.
<p>To say that the barnlike exhibition building was never adequate as a library is a considerable understatement. VUU inherited it from the 1939 World’s Fair: It was dismantled and shipped from New York. The new library is more than triple the size of the old one — 68,500 square feet compared to the 20,000 square feet. When the new building opens, it will contain some 147,000 books and can expand to 250,000 volumes.
<p>Because of heretofore poor library facilities, recruiting new students “was a tough sell,” admits an administrator, “This new building couldn’t come soon enough.”
<p>The library cost about $7.5 million. A $1 million lead gift was given by Richmond philanthropists Sydney and Frances Lewis. Members of the Wilder family made contributions, and for a number of years, Wilder has donated any fees he received from speaking engagements toward the library.
<p>The bulk of the funds was raised from foundation and smaller individual gifts.
<p>For the first time, the library will provide all Union students access to the Internet. A computer laboratory is on the second floor. Previously, only faculty, staff and graduate students had direct access to computers. There are also new study rooms with individual carrels and some additional classrooms, which the school says are in short supply.
<p>Besides putting technology at the service of students, the new library will allow for the continued collection, research space, storage and display of items about the African-American experience in the United States. Primary materials and artifacts in this field are rare.
<p>“We try to purchase as much as we can,” says library director Foster of material pertaining to black history and referring specifically to a half dozen works on canvas by Almarie Little, a New Orleans painter now in her 70s. Foster says the library also counts among its treasures a number of rare slave documents. “We try to reach out as much as possible,” she says of the university’s collecting efforts.
<p>“The new library will allow us many more opportunities for outreach into the community,” says Barbara F. Biemeck, director of information and publications at the university. “This will be a whole different story,”
<p>But for students who will enroll for their final semester in January, the move to the new library is bittersweet. Says Biemeck, “They are saying: ‘Oh great. Now that we’re seniors we finally have a good facility,’ to which I respond, yes, but now you can be proud to bring your kids here.”

<p><img src="./images/feat52-1.jpg" width=300 height=201 align=right border=1><font size=4 color=#333366 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><b>The Library of Virginia</b></font>
<hr size=1>While Virginia Union is moving its library from a late ’30s building that once served as a World’s Fair pavilion, the Library of Virginia moves from a late ’30s building that epitomized modern, state-of-the-art library design when it was completed in 1940. It fronts the Darden Garden (formerly Capitol Street), a stone’s throw from the statehouse and Executive Mansion. Over the ensuing 56 years, however, it had become damp and posed serious fire and security risks. It was also bursting at the seams.
<p>Initially, in addition to numerous other sites, the state-appointed library board considered building the new facility on Governor Street across from the old library on a slice of state-owned land. But the city of Richmond stepped in and offered a choice and highly prominent piece of downtown real estate — the entire block bounded by Broad, Eighth, Ninth and Marshall streets. A block west of the downtown state governmental campus, the site is immediately west of City Hall and south of the John Marshall Courts Building and the historic brick home of the great chief justice.
<p>City officials envisioned the library shoring up activity on Broad Street, traditionally the town’s most prominent commercial and institutional thoroughfare. And during a time of tight budgeting, the library board recognized a good deal when it saw one.
<p>“When it was decided we needed a new library, the vision of the building committee was to have something very impressive downtown,” says board chairman McCutcheon, “We also needed new environmental controls and a building that was patron-friendly. And although it contains new technology, it ‘says’ library inside and out.”
<p>The aggressively modern building houses more than 1 million books, documents and artifacts relating to the nation’s and commonwealth’s history.
<p>“The library, being an archival reservior, will bring a great deal of activity to downtown,” says former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who has been one of three governors to work on the project, “but it will primarily enhance learning and education statewide.”
<p>The new facility, designed by the internationally noted architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill (with Richmond’s The Glave Firm as associate architect) cost $43 million and has about 317,000 square feet of space on five floors plus a mezzanine level. There are two levels of below-grade parking.
<p>The building’s functions fall into two categories: public services and technical services. Public services include reading rooms, research areas, collection spaces, a conference center complex including a lecture hall, exhibition spaces, and a bookstore. Staff and technical offices are located in the upper reaches.
<p>The high-ceilinged and light-filled reading rooms are furnished with a series of custom-designed and “wired” reading tables that will provide the library patron, via personal computer, access to the library’s central computer. The reading rooms are also designed for maximum controlled natural light by a series of translucent window shades that carefully     balance the amount of light needed for either reading a book or using a computer screen.
<p>Quotations from 14 prominent Virginia writers and personalities — from the state’s first governor, Patrick Henry (whose gubernatorial papers and those of all his successors up to George Allen are housed in the library), to the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and editorialist Douglas Southall Freeman — are rendered graphically throughout the reading rooms above the bookshelves: Quotations are fashioned in raised metal letters with signatures copied from actual documents in the library’s collections.
<p>The north side of the building on the mezzanine and second levels houses administrative spaces. These include the state librarian’s office which overlooks the 18th-century brick home of former Chief Justice John Marshall.
<p>A major component of the library’s expansion, however, has yet to be realized. A records center, where many of the state’s voluminous official documents and other material will be stored, is yet to be built in eastern Henrico County. The facility will be administered by the library staff. Materials intended for that facility will remain at the old building until the new structure is completed. Groundbreaking is slated for this spring.
<p>The library’s public spaces are organized around a dramatic central three-story lobby, entered thorough plate-glass doors from the south on East Broad Street. The general reading rooms, open collections and resource areas surround the lobby and are dramatically visible when you enter the building off Broad Street. 
<p>From the lobby, the library’s most precious materials are housed in a rare books area that appears to float above the main staircase.
<p>Among the new features of the building is a Virginia authors room which will contain works by selected authors born, or associated with the state.
<p>“Virginia history, generally, is the history of the nation,” says McCutcheon, “To see something in our special collections that was actually written by George Washington or Jefferson gets to you.”
<p>Among the many historically precious documents housed in the new library is one of 12 surviving original copies of the U.S. Bill of Rights and the original copy of the Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom. Inspired by George Mason, penned by Thomas Jefferson and promoted by James Madison, Virginians all, the law for the first time in western civilization promoted religious freedom.
<p>“I was looking at the document just the other day, to make sure it got here,” says Nolan T. Yelich, the state librarian whose staff is in the midst of an intense one-month moving process that he says might take three to four months at comparable institutions.
<p>The mammoth new library looks to the future as well as the past, he says.
<p>Says Board Chairman McCutcheon: “I’m hoping that through the spaces in the new building we can establish connections with the corporate business community and fruitful relationships with not-for-profit organizations. I see us serving the community beyond the pure services we offer as a library.”
<p>Besides meeting space for various organizations, one of the new permanent public attractions will be the 1,200-square-foot exhibition area located in the back of the main lobby. “The Common Wealth: Treasures from the Collections of the Library of Virginia” will be the inaugural exhibition  during official grand opening activities next May.
<p>VCU’s Ford welcomes the state library’s new, more high-visibility thrust: “There aren’t enough places to come together downtown, and the new state library establishes a grand new public space. It was much, much needed. While architecturally interesting, the old building has long ago outlived its usefulness: This is a quantum leap in terms of technology. It’s a celebration of books. It’s a wonderful combination of the old and the new.”
<p>State Librarian Yelich agrees: “If we don’t keep up, we will be left behind,” he says of rapid advances being made in technology, we’re making sure the best of the past is there while embracing the future.”

<p><img src="./images/feat52-3.jpg" width=198 height=300 align=right border=1><font size=4 color=#333366 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><b>Union Theological Seminary</b></font>
<hr size=1>On Chamberlayne Avenue, at Union Theological Seminary’s sedate North Side campus, as at Virginia Union and The Library of Virginia, staff and movers will be moving during the holidays readying their new library for an early January opening.
<p>“We’ll be pushing, pulling, stacking and shoving,” says John Trotti, head librarian. For him, the new library is a realization of a decade-old effort to replace the 230-student seminary’s antiquated library whose earliest wing dates to the late 19th century. “We’d been living on borrowed time in terms of space,” says Trotti, “Packing books in any way we could.” 
<p>The new facility, The William Smith Morton Library, was designed by Richmond architects The Glave Firm and has 68,000 square feet of space, more than double the size of the facility it replaces. The seminary campus is a distinctive architectural grouping of massive red-brick buildings constructed in the 1890s in a vaguely Tudor style They encircle a grassy, oak-lined, block-long, idyllic quadrangle that is a popular space for students to toss Frisbees or footballs. The new library is at the head of the quad and balances the seminary’s Watts Chapel at the opposite end of the lawn as if anchoring the school’s purposes — scholarly study (the library) — and preparation for pastoring (the chapel).
<p>“It’s a very visible and important symbol in bricks and mortar that we [the church and its educational institutions] are here to stay,” says Trotti. “It says what we stand for.”
<p>Flexibility was key in the library’s planning and construction, Trotti says. “When we told our [technological] consultants we wanted a building that would serve our needs for 20 years, they just laughed. They didn’t even want to talk about 10 years. But we held them down to 20.”
<p>Trotti says the new library has curtain walls that can be moved as needs change. Cables for computer hookups have been installed to serve every space within the building including each of more than 100 individual study carrels. This will eventually allow library users to plug directly into the library’s computer network.
<p>“Maybe cable won’t be the thing of the future,” says Trotti ironically, “but we’ve got it.”
<p>The new three-story building includes an adaptive reuse and expansion of former Schauffler Hall (which served as a chapel, lecture hall and campus radio station and was built in the 1920s) and it cost about $12.5 million including furnishings. In addition, it has been endowed for upkeep.
<p>New features include a rare book room which boasts priceless books by Protestant reformer John Calvin and works by early reform theologians. There will also be spaces for students to conduct group study — “We haven’t had that kind of space before,” says Trotti, “Students would gather in the reading room, and their babbling would disturb everybody.”
<p>For librarian Trotti, the new Gothic-style, high-tech library is a personal, as well as professional and institutional achievement. A number of years ago he was seriously ill.  “I looked like the wrath of the gods and many people thought I wasn’t going to make it,” he says. He underwent a successful kidney transplant, which, he says enthusiastically, “has me kicking around like a young man. It’s gonna take a stick of dynamite to get me out of there.”
<p>Come closing time each evening after these three openings in January, dynamite, or at least a crowbar, might be necessary to remove not just excited staff, but patrons discovering Richmond’s three comfortable, “wired” and spectacular new libraries. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<font size=5 color=#333333 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>T</b></font>he distraught husband cannot make sense of his wife’s sudden disappearance. “There’s just no logic to it,” he tells the TV news reporter in an on-camera interview. “It doesn’t make any sense.” Round-shouldered and slouching in a chair in his family room, he appears drawn and haggard, worried to death. “Sweetheart,” he says, looking through wire-frame glasses directly into the camera lens, “if you’re out there anywhere, for any reason at all, we all love you. Let us know, let us know where you are, please, get in touch with us. Everybody’s praying for you. I ...” He drops his head and exhales an exasperated burst of air. “I don’t know what else to say.”
<p>As Henry Clay Wheless, a former Ethyl Corp. executive, made his dramatic appeal for the return of his wife, Jean Spencer Wheless — who had supposedly disappeared earlier in the week while he was on a business trip — he alone knew he was making a moot plea. As he played to the sympathies of Richmond’s media, Henrico police and the viewing public, Wheless, a gambling addict, was playing the only game at which he excelled: deception. 
<p>Early in the evening on March 14, 1994, Wheless — known as Clay to family and friends — says that in a moment’s rage he struck his wife of 33 years once in the head with a hammer. Later that night, he dumped her body in the James River, where it presumably remains. That is, if Wheless — even in confession — is telling the truth. 
<p>It’s hard to know.
<p>“He’s a consummate liar,” says Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Toby Vick. “I don’t believe a word that comes out of his mouth.”

<hr size=1 width=10%>
<p>“It was a good marriage,” Wheless, 61, says from behind thick glass in the visiting room at Henrico County Regional Jail. “That may sound like a strange thing to say after what’s happened.” He is serving the first part of the eight-year sentence he received in the plea agreement for second degree murder. Since the murder occurred in 1994, before the abolition of parole in 1995, the old rules apply: With good behavior, Wheless will serve roughly half his sentence. 
<p>“What happened” between Clay and Jean Wheless is not bound by a mere moment’s rage. It’s a story that spans years of calculated deception. Wheless was a gambling addict whose failures at the craps tables in Atlantic City were prolonged by his talents as a liar at home. He kept his wife in the dark for years about their growing debt and declining financial security with a pattern of lies so intricate that were it blown glass or fine lace would be a thing of beauty. In March of 1994, he spun his greatest lie — he killed his wife and told the world she was missing.

<hr size=1>
By most accounts, there is nothing to indicate that Clay Wheless would have killed his wife. Police investigators found no evidence of domestic abuse. According to a defense investigator, neighbors described seeing the Whelesses walking hand-in-hand in their West End neighborhood just days before the murder. Jean Wheless’ sister Mary Kay Halterman says she had always liked Clay. Though she found him to be somewhat “boastful” and materialistic (“It was obvious material things meant a lot to him.”) she says she always liked him and had good times together with Jean and Clay. “He was Jean’s husband, so I loved him too,” she says. 
<p>Halterman says her sister kept her marriage problems to herself. Only a passing remark Jean Wheless made to her sister some years ago still haunts Halterman: “You don’t know,” Jean told her older sister. “Clay has an awful temper.”
<p>Henry Clay Wheless was born in Rocky Mount, N.C., and moved with his parents and four brothers and sisters to Richmond when he was in the fifth grade. He attended Binford Junior High and one year of Thomas Jefferson High School while his family lived in the Byrd Park area. He graduated from Manchester High School and then attended the College of William and Mary for two years before dropping out because of a lack of funds. He finished his accounting degree at the University of Richmond.
<p>Jean Spencer grew up in the idyllic rural setting of her family’s cattle farm three miles from the town of Renick, W.Va. The youngest of seven, she was the “love of the family,” says sister Halterman. 
<p>At Renick High School, Jean participated in basketball, softball and was involved in 4-H. She took piano lessons and often entertained the family with her angelic singing voice. She and Mary Kay would sing duets. “You Are My Sunshine” was a favorite, and Jean always sang the harmony. Even from childhood, the difficult, complementary strains came naturally to her.
<p>Jean attended Berea College in Kentucky and earned a degree in public school music education. After college, in the late 1950s, she moved to Richmond and lived with Mary Kay and her husband for a while, teaching in Chesterfield County schools. In 1961, she went on a blind double date with Clay Wheless. He was home on leave from Germany where he served in the Air Force doing intelligence work, he says, interpreting Romanian broadcasts, work he says was “classified top secret at the time.” Six months later, the two married in Switzerland and then lived in Germany for two years.
<p>After returning to Richmond and working in the insurance industry for several years, Wheless landed a job with Ethyl Corp. in 1967 as an insurance analyst. Between 1976 and 1980 he and Jean and daughter Karen lived in Greece where Wheless was financial director of the chemical giant’s Greek operation. He remained with Ethyl until his early retirement at age 57 in 1992 when he was manager of corporate financial reporting, making a reported annual salary of $176,000. 
<p>Mary Kay Halterman’s recollections of her sister are reflective and detailed, while Clay Wheless ticks off information like a human resume, with no embellishment: “She was kind to people, she did things for people. She was not outgoing, she was quiet, I would say on the introvert side. She was talented musically, played the piano, taught piano, taught public school music, from a very large family ...”
<p>Wheless provides more detail about himself. In the first few minutes of the jail house interview, while testing the tape recorder, he twice declares, “I have a rather distinctive voice.” Also in the opening moments of the interview: “I’ve done some acting.”

<hr size=1>
An Atlantic City casino is the kind of place a reserved woman like Jean Wheless would most likely hate. No windows to view the ocean and sky. No clocks to remind a practical person it’s time to go. It is a bombardment of the senses: the bongs and bells of the slot machines over the quiet clicking of chips being stacked; the tickticktick of the spinning money wheel; looping lights above the progressive slot machines; the smell of stagnant smoke; the feel of felt under the fingertips. It is enough to seduce anyone who possesses even the tiniest glimmer of greed or penchant for risk.
<p>Yes, there are those who set a limit and stop playing when the last coin drops solidly into the belly of the slot machine without a regurgitated payoff. But casinos live off the Clay Whelesses, who stick to the table or seat of their favorite game for hours, for days, and rack up points for complimentary hotel perks — room accommodations, meals, drinks, limousines. The rated gambler.
<p>Wheless’ transformation to gambler began with the extravagant lifestyle he says he and Jean enjoyed while living in Greece. Having become accustomed to all the finest things, Wheless says it was hard to return to a more prudent lifestyle in Richmond. “I was spending more money than I should have been, and I had such good credit and a good job making good money that I was able to get more and more credit. Everybody wanted to give me some, and I was silly enough to take it, unfortunately.” 
<p>To cover his increasing debt, Wheless began playing the commodities market, his first dabble into gambling. “I managed to lose a lot of money, a couple hundred thousand between the commodities and the [casino] gambling,” he says. 
<p>The lower he slid into the slippery pit of debt, the more secretive and duplicitous he became in hiding it from Jean and the rest of his family. He took Ethyl’s early retirement package in May of 1992, he says, in hopes that the lump sum of $374,000 would help him gain a foothold. Halterman says her sister was not part of the decision, that Jean didn’t understand why Clay was giving up his considerable salary. 
<p>The time away from work freed Wheless for jaunts to Atlantic City in the middle of the week. He told Jean he was doing consulting work and began keeping phony records on legal pads detailing the companies he worked for, the hours he put in, the travel costs and the amount of money he earned. After Wheless began “consulting,” Halterman remembers saying to her sister, “It sounds like Clay is doing well.” Duped but perhaps not completely confident, Jean replied, “Well, he’s paying our bills.” 
<p>He set up a leased storage space like an office to doctor bank statements before Jean could see them. He was having his statements sent to a  post office box without Jean’s knowledge. At the storage shed, he would do a cut and paste job on the statements. Within minutes, balances ballooned by tens of thousands. Jean Wheless had no idea by looking at the phony statements that her financial security was being thrown away with a roll of the dice.

<hr size=1>
By March 1994, Clay Wheless was in debt for roughly $400,000. His trips to Harrah’s hotel and casino in Atlantic City were becoming more frequent. He visited Harrah’s 22 separate times in 1993 and lost $23,000. In the first two and a half months of 1994, he visited eight times.
<p>As a rated gambler, he used a bank-machine-type card issued by the casino every time he sat down at a table or a slot machine to record his playing time to earn hotel perks. Harrah’s extended Wheless a $4,000 credit limit. Casino records of Wheless’ personal information from as far back as 1989 included the remarks “No mail to home ever.” In the space marked spouse it said, “No.”
<p>He was a big tipper. He’d often flip a waitress a green chip, $25, for a cup of coffee.
<p>He took one of his business trips March 8 to 11, the week before Jean’s murder. On Friday, March 11, according to Henrico Police, Jean Wheless received a phone call from Signet Bank to discuss an overdrawn account. Jean was incredulous. She’d seen the statements. During the conversation, Jean also learned of the post office box. When Wheless returned from Atlantic City that day, she apparently confronted him. That is all that can be pieced together for certain from the police investigation about the events that led to Jean Wheless’ death. The rest is the word of Clay Wheless:
<p>“Basically, a two-day argument ensued over that — not an argument, I hate to use that. It started out as a discussion about what had actually happened and her being very upset that it had happened, and one thing led to another, and it was still going on Monday. 
<p>“Actually, I had told her during the weekend that a lot of this was a mistake, that the bank told her wrong. I was trying to put things off as much as possible, and we were going to go down Monday and talk to the bank to get it straight. Of course, Monday came and I knew we couldn’t get it straight because the bank was correct. And things escalated and the first violent argument we ever had in 34 years was that Monday.”
<p>Wheless says the murder occurred in the early evening, around 5 or 6 p.m. in the family room of their Pump Road house. The couple was watching TV, he says, while the discussion of their finances escalated.
<p>Wheless began to reveal that the overdrawn account was the tip of the iceberg, that their retirement account of more than $200,000 was wiped out. “How could you do this? How could you destroy the rest of our lives,” Wheless says Jean said to him. “How could you destroy everything we had set aside, all the plans we made?”
<p>At some point during the heated argument, Wheless grabbed a hammer lying on the kitchen table, next to the family room door. He says it was there because over the weekend he and Jean had been rehanging pictures. He also says he’s not sure who grabbed the hammer first, an account he has never given the police.
<p>“I don’t want this to appear in any way that this was Jean’s fault, because it wasn’t. The weapon was grabbed, and in trying to take it away and so forth, I delivered a blow, and then Jean fell and hit the back of her head on the brick hearth. I have no idea which of those blows was lethal, but it doesn’t matter, it was my fault anyway.” 
<p>Wheless says he wrapped his wife’s body in a large plastic sheet and waited. He sat staring at the wall, contemplating whether to call the police. He worried about what it would do to their daughter — now in graduate school out of state — to learn that he had delivered the blow that killed her mother. Sometime around midnight, he made his decision. 
<p>He put Jean’s body into the trunk of her blue Volvo sedan and drove west through the rural countryside and star-blanketed vistas on Route 6 almost to Charlottesville. He turned back at some point, he says, “looking for a suitable place,” and at Columbia he turned onto the bridge that crosses the James and pulled into the public boat ramp. He backed the car down the ramp and retrieved Jean’s body from the trunk. Wheless wept as he waded into the James, submerged his wife’s body and gave her over to the river. Her body has never been found.
<p>The next morning, March 15, Wheless laid out a bottle of bourbon and left his house with the deadbolt unlocked. He drove his BMW north on Interstate 95. Wheless says about halfway across the Tydings Memorial Bridge, about 20 miles south of the Delaware line, he stopped on the busy, shoulderless bridge and threw the hammer and his wife’s weighted purse over the rail.
<p>He continued north to New Jersey and checked into Harrah’s hotel and casino.

<p><font size=4 color=#669900 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Custom Coupons</b></font>
<br>Buying Christmas presents can be draining — emotionally as well as financially. During my years as a starving student Christmas was particularly stressful. I wanted to give my family personal gifts but the only way I could think of to manage this was to take out a loan or to don a cat burglar outfit and five-finger the gifts — needless to say neither of these was a desirable option. My mother, understanding my predicament, came up with the idea of a coupon book. She asked me to give her the gift of my time for various different things. I leapt at the idea and began work on my first coupon book. 
<p>That first year, I went a little crazy with it. I gave her coupons for house cleaning, babysitting (I have a younger sister who at the time was 5), foot massages and anything else I could think of.
<p>My mother was absolutely thrilled with the result — and at the time, so was I. Unfortunately, there was a hard lesson to be learned. Basically I had promised to become an indentured servant until these coupons were used up. I sucked it up, but the following year I was a little wiser. Instead of promising everything under the sun, I carefully thought about what would mean a lot to her as well as how much time I could really dedicate. The second year was perfect.
<p>Here’s one word of caution — the gift is only meaningful if you are able to follow through on everything you have promised. In other words, although it is the thought that counts, in this case you must be willing to follow the thought with action — so giver beware!

<font size=7 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>Sympathy for the devil</b></font>
<font size=4 color=#000000 face="Gothic 13, Helvetica, Arial"><br>If you’re the last person in your family to meet interventionist Bill Maher, you’re the addict and they’re trying to save your life.</font>
<font size=4 color=#000000 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><p><i>by John W. Maloney</i></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=7 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>I</b></font>t was June 10, 1994 and he was decidedly hung over. The night before, he had run up a tab he couldn’t cover at Buddy’s until a friend spotted him the cash to escape. Looking rough and feeling bloated, bad even for a Saturday morning, he accepted a ride with a family friend to what was supposed to be a job interview with an influential lawyer.
<p>At least he remembered that he had to go somewhere.
<p>These were strange days for him. Twice through treatment and twice fallen from the wagon, he knew the dean was revoking his law school diploma for unfinished classwork. He hadn’t started studying for the bar exam. He was neither a student nor a lawyer, just an alcoholic and his family knew he was drinking even more than before.
<p>Having never spent a day in his life in a public school, he was an accomplished son of affluent parents. Friends said he was brilliant and self-destructive in the same breath. He dated rich girls who partied hard and if a legal career emerged, then he would have fooled ’em all.
<p>Status, women, and alcoholism, to boot.
<p>But he was essentially trapped most days in his West End rental in mid-1994, paralyzed by debt, swimming in guilt.
<p>Every day, a new sack of empty beer bottles accumulated next to the dirty armchair where he was supposed to be studying. He never counted the bottles, but they made for a heavy bag.
<p>If he went out to drink, he typically closed the place.
<p>A job prospect at this stage — though it was inexplicable that anyone would really want to hire him — was worth showing up for. The interview, however, was a ruse. Stepping through the doorway at 2405 W. Main Street, he encountered his parents, grandparents, an uncle, an aunt, a brother, and two sisters inside, as well a stranger named Bill Maher who knew him better than he could ever imagine. Here in this nondescript little building without a sign, his life would change, perhaps forever.
<p>This was an intervention. The family had had enough. He took a seat.
<p>“I’m thinking ‘I’ll never stop drinking. They’re so full of shit,’” he recalls. The meeting began. Carefully tendered family testimonials unfolded around him. His father cried.
<p>As each person took a turn telling him how his disease had affected them, “the biggest heartache of my life” set in. “I felt like I had gotten out of the shower and was sitting there naked in the chair.”
<p>By the end of a “seamless” intervention, he agreed to try therapy again. He’s going on three years of sobriety, and stays active in the recovery community in the West End.
<p>Bill Maher, he says, is masterful at staging interventions — both for what happens and what doesn’t happen. Sitting to the side, sometimes he doesn’t say a word during the actual intervention because the family is prepared and the “identified patient” is willing to go along.
<p>Maher’s business is saving people from their addictions — one hairy family crisis at a time. He estimates that he has conducted more than 400 interventions.

<p><font size=6 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>T</b></font>he Family Intervention Center of Virginia Inc. is a simple one-room office on West Main Street, with high-backed leather chairs, an erasable drawing board on the wall and a desk where Maher piles case folders around a computer and a cordless phone. 
<p>He does his work on his feet, talking and listening.
<p>The phone rings. It’s a distraught mother whose thirtysomething son is drinking himself to death out west. He’s undergone detoxification twice. She still sends him money.
<p>“You’re not going to like this, but you might as well fly out, go to the liquor store, buy what he drinks, go to his place, take out a glass and put in some ice and pour him a drink,” Maher says into the phone, his words laced with authority, albeit the understanding, sympathetic variety.
<p>Maher is silent as the conversation pauses for the mother to cry.
<p>After listening for a few more minutes, and explaining the bare basics of the intervention process, Maher says she’s going to have to hire him to go any further. The cost is flexible, ranging as high as $3,000 plus expenses. For out-of-town clients, it’s a three- or four-day process. For Richmonders, the process can span a month, with six or more sessions, at $100 an hour. Most treatment facilities, where interventions always lead, typically charge at least $15,000 for 28 days, but often more than $20,000, but there are exceptions.
<p>The mother on the phone will probably hire him the next time she calls, Maher says, clicking off the phone. Her son is dying and she has to save him.


<p><font size=6 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>A</b></font>t 44, Maher’s eyes look tired but he explains his purpose with determination. He’s relaxed in jeans, a sweater and running shoes. His war stories as an alcoholic come out in small pieces, fragments of a harrowing picture he infers is best described in summary, not detail. He isn’t the type to impress listeners with his dramatic exploits, but he shares enough for people to know he was in the gutter once. The man some of Richmond’s highest-standing families are baring everything to was someone altogether different 15 years ago.
<p>He hustled people. He had a gun pointed against his head. He stole what he couldn’t buy.
<p>Why he didn’t die along the way is a mystery. He claims divine providence. Raised in an upper middle class Ohio family, he was scarfing his old man’s Valium as a kid, drinking a six-pack a night at 17. Most of his 20s are a blur, he says. In a combat battalion of the U.S. Marines, he had access to prescriptive drugs and used all he wanted. In 1983, after some seven years back in the civilian ranks, he was sucking down a fifth of liquor, a case of beer and “all the drugs I could get my hands on” in a given day, he says.
<p>Week-long binges, holed up in cheap hotels with four or five half-gallons, were normal. Maher says that at his worst he was transporting his belongings in a kettle grill on the streets of Upper Marlboro, Md. 
<p>“I literally was on my knees puking and drinking Smirnoff 160 [proof] at a commode at the same time,” he says. (If images of Nicholas Cage in “Leaving Las Vegas” come to mind, you’re not far off, Maher adds.)
<p>“What happened to me was the booze turned on me — my liver stopped functioning,” and unfiltered alcohol flooded his bloodstream in all of its toxic mayhem. For the first time in his life, Maher was a fall-down drunk. From there, the only direction was up. He started to pray.
<p>“I’m alive and the only things I know a lot about are death and alcoholism,” he says, having shared all he is going to tell about himself.
<p>In a cruel curriculum spanning decades of drink and drugs, Maher’s descent into addiction hell gave him the tools to help others halt their way down.
<p>He lives in a world of absolutes: Alcoholism is a disease. It is progressive and fatal. Family and friends can help a patient recover — but they have to change their outlook. 


<p><font size=6 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>I</b></font>n the summer of 1994 she was 45, a mother of one, relatively friendless and drinking approximately a liter of wine a day after work and on weekends. It took about that much wine to guarantee that when her head hit the pillow at night, she would fall deep into sleep and escape what haunted her.
<p>“I couldn’t stand to be near my husband,” she says over coffee at the Starbucks in Willow Lawn. She’s now something of a new-age spiritualist; life for her now is an extended renaissance. She has a dinner group with other women like her, the sort of gathering where they never discuss tethering themselves to more thoughtless men.
<p>Disarmingly comfortable in describing her own trials and tribulations, she typifies the Type-A recovery advocate — celebrating her own recovery, and eager to share the 12-step message to anybody who wants to hear it.
<p>There are meetings every night, in every part of town. The little booklet in her handbag lists every one.
<p>As an 18-year-old in Boston, she was raped at gunpoint, an experience she has accepted as the random woman on the other side of the random door her random rapist happened to knock on.
<p>At peak consumption, she says, she was buying wine by the jug at Price Club each week. Tipped off by her husband, her psychiatrist raised the issue of drinking to her in 1994. She was becoming like her mother, an alcoholic. Determined that she could defy the charge, she took just five drinks in five weeks.
<p>Angry and furious, she says she became a “dry drunk,” someone whose addiction is temporarily starved. Mobilized by denial, she felt she had taken charge of this newly exposed vulnerability.
<p>“I knew I had a problem when we planned a party for our child at Chuck E. Cheese’s and I started looking forward to it because I knew I could have wine with dinner” and no one would question her, she says.
<p>Her last drink was July 3, 1994: a vodka tonic. On July 6, she met Bill Maher in the usual way — by complete surprise.
<p>Summoned to a late afternoon meeting at her job to discuss a business matter, she entered the intervention completely unaware. When she saw her parents, she says she first thought this was some kind of surprise award ceremony. They were supposed to be in California. In the presence of her husband, sister, parents and her work supervisor, she accepted Maher’s offer to sit down. He was the calming influence in the middle of the emotional storm.
<p>One by one, each person read prepared statements about her drinking problem. “I was very, very angry,” she says. “I hadn’t been drinking for weeks,” but they continued “bringing the charges.”
<p>She knew she had to go to treatment. She also vowed to divorce her husband when she came back. (She did.) Life would have to start over without him.
<p>“Bill was brilliant. Work was the one place I felt safe — they pulled that mat right out from under me,” she says.
<p>On the arm of her alcoholic sister who was already in recovery, she exited the building through the back. Her bags were packed. Last year at her 30th high school reunion at a prestigious northern boarding school, she was voted “most changed.”
<p>“There is a love in me that I didn’t know could exist,” she says. “We talk a lot about surrender. I had to open up.
<p>“I never realized how sick I was until I started getting well.”

<p>Maher drags a red marker from the top left corner of his office drawing board to the bottom right corner. This is the first leg of the alcoholic’s three-legged journey, he says. When the significant people in the alcoholic’s life arrive at Maher’s office — the intervention team — he immediately focuses their attention on the disease and not the person; they will be ganging up on the alcoholism or the substance addiction, not their friend.
<p>They have to believe, he implores, that the crisis isn’t some behavioral flaw, that no mythical amount of will power will thwart the urge to drink, smoke, snort of shoot up.
<p>“Alcoholism is the only disease that tells you that you don’t have a disease,” Maher says, repeating some of the buzz-phrases that capture his clients’ attention. The downward progression can take months, years or decades, and it is fatal. “There are doctors, dentists and lawyers out there with idiot IQ’s,” from alcohol-related memory deficits. And the “psychological maneuvers” an alcoholic can exhibit in supporting his denial can be mystifying. “We are masters at compartmentalizing our lives,” Maher says. Fittingly, by bringing together the people who occupy the vital compartments of an alcoholic’s life — spouses, siblings, parents, employers, ministers, friends — the intervention creates a “bottom” from which the person can recover.
<p>Maher’s professorial lecture unfolds with “The Three Stages of Alcoholism.” In most cases, the “identified patient” is well into or beyond the middle stage. In a tireless recitation from a pad of notes, Maher launches into his stand-up gig. 
<p>Stage one begins with denial and sincere delusion. Then there’s preoccupation with booze or drugs, and increased tolerance from chasing the high; guilt moves in quickly as the person realizes he needs five or six beers when everyone else has two.
<p>Maher’s writing moves downward along the line.
<p>The “identified patient” uses more than he intended, then conceals or lies to hide his guilt; switches to pot, or wine or substitutes something else. Other interests, such as hobbies or clubs, fall off and he settles for less in his life, from relationships to work.
<p>Bizarre things are happening now at the start of the second stage. Maher is quickly filling his second board now and typically, the intervention team is beginning to see where the identified patient is going. Their experiences with that person are showing up on the line, too.
<p>There are DUIs, money problems, blackouts or grayouts that can last weeks at a time. Conceptual reasoning begins to fall off and promises to quit fail. The alcoholic discovers the value of the morning drink to take the edge off the night before. He makes long, rambling calls, or “telephonitis,” as Maher calls it. Family and friends are avoided as he drinks with inferiors — people he wouldn’t normally associate with.
<p>He neglects nutrition, looks sluggish. Paranoia becomes apparent. Self-pity becomes extravagant. Anything is a reason to drink now. Shame is emerging and he knows that he is an alcoholic.
<p>The diagonal line for the third phase begins with sleep disorders. Suicide crosses his mind. Anxiety disorders prompt twitching, cramping and other gastrointestinal disorders. The body takes protein from muscle tissues to offset nutritional deprivation. Tremors start. There are sexual impairments. The heart is weakened and the immune system grows depressed. Fear, guilt and helplessness are masked by aggressiveness. Then, written at the bottom corner of the drawing board: “death.”
<p>After three full boards about alcoholism, the intervention team’s arrival at death somehow comes suddenly, despite several hours of discussion. 
<p>People who have followed Maher’s “stages” lecture say it changes the way they look at alcoholics forever. The educational process is draining. Hours pass without ever taking an eye off that drawing board. Some team members will complain.
<p>Ideally, in local cases Maher will meet with the intervention team four times before the actual intervention. Participants are asked to abstain from drinking and drug use during these weeks and several hours are reserved before the event for rehearsal.
<p>In the end, the “identified person” is asked to go to treatment. If he refuses, the team insists; and if he still refuses, they are prepared to tell him the consequences of continued addiction. A wife might predict divorce; a boss foresees termination; a doctor expects serious health problems; children threaten to leave.

<p><font size=6 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>A</b></font>sked to meet with the family of a friend on drugs earlier this year, he arrived at Maher’s office with a simple question: How could this interventionist know what’s right for somebody he’s never met?
<p>Maher says the friend was a standard intervention skeptic, perhaps a little more adamant than some.
<p>“We all wanted him to get help,” but not through some kind of trendy experiment, he says. “I said, ‘I ain’t buying the fact that you can stand at that blackboard and diagnose my friend.’”
<p>Sensing the tension in the first meeting, he thought: Is this process going to get the family at each other’s throats?
<p>Opposed to going any further, he sought advice from a psychiatrist, who said doctors diagnose patients all the time from the information on a chart. As the family rehearsed, he played the role of the identified patient, channeling his own feelings into being the encircled individual, he challenged the others, preparing them for the worst.
<p>“It became a very loving, caring process and I sensed relief for the guy in the middle,” he says. 

<p><font size=6 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>W</b></font>hen an alcoholic’s “compartments” are brought together in the same room, and Maher has brought together as many as 15 people in a patient’s life into his office for a team intervention, “the iceberg syndrome” occurs, he says. Skeletons fall out the closets. The group shares experiences, most sad, some just ugly, others horrible, even despicable.
<p>Maher has heard ’em all.
<p>The West End man who leaves his three small children in his Suburban idling outside of a crack house, where an equally addicted friend notices it — and tells the team. 
<p>A husband announces to his stunned wife that they are driving into a rough area so he can score some cocaine, which she didn’t even know he was using. When she walked into Maher’s office, her face was badly bruised from the beating she and her man received when a gang pulled them both out of the car — and she tells the team.
<p>A wife reveals her agony at being sodomized by her husband — always when he’s on cocaine — and she tells the team.
<p>Often, Maher says, people in the intervention team have played some role in the addicted person’s plummet, enabling them. Pooling those experiences can take courage on the part of the team.
<p>A brother did cocaine with the addict. A friend shared a hooker with him.
<p>The pre-intervention sessions can be chaotic events unless the interventionist sticks to the common objective of getting the person to treatment. Maher says bluntly that his sessions never get out of control.
<p>“This can be the most intimate moment a family has ever had,” Maher says.

<p><font size=6 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>T</b></font>he new model for interventions is very different from the kidnappings that highlighted the original technique. The intervention team isn’t there to dump on the patient, Maher says. 
<p>When an intervention team begins to assemble, Maher selects one member each week to call the patient and explain why he or she is meeting with a specialist on alcohol or drug addiction, shifting the issue to the team. Carefully coached, the team members individually inform the patient that the addiction is hurting them as friends, family or employers, and that they want to address the problem.
<p>After a few weeks, the team is prepared for the intervention and the patient knows the most important people in his life are meeting together about him. Each has told him they are willing to confront the disease. Finally, he is invited to an intervention — not duped into coming like the old method prescribed.
<p>The best aspect of the new model, Maher says, is that the patient usually doesn’t arrive at the expensive treatment facility angry at having been ambushed. The new way sends people to therapy in a mindset to try to get well the day they arrive.
<p>Maher says he’s had patients barge into his office before an intervention, sit down, tell him who they are and demand that he stop interfering with their families. In the most polite way possible, Maher says he doesn’t work for the patient, he works for the people around him. The alcoholic can’t fire him. Usually, the fee has been paid.
<p>In executive interventions, Maher works for the addicted person’s company. The fee is $5,000; many companies are more than willing to pay that much to get valuable personnel into treatment. In an abbreviated process, Maher explains to the employer what the employee is probably going through, including the “Three Stages of Alcoholism” lecture. He also strategizes the workplace confrontation — it’s always at the workplace — always with the CEO. A letter, with documented proof of the addiction’s impact on the workplace, is prepared. The letter offers a choice: treatment at the company’s expense (a car is always waiting) or instant termination. Maher is there to counsel the addict if he chooses treatment. Maher can only remember one case when treatment was refused. 

<p><font size=6 color=#333333 face="NuevaMM, Courier"><b>A</b></font> long afternoon interview completed, he says he’s trying to find a secretary. He’s handling as many as three interventions at a time, usually a few of them out of town in a given month. So far, his clients have been limited to the people who can afford his services. As a nonprofit corporation, he wants the Family Intervention Center of Virginia to broaden its client base with grant money and scholarships to help less-affluent patients get into treatment centers. He recently received a $20,000 “challenge” grant and seeks to raise the matching funds. Still, this type of intensive counseling is expensive and time-consuming.
<p>And there is no off-season, especially as interventions catch on here.
<p>As families come and go from his office, he sees bottomed-out patients off to treatment; then he usually sees them again after that, at a mall, at the movies, or just around town. And usually, he says, the patients look well — and that, Maher says, is a humbling, sometimes emotional reward.

<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i>by Carolyn McCulley</i></font>
<p><font size=6 color=#990000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>C</b></font>hristmas conjures up images of a warm, family holiday, full of “peace on earth and goodwill to men,” a holiday jump-started by the feasting at Thanksgiving a month earlier. As shocking as it is to those bred on the romantic nostalgia of a Victorian-tinged holiday, however, Christmas has a history of controversy and Thanksgiving was once sneered at as a Puritan relic. The Christmas of author Clement Moore — wrapped around the jolly image of St. Nick and aglow in the warm wash of “tradition” — only came about at the close of the 19th century.  Christmas wasn’t even a federal holiday until 1870, declared seven years after President Lincoln’s proclamation of a national Thanksgiving holiday.
<p>Long before the Christmas season became a two-month celebration of commercialism, there was great debate about the prominence and importance of these two holidays on the national calendar, their roles in the American culture, and their regional roots.
<p>Virginia is proud of its many historical firsts, among which it can claim the first American Christmas. There was little fun, however, that bleak Christmas Day on 1607 in Jamestown. It was marked only by a sermon in their little wooden church and heartfelt prayers for provision by the 40 remaining settlers. The following year was better. Captain John Smith and the settlers at Jamestown celebrated the holiday             enduring “six or seven dayes off the extreame wince, rayne, frost and snow.” Smith noted they “were never more merry, nor fed on more plentie of good Oysters, Fish, Flesh, Wild-foule, and good bread; nor never had better fires in England.” 
<p>Only a few years later, their counterparts to the north, the Mayflower Pilgrims, landed at Plymouth in December 1620, determined to banish Christmas from the public calendar. Within a year, they had instead set aside a day for giving thanks to the Lord for all their blessings and celebrated it sporadically throughout the following decades. But they  pointedly ignored Christmas. Puritan leader Cotton Mather condemned the “long eating, hard drinking, lewd gaming, rude revelling” that accompanied the Christmas holiday, noting that such actions “have more of hell than heaven” in them. By 1659, the General Court of Massachusetts enacted a law to punish citizens “found observing, by forbearing from labor, feasting, or any other way, any days such as Christmas [Day],” under penalty of fine, imprisonment or whipping.
<p>For the following two centuries, Virginians celebrated the holiday with increasing heartiness, while those to the north, influenced by Puritans, either ignored or censured Christmas, calling it a celebration of pagan revelry. Other religious sects such as Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, Congregationalists, Mennonites, Amish and Brethren, tended to agree. On the other side, the Anglican (Episcopal), Dutch Reformed, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic churches all held to the tradition of Christmas. Thus, Virginia, settled mostly by Anglicans, made merry on Dec. 25.
<p>Christmas for Colonial Virginians had more of an emphasis on partying than gift-giving. Few colonists, north or south, initially celebrated with presents. Instead, the holiday ushered in a time of extended leisure for the entire household, including slaves. As long as the Yule log burned — and the slaves ensured its longevity by cutting it slightly green and soaking it in water — most everyone enjoyed a relaxed holiday for the full 12 days of Christmas. During this time, slaves went from one plantation to the next, feasting and socializing. This kind of celebration, though, cheated the slave, wrote Frederick Douglass, with a “dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labeled with the name of liberty. ...When the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field — feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.”
<p>Such concerns never dampened a good party, though. A correspondent for London Magazine reported in 1746 that “all over the Colony, a universal hospitality reigns, with full tables and open doors ...” And gunfire. Eighteenth-century Virginia gentlemen liked to take their muskets with them when paying a social visit and joined the host in firing away a noisy tribute called “crackers” to the holiday.  (Firecrackers were also popular — so popular that by 1830, Richmond’s Common Hall passed an ordinance forbidding “any person to set off any rocket, cracker, torpedo, squib or other fireworks in the city under penalty of $6.66 for each offense, if free; 20 lashes for a slave.” But the custom of fireworks remained entrenched. Nearly 100 years later, in 1926, the 5-year-old son of Virginia Governor Trinkle held a lighted sparkler too close to the withering Christmas tree in the ballroom of the governor’s mansion, and the tree exploded in flames. The
fire spread quickly and destroyed parts of the house, primarily the new sections added in 1906 and 1914.)
<p>Eventually in the Piedmont and Tidewater areas of Virginia, it became customary for servants to surprise their masters with a cry of “Christmas gift” or “Christmas box,” upon which the patron had to produce a small gift or token. A custom imported from England, it was meant to provide for the poor or dependent in society; for that reason, upper-class families rarely gave gifts among themselves. By the mid-1840s, middle-class American Protestants, seeing success as God’s reward for virtue, made Christmas gift giving an exercise in religious training, and the custom began to take off in the cities.
<p>Although the earliest documented reference to an American Christmas tree was in Lancaster, Penn., the first Christmas tree in Virginia was introduced in 1842 by Charles Minnigerode, a German classics professor at the College of William and Mary. He took a tree to the home of his friend Judge Nathaniel Beverly Tucker.
<p>According to The Valentine museum, Richmond did not see its first tree until four years later. In an 1883 edition of the Magazine of American History, the writer recalls those early Christmas trees of his childhood:
<p>“It resembled, it is true, the every-day cedars or pines growing in the neighboring woods, but its boughs were laden with finer ornaments than the blue berries of the real bushes. There were candy cornucopias, birds of the brightest plumage, golden fish, variegated eggs, filigree baskets full of bonbons, books, presents of description, and silver crosses, and at the summit, the star of Bethlehem. The whole shone in the light of myriads of tapers nestling in the evergreen boughs; and to put out the lamps and illuminate these, after the late Christmas dinner, was the supreme delight of all who witnessed the ceremony.”
<p>During the Civil War era and immediately thereafter, Americans seemed ripe for a national holiday or some symbol of national culture that unified the country under the banner of hope. “It has often been a subject of remark by some ... that our country can boast of no festivious customs, or old merry making days,” wrote the United States Review in 1854.
<p>Given the strife-filled cultural climate of the time, the enthusiasm for the Independence Day holiday had withered: “We all dread the coming of the Fourth of July now,” wrote the editor of Harper’s Monthly the same year. The general consensus among pundits and professional scribes was that holidays stressed unity, and the nation was in sore need of a celebration.
<p>While Thanksgiving had been seen primarily as an institution of the Puritans and confined to New England, Christmas had been long celebrated by Anglicans and others in the South. Slowly, the cultures began to bleed across the regional borders and advocates for each holiday made themselves known in the public forum. Sarah Josepha Hale, the editor of Godey’s magazine and a New England native, had been a strong proponent of Thanksgiving since the late 1820s, calling it a time to “enjoy in national union [a] feast of gladness, rendering thanks to Almighty God for the blessings of the year.”
<p>By the 1850s, she had mounted a full-fledged campaign to the nation’s presidents and governors to adopt her concept of Thanksgiving; Virginia declared it a state holiday in 1855; and Lincoln proclaimed it a national day in 1863.
<p>Even as Hale was stumping for Thanksgiving, Christmas was slowly gaining acceptance in the North. As early as 1856, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow detected “a transition state about Christmas here in New England. ... The old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday, though every year makes it more so.” Even though Harper’s Weekly printed Thomas Nast renderings of Santa Claus with Union affections, Northern publications did acknowledge at the time that Christmas had never been fully observed in America, except in the South. Soon, fevered commentaries were being printed, denouncing the Puritan restrictions and celebrating new American traditions for Christmas.
<p>For a season, the two holidays seemed to be in competition, with Charles Francis Adams writing in 1857 that it seemed “superfluous to have them both.” Oddly enough, it was the sentiment that Christmas evoked during the Civil War that gained it the greater prominence. As George Templeton Strong wrote in 1862, “Christmas is a great institution, especially in time of trouble and disaster and impending ruin.” By 1860, 14 states, including Virginia, had made Christmas a legal holiday; the U. S. Congress declared it a federal holiday on June 26, 1870.

<font size=5 color=#003300 face="EngraversGothic BT, Helvetica, Arial"><b>The Birth of St. Nick</b></font>
</a>
<br>Santa Claus has his roots in the fourth century. Nicholas of Myra was born into a wealthy family in Patara, in what is now Turkey. He was elected bishop of Myra at age 30 and apparently gave most of his inheritance to the poor. All accounts of his life note that he regularly fasted (not feasted), a portrayal that is a far cry from the modern Santa, the rotund crown prince of shopping malls.
<p>He died on Dec. 6, 343 A.D., a date still celebrated in the Greek Orthodox church as his feast day. He is legendary for his good works, among his rescue of three girls headed for prostitution and slavery from families too poor to provide dowries. It is said he responded by dropping gold coins through a window at night, which fell into stockings that had been hung up to dry. Canonized a saint, Nicholas became associated with children, wishes and gift-giving. He was also the patron saint of sailors, who spread his fame along the European coast; along the way he became Father Christmas, Kriss Kringle, Pere Noel, Sinter Klaas and so on. (Eventually the Dutch celebrations of St. Nicholas influenced New Amsterdam, later New York, when early Americans rejected things British after independence and embraced the Christmas traditions of the area’s Dutch immigrants.)

<font size=5 color=#003300 face="EngraversGothic BT, Helvetica, Arial"><b>Tips on Live Trees</b></font>
</a>
<br>If you’re thinking of decking your halls with a live Christmas tree this holiday season, success depends on several factors. First, says Peggy Singlemann, manager of horticulture at Maymont, buy your live tree from a reputable nursery — from people who understand the importance of selling freshly dug trees. “The longer a tree sits in a lot, the more its viability is compromised,” says Singlemann. 
<p>Matthew Cross, nursery foreman at the Great Big Greenhouse & Nursery, stresses the importance of buying trees with a proven track record in our climate.  Typically, many firs and spruces like colder climates and don’t do well in our summer heat and humidity. There are a few exceptions, however, and often you’ll find Norway spruce and Colorado blue spruce sold as live Christmas trees in our area because they live here without much fuss, in addition to white pine, Austrian pine and Japanese black pine.
<br>And finally, to help your live tree along, treat it well, advises Stephanie Hicks, who, with her husband Tom, own Windy Knoll Farm, a tree farm in Mechanicsville. “Keep them inside only for a few days, a week at the most,” she says. To acclimate it to its new home, first bring it into a protected shed or garage for a few days before bringing it inside (and do the reverse on it’s way back outside). Also, pick it up around its root ball (not by the trunk) to prevent damage to the roots. Avoid placing your tree over a heat vent or against a radiator, and keep its root ball moist.

<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i><b>When the holiday hinges on a youngster’s express, written priorities</b></i></font>
<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i>by Elizabeth Cogar</i></font>
<p><font size=6 color=#990000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>T</b></font>hey’re making their lists and checking them twice. Make that thrice, or, more realistically, 20 or 30 times. Yes, my children have been making their Christmas lists since sometime last winter, possibly since Dec. 26, 1995.
<p>The whole Christmas list thing starts with a plea for a toy during the off-season — the Lego launch pad that didn’t show up under our tree last year or the Barbie car that failed to materialize at a February birthday party. The begging starts, and I suggest that they go ahead and start their Christmas lists. So what if it’s July. It’s never too early to plan ahead and the listmaking buys me some peace and quiet.
<p>The tricky part comes when I start doing the actual shopping. By mid-November the lists have been rewritten many times on every imaginable scrap of paper. They’ve been magneted to the fridge, crumpled up in bedside table drawers, lost in piles of papers and recovered over and over again. And, of course, they’ve been revised.
<p>My daughter’s list is basically a regurgitation of the Barbie aisle at Toys R Us and the pages of the Pleasant Company’s American Girl doll catalog. The list she made in August had the Barbie Dreamhouse, Barbie car and Barbie god-knows-what-else. The latest incarnation has a heavier emphasis on the absurdly overpriced American Girl dolls (Felicity, Addie, et al) and their million-dollar paraphernalia. She is under the mistaken impression that the dolls come with everything pictured on the page with them. Yessiree, it’s gonna be a blue Christmas without all that stuff on the page.
<p>My son’s list is more diverse — remote-control airplane (held over from last year’s list), Hot Wheels construction site, Lego space station and “monny.” The list has been updated in the last week to include “T.V. set.” (He must have been talking to one of his grandparents — nobody under the age of 60 calls it a TV set anymore).
<p>So, here’s my dilemma. Do I take these lists-in-progress and go ahead and snag one or two items before they all disappear forever from retail land and, in doing so, risk getting something that doesn’t make the final cut? Or do I wait dangerously close to the big day to see which request rises to the top as the most urgently desired and risk not being able to find it in the store?
<p>I care about this stuff because I want my children to be excited about unwrapping something truly wonderful. And for as long as I can get away with it, I want them to think Santa is listening. But as I’ve found over the years, when all paper is trashed, cards lost and ribbon eaten by our cats, the perfect present is not essential to a happy Christmas. 
<p>Last year, I waited too late and failed to obtain the Lego police station requested and had to settle for another, less fabulous Lego police station. I worried that this could ruin the day. Instead, my child said, “You know, Mom, it’s not exactly what I wanted but I really like it.” So much for those calls I made to Lego Worldwide, FAO Schwarz and Toys R Us stores nationwide. Kids’ lists may morph daily, but, ultimately, they’re not so hard to please. This year I resolve not to agonize.

<font size=5 color=#003300 face="EngraversGothic BT, Helvetica, Arial"><b>No Plums in Plum Pudding?</b></font>
</a>
<br>Every holiday season, consumers are inundated with a variety of gustatory treats. For more than 100 years, the women of Grace and Holy Trinity Church (and now, in keeping with modern times, the men as well) have used their secret recipe to provide Richmonders with one of these seasonal specialties: plum pudding, a traditional Christmas dessert with origins in English and early American kitchens. The dessert, which actually contains no plums (go figure), is a spicy bread, citron and raisin pudding and is usually served with one of many sauces, two of which are listed on the label of the church’s pudding.
<p>Cans of the plum pudding are sold for $8. Proceeds from the sales primarily benefit the Grace and Holy Trinity Child Care Center, located on Floyd Avenue.
<p>This year, 2,400 cans of the Dickensian dessert were made and will be sold around Richmond. According to Katty Franck of Grace and Holy Trinity, the desserts are in high demand and the church even receives orders from out-of-state.
<p>Ukrop’s carries the puddings, which is available at various other locations including the church itself. Shipping is available. For more information on locations or to order by mail, call 359-5628.

<p><font size=6 color=#990000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>S</b></font>o many movies, so little time. That can mean only one thing —  ’tis the holiday season. And Tinsel Town wants to cajole you into merrily keeping that spending frenzy going, tempting you into the theater with dozens of cinematic treats for all tastes.
<p>Oscar buffs beware, this season is stuffed with contenders, particularly of the distaff kind. In <b>“The Evening Star,”</b> the long-awaited sequel to “Terms of Endearment,” Shirley MacLaine recreates her Oscar-winning role of Aurora Greenway. Also a hot ticket this winter is Ralph Fiennes’ star turn in the big screen adaptation of Michael Ondaatje’s 1992 novel <b>“The English Patient.”</b> Another adaptation to watch for: Arthur Miller’s <b>“The Crucible,”</b> this time starring Winona Ryder, Daniel Day-Lewis and Joan Allen.
<p>Other Academy Award contenders include Rob Reiner’s look at the murder of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, <b>“Ghosts of Mississippi.”</b> Whoopi Goldberg stars as Evers’ tireless widow and Alec Baldwin as a crusading assistant DA. Meryl Streep streaks onto the screen this holiday season in a flashy melodramatic role in the play-to-screen <b>“Marvin’s Room”</b> with Diane Keaton. Then expect fireworks with Milos Forman directing and Oliver Stone producing the movie <b>“The People vs. Larry Flynt,”</b> with Woody Harrelson in the starring role. “The Piano’s” Jane Campion turns the screws on Henry Miller’s <b>“Portrait of a Lady”</b> starring Nicole Kidman while Kenneth Branagh returns to the Bard for his take on <b>“Hamlet.”</b> And then there’s Madonna’s long-anticipated star performance as the title character in Andrew Lloyd Weber’s <b>“Evita.”</b> 
<p>On the other end of the Oscar spectrum, here are some titles you probably won’t want to miss — though you might not want anyone to see you buying a ticket. Topping the list has to be <b>“Beavis and Butthead Do America.”</b> What more need I say? Then there’s Tim Burton’s spoof of those ’50s sci-fi B-movies, <b>“Mars Attacks!”</b> starring Jack Nicholson.
<p>Looking for a little romance to warm up the season? How about Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston in a Penny Marshall-directed remake of the holiday classic “The Bishop’s Wife?” This time out the title is <b>“The Preacher’s Wife.”</b> Or join George Clooney and Michelle Pfeiffer as single parents and complete opposites who discover their need for each other extends beyond co-op babysitting in <b>“One Fine Day.”</b> Another classic romance finds its way on screen, in <b>“Love and War”</b> with Chris O’Donnell as a young Ernest Hemingway and Sandra Bullock as the WWI nurse who treats his physical and emotional wounds.

<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i>by Susan Betts</i></font>
<p><font size=6 color=#990000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>I</b></font>t’s still a good idea to acknowledge the kindness of others during the holiday season. Almost everybody tips at some time, but what should you do during the holiday season? Is it a good idea to offer a little extra something to the trashman, the doorman, the hair cutter, the dog groomer, the newspaper boy?
<p>Sure, but there are some rules. Miss Manners — the quintessential source, as seen on TV — weighs in with her book, “Miss Manners’ guide for the Turn of the Millenium.”
<p>“Once a year, all sorts of unlikely people show up to play — with more or less grace — the otherwise defunct role of the old family retainer. From the person who delivers the newspaper out front to the gang who come around the back later to pick it up, a varied cast acts out this peculiarly old-fashioned drama. The idea is to suggest to its audience of one the role of generous patron of the working classes.”
<p>Miss Manners — who is actually writer Judith Martin —  is not opposed to Christmas bonuses, she says, but she realizes that there is a difference between tipping people who render a personal service like dog grooming and those who, say, pick up the trash. “The Christmas ‘tip’ from individual householders to service people whom they do not voluntarily employ is something different. Miss Manners is not unaware that such tipping often comes less from the overflow of bountiful Christmas feelings than from a hope of not finding the alley’s worth of garbage on one’s lawn.”
<p>“You must hand out a few nice round bills this time of year when your door is rattled (the average is $5 or $10 for ordinary services). Miss Manners prefers that the bills be in envelopes, inside cards with a few words of thanks, but knows that the recipients are often willing to overlook the absence of that nicety. The little bonus itself should be in cash. ... If there is a team of people involved, the amount is handed to one of them with the request, clearly within the hearing of the others, that it be divided.”
<p>Tips always grow when the economy is growing, and with the surge in stock prices over the past four years, there’s almost no excuse for not spreading the good cheer, especially if your bank account has had something to cheer about these past 12 months. So, if you’re particularly pleased with the work of your hair dresser, let’s say, why not hand her an extra $10 tucked inside a Christmas card the next time she snips your locks?
<p>If your doorman has held that door for you all year and thrown in a nice smile to boot, why not hand him a Christmas card with $15 tucked inside. You’ll feel better, and so will he. You can bet that your door service will be rock steady for the next 12 months. 
<p>Tipping isn’t all smooth sailing, Martin says.
<p>“Because tips are customary, one cannot be overcome with the sense of one’s own largess. One can withhold them if the function that was supposed to be performed all year wasn’t done.”
<p>“Miss Manners hopes this clears up the immediate problem or befogs it enough so that you will resolve to pretend that you didn’t hear the crashing of lids that announces the Christmas season. She is aware that it does nothing to solve the deeper cultural problem. That is that Americans have never been happy with the idea of having servants.” 
<p>By the way, kindness to strangers mustn’t extend to your mail carrier. Since carriers and clerks are federal employees, they are not allowed to accept any tips, no matter what the season. Bah, humbug!

<font size=4 color=#330000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><b>It doesn’t take a genius to figure out why people bond over a high score on an IQ test. 
<br>Or maybe it does.</b></font>
<font size=4 color=#330000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><p><i>by Dave McCormack</i></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#000066 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b><i>W</i></b></font><font color=#000066><i>ith potted plants, sliding glass doors and wall-to-wall carpet, this South Side apartment complex clubhouse seems a more appropriate setting for a Tupperware party than a brain trust. But a brain trust it is this Friday night, when the Richmond area Mensa club holds its monthly meeting.
<p>Mensa is officially known as the International High IQ Society. It was founded in England 50 years ago by two lawyers who had the bright idea to start a society for smart people. They envisioned a group that was nonpolitical and free from all racial and religious distinctions; an exceptional IQ would be the only membership qualification. Today, the Mensa Society maintains its neutral status, though individual members often have strong opinions about anything under the sun. 
<p>The term IQ stands for intelligence quotient. It is one way of measuring an individual’s intelligence against a cross-section of their peers. Getting together in the name of high IQ may seem a little odd, even pretentious. And the question arises: Why would anyone do such a thing?</font></i>
<center><hr size=1 width=20%></center>

<p><font size=5 color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>“S</b></font>ometimes it’s a burden to be bright,” Mensan Adele Klien, says, laughing. “I guess it’s a burden to be stupid, too, but if I had to choose my burden I guess I’d rather be bright.” 
<p>And it can be a burden, Mensans say, when you’re in the narrow wedge of society endowed with a super-high IQ. Those who soar in the intellectual stratosphere sometimes have a difficult time connecting with the rest of the world puttering along in a lower flight path. And it can be frustrating and painful to live in a society that at best ignores intellectual achievement and often ridicules it. (Who had the better social life in high school — captain of the football team or president of the math club?)  Like anyone else, Mensans want to be themselves with other people. For a genius, that’s often easiest around other geniuses. 
<p>There are many definitions of genius; traditionally a person with an IQ of 141 or higher has been considered a genius. Those who test such things consider anyone who scores in the 98th percentile or above on an intelligence test a genius. That top 2 percent also happens to be Mensa’s standard for membership. 
<p>Mensa member and newsletter editor Klien has been a Mensa member for 15 years. She learned about Mensa 35 years ago but had reservations about taking the entrance test. “I knew I was smart,” she says, “and I was interested in taking a Mensa test, but suppose I failed? I was happy thinking I was smart, and I didn’t want some test suddenly telling me I wasn’t.” 
<p>It wasn’t until she was 50 that a friend convinced her to take the test. “I’ve had a marvelous time ever since,” she says.
<p>Among her fellow Mensans, Klien, who looks more like a Mary Kay representative than a stereotypical genius, has found it much easier to be social. “I find I’m much more extroverted when I’m among Mensans,” she says, “because invariably I meet people I find to be a lot of fun. Some people are quiet, some are more talkative; regardless, we feel comfortable with each other.” 
<p>Klien recalls a conversation she had with a young man who attended a Mensa meeting while traveling through town. “For hours we talked about Napoleon’s exile on St. Helena,” she says. “If I live a thousand years I’ll probably never meet another person who’d be interested in talking about that again,” she says. 
<p>Under the blanket of the organization, Mensans who take particular interest in a specific topic — such as Napoleon’s final years — might form what they call a SIG, or Special Interest Group. There are countless SIGs throughout the country that gather in the name of anything from sci-fi to gardening to filmmaking. There is even a group called Sinistral SIG that admits only left-handed Mensa members. 
<p>Jerry Bryson, who since retiring from state government has been working on sci-fi space opera, found out about Mensa through a SIG that revolved around Esperanto, the invented international language that saw its heyday in the 70s and is still practiced by pockets of devotees. 
<p>Bryson’s passion for Esperanto eventually waned, but his interest in Mensa did not. “I find that there is quite a camaraderie among Mensans,” he says. “It’s like family.” The character of Mensa meetings differs from place to place depending on the number of active members and level of activity in the area. In big cities such as New York, some Mensa event takes place every night. Here in Richmond, they happen but once or twice a month. Primarily the members gather to share dinner, to hold meetings and to stage “game nights.” 
<p>One game is called “Past Lives.” The object of this non-competitive game is to travel through many lives, eventually being reincarnated as a famous historical figure. Mensans say this type of game sparks lively conversation and is a more intellectual experience than standard games.
<p>Occasionally they invite speakers to address the group about a common interest. The Richmond area Mensa — which comprises the areas of Fredericksburg, Williamsburg and Petersburg — has about 190 members.
<p>Mensa meetings are loosely organized around the principles instilled by the founding members. “Mensa” is the Latin word for table, and the idea was that Mensans would figuratively “sit around the table” hashing out important issues. Jerry Bryson finds the atmosphere of meetings engaging. “There’s no party line to tow,” he says. “You can have arguments that you might not be able to have at other venues. It’s expected that we’ll stay civil and yet say what we think.” 
<p>Klien adds: “If someone is speaking and uses a word that I don’t understand, I don’t feel threatened by it. I have no problem asking what the word means.” What she’s getting at is that by being there in the first place, everybody knows she’s no dummy. 
<center><hr size=1 width=20%></center>

<p><font size=5 color=#000000><b>I</b></font>ndeed, a Mensa meeting does at first appear to be an eclectic group.
<p>Two men with long hair and beards chat on one side of the room and look as though they may have arrived on Harleys. There is an elderly woman, carefully groomed sitting on a sofa speaking to the various individuals who come to share the sitting area.
<p>A young, pixielike woman sits in a corner reading a book. Although several people address her by name, she speaks to no one. Only when it is time for the speaker, does she mark her page and put her book down.
<p>Invited speaker Ken Wilson, Director of Astronomy and Electronic Outreach at the Science Museum of Virginia, begins his talk about life on Mars. According to several Mensans, the turnout at this meeting is better than most.
<p>One young woman, the wife of a Mensan and not a member herself, says she loves to come to the meetings because no matter what the topic of discussion, or the nature of the meeting, there is an intellectual intensity that she feels is missing from other social affairs. She also says that “Mensa is a way for people who may not feel connected in the more typical Richmond social circles to find a niche.”
<p>To some, the name Mensa carries with it a certain stereotype — the nerd who entertains himself by plunging into heated games of three-dimensional chess — hardly a typical social circle in Richmond.
<p>“I haven’t yet seen that one,” Bryson says. “You’ll hear slightly deeper jokes and play some mind games. But we usually play Scrabble and Pictionary just like everybody else. 
<p>It’s true that, initially, all we have in common is this number,” he says. “After that we’re just a cross section of the population.”
<p>Nine-year-old Matt Pinsker actually likes to play chess, but the young Pinsker is anything but a stereotypical nerd. He plays soccer and other sports, Mensa is just another extracurricular activity. Like his sister Hillary, he tested into the group when he was 4. 
<p>After his brother Matt and sister Hillary tested into the group as youngsters, Scott, the oldest of the three Pinsker children, didn’t want to be the only kid in the family without a membership. So in a flash, he went out and passed the test. 
<p>A recent graduate of James Madison University, Scott is working for Affiliated Attorneys Inc. while he sends out law school applications. “The Mensa membership is a great resume builder,” he says. “It certainly hasn’t shut any doors for me.” Nor will his real-world experience. At James Madison University, Scott became very active in Young Republicans and attended the 1994 Republican convention as the vice chairman of the group for the state of Virginia. The role landed him a few spots in the documentary “The Perfect Candidate” and an even bigger role in “Ollie’s Army” another documentary about the grass-roots Republican effort to elect Oliver North to the U.S. Senate. 
<p>Not every genius enjoys such notoriety. Consider the case of Kilian Garvey. He was held back in grade school, failed the 11th grade twice and spent 16 semesters at three different colleges just trying to graduate. When he finally did, he wound up with a 2.1 grade point average and meager prospects for a job. But in Garvey’s case, the intelligence quotient proved a profound irony. 
<p>“I had an enormous amount of difficulty in school,” he says, “but it wasn’t so much failing that bothered me. It was that I could get so frustrated with the whole thing. I became disinterested and would stop going to classes.” 
<p>Garvey had a learning disability, which is not uncommon in people with very high IQs. Common learning disabilities include dyslexia, ADHD, and attention deficit disorder, which was Garvey’s albatross. “I was seen as a failure,” he says. “I was failing out of high school. People thought I was stupid.”
<p>But Garvey knew differently. “I always knew I was smart, in spite of my bad grades.” While attending — and struggling — through VCU in 1989, he noticed an article in The Richmond Times-Dispatch with the headline “You May be a Genius.” On a whim, he called Mensa for a practice test. The test comprised 100 sample questions and after he returned it, they recommended he take a proctored test. Garvey took two IQ tests in one morning and soon found he had scored in the 97th percentile on the first and in the 99th on the other. And with that, he became a member of Mensa.
<p>At the end of last summer Garvey came to terms with his ADD and began taking the drug Ritalin. Shortly thereafter, he took two summer courses and roped in two A’s. “I’ve never in my life gotten two A’s in any one semester,” he says. His experiences have made him somewhat cynical of measurements such as the Intelligence Quotient. “No matter how high a person’s IQ may be, they are not always Oxbridge material,” he says. 
<p>With his learning disorder in check, Garvey, who is an admissions counselor at Benedictine high school, is back in school for a master’s degree in counseling. “It’s disappointing to think that I wasted so many of those years,” he says, “but it could be worse. I’ve still got plenty of years in front of me.”
<p>Mensans are quick to invite anyone and everyone to join the group. 
<p>To get in all you have to do is correctly answer a few simple questions (see the <a href="http://www.miracle.com/mensa/workout.cgi?workout">sample quiz</a>). When you’ve passed with flying colors, you’ll technically be a genius — your IQ will measure in the top 2 percent of everyone in the world. And if you fail ... well, those with fragile egos might just keep on considering. Procrastination could be the smartest move of all. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<p><font size=5 color=#333399 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Secrets of Success</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Emotional, intellectual savvy are keys to satisfaction, one study shows.</b></font>
<p>So you’re not a rocket scientist. But if you were, could you be a happy rocket scientist? 
<p>A College of William and Mary psychologist is looking for the answer by updating a nearly 50-year-old-study of the relationship of intelligence to success, satisfaction and happiness.
<p>Greg Feist hopes this and other studies will help us understand why some people succeed in life without a high IQ and why some really high IQ folks are miserable and fail to live up to their potential.
<p>What’s more important, he and other psychologists are asking, academic intelligence or the ability to read your “gut” and manage emotions? 
<p>Success, it seems, thrives on a blend of emotional and intellectual abilities.
<p>In a study that spanned 44 years, Feist and a colleague tracked down 53 of an original 80 study subjects to discover how successful they had been in their careers. 
<p>Back in 1950, University of California at Berkeley graduate students were given a slew of personality and intelligence tests. The students also spent a weekend with a group of psychologists, who later rated them on how “emotionally healthy” they were. During the weekend of socializing, the psychologists tried to gauge how sensitive the students were to their own and others’ emotions and how they coped with problems. In short, they wanted to know how mature and balanced the students were.
<p>Then, the students’ academic advisors and the psychologists rated each student on his “potential for success” using one rating for academics and intelligence and another for “personal soundness,” 1950s lingo for “emotional intelligence,” Feist says.
<p>The study aimed to find out which of the two scores would predict future success. Forty-four years later, Feist and his colleague reviewed the resumes of the now-retiring subjects to find out how their careers had fared and how those resumes compared to the students’ original ratings.
<p>“We found both the academic and intelligence (ratings) predicted career success, but the emotional intelligence (rating) was a better predictor,” Feist says. In other words, those who were emotionally savvy back in 1950 appeared to achieve more over the course of their careers.
<p>But wait, there’s more. These aging subjects were also asked about “life satisfaction.” The result is sobering.
<p>The researchers found that neither the academic rating nor the emotional rating could forecast satisfaction.
<p>“It suggests that being smart in academics or sensitive and aware doesn’t relate to how happy you’re going to be,” Feist observes.
<p>Feist continues the quest to unlock the secrets to success and satisfaction. He’s already working on a new study that will follow 120 students and adults and attempt to measure whether emotional or academic success can predict not only career success but also life satisfaction and relationship satisfaction. Whew.
<p>It’s gotta be harder than rocket science. <i>— Betty Joyce Nash</i>

<p><font size=5 color=#333399 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>By the Numbers</b></font>
<br>Mensa is not as exclusive as it may seem. While the 98th percentile requirement does seem a pretty slim margin, the numbers suggest that, on a worldwide statistical basis, 100 million people could get that kind of score and thus qualify for membership. Compare that to the membership requirements of other “brain clubs” around the country. The Triple Nine Society requires that a member’s IQ be in the 99.9th percentile of all 5 billion people on the planet. Crunching the numbers will reveal that’s one in a thousand. Membership in the Prometheus Society is even more of a long shot — don’t even think about if you don’t rank in the 99.997th percentile. Then there’s the Mega Society. You’re welcome if your I.Q. tests in the 99.9999th percentile. 
<p>But how much could the rest of us be missing? Mega only has 17 members worldwide. Statistics show that only 5,000 people on earth have an IQ that could qualify them for membership.

<br>Mensa exists to identify and foster human intelligence for the benefit of humanity, to encourage intelligence research and to promote stimulating intellectual and social opportunities for its members. There are currently about 100,000 Mensans, as they are called, worldwide. About half of them live in the United States supporting 150 local chapters.

<font size=4 color=#000000><br><b>Online chat rooms are the new frontier in virtual relationships.</b></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#660000 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><b>C</b></font>hat is a word your Great Aunt Ethel used to say, as in, “Come over here honey and chat with me awhile.” Then she’d pinch your cheek. Old Ethel would probably be shocked to learn what the ’90s connotation of chat is, that there are entire chat rooms where the so-called “chat” is less than wholesome. 
<p>All over the world, people are turning on their Macs and PCs, signing onto online computer services like America Online and CompuServe and heading straight for chat rooms. From their offices, bedrooms, family rooms and hotel rooms, men and women are reaching out across a crowded screen to make a connection. They’re double-clicking on chat rooms with names like “Tonight’s the Night” or “Born Again Christians” or “Married and Flirting.” 
<p>In a way, online chatter is one big costume party where true identities are cloaked in fantasy and geographical boundaries don’t exist. You can live in Richmond or Moscow; you can be any sex, any height, weight or age. Care to test the waters as a homosexual? Go ahead and experiment — nobody will ever know. In fact, for young gays who have traditionally had to wait until their 20s to emerge from the closet, online chat has become a safe way to gradually, anonymously come out. For marrieds, online is the new way to have an affair without all that pesky sneaking around town.
<p>In many of the chat rooms, talk, which is carried on in real time (as you type, your words appear on the screen immediately for the other 20 people in your room to read and respond to) is generally inane: You’ll see lots of “Hello,” “Hi” and “How’s the weather?” 
<p>What you can’t see is the talk that’s going on outside the rooms. In nearly every chat room there are those who are prospecting for, well, we’d like to think it’s idle chatter, but more than likely it’s sex. 
<p>The hunt begins with what’s called an Instant Message. Bob sees Sue’s screen name and sends her a private message that appears on her screen with a little Tinkerbell-esque sound effect. It might say something polite like, “Care to chat?” or “You busy?” or something else entirely like “How bout some cyber?” Cyber means verbal fornication in which the two consenting parties type themselves into orbit.
<p>If Sue ignores the message in that little box on her screen, Bob will go away. That’s the nice part. No awkward body language. No excuses. No pretense of politeness. Just a blunt “I’m not interested” and poof! Gone! This hands-off aspect of “chatting” is its greatest appeal for those who want to graze.
<p>What’s different about this wild frontier of relationships is that while some go for the catch and release, others do, in fact, fall in love. 
<p>Do these electronic impulses translate into three-dimensional bliss? Infidelity? Will they keep us from relating in the real world?
<p>“With the proliferation of PCs, I am seeing gradually more people with problems caused by abuse of the Internet,” says clinical psychologist Dr. Leigh Thornton of The Westwood Group. While Thornton recognizes the positive side of talking with individuals with like interests and hobbies, he warns of the danger of “compulsive surfing of explicit graphics or chat rooms for excitement or gratification at the expense of putting energy into development of healthy relationships.”
<p>Some chatters, or their concerned spouses, are already seeking help. Says Thornton, “I’m seeing people with problems caused by Internet usage or abuse, often married people who are dissatisfied with relationships. While in the past they may have rented an erotic video, they can turn to the Internet anytime as long as their co-worker or spouse isn’t looking over their shoulder. I’ve seen clients who ‘chat’ for three hours a night while their spouse is in next room thinking they are paying bills or doing computer work for the office. It’s as anonymous as you want it to be, with little or no record of even long-distance interaction as there would be with a phone bill. It can become an addiction which needs behavioral intervention and therapy.”
<p>Considering the pros and cons, Thornton concludes that “used judiciously, the Internet can be a valuable source of information and helpful contacts and even friendship, but its very format can prove a temptation for abuse for someone who is vulnerable or very dissatisfied with relationship.”
<p>Interestingly, research indicates that women are at least as likely as men — the early and still majority users of the Internet — to spend long hours online to the detriment of their marriages. A recent study at the University of Pittsburgh studied 396 hard-core Internet users, 239 of which were women. They spent an average of 38.5 hours per week online.  
<p>The study claimed that Internet use is as addictive as drugs, alcohol or gambling. The study subjects exhibited the same addictive symptoms, including an inability to control Internet use, the need to use it for longer and longer periods of time, and lying to family and friends to hide the amount of time spent online. 
<p>One woman who participated in the study spent up to 12 hours a day online and chose to be divorced rather than be separated from her computer. According to psychologist Kimberly Young, who coordinated the study, the woman met new people on the Internet and the conversations made her feel attractive and interesting. Young reported that dependent users were particularly attracted to chat rooms, where people can assume any personality they want without fear of repercussion or discovery.   
<p>Some very personal stories and experts’ observations of this brave new world of human interaction follow. Anonymity, the key element to many online relationships, has been granted in cases where identity could wreak havoc on personal lives and professions.

<br><b>A far-flung couple finds love, however star-crossed, online.</b>
<br><i><b>by Anonymous</b></i>
<p><font size=6 color=#660000 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><b>I</b></font>t all started innocently enough. One dark and rainy afternoon last summer, I was signed onto America Online, checking the stock market and the day’s news and downloading some information for a business research project. Curiosity led me into “People Connection,” the land of chat rooms. A friend had told me of his exploits with women online, and I wondered how hard it would be to find a man.
<p>In a dead-end relationship for several years, I’d learned about loneliness and the toll it takes on one’s self-esteem and spirit. I had a hunch I was not dumb or ugly, but no one had confirmed it for a very long time. Cruising into the “Romance Connection” chat room I thought, well, even if I make a new friend I’ll be happy.
<p>Within three minutes I was having a conversation that would change my life forever. It started like this:
<p>He: Can you talk?
<br>Me: Not at any great length ...
<br>He: Does length matter?
<br>Me: Not really ...
<p>Yes, it was rife with innuendo. No, I didn’t know this guy from a hole in the wall. But, nevertheless, as Hurricane Hugo swept through the apartment courtyard below my window, we talked. And talked. And talked. For a good hour or more we carried on a dialogue via Instant Messages (IMs), covering every imaginable topic from sex to kids to movies to Fortune 500 companies to mutual funds to bad writers to indifferent spouses, his and mine.
<p>Expecting guys on AOL to be your basic idiots or perverts, I was taken totally by surprise. This man was funny and smart, keeping pace with me every step of the way. He seemed familiar, and, although he said he was an English professor in Michigan, I secretly wondered if he was lying. I mean, on AOL, you can be anything, look like anything, be totally deceptive or completely honest — and no one would ever know. Besides, his spelling was atrocious — how could he teach English?
<p>We said goodbye and signed off that afternoon with a mention that maybe we’d meet again online the following week. That weekend I thought of nothing but my new friend, Jeff. I laughed to myself about some of the funny stuff he’d said. I wondered if I might be able to find a book he’d written in the library. I had a silly grin on my face round the clock.
<p>On Monday afternoon I signed on AOL and Jeff was on, too. We picked up where we left off with a conversation that involved a gradual revealing of ourselves. And we had sex or whatever it is you have online when you make love to someone verbally. It felt strange, but it felt strangely good and impossible to explain. I knew I never would be able to explain it to anyone and resolved to stay silent on the subject with my friends who’d have a hard time believing that I, a navy-suit-and-heels finance professional, would be carrying on in such a way with a total stranger.
<p>Soon, before we knew it, Jeff and I were talking online, and eventually on the phone, every day and night, at an appointed hour. We couldn’t get enough of each other, wanting to know everything about everything. It was like the beginning of any other relationship in many ways, the only difference being that we’d never seen each other. This relationship, we decided, was being conducted backwards. Usually, you see someone, think they’re attractive, make your move, start talking, maybe have a date, fall in love, make love. 
<p>Here, we’d talked, made love, fallen in love and never laid eyes on one another. 
<p>Before long, we knew we were going to have to meet. All the e-mail in the world was not going to satisfy our curiosity about each other. We were openly talking about being totally, irreversibly in love. So Jeff made the most of a business trip east and we arranged to meet. Never have I been so nervous in all of my life. I worried that he wouldn’t think I was attractive. I also worried that we’d have so much fun together that parting would be unbearable.
<p>But, by this point, we knew two things: We would meet no matter what, and we would never be able to be together on a permanent basis due to our families.
<p>We shared an allegiance to our respective children that would keep us married until they were gone. It seemed like we were on a collision course with misery by indulging ourselves, but it was a risk we were willing to take.
<p>So we met for one wonderful weekend. That first moment that we saw each other was intense. Neither one of us was disappointed, but looks really didn’t matter by that point. We had dinner, saw movies, walked down side streets hand in hand. We talked about what we called “stupid stuff” — nothing in particular, just details of life. 
<p>We knew we probably wouldn’t be able to pull off another rendezvous so we made the most of the days and nights. It felt kind of like spending time with a terminal patient, and the victim, we knew, would inevitably be our relationship. We had met about 20 years too late, or 10 years too soon to gain freedom without upsetting so many lives.
<p>Early Sunday morning, Jeff left the hotel for his plane back to the Midwest, and I dissolved in a heap of tears, feeling a pain more profound than I could ever remember. In the bathroom, I discovered that he’d left me toothpaste on my toothbrush since I’d borrowed his all weekend. In the hallway, next to the elevator he’d drawn a face in the ashtray sand just like he’d done all weekend. 
<p>Sitting alone at breakfast that morning, I composed a letter to him thanking him for the gift he’d given me — of acceptance, love and many, many laughs.
<p>I’d gotten that confirmation I’d been missing and gained a great friend in the process. Though we may never see each other again, we stay in touch, keeping each other abreast of little details — his son got his first car, mine was accepted early-decision at the college of his choice. It’s nice to know that somewhere out there is someone who loves me very much, even if we never share that love in person again. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><b>Virginia divorce law hasn’t joined the information age.</b>
<br><i><b>by Jeffry Burden</b></i>
<p><font size=6 color=#660000 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><b>O</b></font>nline love was a big temptation for Cynthia Forest.
<p>The Prince William County legal secretary, whose 8-year marriage had produced three kids and plenty of ups and downs (and whose name has been changed here for privacy’s sake), fell hard for the California tax lawyer she met online last December. He seemed affectionate and sympathetic to her problems while providing a nice distraction from the strains of her daily life. 
<p>Their friendship deepened quickly, and it extended to their children.  Cynthia developed a relationship with the man’s son, and he did the same with her kids. Meanwhile, Cynthia’s husband had begun to form romantic links of his own on the Internet.  
<p>By early this summer, Cynthia and her husband had separated and her long-distance beau was flying to Virginia to meet her in person for the first time.   
<p>While it’s not yet commonplace, Richmond domestic relations lawyers say romantic online relationships are cited as significant factors in the breakdown of their clients’ marriages. And with online services in more and more homes, it’s likely to become a part of more and more divorce proceedings.
<p>Richmond lawyer Don Butler, who recently represented lesbian mother Sharon Bottoms in Bottoms’ child custody dispute with her mother, says online relationships fall into two general categories: those that are a further extension of an already existing liaison, and those where the relationship is actually formed online, perhaps in a chat room.  He expects to see more of both.
<p>Like a bar, a supermarket or the workplace, the Internet is just another meeting place, and just as ripe for potential matrimonial misdeeds.   
<p>“For example, the husband is logged into a football chat room,” Butler says.  “He meets Melissa, who seems to know a lot about football. They get to communicating, and it leads to a relationship.”  Usually, Butler says, the two parties end up meeting, whereafter the affair may or may not go smoothly.  
<p>As in the old days when spouses would find love notes in a sock drawer, so today can e-mail reveal marital indiscretion. “I always get copies of the e-mail messages as part of the ‘trail’ of the relationship,” Butler says. He is not surprised that those messages are often left for the other spouse to find. He believes that, just as leaving notes in a drawer can reveal an unconscious wish to be caught, not eliminating e-mail messages may reveal the same wish.  
<p>Steamy love notes, of course, have been around as long as marriages have been falling apart. But Virginia law has not yet made the lovers’ leap into cyberspace. In other words, it’s not adultery unless there is a physical relationship, no matter how steamy, graphic or even satisfying the online relationship is. West End lawyer Greg Waddell says the best grounds he can allege for a divorce based on excessive online time is “constructive desertion.”  
<p>In such a situation, the offending spouse has absented him or herself from the marriage, either physically or in some other meaningful way, and devoted his or her “energies and affections” to someone else.  
<p>In fact, Waddell says, merely ignoring your spouse while in front of a terminal is no more a “constructive desertion” under current law than playing golf all weekend. To date, Virginia courts have not been willing to grant divorces on that ground to spouses who have lost a partner to their computer, even if romance is online.  
<p>The fact remains, if one spouse wants to blame the other for breaking up the marriage by extracurricular conduct, there still has to be some kind of physical relationship. But technology could change that, too. “Sexual connotations may become a means to overcome the reluctance of the courts” to find a constructive desertion, Waddell says.     
<p>Just think: A home computer originally purchased for the kids’ homework could either force the courts to expand the definition of constructive desertion or even eliminate the physical requirement to prove adultery.
<p>And what about Cynthia Forest, the secretary with the California cyberbeau? She found something less than bliss when they finally met: He was obsessed with his work, and yelled at her kids. They ended their relationship, and she is now back trying to work things out with her husband. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><b>How can parents protect children from sex on the Internet?</b>
<br><i><b>by Janet Giampietro</b></i>
<p><font size=6 color=#660000 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><b>T</b></font>here was a time, not too many years ago, when a young teen-ager’s access to sexually explicit materials was in the back of his father’s sock drawer, or on page 162 of her mother’s romance novel.
<p>But the personal computer — and the Internet in particular — has changed all that. This vital educational tool has a downside: The Internet offers a smorgasbord of sexually explicit material, and the average curious teen can download graphic pictures in seconds — or worse, strike up a live conversation that has nothing to do with geometry.
<p>“Melody” (not her real name) is a 13-year-old 7th grader in the West End. She has a personal computer with Internet access in her room. She also subscribes to America Online, and has access to any chat room from Trivia to The Flirts Nook. She says that, on at least one occasion, she and a schoolmate have had a sexually explicit conversation with an adult man, or at least someone claiming to be an adult man. Melody says she told the man she was 17 or 18.
<p>How explicit did it get? Melody’s a little too embarrassed to say. “He’d use some really bad words,” she says. “He asked me, ‘Do you want to F?’”
<p>This is a scary scenario for parents, especially if they bought the computer as an educational tool and encouraged their child’s interest in it. “This technology is extremely attractive and valuable for adults and children,” says Sue Melzig, a resource counselor at Commonwealth Parenting Center.
<p>It is a parent’s responsibility, Melzig says, to introduce their children to this technology, but the guidelines parents use in other aspects of their children’s lives should still apply. Melzig offers some concrete steps parents can take to strike the proper balance between responsible Internet use and troublesome abuse:
<p><font color=#990000 size=5>•</font> Familiarize yourself. Investigate and explore as your child might. “Look at where the pitfalls are,” Melzig says. Visit chat rooms and websites that might attract sexually curious young people. If you don’t have a computer but know that your child has Internet access elsewhere, Melzig suggests visiting a friend who has Internet access and asking him or her to walk you through it. Kinko’s copy stores offer Internet access for $10 per hour. 
<br><font color=#990000 size=5>•</font> Keep your computer in a shared space. Melzig says use of the computer should be a “public experience” within the home.
<br><font color=#990000 size=5>•</font> Treat the computer like the other privileges you grant your children. If you wouldn’t give your 16-year-old 24-hour-a-day access to the car, or unlimited hours playing Sega games to your 11-year old, why unlimited access to the computer? Like the telephone, the Internet racks up bills, and for that reason alone, Melzig says, monitoring time on the computer is reasonable. Place a sign-in book next to your computer and have your children log when they are on the computer, for how long and for what purpose. “If you trust them, you don’t have to be over their shoulders,” Melzig says.
<br><font color=#990000 size=5>•</font> Make your children accountable for their computer activity. Occasionally ask what they did on the computer that day, what websites they visited and what the value was. You may learn something yourself.
<br><font color=#990000 size=5>•</font> Keep your antennae up. “It isn’t hard to detect when [children] are up to no good,” Melzig says. There are signs when your children might be getting into trouble — over-enthusiasm about one particular activity, an extreme desire for privacy, and a certain friend or friends who are often involved in the activity as well. If Suzy spends hours and hours with Brittany from down the street with the door locked and computer keys clacking, find out what they are up to.
<br><font color=#990000 size=5>•</font> Even if you don’t own a computer, be aware of exposure your kids are getting elsewhere. If your child visits a friend who has Internet access, talk with the parents to find out what their procedures and rules are about the computer.
<br><font color=#990000 size=5>•</font> No pleading ignorance. This is an area where your kids may be far more expert than you, but that doesn’t relieve you of your responsibility to guide your children, says Melzig. “You can’t buy it, plug it in and walk away from it,” she says. “You have to be responsible.” <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br>Keep pace with Walter Witschey.
<br><i>by Carolyn McCulley</i></b></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#003366 face="GeoSlab703 Lt BT, Avant Garde, Helvetica, Arial"><b>W</b></font></tt>e zap hot dinners on platters that whirl in microwave ovens. We conduct conversations and bank transactions on cellular phones the size of a deck of cards. We carry libraries of data and worldwide communication devices in computers that tuck inside a briefcase. We exercise on treadmills that offer words of affirmation as they track heart rate, calories burned and virtual distance traveled. 
<p>We’ve met the Jetsons and they are us. 
<p>With technology passing futurist fantasies in the fast lane, how does a science museum keep up? An obvious question for Walter R. T. Witschey, 55, since 1992 the executive director of the Science Museum of Virginia.
<p>But spending time with the physicist, M.B.A. computer whiz, turned successful entrepreneur, turned archeologist, turned head of one of the state’s most far-reaching educational institutions, with over two million people participating in its programs annually, poses a more immediate challenge: keeping up with Witschey.
<p>His ahead-of-the-pack pace has served him well. Throughout Witschey’s varied career, staying at least a few steps ahead has put him in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. 
<p>“I look at Walter as a Renaissance man,” says Arthur W. Helwig, chairman of the museum’s board of trustees and retired vice president of development at Ethyl Corp.: “You can see it in his career path that has developed in a most interesting and most fascinating kind of way.”
<p>On a recent afternoon, Witschey is in his office contentedly clicking away at his PC. The ongoing — 20 years and counting — renovation of the grand old West Broad Street train station into a major state-of-the-art science museum has apparently missed the modestly furnished executive suite. Pale blue paper covers the walls, and tired polyester curtains hang at the casement windows.
<p>“Let me show you around,” he offers in a West Virginia drawl. Rising to greet his guest, his eyes twinkle behind rimless spectacles as he flashes a boyish smile. He eschews his trademark bow tie this day and wears sporty white chinos and a turquoise polo shirt with a discreet museum insignia on the pocket.
<p>Trailing Witschey as he bounds through the sprawling museum is like keeping pace with a gregarious scout troop leader on a cross-country hike.
<p>He sweeps across a catwalklike balcony overlooking the spectacular rotunda aglow with golden autumn sunlight. He gestures to the 96-foot Foucault pendulum swinging rhythmically from the massive dome to show the Earth’s rotation. Embedded in the floor below, a series of large, colored dots simulating the growth pattern of sunflower seeds illustrates principles advanced by the 13th-century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. Bounding down a few flights of steps, Witschey pokes his nose into the basement carpentry and metalwork shop where the air is filled with sounds and sawdust from exhibits-in-the-making. The museum, Witschey explains, has two primary functions: first, to complement educational programs offered in elementary and secondary schools and second, to provide continuing science education for people no longer in the classroom. 
<p>Citing national high school tests, Witschey says the United States ranks no better than 10th or 12th place in science proficiency worldwide. “I don’t think the U.S. ought to be out front on everything, but these things affect the quality of life. Times have changed. You can’t rely on getting a job up the street, or across town, or even from county to county. ... When it comes to the education of our children, science ought to be high up on the list.”
<p>The tour continues.
<p>Pushing open a glass door, Witschey charges across an outdoor area formerly covered by train tracks. Strips of emerald lawn stretch northward to Leigh Street, grass thriving where rails once lay. “We were locked indoors for a quarter century, surrounded by a hazardous railroad facility,” he explains. “We’ve moved from that to a not just safe, but highly attractive and usable space.”
<p>Nearby, under meticulously restored “butterfly” cast-iron train canopies that sheltered generations of travelers into and out of Richmond (the last passenger train departed in November 1975), an advanced ground transportation system exhibit in the planning: “Other regional transportation museums in Roanoke and Baltimore deal with the past; we’ll deal with transportation systems of the future,” he says of the exhibit that will explore passenger and freight rail as well as “smart” highway technology.
<p>A final stop on his whirlwind tour is the environmentally conscious air conditioning system for the museum’s popular OMNIMAX theater. “We make ice during the night when electricity costs are cheaper,” he says, pointing to containers holding softball-sized and liquid-filled globes which are frozen at night. During the day, air is blown through the system to cool the building.
<p>The quick loop is a kind of victory lap. Witschey has led his administration’s stewardship of the landmark, the physical cornerstone of the institution, into one of the nation’s 20 major science “centers” — a term he clearly prefers to “museum.”
<p>“I think the public is attuned that a science museum is not a place with static objects on display but a place for hands-on discoveries,” he says, “We are a public science center.”
<p>Unlike traditionally hands-off, object-oriented art and historical museums, “science museums have a difficult challenge because they must provide experiments that can be conducted during a visit,” he says, “so we must lure visitors in. The most exciting and long-lived discoveries are made when you’re totally engaged.”
<p>Associates say it’s hard to imagine anyone more engaged in or enthusiastic about scientific discovery than Witschey.
<p>“He’s unlike anybody I’ve ever met,” says Robert L. Thalhimer, executive director of the Science Museum Foundation. “He has boundless enthusiasm for life. He’s curious about everything, and he doesn’t stop until he figures out how it works.”
<p>In addition to his natural curiosity, Witschey is able to share this enthusiasm with others, a quality key to the director of any center of learning. “We need someone who is well-grounded scientifically,” explains Helwig. “Walter’s nature is to be outgoing. He sells himself and he sells the role of the institution.”
<p>Says Jack Parry, the museum’s deputy director for administration and support: “He executes the key things that need to be done, which are the development of the vision and long-range plan (with Bobby Thalhimer) for financing the museum’s programs.” 
<p>Since the museum’s first exhibition space was opened in 1977 with the 2,500-square-foot “Discovery Room,” Witschey says the museum’s Broad Street exhibition space has grown to some 85,000 square feet — plus 12.5 acres of outdoor space.
<p>“When I came here I told the board my goal was to raise and spend $100 million in projects,” Witschey says straightforwardly. “We’ve done $40 million so far.”
<p>“Well begun is half-done,” he says, crediting his senior staff, the museum’s 65 full-time, 65 part-time employees and a legion of some 1,100 volunteers.
<p>Thalhimer, whose family members are longtime museum patrons, says his own decision to head the museum’s fund-raising efforts was inspired by Witschey’s arrival at the museum almost five years ago. Thalhimer relishes those occasions when he and Witschey travel together on business. Once, in Lynchburg, they were meeting with researchers developing highly specialized robots designed to enter nuclear reactors to replace rods. 
<p>“Walter was right in gear with the engineers and could discuss the process with them on their level. That same day, at another stop, the process of shipping coal was discussed. He was equally adept at discussing that. The amazing thing is he can shift from high-tech to low-tech,” Thalhimer says.
<p>On another occasion when they were visiting a downtown Roanoke museum, Thalhimer thought he could finally stump Witschey when they came upon a still for making whiskey. “I thought I had him. But of course he knew how the distilling process worked: It’s science.”

Using $5.60 in parts, he made a Tesla Coil (named for Nikola Tesla) which makes high voltage discharges like lightning.
<p>“My parents encouraged me in everything,” Witschey says.
<p>Witschey’s late father was a certified public accountant, and his mother, who still lives in Charleston, taught piano for 65 years. She was trained as a classical pianist at Julliard in New York City.
<p>But he credits one of his parents’ friends with sparking an early interest in science: “Perry Poffenbarger was a lawyer by profession, but he was a laboratory scientist at heart. He had a lab in his home and was always encouraging people like me to do science.”
<p>Witschey also remembers being handpicked in the fifth grade to conduct a scientific experiment, and he has high praise for a high school teacher who came in some mornings at 7:30 before class to teach calculus, a subject not offered in the official curriculum. “These people made a difference. I’ve had wonderful mentors all my life.”
<p>Those mentors always set high expectations, something he says is missing in too many homes and schools today.
<p>“Number one, I believe we should have higher expectations for our children’s behavior. Secondly, we must have higher expectations of our children’s schoolwork. And thirdly, we should have higher expectations of our teachers to keep the fire alive in our children,” says Witschey.
<p>“I work on this personally with my own children at home. I make it clear that the minimum is not acceptable. Learning is cumulative. There’s no such thing as learning something this quarter and then forgetting it next quarter.”
<p>Witschey’s own early academic achievements earned him a spot in Princeton’s class of 1963 where he would major in physics. It was in his third year, however, he had “a wake-up call that came as sharply as an alarm clock: I did not want to be a research physicist.” 
<p>A professor put it to him even more bluntly: “Why don’t you go into something that you understand?”
<p>Undaunted, Witschey persevered and graduated with a B.A. in physics.
<p>He then escaped the world of pure science to earn an M.B.A. from the University of Virginia’s Colgate W. Darden School of Business Administration. “I loved business school, I had professors who challenged me repeatedly to do more and better.”
<p>Grown-up and M.B.A. in hand, Witschey landed a job with IBM in sales and systems design and moved to Richmond.
<p>Then in 1969, when he was still in his 20s, Witschey co-founded The Computer Company, a Richmond-based consulting firm which would eventually specialize in Medicaid claims processing in over a dozen states, airline strategic decision systems, microform production and Richmond’s first retail computer store. He served as president from 1970 to 1984.
<p>It was at The Computer Company that Witschey met his future wife — a fellow employee — the former Joan DuRelle Vincent of Danville. Witschey says that within days of their first date “it was a clear certainty” that there was chemistry between the two.
<p>They were married in 1979, the second time around for both.
<p>They have five children, Anne Witschey, 29, who works for The Recorder newspaper in Highland County, Schon Parris, 27, a student at Virginia Commonwealth University; Kate Witschey Brauner, 26, who teaches math in New Orleans and has a 1-year-old daughter; Walter II, 14 and a student at the Governor’s School (who volunteers during the summer at the Science Museum’s computer center); and Benjamin Witschey, 13, who attends Short Pump Middle School.
<p>The family vacationed this summer on North Carolina’s Outer Banks where Witschey kicked back with a Tom Clancy novel and brushed up on literature of the Inca culture. He will lead a museum-sponsored tour to Machu Picchu, Peru, this fall to visit pre-Inca and Inca archeological sites.
<p>“Having two school-age children in the house is a great challenge, but it keeps you young,” Witschey says with a hearty laugh. 
<p>They also help him keep in touch with one of his museum’s largest constituencies, Virginia’s students. One third of the museum’s 350,000 annual visitors come in organized school groups. The institution’s statewide outreach and traveling programs reach more than two million people annually.
<p>By 1983, The Computer Company was on a roll with revenues of $32 million and 1,200 employees. Witschey arranged the sale of the corporation to Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Virginia, a transaction reportedly valued at more than $8 million. He says it had always been a part of the investors’ business plan to sell or make a public offering, if and when the company reached a certain size. He stayed on briefly as president, but the company’s sale didn’t allow him to retire as a rich man: “I was a small minority stockholder. I’m not independently wealthy.” 
<p>The company’s sale, however, did open the door for him to pursue a longtime fascination with archeology. He was unexpectedly offered a full fellowship to study archeology at Tulane University. Within 24 hours he accepted, and the Witscheys were on their way to the Big Easy.
<p>During their years in New Orleans, Joan, a mezzo-soprano, furthered her interest in music by performing with the New Orleans opera and singing in church choirs. Today, she sings with the Richmond Concert Chorale and is a dedicated volunteer at the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden.  
<p>While pursuing his graduate studies, Walter continued computer systems consulting work and taught college courses. “I’ve never gotten out of the computer business,” he says, “I continue to consult, and archeological work is laced with computer work. It’s very exciting.” He received his Ph.D. from Tulane in 1992.
<p>The Witscheys were living in New Orleans when they heard through Richmond friends that Paul Knappenberger, Jr. who had headed the Science Museum for 18 years, was accepting the directorship of Chicago’s Adler Planetarium, and a national search was underway for a new director.
<p>“Eleven years before I came here, I told Paul that he had the best job in the whole world; to let me know if he ever was going to leave,” Witschey remembers with an ironic smile. 
<p>While at The Computer Company, Witschey found time to volunteer at the museum. His major contribution was the design and installation of a huge sundial that covered one-third of an acre of the museum’s parking lot. In 1983, it was cited as the world’s largest in the “Guiness Book of World Records.”
<p>Witschey has continued that tradition of extending science beyond institutional walls by developing other science venues (see sidebar). These include the Virginia Aviation Museum, the opening of the Danville Science Center and most recently, the Rice River Center on the banks of the James River in Richmond’s West End.
<p>Witschey also sees the Science Museum as a major component of the linear complex of cultural and recreational and educational attractions hugging the Boulevard and its northern extensions, Hermitage Road and Lakeside Avenue.
<p>“The Boulevard is a sleeper,” he says, citing the string of popular destinations which attract collectively more than 1.5 million visitors annually — Maymont, Dogwood Dell, Byrd Park, the canal, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the Virginia Historical Society, Monument Avenue, The Diamond, Bryan Park and the Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. The Richmond Children’s Museum is currently developing plans to move to a location adjacent to the Science Museum. “Richmond has a cultural spine that is comparable to the Mall in Washington, D.C.,” says Witschey, “but we’re hiding our light under a bushel. ... The game is not over,” he says. “It’s just starting.”
<p>Of course, the secret of Witschey’s success is no secret: He loves what he does, and he’s excited about all the scientific discovery still ahead: “All the great science is not in the textbooks,” he says. “The fun science is yet to be done: We don’t know much about human consciousness, we don’t know how to decipher Linear A writing systems on Crete. Computers are still in their infancy.” 
<p>As he rattles off a litany of scientific challenges the mission of the Science Museum of Virginia crystallizes: “We’ve got to keep our kids charged up.” 
<p>And a few steps ahead. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><font size=5 color=#003366 face="GeoSlab703 Lt BT, Avant Garde, Helvetica, Arial"><b>T</b></font></tt>he Science Museum was established by the Virginia General Assembly in 1970 with a goal that hasn’t changed in 25 years — science literacy for all Virginians.
<p>The initial concept, advanced by longtime museum proponent Dr. Roscoe D. Hughes of Mechanicsville, was to establish regional museums at no cost to the state using existing facilities and mobile museums. 
<p>In 1972, the Science Museum of Virginia Foundation Inc. was formed to receive and manage donations toward the museum’s development. 
<p>The first proposal for a museum building was a futuristic-looking, solar-powered glass “Crystal Palace” in Byrd Park near the James River. The mid-’70s recession, however, caused Richmond-area localities and the state to cut support. Undeterred, the museum hired its first director, Paul H. Knappenberger Jr. A mobile unit was purchased, equipped with various exhibits and christened TransScience 1. Dedicated in 1973, it would eventually be visited by 2 million people.
<p>With the success of the mobile museum, the museum board began searching for a permanent Richmond address.
<p>The last train pulled out of Broad Street Station in 1975, and the state had purchased the terminal intending to demolish it and build a governmental office complex in its place. The late Mrs. William T. Reed Jr. of Goochland implored state legislators to save the building by allowing the museum to locate there temporarily (She and her sister, Elisabeth Scott Bocock, were already legendary preservationists having been leaders in the initial restoration of historic Church Hill and establishing of the Historic Richmond Foundation Inc.).
<p>In 1976, Broad Street Station became the official home of the Science Museum.
<p>The initial exhibits included a sand pendulum, angle mirrors, Virginia rocks and minerals, a miniplanetarium, whale bones, telescopes and “Make-a-Movie.” The Exploratorium, a science center in San Francisco, provided the model for many of the museum’s earliest programs.
<p>In 1980, at groundbreaking ceremonies for the planetarium and space theater, an actor dressed as Darth Vader theatrically endorsed the project: “Build your structure. I approve of its existence.”
<p>The planetarium opened in 1983 with more than 10,000 people attending opening day, still a museum record for a single day. The new attraction caused the museum’s attendance to triple.
<p>In 1987, Ethyl Corp. gave the museum $2 million, the largest gift in the museum’s history. The planetarium and space center were renamed in the company’s honor.
<p>The Hall of Science and Exploration was completed in 1989 in the former grand concourse.
<p>In 1990, the museum made its first off-site expansion when it accepted by gift the Virginia Aviation Museum located at the Richmond International Airport. It features vintage aircraft from the collection of Sidney Shannon Jr. of Fredericksburg. The collection also includes other historical exhibits and the Virginia Aviation Hall of Fame.
<p>In 1993, the museum opened a branch museum in Danville where city, county and educational officials were looking for a new use of the Norfolk Southern train station. The city won an ISTEA (Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) grant for transporation-related community improvements. The community raised $1 million — twice its goal. Today the Danville Science Center shares its lobby with Amtrak. 
<p>The museum’s most recent addition is the West End riverfront home of former Ambassador and Mrs. Walter Rice. The striking building, designed by celebrated 20th-century architect Richard Neutra, is located 100 feet directly above the James River near 11 acres of flood plain. The property includes the 5-mile lock of the James River and Kanawha Canal. The  riverside location presents study opportunities for natural history and archeology. 
<p>The museum’s 1996-97 operating budget is $5.8 million operating and $3 million for facilities improvements. Of this, about 16 percent is earned from admissions. The state contributes 43 percent, and 28 percent comes from private and corporate gifts or grants. The remaining 13 percent comes from museum sales and admissions to other museum programs.
<p>Brenda Baker, science specialist for secondary education for Henrico County schools, says the museum plays an intregal role in the area’s overall science education. Last year, for instance, more than 1,100 Henrico students participated in a satellite hookup with explorers conducting an underwater expedition in the Florida Keys. This year, students will participate in museum-sponsored hookups with Iceland and Yellowstone National Park.
<p>Museum Director Walter Witschey says that during the quarter century since May 1971, when the museum presented its first programs, the institution has become one of the nation’s top 20 science centers. Current exhibits explore the physical sciences: astronomy, botany, oceanography, chemistry and physics. The next wave of exhibits, Witschey says, will emphasize the life sciences. Three new life sciences projects are in development and will explore: health and human biology, genetics and molecular biology and environmental biology. The latter will emphasize Virginia aquatics and the ecosystems of the James River and the Tidewater, Piedmont and mountain regions. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br>Built in 1914, the former train station that now serves as the flagship of the Science Museum of Virginia was the only commercial building designed by architect John Russell Pope. The resemblance of the low-domed building to other Pope landmarks such as the National Gallery of Art and the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C. is easy to see from Broad street. In Richmond, Pope also designed the Tudor-style Branch House in the 2500 block of Monument Avenue. A $4.5 million renovation, which restored the train sheds, the lower concourse and landscaping, has recently been completed. The museum is beginning a $10.3 million renovation that will include the east and west wings.

<br><font size=4 color=#336600><tt><b>Russian immigrants encounter the strife that sometimes comes with freedom of religion.
<br><i>by Carolyn McCulley</i></b></tt></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<tt><font size=6 color=#663300><b>L</b></font></tt>eo Vaynberg grew up in Ukraine and moved to Moscow as an adult. For his entire life in the former Soviet Union, his name and his identification papers reflected his Jewish heritage. But Vaynberg had never set foot in a synagogue, even after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and official state atheism was dismantled, granting a measure of freedom of religion.  
<p>“I didn’t attend services, I didn’t even think about it. I knew I was Jewish, but my nationality caused a lot of problems for me. I knew people who were practicing Judaism, but I tried to avoid contact with them,” says Vaynberg, 37.  
<p>When he arrived in Richmond with his family in January 1994 with the help of the Resettlement Program of Jewish Family Services, one of the first things he did was go to a service at an Orthodox synagogue, Kol Emes.
<p>“I didn’t understand everything, but I was trying to find out,” Vaynberg says. “But if you don’t understand Hebrew or you don’t know what it’s all about, you watch it as a spectator. I think it would be better to be on the stage. But that means you have to know the role.”
<p>Nearly three years later, Vaynberg is still a spectator, observing religious life from his own questioning perspective. Nevertheless, he has had a role in Richmond’s religious drama from the moment he immigrated here. Jewish by cultural identification but not by religious practice, he and 500 other Russian Jewish immigrants in Richmond are players in a late-20th century experiment in freedom of religion.  
<p>Most have arrived here under the auspices of the Resettlement Program of Jewish Family Services, which is supported by many Jewish organizations and the area’s traditional synagogues. Many of these new immigrants have found themselves sitting on a fault line within the Jewish community as two groups reach out to help them: traditional Jewish organizations and a “messianic” (believers in Jesus) Jewish congregation, Tikvat Israel. 
<p>While the drama has played out quietly in Richmond, the heart of the conflict could hardly be more provocative: In addition to freedom of religion, at issue is nothing less than the definition of one of the world’s oldest religions and  the survival of one of the world’s most persecuted peoples. 
<p>Both groups help Russian Jewish immigrants resettle here, learn English and find jobs and housing. But the traditional Jewish community says Tikvat is not Jewish at all and is undermining their efforts to help refugee Jews learn their religious heritage, while Tikvat Israel, the messianic congregation, believes they have the freedom to offer such services and the right to share their beliefs.  
<p>Tikvat Israel is not an unusual congregation. There are more than 270 messianic congregations in the United States. Even though the label of “messianic Jews” is an affront to the traditional community, which does not consider those congregations Jewish, it is the identifying term chosen by those congregations and more than 400 other messianic groups nationally. Nor is it an issue confined to the United States. Jews for Jesus is the largest messianic organization, with 155 staff members, an annual budget of $13 million and offices in nine U.S. cities and eight other nations, including Israel. 
<p>At the heart of this division is a Palestinian Jew who lived a controversial life 2,000 years ago and who continues to stir controversy today: Jesus of Nazareth. Belief in the divinity of Jesus, as the one who came as the long-awaited Messiah of the Jewish Scriptures (Christ is the Greek word for Messiah), is the most significant dividing point between the Jewish and Christian faiths.  
<p>The messianic Jewish community exists in that gray area between the two faiths by believing that one can be both a Jew and a believer in Yeshua (Hebrew for Jesus). Like their Christian counterparts, messianic congregations evangelize or share their beliefs with others — a tenet essential to their faith, but one which is repugnant to the traditional Jewish belief. When both groups exercise their freedom of religion, there is inevitably a culture clash. 

<br><center><font size=7 color=#fff9999 face="Palace Script MT, Times">~</font></center>

<p>“This issue is certainly complicated and sensitive. In terms of freedom of religion, this country has a great history of tolerance. They [messianic Jews] certainly have a right to profess their religious beliefs,”  says Tommy Baer, president of the Jewish advocacy organization B’nai B’rith International and a Richmond attorney. “But if a tenet of their religious belief is to attempt to convert others to adopt that particular faith, then the issue to me is where the line is drawn with regard to discussion, invitation and interference. And when you go over that line — when it becomes imposition — that’s where you infringe upon the rights of others to practice their religion as they deem fit. Jews accept Jesus as a teacher, and certainly a great teacher, but not as the Messiah. The Jewish community takes the position I do: These immigrants are Jews and you can’t be part of this [messianic] group and remain Jewish. It can’t be done.”
<p>This is not just an academic problem of theology to the Jewish community, though theology must be examined to understand the tension and passions involved. In Judaism, the practice of any other faith is a form of “idolatry” — a concept which isn’t necessarily limited to the worship of statues or idols, but includes the worship of anything other than the one true God of the Hebrew Scriptures. The theological risk is to be separated from the presence of God eternally and to be outside of the community of faith in this life.  
<p>But there is another risk, both practical and profound. Historically, the preservation of the Jewish faith has been inextricably linked with the preservation of the Jewish people. From nation to nation and era to era, Jews have endured persecution and bigotry that has sought to wipe them out as a religion and an ethnic group. Given this history of persecution, strident opposition to anything that threatens to erode the Jewish faith is understandable.   
<p>In this nation and in this generation, however, some Jewish leaders concede that secularism, intermarriage and ignorance of Jewish beliefs pose greater threats to the survival of the faith.
<p>“We’ve raised a generation of Jews who are Jewishly ignorant. What is it that makes a person Jewish? Is it the bagels and lox? No, it’s the faith system,” says Mark Powers, national director of  the Baltimore-based Jews for Judaism and a self-described Jewish missionary.
<p>To messianic Jews, though, belief in the divinity of Jesus as the Messiah does not preclude being Jewish, nor does it necessarily make one Christian. These groups point out that Jesus, his disciples and the writers of the New Testament all were Jewish. 
<p>“The whole thrust of Messianic Judaism is to restore the roots of the faith as a belief in Jesus as a Jewish Messiah. The Jewish community will believe it’s a contradiction in terms, but it’s not. It’s simply a restoration to the original intention of Jesus’ coming — to be a Jewish Messiah and restore the Jewish community to its original calling as a ‘priestly nation’ among the nations. We see our mission as primarily two things: To help Jews understand Jesus as the Messiah and to help the Christian Church understand its Jewish roots,” says Rabbi Jamie Cowen, Tikvat Israel rabbi and an officer of the national Union of Messianic Jewish Congregations.
<p>Enter the Russian immigrants, blank slates theologically. It’s bad enough, Jewish leaders say, when Christian groups like the Southern Baptist Convention announce their intent to evangelize Jewish groups, but it’s intolerable when they perceive their own religion being co-opted.
<p>“Traditionally, Jewish people have had to pack up and leave wherever they have been. That’s part of our history. In this country, Jews have been targets of assimilationists for decades. We are in a threatened position with regard to the efforts at proselytizing. But Judaism just does not proselytize. It’s a ground rule. We’re not changing other people and we don’t want to be changed, either,” says Miriam Davidow, director of community services for the Jewish Community Federation, an umbrella group that raises funds to provide educational and social services for the Jewish community. 
<p>“The Jewish community sees this issue as Jews from the former Soviet Union who have been persecuted for decades now coming to this country not as yet having had the opportunity to become familiar with and acculturated in the Jewish faith says Rabbi Leivy Smolar of the Or Ami congregation, “and once again being pressured or bribed or given all kinds of assistance from that [messianic] community not for the sake of helping people, but for the sake of turning them to another faith. And that’s not what America is all about. 
<p>“I don’t believe they are interested in helping Jewish people as the Jewish community does. They should help people who need help and leave their spiritual welfare to the community who anguished over them and labored so long to get them here,” says Smolar, who also is chairman of the Richmond Rabbinical Council. “I don’t know why Tikvat Israel finds it necessary to snatch souls of new immigrants who are not yet fully knowing of their faith. Maybe it’s a weakness in the faith of the leadership of Tikvat that compels them to go to immigrants who are not strong.”
<p>When asked if he has ever tried to discuss the issue with Tikvat’s leadership, Rabbi Smolar was adamant: “I wouldn’t go near them. They are inauthentic people — not as human beings, but in their leadership.”
<p>He, like Tommy Baer, feels Tikvat has crossed the line into interference and imposition. Neither man, however, names a specific charge when asked. 
<p>“I couldn’t comment on that without having the facts. I couldn’t comment on the Richmond (messianic) group because I don’t know what they’re doing,” Baer says. 
<p>In Richmond, the controversy is largely centered on Tikvat’s two programs for the Russian Jews — Russian Immigration Services and the Russian Cultural Center. Both  programs were created after Tikvat hosted a bagel brunch for the Russian community in February 1994. Cowen, a lawyer whose practice is now limited to immigration law, says the congregation works with about 300 individuals, many of whom immigrated here under the auspices of the Resettlement Program of Jewish Family Services. Of that number, he estimates only about 50 are in any way affiliated with the 200-member congregation as a matter of religious worship.
<p>“The rabbinic Judaic community is unalterably opposed to us,” Cowen acknowledges. “But the other side of the question is, what is it we do to other people? We don’t do anything different than they do. They serve the Russian Jews and explain their version of Judaism to them, too. We’re going to share the love of God — if they are needy people, we are going to help them, no matter what.”
<p>Both programs offer practical help such as English language training and a furniture warehouse, and Russian families often take advantage of both services, he says, because Tikvat’s program is open-ended.  
<p>“What happens is that Jewish Family Services targets basically four months for service and then they really aim to ease out of the relationship — and there’s good reason to do that to encourage self-sufficiency. But we wouldn’t be in existence if there wasn’t the need,” he says.
<p>On a recent Thursday morning, about 30 Russian immigrants gathered in the basement of the turn-of-the-century synagogue at the corner of Grove and Boulevard to use the resources of the Russian Cultural Center at Tikvat Israel and its weekly food bank. One elderly woman paused in front of the television set broadcasting Russian TV, but she did not sit down in the collection of recliners to watch. Coffee, doughnuts and pastry sat on a card table, near the collection of international flags, facing the job notices posted on the opposite wall. Women of all ages, and a handful of older men, selected items from the food bank and checked out the resources of the Russian-language library. 
<p>The librarian, Maya Dynova, proudly presented the 1,000-book collection, noting the novels, medical guides, historical essays, business texts and other Russian-language books, neatly catalogued by subject group. A Russian typewriter sat on the library’s only table.  
<p>Dynova, 43, is a librarian by training and works part-time for Tikvat Israel. She emigrated from the Ukraine to Richmond three years ago with her family.  
<p>“This is the first Russian-language library in Richmond — it opened May 5. This is my dream, to organize a Russian library,” she says proudly.
<p>Across town at the Patterson Avenue-based offices of the Resettlement Program, director Joanne Marcus coordinates the efforts of the volunteers from Richmond’s six traditional synagogues who work with the approximate 120 refugees who arrive each year in Richmond. This program offers intensive counseling, acculturation programming and job orientation, as well as services such as a furniture warehouse and English-language tutoring. Ready-to-work Russian job applicants and myriad volunteer needs are advertised to the Jewish community in the Reflector, the semimonthly publication published by the Jewish Community Center.
<p>“For refugees, their initial level of needs is very basic — they are focusing on survival. On the plus side, they have each other — it’s a very close community. They also have a supportive group within a wider Jewish community which does reach out to them,” Marcus says. “After four or five years, they begin to live the American dream.”  
<p>The volunteers occasionally include the settled immigrants themselves. Vladimir Gurshpun, 18, immigrated here a year ago with his parents and 25-year-old sister. His father, Yakov, is an electrician. His mother, Polina, works in a sewing factory. He is studyingEnglish at Virginia Commonwealth University, and plans to major in computer science.  
<p>“[The Resettlement Program] was really helpful. They helped us with furniture, took us to doctor’s appointments, etc. Now we help them, we volunteer with them,” Gurshpun says, describing how the family meets newcomers at the airport and helps them get settled in Richmond. He admits he visited Tikvat’s Russian Cultural Center “a couple of times,” but wouldn’t go back.
<p>“These people, they are Jews for Jesus. It doesn’t sound right. I don’t like it,” he says.
<p>Anna Gershkovich, 30, is one of the immigrants who uses the services of both groups. After applying six years ago to leave her native St. Petersburg, she arrived here April 18 with her husband, Roman, and daughter, Maria, 5. She came here under the auspices of Jewish Family Services, but she socializes with the Tikvat congregants. A professional translator, she uses a computer loaned to her by Tikvat to work from her home. Roman is Jewish, she is Russian Orthodox, but the family practices no particular religion.  
<p>“Of course we know this problem exists, but we are more concerned with issues of basic survival,” she says. “From my point of view, the feeling of God is inside each person. For our family, we are not getting involved in this problem. We like the people at Tikvat. People should respect the beliefs of each other and the right to exist.”
<p>Because of their history, the Russian immigrants are often described as being “vulnerable” by the traditional Jewish community, which worries that the immigrants haven’t had the opportunity to learn what Judaism is before they encounter groups outside of the faith. Cowen does not share this view, emphasizing that the Russian immigrants are generally a highly educated group who are only hampered by language skills; Vaynberg, Gershkovich and Gurshpun heartily agree with his assessment.  
<p>Leo Vaynberg occasionally attends services at a variety of synagogues, including Tikvat. Vaynberg is an engineer with two master’s degrees and a new home in the far West End of Richmond. A thoughtful and gregarious man, he says he has no option but to “be Jewish,” but he thinks most Russian immigrants, accustomed to atheism, will never be true believers of any religion.  
<p>“The Russian soul is hard material. It’s hard for us to believe in something supernatural, it’s unbelievably difficult. Our previous life without God makes knowing him almost impossible for me and other Russians,” he says. 
<p>“[When I came here] I was prepared to meet ‘capitalistic sharks’ — people who were interested in my wallet, not my soul. ... Yes, [Tikvat] would like us to follow God the same way they do; however, they have never been insistent to propagandize their faith,” he says. 
<p>The issue is not likely to abate. In mid-October, the Jewish Community Federation hosted a series of meetings here with Jewish missionary Mark Powers. Powers consults with  many Jewish organizations throughout the country, calling his organization North America’s only full-time Jewish counter-missionary and counter-cult organization. According to Powers, about $150 million is spent annually to convert Jewish people to other faiths. The money is spent by groups such as Jews for Jesus, Chosen People Ministries, and Christian denominations such as the Assemblies of God and the Southern Baptists.  
<p>“The simple fact is that Judaism is not Christianity and Christianity is not Judaism. It’s not just a question of who Jesus was or may have been. On all theological questions — sin, atonement, heaven, hell — Christianity and Judaism are at opposite ends of the spectrum. To say differently is at best disingenuous, and at worst, fraudulent. It’s provable that this movement was designed specifically as a marketing strategy to bring Jews into the [Christian] Church,” Powers says.
<p>Powers estimates that there are about 35 Southern Baptist-affiliated “Hebrew Christian” or messianic Jewish congregations nationally and about 48 such congregations sponsored by the Assemblies of God. Tikvat Israel is not affiliated with either. The seven-year-old congregation is independent; Cowen moved to Richmond from the Washington, D.C.-area more than six years ago to be the rabbi there.  
<p>Prior to attending the Messiah Biblical Institute in Gaithersburg, Md., Cowen was a chief counsel to a Senate subcommittee and a consultant. Right before his move to Richmond, he received three calls from the Bush administration asking him to head up three different federal agencies. Acknowledging he gave up a life of financial security, the father of three teenagers feels he made the better decision to obey what he felt God was telling him to do. While waiting in a doctor’s office for a Russian Jewish man he had driven there in his aging van, Cowen switches from his normally laid-back attitude to a greater intensity when asked about the charges made against his motives for reaching out to the Russian immigrants.
<p>“Our congregation truly loves these people and wants to show them the love of God by practically demonstrating this by meeting their needs. That some would say because we’re serving them, we’re manipulating them into believing [our views] is the highest form of cynicism,” he says. “Where I would draw the line in the sand is where the other groups make accusations, but they don’t know the truth. They’ve never contacted us, never been to our congregation.”  
<p>“Messianic Judaism is perceived as being a front for Christianity, which ultimately obliterates all traces of Jewishness. Historically, I’m in agreement with them. But messianic Judaism’s goal is to maintain our Jewish identity for now and into the future.
<p>“The Jewish community recognizes that the only way to get along is to build bridges. They think Jesus is fine for the Gentiles, but not for the Jews. My retort is, that’s nice — but Jesus didn’t come to the Gentiles, he came to the Jews. Personally, I believe a day will come when the bridge will be built,” Cowen says.
<p>Powers doesn’t share Cowen’s optimism. 
<p>“Regardless of our differences, be they political or whatever, the Jewish community is united on this issue: They are not Jews. They are Christians. There’s nothing wrong with being Christian, but it’s just not Jewish,” Powers says.
<p>The debate is not likely to end soon. In the first century A.D., the New Testament records the following story: Festus, a Roman governor, summed up the charges brought by Jewish leaders against another Jew, Paul of Tarsus, who believed in Jesus. “When his accusers got up to speak, they did not charge him with any of the crimes I had expected. Instead, they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named Jesus who Paul claimed was alive. I was at a loss to investigate such matters ...”
<p>Two millennia later, Russian Jews find themselves in a country where issues of faith cannot be resolved or dictated by governmental fiat — surely a source of wonder for many new immigrants. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

Dozens of the handsome black-and-white Holsteins lumber about the fields near the local county supervisor’s modest rancher. The pungent smell of cows-in-progress strips you of any sense of suburbia you might have brought with you. This is the far west end of Goochland County, a few miles from Hadensville and eons beyond Richmond’s westernmost tentacles.
<p>A small scripted sign on the roadside proclaims the rustic landscape “Pryorsville.” That’s presumable as most of the mail boxes have the name Pryor on them, and the road itself is Pryor Road. 
<br><img src="./images/feat43-2.jpg" align=right width=213 height=300>
<p>The last driveway is Andrew Pryor’s, the chairman of the Goochland County Board of Supervisors and an ardent preservationist of his county’s rural character.
<p>Some 35 miles back, change — in its many forms — is massing on the Henrico/Goochland line like an invading army whose numbers only get bigger the longer they are deterred. Rural-minded Goochlanders like the dairy farmer keep the faith, thwarting concentrated development any way they can.
<p>As in most country homes, Pryor’s back door is the way people come and go. Antique farm tools to clear, plow and plant the fields adorn the carport wall. The monotoned voice of a dispatcher on a police scanner inside competes with the diesel drone of a tall John Deere 4400 tractor idling by a barn. It’s 5 o’clock, and Pryor comes down from a shower to talk politics and progress after a warm day on the farm.
<p>“Motorola is definitely going to increase residential growth, industrial growth and commercial ... no doubt about it,” he says, settling into a chair on the louvered-glass porch. “West Creek can be the best thing that ever happened to Goochland or it could ruin it.”
<p>Born in a house not two miles away from where he lives now, Pryor states his message simply: “I like Goochland the way it is.”
<p>Forces that have a different perspective are challenging his philosophy more than ever before, he says. The life of Goochland County is growing more complex.

<p><center><font size=3 color=#cc9900 face="ZapfDingbats, Helvetica, Arial"><pre>:         :         :</pre></font></center>

<p>Located at the opposite end of the county against the Henrico County line, West Creek is a privately developed 3,500-acre commerce park and the magic kingdom for Motorola’s proposed semiconductor plant. If and when the $3 billion Motorola plant emerges, it will pay half the taxes Goochland collects and add some 5,000 people to the county’s daily work force, not to mention the thousands more jobs that are expected to follow in the techno-giant’s wake.
<p>“It’s the gold coast down there,” Pryor says with a grin. It’s also a massive commercial buffer against residential sprawl from Henrico County.
<p><img src="./images/feat43-3.jpg" align=right width=300 height=256>
Holding onto the rest of Goochland is Andrew Pryor’s mission, as long as he stays in office. Last election he had to put up campaign signs for the first time in 24 years; the competition was just that fierce. He even collected a few contributions. Mostly though, he just shook hands.
<p>When an area golf course owner called recently to ask if Pryor would consider decreasing the county’s housing density requirements from the 7-acre lot minimum (west of the court house), Pryor said, “Sure, in the other direction.” The man hung up.
<p>Pryor thinks 10 acres per lot has a nice ring to it. You get the idea.
<p>“There are some people who want to put 50 houses on 50 acres of land, but I’m not one of them,” Pryor says. “I firmly believe that the majority of the people in Goochland County want growth controlled as tightly as possible.”
<p>Large lot-size minimums prohibit the kind of cluster housing that characterizes Richmond’s outer suburbs, while rollback land-use taxes make the conversion of woods and pastures into housing lots too expensive for many developers. Property owners who keep land open pay lower taxes than those who develop the land.
<p>It’s a funny thing about people when they move to Goochland, Pryor says: They always want to shut the gate behind them. “I can tell you if we announced a 300-house subdivision anywhere in the county, the new people would be the loudest opponents,” he says.
<p>Lawrence Nuckols works in the second service bay at Centerville Exxon. Versed in far more than cars, he is a vocal proponent of growth on the Route 250 corridor of Goochland County. Beyond his job at the Exxon, which he used to own, he is also the frustrated owner of several hundred acres in the Centerville area.
<p>This is the next hamlet in the path of Richmond’s westward sprawl and the first place you get to in Goochland when you leave Henrico. The countryside here begs for business development, with I-64 passing nearby. Prospects approach Nuckols all the time, he says, but you can’t build an office building on a septic field.
<p>And the only water you can use is the kind that comes out of the ground.
<p><img src="./images/feat43-4.jpg" align=right width=300 height=242>
Nuckols is also handy with a compressed-air wrench, tightening a set of Honda lug nuts in seconds. “You can’t stop growth,” he says summarily, looking out over the open lots around the station. “It’s coming. It’s coming.”
<p>So far, Goochland has slowed development to a crawl on the two primary highways that run through it: Route 6 and Route 250. It’s no accident that both roads go scenic as they depart Henrico. It’s suddenly miles between gas stations and fast food is nowhere in sight.
<p>The Henrico/Goochland line is less than two miles east from Centerville Exxon. Just east of that border is the suburban epicenter that used to be rural Short Pump. Roads can’t be widened fast enough there.
<p>Goochland’s power structure is all too familiar with gonzo growth. Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield all have their traffic nightmares, their trailer classrooms and their brazen developer-driven politics.
<p>Now, every indication suggests Goochland’s east end — along Broad Street and Patterson Avenue — will someday go the way of west end Henrico.
<p>Given that prospect, Nuckols believes Goochland can control growth by inviting it in and managing its course.
<p>While county and state officials part the seas for Motorola’s proposed complex in the West Creek development, bringing 4 million gallons of water a day to the site,  Nuckols and like-minded landowners wait in a perpetual standoff with county fathers for water and sewer services to the Centerville area.
<p>Andrew Pryor says the county won’t pay for those things, and few people believe he would ever lay the groundwork for growth in Centerville, just on principle.
<p>Commerce is welcome here, if its address is in West Creek.
<p>Now 55, Nuckols has worked around Centerville since he was an eighth-grader. His political savvy is revered, stemming from his 20 years as a member of the county board of supervisors and now as a prospective developer.
<p>Goochland should seize growth before the pressure becomes too much to contain, Nuckols warns. “We can do it right, right now,” he says.
<p>Current county board member Rudy Butler, who represents the Centerville area, pulls into Nuckols’ lane in a minivan. He shares the mechanics’ view that no-growth politics won’t work. “You gotta have growth to pay the bills. It’s a control thing,” Butler says.
<p>Pryor, of course, sees things differently — allowing concentrated development would upset county politics, giving a small geographical area of newcomers undue influence over the rural people who have been there much longer. Who’s to run Goochland is at stake.
<p>Before Motorola, the biggest thing to hit Goochland County was either Thomas Jefferson, who was raised at Tuckahoe Plantation, or the late “Chris from Circuit City,” known thereafter as “The Champ” at Satterwhite’s Restaurant in Centerville after he ate five Mammoth Burgers in one sitting. (Plus three beers and two Pepsis.) Some would put that feat above Jefferson’s Louisiana Purchase on the individual- achievement scale, but you should see a Mammoth Burger and form your own opinion.
<p>Catherine Daniels was the waitress who served Chris from Circuit City and countless others in the past 16 years. To most, Satterwhite’s is a frontier point for countryside — beyond it lie fields and farms. When the glow of new gas stations, car lots and warehouse stores make this place bright at night, the eastern front will no longer be all quiet.
<p>“People are nice out here,” Daniels says, as daughter Shanelle quietly colors pictures at the counter after school. “Everybody likes to help everybody. I love it.”
<p><img src="./images/feat43-5.jpg" align=right width=300 height=230>
At Satterwhite’s or Goochland Restaurant or the Town & Country Market, the country feel of Goochland is all over you as soon as you walk in.
<p>Folks speak their mind and the gossip is rich.
<p>“I have no idea what no telephone number is on him,” a woman says at Goochland Restaurant, miffed that she actually has to call some scoundrel. “He had a hateful attitude on him, that’s what he’s got.”
<p>The man at her table changes the subject to a woman who married a prison inmate, if the truth be told.
<p>Julie Childress took over Satterwhite’s 17 years ago when it was a rougher-than-some beer joint. Locals gave her six months. “When they get water and sewer up here, you’re going to see a McDonald’s on that corner,” Childress says. Andrew Pryor is a hero to her.
<p>The graying frame structure across the street has “The Corner Store” in wide block lettering. Catherine Ellis, or Miss Catherine as she prefers, knew it as Ellis’ Store, her family’s longtime business as far back as 1922.
<p>“We didn’t have anything except muddy roads,” as the last store between Richmond and Charlottesville, she says. What’s become of Short Pump makes her sad. Twice a day she comes to Satterwhite’s and sits at the regulars’ table where the coffee and cigarettes help people pass the time in the natural light of the front window.
<p>It’s easy to forget that’s Broad Street out front.
<p>Goochland is unrivalled for the disparity in  its per-capita income extremes, County Administrator Gregory K. Wolfrey says. The wealth separating the richest from the poorest residents is vast. Of 5,000 households in the county, 800 are believed to shelter people living below the poverty line. Some 250 are thought to be without indoor plumbing, and a few dozen fall in the dirt floor/no electricity category. Initiatives to pursue grant money to improve the county’s housing stock are still fairly new.
<p>Affordable housing is a relatively new concern here.
<p><img src="./images/feat43-6.jpg" align=right width=300 height=249>
Conversely, wealthy Richmonders continue to relocate to the former farmlands of Goochland in developments like Sabot Hill Farm and The Meadows, where $500,000 houses are the norm.
<p>Freddie Reed, who was raised in the Sabot Hill mansion above the bluffs along Route 6, now steers the development of 61 parcels averaging 22 acres apiece. So far he’s sold 27, and the grand mansion is under contract to a West Cary Street Road resident, contingent on his being able to sell there first.
<p>Reed’s goal is to sell four of the former family parcels a year.
<p>An architectural review committee has to approve new construction on the land, because, Reed says, “We didn’t want the monstrosities. We think that a house, when it starts getting above 8,000 square feet is getting too big and would dominate the property.”
<p>Early arrivals at Sabot Hill include retired insurance executives, business leaders, builders, financiers and a heart surgeon.
<p>Near Sabot Hill, behind an impressive entrance that funnels several paved access lanes onto a smooth blacktopped roadway, the 1,200-acre Meadows project also represents Reed family land now being converted into an ultra-rural 140-home neighborhood for people wanting the horse-country feel. The price to build ranges from a low of $350,000 to $1 million or more.
<p>Reed sits on the county planning commission where growth management plans have been designed to handle whatever comes west. “We’re trying real hard to keep it rural,” he says. “We think we have a pretty good plan. We’re going to keep Route 6 from becoming Midlothian Turnpike and with good planning preserve River Road.
<p>“The hard part of it is that if you don’t provide a place for commercial enterprises to locate in a village, they will squish out like a tomato.”
<p>With 22 years of local subdivision development to look back on, Bryce Powell says Goochland “is in a good position to look around and see what others have done wrong and learn from their mistakes.”
<p>Powell is working on The Meadows, as well as 300-acre Randolph Square’s 150 houses ($350,000 on up) on the Henrico County edge. “The pervasive view is that residents really don’t care to see residential development, so I think it’s going to be interesting to watch because you’ve got some conflicting forces,” Powell says.
<p>High-end building is clearly the hot trend in Goochland development now, and few homes can rival Bill and Edith Massey’s River Run Manor on Route 6, just east of Maidens. Style was welcome to tour the place, which lords over the James River, but Massey, who is retired from A.T. Massey Coal Co. Inc., explained that photos and publicity bring too many strange cars up the driveway for his liking. The last time the 1982-built house was open for tours, he says, a professional fall artist threw herself down, sued him and forced a settlement with his insurance company.
<p>If you want a good look, take a boat down the river.
<p>“It’s booming in Goochland,” Massey says. “It’s beginning to really roll. Multimillion-dollar homes are getting to be a dime-a-dozen out there. They’re kinda hidden back in the woods but there’s all kind of stuff going on.” The land Massey bought for River Run Manor cost him $5,000 an acre, when the seller had only paid $600 an acre just two years before. Now the land is assessed at $30,000 an acre, “which is wild,” Massey says.
<p>(The Virginia Department of Corrections has its own big houses on the river. It operates men’s and women’s prisons near the James, as well as a work center for trusted inmates and a very productive dairy.)
<p>Bill DeRusha, the CEO of Heilig-Meyers furniture company, is not only a resident of Oilville on the Route 250 corridor, but he is also a future corporate citizen. In 1997, 500 Heilig-Meyers headquarters personnel will relocate to offices in West Creek — across the street from Motorola’s campus.
<p>“That’s going to be booming out there,” he says. Access, for now and the immediate future, is excellent to Goochland, he says.
<p>“I think if the powers in the county are as forceful as I think they can be, I don’t think [Goochland’s] going to change a whole lot,” he predicts.
<p>Each fall, DeRusha hosts the Commonwealth Cup polo matches in his front yard. A county resident for only three years, DeRusha has earned the reputation as a new breed of county booster.
<p>He joins a very small cast of old-line corporate citizens including Luck Stone, headquartered on Route 6 above its Boscobel granite quarry, which the family company bought in 1930. In 1968, the company moved its offices from Richmond to Manakin.
<p>With its arrival in West Creek, Heilig-Meyers will have as many employees in Goochland as Luck Stone has in the entire state.
<p>Charles S. Luck IV, 35, is president of Luck Stone.
<p>“I’ve tried to imagine what this place is going to be like when I’m 50,” he says. West Creek companies and the ancillary development outside the park that are expected to bring thousands more jobs to eastern Goochland will raise the quality of life for county people, he predicts. Public schools will benefit from the taxes, and jobs will be available here where in the past residents often had to travel to the city to get work.
<p>In a recent company reorganization, Luck Stone formed Luck Properties to maximize the potential of company holdings, including large tracts in Goochland.

<p>As a Friday evening’s fog cottons up against the trees around Goochland High School, a scene out of “Leave It to Beaver” unfolds — it’s homecoming. Crew-cut kids run around the edges of the field tossing footballs as their parents load into the bleachers to see the game against Cumberland.
<p>Everything, from the doe-eyed cheerleaders to the bustling concession stand, is strangely familar — Americana under the stadium lights. The homecoming king is, naturally, the quarterback. His dad is the head coach.
<p><p>The nattily dressed man with the scarf tucked like an ascot into his blazer is Superintendent of Schools Warren Stewart, a 50-year-old transplant from the state Department of Education and a shameless promoter of his oft-knocked school system. His last residence was in the  West End of Richmond on St. Christopher’s Road.
<p>He says Goochland schools get a bad rap.
<p>“We are the most extensive structural-technological system in the state of Virginia, K-12, no doubt about it,” he says. “There’s some [good] stuff here.”
<p>In any tour of Goochland Schools, or a recent browse of the newspapers, Stewart’s computers-or-bust initiative gets top billing. Three years ago, Stewart says, the high school library was embarrassing. Now PC stations there open the unlimited library of the Internet to students. In a geometry class, students do their work on-screen and file with the teacher electronically. If there is a computer application, Goochland’s schools use it.
<p>The last time the sheriff’s department brought drug dogs through the middle school and the high school, no drugs were found. (There’s been one murder in Goochland in the last five years.)
<p>The day after a recent newspaper article featured a county schools program, Stewart had the office copier cranking it out for immediate distribution. “You either like me or you don’t,” he says.
<p><img src="./images/feat43-7.jpg" align=right width=300 height=230>
“Goochland is the fourth wealthiest county in the state, did you know that? Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Goochland. Take 100 kids, 20 percent of the kids in Goochland go to private school. Three percent are home-schooled, for whatever reason. Initially, it was religion. Now I don’t know what it is — it’s kinda growing. It’s like a cancer out there. Take our test scores and you lop off 23 percent, what you’ve got is a bunch of kids that would probably score high but you don’t get to average them in,” he says. “Twenty-two percent, the second highest [in the state], of our kids are special ed — they’re not going to shine.”
<p>The demographics are an educational anomaly, he says.
<p>So Goochland’s standardized test scores, which cluster around the 50th percentile, Stewart notes, are still better than the national average in some cases. “You’re giving me a 5-foot-tall center, and I still gotta win [basketball] games.”
<p>Stewart’s wish list includes pay raises for teachers who lag behind Henrico’s in salary upgrades, a new high school-middle school complex and new transportation — and the only way he will get those is through the board of supervisors, which cringes at a tax hike for anything.
<p>“Thirty percent of the people have kids in school, 70 percent don’t. Of those 70 percent that have the wealth out here, did they come to Goochland to build their multimillion dwelling so they could pay taxes on it? No. It gets real incestuous here,” Stewart says.
<p><img src="./images/feat43-8.jpg" align=right width=300 height=230>
Back at Centerville Exxon, supervisor Rudy Butler isn’t so high on Goochland Schools’ technology. He says he prefers a program in Charlotte County where students make computers and sell them. Clearly, Butler leans toward stressing vocational training — “We don’t need to worry so much about the ones going to college because they’ll take care of themselves.”
<p>Old meets new every day in Goochland County and it’s hard to say which will prevail. Even though Stewart has a three-year contract, he chooses to rent a house in the eastern end.
<p>As the football game winds down, with Goochland leading handily, a family inside a Jaguar sedan summons a police officer to help clear the parking lot. A number of pickup trucks have him blocked in.
<p>What an unusual scene. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<p>Today, as most days, Anderson spent $10 on the game. 
<p>Ever won? 
<p>“Once I won $100,” the part-time pipefitter replies. “That was last year. Never won the big one, though. Someday, though — man! I’ll win it big. Somebody’s got to, you know. Might as well be me. Can’t win if you don’t play, you know what I’m saying? ... I’ll buy myself a new car, quit my job. Maybe buy my momma a house. 
<p>“Even if that don’t happen, I’ll still be dreaming,” Anderson says. “It gives me something to dream about.” 
<p>For the people behind the lottery, however, the pursuit of lottery dollars begins long before Anderson’s and takes far more work. Their dreams are as big as Anderson’s, though less glamorous. 
<p>In some ways, they — like all Virginians — depend on the dreams of millions of people like Anderson.
<p>Without those dreams of the lottery, Virginia would be a very different place. Its taxes would be higher, or its services dramatically curtailed. 
<p>And, obviously, it would have one fewer government agency. For in a 13-floor group of offices in downtown Richmond, and in seven regional offices around the state, a cadre of about 200 men and women work very hard to keep Anderson’s dreams — and his money — flowing.
<p>Every aspect of this most unusual arm of state government is geared to drawing attention to its products, from marketing research to ticket design to public relations. 
<p>Although the General Assembly ordered $7 million in advertising cuts in the next two years, the Virginia Lottery still retains a huge ad budget. 
<p>The most recent contract, divided between Virginia firms Arnold Finnegan Martin, and Siddall Matus & Coughter, totals $17 million, dwarfing the national ad budgets of many major companies. 
<p>Its advertisements flood the state’s airwaves; its posters and billboards are ubiquitous. When the lottery’s Lady Luck character tours Virginia every two years, crowds routinely mob her. 
<p>“We work very hard to maintain the level of sales,” says Deborah Sawyer, a manager of market research and development for the lottery. “If we didn’t work very hard at it the sales would fall.” 
<p>No one involved in the lottery wants that to happen. In eight short years, the lottery has become as vital to Virginia government as the more obvious taxes on personal income, sales and corporations. 
<p>Somehow, the state’s government has turned its citizens’ dreams of instant wealth into the nuts and bolts of funding Virginia’s government. 
<p>Since its creation, Virginia lottery sales have totaled $6.1 billion. To understand how big that figure is, picture a line of $100 bills laid end to end, stretching 6,000 miles — more than twice the distance from Richmond to Los Angeles. 
<p>The lottery has also paid out $3.2 billion in prizes, paid $322 million to retailers selling the tickets, and — perhaps most importantly — added $2.1 billion to the state coffers. 
<p>In the most recent fiscal year, the lottery sold $924 million in tickets — that’s $140 spent on the lottery for each of the 6.6 million men, women and children in the state. Every year, the lottery grosses more than do the farmers of the state’s seven biggest crops combined — from tobacco to tomatoes. 
<p>From that income, the state gained $332 million for its general fund — more than the state’s general fund allocations to Virginia Commonwealth University, the College of William & Mary and James Madison University combined. 
<p>And the lottery still isn’t through. Says Penelope Kyle, the lottery’s director: “We want to do a billion dollars [in sales] next year alone. ... With some new initiatives and with some really careful work, we might be able to hit that billion mark this year.” 
<p>The annual cash influx makes the lottery the fourth-largest source of state revenue, behind taxes on income, sales and corporations. In years of recession, the lottery climbs into the third-place slot. 
<p>Each year, the state General Assembly tells the lottery how much money it needs to raise. 
<p>“We’re in a no-new-tax posture, rightly or wrongly. Most would say rightly,” says state Del. Jay DeBoer of Petersburg, who serves on the House’s finance committee and nine years ago helped craft the state law creating the lottery. 
<p>If the lottery didn’t exist, DeBoer continues, “We’d have two choices: We raise taxes, or we cut programs. ... People may hate the lottery. It’s a convenient whipping boy. But we’d be in tough shape without it.”
<p>Next year marks the 10th anniversary of the year Virginians voted their lottery into existence. 
<p>Now, less than a decade after it was introduced, says Bill Kincaid, an anti-gambling lobbyist, “Virginia is addicted to the lottery.”

<p>Virginia certainly isn’t alone in turning to state-sponsored gambling to raise money. 
<p>More and more, states are relying on lottery profits. By last year, 37 states had lotteries, raking in $32.1 billion in sales, up from $2.9 billion 15 years ago, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, based in Cleveland. 
<p>Lotteries in Virginia go back to its earliest days. In 1776, for example, the Continental Congress authorized a lottery to cover costs of the Revolution. Lotteries also helped pay for Virginia’s roads, churches and universities, including William and Mary. 
<p>But those lotteries differed from today’s in one crucial way: They were designed to pay for a single project. Indeed, they were more similar to raffles than to the modern-day cash machine the lottery has become. 
<p>The first state lottery in the modern era began in New Hampshire in 1964. Over the next decade, nine other states, primarily in the Northeast, added their versions. 
<p>In the mid-’80s the South, which had eschewed gambling, joined the boom — first came West Virginia, in 1986. Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, Texas and Kentucky soon followed. 
<p>Virginia added its name to the roster in 1987, when 57 percent of the voters said they wanted gambling, though the state’s governor and attorney general said they opposed it. The state’s first game played in 1988. 
<p>Originally, then-Gov. Gerald Baliles asked that money raised in the lottery be used for specific construction projects, thus ensuring that the state not become reliant on the unpredictable income generated by gambling. If the money didn’t come in, Baliles reasoned, the proposed projects could be postponed. 
<p>That plan, however, soon was dropped in the administration of Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who faced a massive state revenue shortfall when he took office after Baliles. 
<p>The shortage, a full 15 percent of the total budget, encouraged Wilder to seize lottery income and apply it to the state’s general fund. The General Assembly approved the policy change, which hasn’t changed. 
<p>Some say that though Wilder’s fund-shifting stemmed the hemorrhage, it changed the way the state viewed the lottery. After Wilder, the flow of money from gambling became vital. 
<p>Was that a good idea? 
<p>“Absolutely,” says Paul Timmreck, secretary of finance under Wilder. “It may have been regrettable — but when you are facing a $2.2 billion shortfall ... I wish it hadn’t happened, but I think it was a good decision. 
<p>“We’re not addicted to the lottery,” Timmreck adds. “We can quit anytime we want.” 
<p>Not at all, says former anti-lottery advocate Robert Ukrop, chief operating officer of Ukrop’s Super Markets. Ukrop’s stores don’t sell lottery tickets. 
<p>“The government has become tremendously dependent on the lottery,” Ukrop says. “If they need more money, I would rather pay taxes in the more traditional way. 
<p>“The idea of depending on luck runs counter to the work ethic that I believe in,” Ukrop adds. “You work hard and the fruits of your labors come from that. Don’t expect games of chance to change your life.” 
<p>Despite the concerns of anti-lottery advocates, the lottery’s studies say that lottery players reflect Virginia’s overall population — the poor don’t buy a disproportionate number of tickets.
<p>In a reversal of its previous policy, in its most recent session the state legislature voted to stop counting on lottery income to bolster the general fund and to begin “earmarking” lottery profits for use in education. 
<p>Some anti-gambling advocates say, however, that’s not enough. Kincaid, the anti-gambling lobbyist, suggests that the money won’t be used to fund education; it will still be lost in the general fund. “It’s just a feel-good bill,” he says. “It won’t change anything at all.” 
<p>More broadly, gambling foes say the billions spent on the lottery could be better spent on — well, just about anything else. 
<p>Because lottery money first goes to the state and then is parceled out to a relatively small number of winners and retailers, the cash doesn’t do as much as it would if it were put into savings accounts or spent on goods, says Kincaid. 
<p>By abolishing the lottery and pumping almost $1 billion a year back into Virginia’s economy, Kincaid suggests, the state’s industries, services and retailers would have more money to spend or save. 
<p>That shot of capital could lead to even more taxes for the state than it currently raises through the lottery — and without the lottery’s troublesome moral questions, he adds. 
<p>Views like that are decidedly in the minority; 73 percent of Virginians have played the lottery at least once, according to a survey conducted this year for the lottery. The same percentage said they approved of the lottery, the survey said. 
<p>Another sign of its popularity: Spending on lottery games has more than doubled since the lottery was introduced, from first-year sales of $409 million to last year’s record $924 million. 
<p>Now Virginia is looking to increase its take — or at least keep it the same.

<p>Recently Virginia joined with five other states in The Big Game, a multistate lottery promising bigger jackpots to compete with Powerball, a 21-state lottery consortium. 
<p>And a General Assembly committee is examining other games such as keno, a fast-moving video bingolike game so compelling that some players call it “Lotto Crack.” In New York, keno plays every five minutes. 
<p>For now, though, the Virginia Lottery’s emphasis is on fine-tuning the games it has. One consistent goal is to make the scratch games appealing to as many people as possible. Sales of the little cards bring in about a third of the lottery’s overall revenue. 
<p>Every aspect of the scratch tickets is examined to ensure that they are as seductive as possible — the colors (dark colors don’t do as well as bright colors that “pop” from the displays); typography; illustrations; “iconography” or symbols used on the card; the way the game plays. 
<p>“We try to make the play experience as appealing as possible,” explains Jim Nulph, an affable, bearded man who only recently lopped off his ponytail. Until September, he was the Virginia Lottery’s director of marketing, and the man many credit with making the state lottery so successful. He now works for Scientific Games, a manufacturer of lottery tickets. 
<p>The word “cash,” for example, proved more popular in surveys than “money,” Nulph says. Should a game spell out “One Million,” or use numbers? Do games featuring fishing iconography draw players? (The answer, according to the dismal sales of a 1990 game, is no.) 
<p>A few rules are universal: Players like games that remind them of the money they could win; they like games that seem original yet familiar; and they prefer games that appear simple to play. And they like gambling — or in the careful parlance of the lottery industry, “gaming.”
<p>Notes Sawyer: “Some of the most popular games are gaming-theme games” that remind players of gambling. “You know, slots, card games and so on.” 
<p>One of the state’s biggest scratch games, in fact, is its blackjack-themed card, Nulph says. That game has been reissued five times. 
<p>Ideas for scratch games come from everywhere. Nulph keeps a library of loose-leaf notebooks filled with other states’ games, sorted by category. Ticket printing companies — Virginia uses two, Dittler Brothers in Georgia, and Pollard Banknote in Canada — often proffer ideas. 
<p>Sometimes, though, the best concepts come from the lottery’s 13-floor offices at 900 E. Main St. 
<p>One idea already has attained a sort of legendary status in the Virginia lottery business. 
<p>About eight months ago, at 6:30 on the morning of a round-table discussion of new ticket ideas, John Paul Candler realized he had a problem. He hadn’t come up with an idea to discuss. So Candler sat down with a pad and pen and began to doodle.
<p>“Cowboys and Indians popped into my head, a game I used to play as a kid,” recalls Candler, a fresh-faced advertising manager for the Virginia Lottery. “I turned that kind of into a Western theme — you catch the bad guy.” 
<p>That sort of childhood image made sense to Candler, who describes his job thus: “I see us as selling daydream material. We’re supplying daydreams, which I think is fun.” 
<p>Quickly, Candler scribbled pictures of a handful of “bad guys” — including a caricature of Nulph and one of David Howard, the lottery’s marketing manager. 
<p>The idea — and the drawings — caught on with lottery officials and tested well with consumers. With few of the adjustments typical for game designs, Candler’s last-minute idea became “$10,000 Cash Reward,” one of the lottery’s biggest hits of the season. 
<p>Candler’s original doodles ended up on the final card — with two exceptions. His drawing of Nulph didn’t appeal to many. It was dropped.
<p>And though his shifty-eyed caricature of “Dastardly Dave” Howard made it to the focus groups, it ran into an obstacle. 
<p>As Howard says with dry good humor, “I was promptly identified by the people [in the focus groups] as a pedophile.” 
<p>“Dastardly Dave” was dropped, too.

<p>They wander up the stairs of the West Broad Street offices of the Southeastern Institute of Research. The nine women gather in a smallish room, perhaps 15 feet by 20, mill about for a moment and then sit around the table that dominates the room. 
<p>Another woman joins them. She works for the Virginia Lottery, she tells the women. They have been invited here because they told a telephone surveyor that they are “frequent” players — they play the lottery at least once every two weeks. 
<p>Six women are African-American; three are white. They say they play the lottery often — one woman plays 20 times a week. Their job tonight is to examine a dozen proposed lottery scratch-off games and to say what they think of them. 
<p>A mirror dominates one wall. It’s actually a one-way window, and behind it a handful of lottery professionals sit in a darkened room well-appointed with bowls of Hershey’s Kisses and pretzels. They’re here to listen to the women’s ideas and perceptions. When the women finish, in about 90 minutes, a group of men will be questioned. 
<p>Researchers segregate the groups because mixing men and women often leads to distortions in opinion, lottery officials explain — the women sometimes defer to the men, and some men tend to grandstand to impress the women. 
<p>The watchers hidden behind the glass — about 10 men and women — work for the state lottery or for companies that make lottery tickets for the state. They munch pizza and Dove ice-cream bars as they take notes. 
<p>For eight years, since the lottery first began in Virginia, these focus groups have convened four times a year. Now, however, the lottery has changed its game plan, says market researcher Sawyer, and has begun issuing 24 new scratch-off cards a year — double the previous rate, and four times the lottery’s original rate. To keep up, the focus groups will gather every month. 
<p>The state’s shift in strategy is required, Sawyer says, because the lottery is fighting to keep sales high. Lotteries in other states have seen their sales dip in recent years, and Virginia plans to keep lottery money rolling in. 
<p>One by one, the women examine proposed designs for scratch-off games, give their first impressions, then practice playing them. One game, called “Red Hot Cash,” gets a powerful response. Eight of the women give it a good rating based on the game’s name alone. 
<p>“I could see the money,” explains one heavyset black woman. “I could see myself winning. ... ‘Cash’ says quick to me. It’s here and I’ve got it.” 
<p>The women’s opinions are important. Based on this research, the lottery often decides whether to drop a game, add it to the schedule immediately or keep trying to make it more attractive. “We do a lot of tweaking” of the games, Sawyer says — changing the games’ colors, play action or prize structure to make them more appealing. 
<p>After further tests, a few of the proposed games make it to the printers. The lottery orders millions of tickets a year — most games get orders of about 7 million. A million tickets cost the state about $9,000. 
<p>Every scratch-off ticket appears simple. They’re not. Dittler Brothers, a Georgia company that has printed 33 billion scratch tickets since 1974, offers customers, including Virginia, state-of-the-art ticket printing. 
<p>A Dittler scratch game is a multilayered sandwich. In all, six layers of latex, varnishes and overprinted inks protect the ticket from moisture, crumpling and — most of all — cheating. 
<p>When they’re printed, the tickets go into an unmarked tractor-trailer. The doors of the trailer are sealed. Then the driver — whose background has been put through a criminal check — and the tickets take to the road to Virginia. 
<p>Twice a month, they come to an unimposing 29,000-square-foot warehouse in an industrial-park section of Richmond’s North Side. 
<p>“What you have here,” says Linwood Eddleton, the warehouse supervisor, “is a warehouse full of instant tickets.” Row upon row of shelves, piled high with tan cardboard boxes, line the warehouse. Some boxes hold 9,000 tickets; others, 6,000. The cash value of these compiled tickets, Eddleton says casually, is “up in the millions.”
<p>From here, the warehouse’s 10 workers ship the tickets to retailers. “We’ve got 822 orders to fill today,” Eddleton says. 
<p>Tickets that don’t sell don’t stay around too long. Unsuccessful tickets go into a “super shredder” that turns them into confetti. Waist-tall bags of diced tickets — unrealized dreams of lottery millions — surround the shredder. “Sometimes we’re in here every day,” shredding tickets, Eddleton says.
<p>Other games end differently. 
<p>Warren M. Greene, a 35-year-old Navy sailor stationed 30 miles from Tapahannock, sits in the Virginia Lottery’s conference room. He drove up to Richmond to collect his check. 
<p>He says he plays the lottery every weekend, putting about $10 a week into the numbers. 
<p>This time, it paid off. He won $150,000 in the Big Game by matching seven numbers. He rocks in his chair, clicking a pen in his hand. 
<p>“Is this for real?” he wonders aloud. “Still it’s not real to me.” 
<p>Lottery employees ask questions about him to find out more for use in a press release that will be sent to newspapers and television stations. They take his picture as he stands awkwardly holding an enormous fake check. 
<p>Then they give him the real one, for $102,000 — his take after state and federal taxes. He clutches the check in both hands and stares at it. He stares and stares, as if it might disappear. 
<p>“Man,” he says. “That looks good.” <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#000000 face="Clarendon, Helvetica, Arial"><tt><b>T</b></tt></font>he last message Aaron Marks’ brain ever sent to the lower half of his body was “Run.”
<p>Seconds later his legs crumpled as a single bullet in the back felled him in an alley in Richmond’s Creighton Court neighborhood. A resident of Fulton visiting a cousin, Marks, 20, knew the guys that had called him over, and he says he had no reason to suspect danger. But one hit him in the face and demanded his money. He handed over his money and they continued to beat him. He heard the shot as his back was turned to run.
<p>“Boom!” he says. “My legs fell out from under me. I started praying, I started repenting, I started calling my dad.” Instantly, Marks lost feeling below his waist. “I didn’t want to look at my legs,” he says. 
<p>That was July. Today, the former furniture mover with the winning smile is a paraplegic, unable to move or feel anything below his belly button. Sitting in his wheelchair in the spinal cord injury outpatient unit at VCU’s Medical College of Virginia, wearing a T-shirt that says “Just play it. Life is football,” Marks is athletic-looking. He looks like he could spring from the chair at any moment and blast into the end zone. 
<p>In reality, his victories are seemingly smaller. He can dress himself. He can catheterize himself. He can maneuver his wheelchair up the two small steps into the East End home where he lives with his mother and brothers and sisters. His doctor, William McKinley, describes Marks as “amazingly upbeat and motivated.”
<p>The injury, Marks says, “is a blessing.” It has brought him closer to God, he explains, and helped him clarify his future — to be a minister. In the irony many spinal cord injury patients face, he says he accepted the severity of his injury quickly, but believes he will someday overcome that paralysis.

<br><center><font size=7 color=#9999ff face="Palace Script MT, Times">~</font></center>
On the first floor of MCV’s North Hospital at 13th and Marshall streets, the 41-bed Rehabilitation and Research Center is a magnet for spinal cord injured persons from all over Virginia and beyond — an inner-city shooting victim paralyzed from the waist down, a small-town college student injured in a car accident, a football coach sidelined by a rare virus and a rehab staffer who is himself spinal cord injured. They have little in common, but they share the experience of life changed in a single second and the mission to move forward with the capabilities they have left.
<p>Persons with spinal cord injuries live with the fact that their condition is often defined in the tiny, life-changing distances between vertebrae. An injury’s location — one vertebra higher or lower — can mean the difference between breathing independently or needing a ventilator; between total or partial paralysis; between retaining full use of one’s arms and hands or limited function below the shoulders; between a standard lightweight wheelchair or a cumbersome motorized chair.
<p>And regardless of how much injury occurs, recovery lies in the individual’s ability to make the most of what remains. For some that means asking a thumb to do the work an entire hand, or a bicep to carry the weight of the rest of an entire arm.
<p>Walking is the symbolic grand prize, even more so since actor Christopher Reeve declared that his mission is to stand and toast on his 50th birthday, just seven years away. Reeve was paralyzed from the neck down in an equestrian accident in Culpeper on Memorial Day 1995. While Reeve’s sweeping vision and industrial-strength hope are tools for progress in the public arena, there are everyday heroes in the battle against spinal cord injuries, and they’re winning not by tall leaps but by small, measured and mostly metaphorical steps.

<br><center><font size=7 color=#9999ff face="Palace Script MT, Times">~</font></center>
Tim Downey, 20, is Dr. McKinley’s next patient in the outpatient unit, a bright and welcoming area in MCV’s Ambulatory Care Center. A car accident two years ago stole all sensation and movement from Downey’s body below the upper chest. He was on his way to see his brother quarterback the same high school football team in Mathews County that Tim led two years earlier. He was sitting behind the driver, who was turning into the parking lot, when their car crashed head-on with another vehicle. 
<p>Tim’s parents, Deborah and Tim Sr., were standing in the bleachers for the national anthem when they heard the crash. “I wonder where Tim is,” Deborah said, turning to her husband. Minutes later, a town deputy stood at the foot of the stands and gave the Downeys a come-here wave. 
<p>Tim’s neck broke between near the fourth and fifth cervical vertebrae, slightly higher than shoulder level. He would lose all mobility and feeling below his biceps.
<p>When nerve cells in the spinal column begin to die, they set off a chain reaction of further destruction: Enzymes attack healthy cells, immune cells destroy live nerves, nerve fibers continue to tear and degenerate. Injuries like Downey’s are compounded in the hours that follow.
<p>After more than a month in the intensive care unit of a Norfolk hospital, two surgeries, a tracheostomy to relieve temporary breathing problems and nearly two more months in MCV’s rehabilitation unit, Downey went home. It was two days before Christmas. 
<p>With the help of arm braces to hold different implements, Downey can eat by himself, brush his teeth, type and steer his motorized wheelchair. Though medical science says there is virtually no chance of neurological improvement in cases like Downey’s, he too, like Marks, clings to a greater hope. “It’s still not permanent,” he says. “I don’t think so anyway.”
<p>In many spinal cord injury cases, the difference between hope and denial is as fragile as the spinal cord itself. A bundle of nerves the width of your little finger, it is the body’s information superhighway, the road upon which messages travel back and forth between the brain and the body. A spinal-cord injury sets up a kind of road block: a “complete injury” means nothing gets through at all; an “incomplete injury” means some messages reach their destinations, though slowed down or rerouted. The higher the injury is on the spine, the greater the level of disability.

<br><center><font size=7 color=#9999ff face="Palace Script MT, Times">~</font></center>
Billy Perkins glides along the linoleum-floored halls of MCV’s Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Unit in a wheelchair branded with the label “Quickie.” To negotiate the rigid hospital corners in tight, clean turns, Perkins slides his hand along walls or doors or whatever feature of the environment that helps get him there the quickest. Perkins’ chair is simply part of him, as much a physical attribute as his bushy mustache or his green eyes. 
<p>He rolls into the nursing station and spins the circular chart rack to read up on his first patient of the day. Pay little attention and you might not notice that Perkins’ fingers do not work. Only his ability to pinch his thumb to his hand enables him to grasp the chart, drop it to his lap and flip the pages deftly. 
<p>Perkins understands that unfailing optimism like Marks’ and Downey’s is to be expected among the newly and recently injured. But 12 years after his own complete injury at the level of his sixth and seventh cervical vertebrae, the MCV recreation therapist says walking isn’t necessarily winning.
<p>“Walking?” he says. “I don’t need to walk. I wanna feel my body.
<p>“When people talk about a cure ... a cure is not being able to walk. A cure is being able to improve the quality of life.”
<p>Perkins’ statement could be the unofficial rallying cry for the spinal cord injury (SCI) rehab team, part of MCV’s rehab unit. Perkins and 24 of his colleagues compose the Red Team — doctors, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, recreation therapists, social workers and psychologists — who are assembled to treat spinal cord injury patients. (The rehab unit’s Blue Team handles cases of stroke and all other rehabilitation.) 
<p>There is one mission here: for patients to master their remaining physical abilities and return to their lives.
<p>Miracles don’t come in dramatic bounds from the wheelchair. “The real miracle is what you can do with the strength you have,” says McKinley, medical director of MCV’s Spinal Cord Injury Services. “To leave here and go on with your life and make something of your life is the real goal.”

“Ready! Go, Go, Go! Up, your knee! Come on!” 
<p>Physical Therapist Ella Weiss is probably the toughest coach Mike Davis, a high school football coach himself, has ever had. Lying on his side on a physical therapy mat in the rehab unit therapy room, Davis struggles to swing his hip back toward Weiss, who straddles his leg while pushing the fleshy part of his right buttock with one firm hand and contorting his leg with the other. His face reddens and bulges as he bears down to push back against her. Sweat beads like dew at the edges of his thick blond hair.
<p>“What about the hip?” she scolds in her thick Israeli accent. Then her voice softens, and she turns to Davis and asks if he’s OK.
<p>Davis, 25, a football coach and special education teacher in Waldorf, Md., arrived at the rehab unit three weeks earlier. He is a minority among spinal cord injury patients. His is a nontraumatic injury, caused by a still unidentified virus that triggered a rare case of acute disseminating encephalomyelitis, which attacked healthy nerve fibers in the brain stem and upper spinal cord in an attempt to fight the virus. The result is an incomplete spinal cord injury at the cervical level. Though he hasn’t lost any feeling in his body, the former nose guard for the University of Richmond Spiders can’t walk under his own power.
<p>In the afternoon session, Weiss prepares Davis to walk the parallel bars. With a full-length mirror at one end and Davis’ wife Sherry behind his wheelchair, Davis leans forward, flings his 6’3" frame forward to a standing position and holds on for dear life.
<p>Six months ago, Davis could have lifted this apparatus over his head, and now it is almost all that is keeping him from dropping to the floor like a safe. His condition is rare, his prognosis uncertain. Answers have been hard to come by. Still, says his pint-sized wife, “He’s yet to complain once. Mike deserves a gold medal.”
<p>When Davis arrived at MCV, walking — even along the parallel bars — was impossible. He passed out one of the first times he tried it. He could not lift his arms much beyond his waist, and tremors in his arms and legs were severe. He still can’t swallow and is being fed through a feeding tube in his stomach. He has lost so much muscle that his bride of only three months had to reinforce his wedding ring with tape. 
<p>But the motivated Davis is after results, and every day his progress creeps along. In a Frisbee toss with Perkins, he lifts his arms high and steady to ready himself for the catch. Sherry boasts proudly of how her husband nearly jumped out of his wheelchair listening to his brother score a touchdown for University of Richmond the previous weekend. And on the parallel bars he takes 15 excruciating steps, each one soft and uncertain, as if he were treading the surface of some strange, new planet. 
<p>Sherry moves the chair behind him with each step until he comes to a halt at the end of the bars. It is time to sit back down. “You’re not leaning forward!” Weiss reprimands sternly. “You’re falling back like a sack of potatoes! Come on!” He drops back awkwardly to the chair, and Weiss leans in and regards him for a moment with her wide, brown eyes. She gives an approving nod and says, “That was very good.” Sherry beams and hugs him from behind.
<p>“Let’s do it again,” says Weiss.

The spinal cord is about 18 inches long and runs from the base of the brain to about the waist. It is protected by the spinal column, which comprises seven cervical vertebrae (in the neck area), 12 thoracic vertebrae (upper back), five lumbar (lower back) and five sacral (tailbone) vertebrae. The designations given to injuries — such as C-6 or T-10 — correspond to the vertebra nearest the point of injury. Perhaps the most important distinction among spinal cord injuries is the degree of completeness. “The difference between complete and incomplete spinal cord injuries is night and day,” says McKinley. With a complete injury there is virtually no chance for any neurological recovery; with incomplete injuries the potential is there.
<p>Roughly 200 Virginians suffer spinal cord injuries each year, according to the Virginia Spinal Cord Injury Systems (VSCIS), a cooperative program of VCU/MCV, Eastern Virginia Medical School, University of Virginia Hospitals and Woodrow Wilson Rehabilitation Center.
<p>Following the national trends, more than 80 percent are men, and young men are most common of all. Motor vehicle accidents cause most spinal cord injuries, followed by violence and falls. MCV’s rehab unit treats about 60 SCI patients each year with average hospital charges of $100,000 to $125,000.
<p>Spinal cord injuries cause more medical complications than any other traumatic injury. When a body can no longer feel itself, it doesn’t sense when things are going wrong. The person can’t feel when he is uncomfortable or when blood flow is cut off. Pressure sores become a problem when skin and muscle breaks down, causing a sometimes gaping and life-threatening wound. Pressure relief exercises are vital. Perkins lifts himself out of his chair for several seconds every 10 or 15 minutes. Tim Downey tilts his chair into different positions at least every half-hour to redirect blood flow.
<p>SCI also causes problems with bladder and bowel function, extreme muscle spasms and a serious condition called autonomic dysreflexia, an uncontrolled nervous system reflex which can raise the blood pressure to dangerous levels and cause strokes.
<p>Medical concerns are only part of the SCI puzzle.
<p>“We’re not just here to take care of medical problems,” says McKinley. “That’s stopping way short of the goal.”
<p>Much of the goal of MCV’s Spinal Cord Injury Services is getting people back to their lives and back to their communities. So important is that goal to MCV’s program that the expansion of community reintegration programs is a major component of a five-year, $1.8 million grant it received last year from the U.S. Department of Education. The MCV program is one of only 18 in the nation to receive the grant and the designation “model system.” Along with the other model systems (the closest is in Philadelphia; others include facilities in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston, Boston and Seattle), MCV contributes to a national database compiling information on spinal cord injury causes, treatment, rehab efforts and patient demographics. 
<p>So in addition to intense physical therapy and vigilant nursing care, emphasis is placed on occupational therapy for the skills of daily living. Patients must relearn the basic skills of getting dressed, going to the bathroom and cooking. Outings to bowling alleys, movie theaters and malls are not just recreational diversions, they are lessons, all — in maneuvering around public places, finding wheelchair accessible facilities and dealing with public perceptions.
<p>“David” learns some of these lessons on a Richmond city bus. 
<p>The 22-year-old holds his head in his hands. “Why do I gotta go on this bus?”
<p>“You gotta do it, man,” says Perkins, sitting in his wheelchair just outside his cramped office near the rehab dining room area. David, who says he sold drugs for a living before the shooting, suffered a T-10 complete injury from multiple gunshot wounds. He is under an alias at MCV to protect himself and the staff that cares for him.
<p>“I don’t need to take this bus. Anywhere I need to go, I’ll ask my mama to take me,” David says.
<p>“What if your mother isn’t around? What are you gonna do if you have to go somewhere? You can’t drive yet,” Perkins counters.
<p>“And it’s very expensive to convert your car — seven, eight thousand dollars,” says Occupational Therapist Alexis Dobler.
<p>“What are you afraid of, man?” Perkins asks.
<p>“I don’t know,” David replies, his head sunken low toward his chest. The top half of his body, though not particularly muscular, seems strangely detached from the lower portion. His useless legs flop crookedly to the foot rests of his chair like a sad afterthought. “I just don’t wanna go on this bus.”
<p>Nevertheless, within minutes, the three are headed toward a bus stop at 10th and Broad streets. Despite the “Don’t Walk” sign, Perkins wheels across 11th Street with ease. David follows tentatively with Dobler assisting from behind, his face registering discomfort with every curb cutout, with every slope and slant of the asphalt. A bus comes quickly, too quickly for David to back out now. 
<p>The wheelchair lift grinds out from the steps and down to the pavement, and Perkins backs his chair on smoothly, locks his wheel braces and rides up. Next is David’s turn, and he duplicates the effort. The bus driver flips up the bench seats on each side of the bus to make room for the two wheelchairs and the passengers fall silent.
<p>Perkins, David and Dobler exit the bus at 1st and Main. David gets off first, finding no trouble with the process. “So, where do we go now?” he asks.
<p>The bus ride back to MCV provides David an opportunity to learn a different lesson. A seemingly intoxicated passenger watches David’s slow rise on the wheelchair lift and mutters, “One day I might be like that. Or my child,” and he adds, “Thank God.” 
<p>“Need some help, little bro’?” the man asks as he grabs David’s chair and jerks it back roughly down the narrow aisle. He does the same for Perkins, who gives him a brusque, “Thanks, man.”
<p>Dobler drops in 50 cents each for David and Perkins, but the bus driver says they must show handicap cards to receive the discounted fare. Perkins says he didn’t know about the special card and antes up the remainder of the $1.25 fare for himself and David. The overly eager-to-help passenger grouses on and on for blocks about the driver’s insensitivity. “It’s OK, man, don’t worry about it,” Perkins says without turning around. 
<p>As the passenger exits the bus, he rebukes the driver: “Jeez, what’s wrong with your eyes? Can’t you see them guys are crippled?” If the man’s crass display of pity bothers Perkins at all, one would never know by his casual expression as the bus doors close with a hiss.

Billy Perkins was injured in a truck accident three weeks after his son was born in 1984. The driver of the other vehicle ran a stop sign and slammed into the truck Perkins was driving as a crew chief for a special events company. No one else in the accident was severely injured except for Perkins, whose neck was broken when the roof of the truck caved in on him.
<p>“I was sky-high for weeks [before the accident], man, and all of a sudden, bam! It affects every aspect of your life — mental, social, physical, emotional,” says the 39-year-old. “Who you were before your injury was all the things you did ... and now you can’t even control your bladder and bowel.”
<p>He says growing up, the only role model in a wheelchair was Raymond Burr as the chair-bound TV private eye, “Ironside.” 
<p>“He’s this big, old fat guy being pushed around by an attendant and riding around in a Wonder Bread truck.” That wasn’t exactly what Perkins aspired to. 
<p>Instead, Perkins built himself a new career as a certified recreation therapist and picked up three gold medals for discus, shotput and javelin in competition in 1988.
<p>“I see my role here with people as showing there’s life after SCI.” On the other hand, he says, “Some people see me as the reality and don’t want to talk to me.”
<p>But reality for spinal cord-injured people is brighter than ever before. New drugs are being used to halt the destructive chemical reaction that causes so much additional nerve damage immediately after the primary injury. Researchers, who once thought nerves in the spinal cord could not regenerate now believe that the nerves can regenerate but simply do not — a major distinction. Research is focused now on creating the proper environment for regrowing nerves.
<p>Medical and technological innovations such as the Parastep system are using electrical impulses to recreate the motions of standing and walking in some spinal cord injured people.
<p>McKinley says the likely beneficiaries of the latest research are individuals who will suffer injuries in decades to come. Today’s research may not help the young Aaron Markses and the Tim Downeys who cling to the kind of sky-high hopes for walking that Christopher Reeve inspires. McKinley says high hopes are just fine.
<p>“I see it in the majority of individuals with SCI,” says McKinley of his patients. “That’s OK as long as they can accept their current condition and be motivated to maximize their current potential. If I tell it to them straight and if they choose to have faith, that’s fine.”
<p>While Marks’ and Downey’s hopes for walking under their own power seem unrealistic, it has not stopped them from taking strides toward full and active lives. There is not one noticeable drop of self-pity between them. Marks plans to attend J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College in January to study community and social services. Downey is already back in classes and plans to apply to Virginia Commonwealth University to study psychology. While he can no longer play his guitar (“That kind of sucks,” he says), he still attends concerts with his friends and his girlfriend. He plans to get married and have children one day.
<p>Davis doesn’t need to dream about walking, he’s doing it, literally one step at a time.
<p>Perkins, on the other hand, can take it or leave it, and he has mixed feelings about the hopes Christopher Reeve inspires. “Everybody’s got to have a spokesperson but the trouble is it also generates false hope and unrealistic expectations. I’d wanna be breathing in five years if I were Christopher Reeve. Walking wouldn’t be high on my list.”
<p>Perkins’ list? To feel his body, first and foremost. Normal bowel and bladder function, not to have to schedule his whole life around a catheterization schedule. Then the use of his fingers. He’d also like to skydive again.
<p>Then, maybe, to walk. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><font size=4 color=#000000><i><b>by John W. Maloney</b></i></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#ff9933><tt><b>S</b></tt></font>omebody needs to tell the women practicing in the Randolph-Macon College gym that women’s professional basketball will never work.
<p>The trail before them is cluttered with the fail-ures of earlier pioneers: the Women’s Basketball League, Women’s American Basketball Association, National Women’s Basketball Association and the Liberty Basketball Association (with unitards and 9-foot-2 rims) all failed like desperation jumpers, some in a matter of months, some without playing a single game.
<p>The skin-tight unitards in 1991 are still a painful memory for some women’s hoops boosters who grimace at the gimmicks organizers thought they needed to woo fans. Now they have the American Basketball Association to cheer or ignore. The season starts Oct. 18.
<p>One of those teams calls Richmond home. (Just a year ago people laughed aloud about a Canadian Football League team owner’s discussions with the city, now Richmond is on the leading edge of a major movement in women’s basketball.)
<p>With five weeks to go before the opener, Richmond’s Rage had yet to run a full-court scrimmage, primarily because the team didn’t have 10 players. The hyped and hoped-for center, Olympic gold medalist Lisa Leslie, chose modeling over rebounding. A late addition from Brazil, Olympic silver medalist Marta de Souza Sobral, got rejected by customs in Atlanta and had to fly home until her papers were straight. Jackie Joyner-Kersee, or JJK to the insiders, picked Richmond for her return to the game after 11 years of heroic track and field success, but her contract came on the condition she be excused from games that conflict with her track schedule.
<p>And one day before their introduction to the Metropolitan Richmond Sports Backers luncheon, Richmond Times-Dispatch sports writer Bob Lipper fired a stream of skepticism across the sports page with a column headlined “A Raging Success? Don’t Count on It.”
<p>Welcome to Richmond, ladies. Good luck. Staying awhile?
<p>But the women in the gym are still practicing. Destiny calls them from ordinary lives as former collegiate stars or expatriates living abroad. Coach Lisa Boyer is still hoarse from teaching the position reversals in the high-low offense. Between wind sprints, the nine or more women of the Rage are dreaming as hard as they can about their singular quest: to play for pay in the country they were born in.
<p>That’s all they want, just like the men. The ABL has all the trappings of a dreamscape, and many of the league’s players have more than a few reasons to damn the skeptics and try to make this thing work.
<p><center><font size=3 color=#ff9933><pre>•   •   •</pre></font></center>

<p>At 33, 6-foot-3 lefthander Kirsten Cummings has <i>only</i> played professionally in Japan, Italy, France, Germany and Israel. When she tells people stateside what she does for a living, they often ask her what she’s going to do when she gets serious about life, she says. There’s only so much basketball left in this Long Beach State alumna whose hearing is 70 percent impaired. She admits the dream of performing in a United States league drives her. “I don’t have much time, but I’m just in time for this,” she says.
<p>Last year at this time, 5-foot-5 guard and former class salutorian Dena Evans was teaching ninth grade at her old high school in Deer Park, Texas, where she holds a few records, including all-time leading scorer and most career assists. She heard the horror stories some women tell of life in the foreign leagues. As a point guard, it was also hard to find a good team because leagues restrict the number of Americans and taller scorers from the U.S. are preferred to playmakers.
<p>At Virginia, she played on teams with the Burge twins (Heather is with San Jose, Heidi with Columbus) that won the ACC title (Evans was MVP) and reached three Final Fours, a pedigree any man in the game would likely parlay into NBA riches or at least a strong life insurance business or regional car dealership. Instead, she had the choice of playing in foreign obscurity, “a huge sacrifice” of friends and family, in her words, or going home to Deer Park.
<p>When she heard about the ABL, Evans says she hit the gym with one goal: to make an ABL team.
<p>Her arms and legs are spotted with bruises.
<p>“It was a dream come true,” when the league was announced last September. “I’ve been training for a year getting in shape for this.” Making NBA-style salaries and gaining stardom beyond her collegiate success aren’t her objectives, or the goals of the league, she says.
<p>“I don’t think it’s a moneymaking thing — the motivations are pure, just like the women’s game itself,” Evans says, echoing the party line from the league office in Palo Alto, Calif. On the Rage, “we’ve got people who are willing to try hard.” 
<p>Lean tall and strong, Adrienne Goodson, 29, looks like she can handle herself with anybody on any court any time. She’s played on four teams over five years in Brazil, where she was a star. In America, she played at Old Dominion University and won an NCAA Division I title her first year there. She also played on America’s national team for two years but never sought an Olympic team spot. 
<p>“I think [the ABL] is going to go well. It’s very professional. I hope that people continue to be professional,” she says, legs draped from a training table.
<p>A versatile wing player, her game includes the fade-away jumpers, drives and spins of man. The knees she leaps with haven’t failed her — knock on the training room door.
<p>In the still of the Ashland night, the basketballs herded back into the racks, the mayhem Goodson recounts from Brazil seems more than a continent away. It’s more like bizarre fantasy that people anywhere would clamor so much over women’s basketball that the players can’t even shout out the plays, but it’s true. 
<p>As a little girl who got her start in the Police Athletic League in Bayonne, N.J., Goodson says basketball “is just doing what I do,” and the reward “is just being out there.”
<p>The only job she has had outside of basketball was a stint as assistant manager of a Wal-Mart and the only reason she did that was that a season in Germany was cut short by the fall of the Berlin Wall. People were momentarily distracted from basketball for a revolution, which Goodson remembers was “in their eyes.”
<p>She was relieved to get out.
<p>With no league of their own in the states, America’s best female players often face lucrative but obscure opportunities abroad. At Stanford, wiry guard Molly Goodenbour won two NCAA championships and garnered MVP accolades in 1992. Now 24, she has behind her a few months of Swedish play for a team that was not very good in a league that isn’t close to the top in Europe. While she made two U.S. national teams — the best women’s team in the country — those teams came between Olympic years.
<p>Now, she says, her new team here has the task of winning over Richmond. “It’s exactly what I want to be doing now,” she says. “It’s exciting to be something new, but we don’t know what’s going to happen here either, besides opening opportunities for other women.” Goodenbour is the first of the Ragers to say the players bear the responsibility for filling the seats at the Richmond Coliseum and UR’s Robins Center. “We just don’t expect people to automatically come.”
<p>Married to Sonoma State men’s basketball coach, Pat Fuscaldo, 40, Goodenbour’s courtship included a lot of full-court one-on-one with him, he says. They share the same passion for the game, and he sympathizes with his wife’s plight as a former collegian. “The women, for so long, had nothing to look forward to,” he says. With two or more players missing from early Rage practices, Fuscaldo scrimmaged with his wife’s teammates in a remarkable though not particularly scenic honeymoon after their Sept. 13 wedding. When the season’s over for both of them, he says they’ll take off for Europe, sans roundball, and maybe even revisit Sweden where “they treated her like a celebrity.”
<p><center><font size=3 color=#ff9933><pre>•   •   •</pre></font></center>


<p>While coach Lisa Boyer is preparing the best collection of players in her career, which includes a decade as head coach at Bradley, Rage players say they don’t envy her task. The defense is coming along, but offensive chemistry remains the stuff of practices future. The diversity of player experiences and backgrounds leaves Boyer patiently urging her squad to execute the offensive patterns “you have all done before,” but somehow can’t get right with the latest cast of characters. Losing Lisa Leslie in the pivot hurt. Gaining Joyner-Kersee can only be seen as a rare challenge. Olympian, NCAA player of the year and former U.Va. star Dawn Staley is the charm at point guard, but bigger guards on other teams promise to play her tough. Nobody on the Rage knows how the other teams will perform. 
<p><center><font size=3 color=#ff9933><pre>•   •   •</pre></font></center>


<p>The ABL is the brainchild of PR executive Gary Cavalli, former Olympic swimmer Anne Cribbs, former Silicon Valley executive Steve Hams in California and Georgia businessman Bobby Johnson. The coasts were merged by Olympic star Teresa Edwards, who was approached by both groups about playing in a new league that would follow the Atlanta Olympics.
<p>With substantial backing from an unnamed group of investors, the quartet of Cavalli, Cribbs, Hams and Johnson announced the league Sept. 26, 1995. On Feb. 21, 1996, eight cities were announced as franchise winners, all under the investors’ collective ownership.
<p>A spokesman for the ABL says initial season capitalization is $16 million. The average player salary is reportedly $70,000 with Olympians getting $125,000. Cable sports TV coverage will reach 45 million homes, including Home Team Sports in Richmond. If teams can draw 3,000 to 5,000 fans to each game, and Rage tickets range from $9 to $30, ABL organizers say they’ll be happy. 
<p>Marketed as a carry-over from the Olympic team’s success, ABL teams landed seven of the 12 gold medalists for the U.S. Of the seven, only one was a starter — Teresa Edwards. Leslie is modeling, while Katrina McClain and Ruthie Bolton took their talents to ... Turkey. Yeah, Turkey. Each with considerable name recognition, Sheryl Swoopes and Rebecca Lobo are reportedly holding back to work for the WNBA — a women’s professional league derived from the minds and money of the men’s NBA, with a summer season tipping off next June. 
<p><center><font size=3 color=#ff9933><pre>•   •   •</pre></font></center>


<p>Richmond’s ABL bid, like many significant area sports events, originated with the Metropolitan Richmond Sports Backers.
<p>Executive Director Jon Lugbill explains that his organization’s goal is to build on each sports event it can bring to the city. Sellouts at the Coliseum for the Women’s Final Four and near-capacity crowds at the Central Fidelity Bank Women’s Invitational Tournament at the Robins Center established a track record for women’s basketball in Richmond long before the ABL was announced. Successful collegiate programs at ODU and U.Va. make Richmond an attractive place for both Norfolk and Charlottesville fans to support. So Richmond has the Rage.
<p>By no coincidence, Stanford fans can follow the San Jose Lasers. University of Washington is close to Seattle’s Reign. The New England Blizzard falls on the UConn Huskies (even though former UConn standout Lobo opted out of the league). Atlanta has the Glory; Columbus has the Quest; Colorado is the Xplosion and Portland is the Power.
<p><center><font size=3 color=#ff9933><pre>•   •   •</pre></font></center>


<p>Shaving away the unofficial slogans, like “little girls need something to look up to,” and “it’s a whole new ballgame!” everything about the ABL boils down to spectator attendance. Rage general manager Tammy Holder, 38, a former coach at UR, twists her head at that pronouncement, but acknowledges the truth in it.
<p>At the Sports Backers luncheon, she pitched the naked plea: “Ask your neighbors, your children, your children’s children to buy season tickets.”
<p>She knows first impressions are crucial and the vast majority of tickets will be single game sales.
<p>“The Olympics were an indication of the excitement,” Americans have for the game, says Holder. “People who know women’s basketball know [the time is right].”
<p>Ever so slowly, though, the zealot in Holder takes over, and she tells the well-worn story of being a little girl cheerleader at George Wythe High School games when Bobby Ukrop was the star, and how she had to wait until 1Oth grade to play scholastically, and how, thanks to the ABL, little girls can dream of professional stardom in America now. Ukrop’s is a major sponsor of the Rage and Bobby Ukrop has been instrumental in the Sports Backers and more specifically in recent national and world-class soccer events at UR Stadium. His son Rob is a soccer star.
<p><center><font size=3 color=#ff9933><pre>•   •   •</pre></font></center>


<p>All the dreams of the ABL turn to nightmares if the seats are empty. Or league paychecks start to bounce. Each team plays 40 games. “Stopping the season midstream,” as other women’s leagues have, “does a lot of damage,” Holder says. “But the Final Four packed the Coliseum; people will come out for great women’s basketball.”
<p>Some potential corporate supporters have been openly skeptical to Holder about the league’s prospects, but three-fourths like the idea, she says, “and the majority have been absolutely great. It’s not something that could possibly be bad. It can only be positive.
<p>“We all have a passion in this,” Holder says of her staff. “There’s nothing like looking back and saying ’I was a part of history,’ This really is a history-making process.”
<p><center><font size=3 color=#ff9933><pre>•   •   •</pre></font></center>


<p>As a team assistant unpacks brand-new Rage apparel on the R-MC gym floor, 23-year-old forward Etta Maytubby is in no hurry to dress up in logo-emblazoned anything.
<p>The Friday night practice has her down.
<p>Offensive patterns were arhythmic exercises in choppy steps, late passes and bad shots. Coach Boyer’s frustration shows, but patience sustains her. She huddles the women before blasting them, limiting embarrassment before a crowd of 50 or so spectators.
<p>“I just don’t want to hold the team back,” Maytubby says after the last period, having struggled to find her game in a professional system more sophisticated than the program she left behind at University of Oklahoma. “Our coach was old and he didn’t teach us anything,” she says. The youngest player on the team, Maytubby is also the most likely to receive advice or stronger words from her worldly teammates.
<p>Together, they are all feeling the weight of a sad history for women’s professional basketball they never want to repeat. Etta Maytubby’s ability to move effectively within the high-low offense won’t decide the fate of Richmond’s youngest sports franchise, but don’t tell her that.
<p>Maytubby’s life as an ordinary person is on hold — for how long depends on basketball and the box office. She and her Rage mates have come from every direction to Richmond to see this league through.
<p>Leslie Morgan’s seven years in retail before this season haven’t exactly sharpened her game, but Boyer points out that she played through several rounds of cuts and a few hundred women in the league tryouts to get here.
<p>Rehema Stephens is an ordained minister as well as a high-scoring UCLA alumna, while three-time NAIA All-American Taj McWilliams has an 8-year-old enrolled in school here.
<p>“We have nine awesome women here,” Rev. Rehema says. “Why give up our dreams? We all want to play and this is the answer to prayers.”
<p>Now’s not a good time to tell the women of the Rage they won’t make it. They’re living out a dream. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#663333><b>T</b></font>he inmates call it the Pink Palace. The flat-roofed boxy buildings that constitute the Pocahontas Correctional Unit have coiled razor wire about the perimeter fences, but the pink, bubblegum-colored interior walls provide the signature detail.
<p>Visitors inside await their incarcerated wives, mothers, daughters and sweethearts in a stuffy room that begs for air conditioning. Visitors — some somber, others chatty — settle into plastic chairs clustered around small, low tables.
<p>Beverly Monroe, 58, appears in the doorway, having been led to the basement from one of the prison’s four living spaces. Sixty women share two toilets in her area. Flashing a huge beatific smile, whether sincere or forced, it says, “I’m doing OK.” 
<p>She’s doing 22 years for the murder of Roger de la Burde, with whom she had an 11-year affair. The Chesterfield prison is now home to Monroe and 250 other female convicts.
<p>Monroe is trim, exuding natural chic — despite the prison-issue uniform of sky-blue cotton pants and matching T-shirt. She remains fastidious about exercise. The prison’s dusty air and low-fiber diet worry her. 
<p>Her face has more lines and her light brown hair is grayer since the morning of March 4, 1992, when she claims she discovered the corpse of her boyfriend. The body of the high-profile Richmond real estate speculator, African- and contemporary-art collector and retired Philip Morris research chemist was lying on a library sofa in his Powhatan farmhouse. De la Burde’s forehead bore the fatal bullet hole.
<p>Eyes misting, Monroe recounts her fondness for the man she was quickly convicted of murdering. There were the trips they took together, and the love they shared for music, she says. When he was with her and her children, there was a warmth and closeness he failed to find anywhere else, she says.
<p>Ironically, Monroe’s family is the only chance she has left as they seek to free her through a dwindling appeals process. The past four years have taken a grievous toll on her children, she says. “It would have been easier if they’d just taken my life, right off the bat.”
<p>Her mother’s financial resources depleted, Monroe’s oldest daughter, Katie, 31, a Washington, D.C., lawyer, has taken on the case. She’s cobbled together a volunteer defense team that includes Chesterfield lawyer Thomas H. Gays II, a friend of Katie’s from George Mason law school; and Donald Bergerson, a San Francisco criminal defense lawyer whom Katie met in Washington. “Donald believes that the scientific evidence is that Roger committed suicide, and he doesn’t know how this case even got to trial,” she says.
<p>Other lawyers who are consulting have told Katie: “Oh boy, there’s a hole there you could drive a Mack truck through,” referring to the perceived lack of evidence. “This was a great injustice. I think your mother was screwed and I think you need some help.”
<p>Monroe’s son, Gavin, 33, an area sales representative for a beverage manufacturer and her daughter Shannon, 25, who teaches art, are providing backup support.
<p>This summer, they distributed hundreds of flyers to increase awareness of their mother’s plight and to bolster support for her federal appeal. It shows an enlarged snapshot of their smiling mother standing in a field of wildflowers. It was taken by de la Burde during a trip to Poland in spring 1991. The flyer’s headline reads  “Help to Free Beverly Monroe.”
<p>The team is preparing a federal habeas corpus action that seeks Monroe’s release from prison. “[It] raises constitutional issues and challenges the fairness of the trial,” Katie explains, “things like what the police didn’t do, what the defense didn’t do. The court requires you to support all your allegations. You put the entire case on paper, showing what should have been done. It is so much work.”
<p>Some believed de la Burde’s wound was self-inflicted. The death was initially investigated as a suicide. But three months later, on June 9, 1992, Monroe, a research scientist, was indicted as his murderer.
<p>On Nov. 2, 1992, after a seven-day trial at Powhatan Courthouse under the glare of sensational local and national media coverage, the jury found her guilty. This past January, with her appeals in the Virginia courts exhausted, Monroe reported to prison to begin her sentence.

<p>Katie Monroe believes that the county and state authorities involved in the case were negligent by failing to collect evidence and not examining many items at the scene of de la Burde’s death.
<p>Referring specifically to two cigarette butts left in an ashtray and burned papers in de la Burde’s library fireplace, Shannon Monroe says: “I personally don’t believe it was a homicide, but by examining such evidence, while not necessarily pointing to other suspects, they would have been less likely to have just pointed the finger at my mother.”
<p>Katie and her legal team also maintain that because medical experts did not conduct forensic tests ordinarily carried out, the true circumstances surrounding de la Burde’s death may never be known.
<p>They maintain that the lack of physical evidence linking Monroe to de la Burde’s death will also be critical to their case. 
<p>They will dispute the circumstantial evidence, arguing:
<ul>
<li> The prosecution only speculated regarding the motive, means, opportunity and time — all facts that were supposed to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
<p><li> There were many contradictions in the government’s case. For example, the prosecution alleged the time of de la Burde’s death was around 10:30 p.m. while conceding that Monroe was at a Huguenot Road grocery store at 10:40 p.m., at least 20 minutes away from his house. She has a receipt and a witness to prove it.
<p><li> At the trial, at which Monroe took the stand, although no one testified negatively about Monroe’s personality, the prosecutors repeatedly made false and prejudicial statements about her character to the jury.
<p>“My gosh,” prosecutor Warren B. Von Schuch told the jury, “she knows she was there. She knows what happened. She is a manipulator. And the actions and the acting that she did that morning are good ... It is a desperate act. It is a cruel act.”
<p><li> The prosecution relied on testimony from Zelma Smith, who was then serving time on a felony conviction in Chesterfield County Jail, to substantiate that Monroe had premeditated the act. Smith testified that Monroe advanced her money in a West End Burger King in the spring of 1991 to purchase a small handgun. Smith also said that although she and Monroe later met in a West End cemetery, no gun was ever exchanged. 
<p>Not only does Monroe maintain she’d never seen Smith before, “I’ve never been to a Burger King in my life,” she says incredulously. Besides, Monroe says she and de la Burde were traveling in Europe in the spring of 1991.
<p>“I don’t believe the jury believed [Smith], that’s my opinion,” says Richmond criminal attorney Murray Janus, who defended Monroe. “I said it was a ‘whopper.’”
<p>Even State Police Special Agent David Riley recently said he initially thought Smith was “looking for a way to free herself” when she volunteered her story to authorities, but found her increasingly convincing as she described Monroe’s “commanding presence,” their meeting spots (“which were more convenient to Beverly than to Zelma,” and her description of what Monroe was wearing.)
<p><li> And finally, they will argue that investigators coerced statements from Monroe that she was present when de la Burde committed suicide. 
<p>State Police Special Agent David Riley interviewed Monroe twice on March 26, 21 days after de la Burde’s death. In the morning he spoke with her in the kitchen of de la Burde’s farm. Later that afternoon he had her come to police headquarters. 
<p>This admission was not taped: “I forgot to turn it on,” Riley said on the stand referring to the recording equipment. “I immediately moved in front of Mrs. Monroe and began to talk to her and forgot, totally, to turn it on until the interview was almost — well, actually, I had concluded the interview, totally concluded the interview and I was about to tell her to leave.”
<p>Riley says that a number of witnesses observing his interviews with Monroe from behind one-way glass corroborated his take of the sessions.
</ul>
<p>“Yes, there was only circumstantial evidence,” says prosecutor Warren Von Schuch, “but there was a lot of it. And there was a tremendous amount of motive.” 

<p><center><font size=2 color=#663333><pre>o      o      o      o      o</pre></font></center>

<p>“Our goal now is that if Beverly has to sit in prison for 10 years, we will have the satisfaction that we gave this our best shot,” says Katie, who has left her job with the U.S. Civil Rights Commission to take on what would be daunting for any attorney.
<p>“Previously, I was asking Mom to hang on for two more years,” Katie says, “but the rules have suddenly changed.” New federal procedures are designed to keep the pipelines of justice flowing freely. “We thought we had all the time in the world” to appeal, Katie explains. “Now she has 12 months, since last January, to get into federal court. She has one bite at the apple this time and gets to take the bite just once.”
<p>Mission control for Monroe’s defense team this past summer was a spare room in Katie’s apartment in a Washington, D.C., townhouse. Shannon moved in with her sister to handle fund raising and volunteer efforts. Brother Gavin held down the fort in Richmond, coordinating visits with their mother. This fall, they are also working out of Gays’ Chesterfield law office.

<p>Why would anyone want Roger de la Burde dead? 
<p>At the trial, in his closing argument, Monroe’s defense attorney Murray Janus could find little good to say about the man his client loved: 
<p>“Unorthodox”
<p>“Complicated” 
<p>“That’s the nicest thing you can say for Roger, Count Roger Z. de la Burde, as he called himself on his stationery,” Janus said.
<p>“A crook is a crook,” Janus continued, “and I could go on with other adjectives. ... Roger Burde was a fraud, and Roger Burde was immoral.” 
<p>The circumstances of de la Burde’s life threatened, at times, to eclipse the mysteriousness of his death. 
<p>Polish-born, de la Burde moved to Richmond in the 1950s. He speculated on land sales and development. He purchased African and contemporary art and enthusiastically promoted his collection. While he had retired from Philip Morris as a scientist in the research and development office, he was in the midst of a major lawsuit, suing the conglomerate for $12 million he claimed it owed him in patents. Philip Morris had countersued for $50 million alleging fraud.
<p>The “Count” was a ubiquitous, if somewhat mysterious figure on the local business, cultural and social scenes. Against Richmond’s usually staid, waspy, color-within-the-lines backdrop, de la Burde’s striking continental manner and mores, his crassly-expressed social ambitions and his erratic behavior all elicited everything from slack-jawed wonder to disgust from those who met him.
<p>He wanted desperately to achieve the outward appearances of social acceptance. Just days before his death, a picture appeared in The Richmond News Leader of him whirling Virginia Museum Director Katharine Lee around the dance floor at a Friends of Art ball. He had unsuccessfully angled for years for an appointment to the museum’s prestigious board of trustees.
<p>“Roger drove a hard bargain, but without finesse,” says Richmonder Donald Beville, a publishing representative who was helping de la Burde, in conjunction with Radford University, create a book on his art collection. On the night of de la Burde’s death, Beville had chatted with him on the phone sometime around 10 p.m.
<p>“I found he was wrong a lot,” Beville says. “He assumed a lot, and that he knew everything, when he didn’t. He was kind of a bully.” Beville says working with de la Burde, who “was always scheming,” could be a nightmare.
<p>“I couldn’t stand him at first,” says Beverly Monroe’s son, Gavin, of de la Burde. “He was always trying to cut a deal: ‘If you do this, I’ll give you that.’ One time he came in and threw down $80,000 on the table in $100 bills from some deal, as if I should be impressed. But toward the end, he was more of a caring person. ... He got more sentimental.”
<p>“Roger had a lot of destructive qualities,” agrees Katie Monroe, “but he loved my mother very much. He was always saying things like, ‘She is a prize.’ He considered himself lucky to be with her.”
<p>Members of de la Burde’s family could not be reached for this story.

<p>Beverly Monroe and Roger de la Burde met in 1979 during the holidays at a company party when both were employed by Philip Morris.
<p>Monroe was divorcing her husband, a college professor. De la Burde was still married.
<p>While she admits de la Burde was a complex man who had his demons, Monroe says she and her children took his mercurial personality under their wing, giving him a sense of family and belonging he craved and apparently lacked in his own marriage and other romantic relationships.
<p>“There was a little-boy feeling about him,” says Beverly. “When he was in a jam he’d ask me to stay with him and not let him down and not to abandon him. I told him I would be his friend. He was always there for me.
<p>“He was always generous and always thinking about others. He was so bright and so intelligent and so fun. Sometimes he’d laugh until he was rolling on the floor. Before, he had never known how to laugh.”
<p>In return, he shared his fertile intellect, a sophisticated world view and an appreciation for culture.
<p>That interdependence was the glue of de la Burde’s and Monroe’s relationship. For more than a decade she stuck by her tempestuous companion through his familial, emotional and financial traumas.
<p>“He looked like a cornball, like he was out of the 1940s,” says Gavin Monroe, sitting on the sofa of his south Richmond apartment, “but he had this European charm.
<p>“He had a lot of good qualities,” says Gavin of de la Burde, “I was really into baseball and football, and he wanted to be. He enjoyed watching and the group spirit. He enjoyed soccer, tennis and boxing. Roger loved music and had African art. He got us into the arts.”
<p>Gavin points to a framed silk screen print hanging on the wall that was a gift from de la Burde. “I probably never would have gone to Europe if it hadn’t been for him.”
<p>Having a son of his own became an obsession with de la Burde.
<p>Monroe was a divorcee with three children while de la Burde already had two grown daughters, Corinna and Colette, with his wife Brigitte de la Burde. The de la Burdes separated in late 1984, four years after he and Monroe met. They were divorced in June 1991 after a drawn-out financial settlement. (De la Burde had also fathered an illegitimate daughter, Sylvia Meys, who now lives in Germany).
<p>A demanding man of considerable pretense, he felt his female offspring weren’t up to continuing his business and cultural interests. According to Monroe, de la Burde had even encouraged his nephew, Sig Huber, a Californian whom de la Burde admired, to change his name to de la Burde.
<p>Desperate to find someone to carry the family name, de la Burde was on the constant lookout for someone to give him a son. He was known to have propositioned women he knew only casually or socially — even wives of business associates.
<p>De la Burde found a willing woman on a ski trip he and Monroe made to Snowshoe resort in West Virginia. Overhearing another couple speaking Polish on the slopes, Monroe suggested that de la Burde introduce himself. Polish-born Richmonders Wojtek and Krystyna Drewnowska were the couple. In August 1992, five months after de la Burde’s death, Krystyna gave birth to de la Burde’s child, a girl.
<p>At the trial, the prosecution successfully painted Monroe as the classic angry, scorned older woman. 
<p>Monroe counters that she was not jealous and would probably never have married de la Burde: “That was not a person I would trust my life to. My finances were more stable than his. My house was paid for, and I had a great job.” She claims hardly to have been a woman scorned, but someone who had built her life on independence.
<p>De la Burde’s philandering ways were nothing new to Monroe. Hadn’t she been the other woman first, when de la Burde was married to Brigitte? 
<p>“He knew the things that were important to me,” she says. “I’d taken up the flute. If I could get one phrase that was good, he would be ecstatic.”
<p>Their relationship, Monroe says, was based “on the essence of things.”

<p><center><font size=2 color=#663333><pre>o      o      o      o      o</pre></font></center>

<p>On the evening of March 4, 1992, de la Burde and Monroe dined together at Windsor, his 200-acre Powhatan farm. After dinner, around 9:30 p.m., as was her custom, she says she returned to her house near Bon Air. She picked up a grocery list from her son Gavin, who was then living at home, and drove to the Safeway in the Shoppes at Bellgrade.
<p>Returning home sometime around 11 p.m., she says she telephoned de la Burde, but the line was busy so she went to bed.
<p>The following morning, before driving to work, Beverly says she tried phoning Roger again. The line was still busy. Concerned, she decided to drive to the farm.
<p>When he didn’t come to the door, and not having a key to his house, Beverly says she contacted the caretaker, Joe Hairfield, who lived on the property.
<p>Hairfield snapped open a sliding glass door and was the first to enter the house. They found de la Burde lying on the sofa, dead from a bullet in the head. In the confusion, Hairfield testified that he might have moved the gun, but couldn’t recall for certain.
<p>Monroe, who had been crying, soon called Gavin, who was at home.
<p>“I thought he’d beat her up,” Gavin says. “He’d smacked her in the face once. When I got there I saw the police cars. ‘He didn’t take his life, did he?’ I thought. He was so depressed. He told me he had recently bought a gun because he thought Philip Morris was out to get him.
<p>“He had a lot of emotional swings,” Gavin continues. “He was not happy. He hated his life. He was unhappy about his looks — he talked about that all the time — and he had had a scare with prostate cancer. He had dug himself into a hole he couldn’t get out of. And now, here he was a 60-year-old man getting someone pregnant — and it was a baby girl.”
<p>De la Burde’s funeral was conducted by a minister who didn’t know him. The chapel at Joseph W. Bliley Funeral Home on Staples Mill Road was full. De la Burde’s former wife and daughters, Corinna and Colette, remained stoic.
<p>Monroe and her brood, sitting on a front row, wept openly. Following the service, still sobbing, they walked up the chapel’s center aisle entwined in a slow-moving huddle.
<p>A long procession wound its way toward the Hollywood Cemetery burial. De la Burde hadn’t made it into the city’s most prestigious clubs, but he had secured a place in Richmond’s venerable graveyard.

<p>About two days after de la Burde’s death, Powhatan authorities called in the State Police to help investigate the rare county shooting. Special Agent David M. Riley was assigned to the case.
<p>Riley testified that he fingered Monroe early in his investigation. 
<p>The prosecution characterized Monroe as a jealous woman unwilling to relinquish a tempestuous 11-year relationship to a younger woman.
<p>Riley said gun tests convinced him that the death was a homicide: “The test results actually had been completed and the results were as had actually been suspected; that is, the physical manipulation of the gun to leave certain residue and imprints and so forth, were not indicative of suicide but actually indicative of homicide, and suicide was highly unlikely, virtually impossible with what we observed.”
<p>Three months after de la Burde’s death, on June 3, Monroe left her Philip Morris office to meet Riley in Drewry’s Bluff in Chesterfield County. Riley told her that she would be indicted and encouraged her to confess.
<p>“Well, he told me if I forced him to be my enemy, that he had all these circumstances that he could use against me and no one would ever believe me, and that he could twist them any way he wanted. And he could make me out as the black spider of all time, and that I could be charged with first degree murder and no one would ever believe me,” Monroe testified.
<p>“And he went on and on and on like this, telling me all the terrible publicity with me, how my family would be ruined. As he went along, every time I tried to say anything, it was as though it had no meaning whatsoever. I said, ‘That is all wrong. This is not true.’ And he just kept on going.” 
<p>She was indicted on June 9. With Richmond lawyer Murray Janus trying her case, Monroe’s trial began Oct. 26, 1992. On Nov. 2, after deliberating for 90 minutes, the jury delivered the guilty verdict.
<p>“She said she was innocent, she still says she’s innocent, but the jury did not believe her,” surmises Janus. “They found the circumstantial evidence was satisfactory beyond a shadow of doubt, unfortunately.” 
<p>In December 1994, Monroe took her case to the Virginia State Court of Appeals. Peter Greenspun, a young Fairfax lawyer who had been a classmate of Katie’s at George Mason University, was hired for the appeal, which was denied. Last January, the state Supreme Court declined to hear her case.

<p><center><font size=2 color=#663333><pre>o      o      o      o      o</pre></font></center>

<p>During the appeals process, Monroe remained free on bond, but could not leave the Richmond area. She couldn’t drive to Williamsburg for daughter Shannon’s senior art show or graduation at the College of William & Mary. 
<p>Monroe took a job at a West End bookstore. “She had been a librarian in the past,” says Shannon, “so it was nice to go in and do something normal.”
<p>Monroe found solace working in her yard. “She has a farm mentality,” says Shannon, who moved in with her mother after college. “She mowed the grass, fixed the mailbox and pulled weeds. When she feels the world is closing in on her, she goes outside to prove the world is big and wide.”
<p>In January, her children drove her back to prison to begin serving her sentence. 
<p>Scanning the prison visitation room, abuzz with Sunday afternoon reunions, Beverly expresses an almost maternal interest in her fellow prisoners. She can relate something about the predicaments of many of them.
<p>“There is a unity and a bond among the women that allows them to show respect for each other and others,” Shannon Monroe says. “She feels there are a lot of people there she can help by listening and vice versa. It’s not as if she’s on an 
<p>island waiting to be saved. She’s optimistic.”
<p>Monroe passes time reading poetry — Yeats and Dylan Thomas are favorites.
<p>There are fewer tears these days when Monroe’s children leave the Pink Palace. Katie, Gavin and Shannon, whom their mother calls “my little band of bravehearts,” are undaunted.
<p>“It’s like being a prisoner of war,” says Katie. “There’s a certain satisfaction you’re right and you’ve been wronged. She has the facts on her side. In a generally depressing situation, she has some positive elements. I think human beings have amazing strength and don’t know it until they are tested.” 
<p>Says Gavin, “There are some people out there who would have given up, I’m sure it’s easy to do. You’ve got to keep plugging.” <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><font size=4><b>At Flagler Home, homeless women and children get two years to break the cycle of poverty and abuse.
</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i><b>by Elizabeth Cogar</b></i></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#333366><b>A</b></font> homeless woman on a city sidewalk at dusk, pushing a stroller loaded with blankets, baby bottles and plastic bags of clothing is one sight you’ll never forget. She’s got one child by the hand and another on her hip. She’s looking for a place to sleep.
<p>Passing her in your car you can’t help but notice and wonder. Where will she be late tonight when you’re watching the 11 o’clock news under clean sheets or tomorrow morning when you’re making coffee? And where will she be next year? Maybe on that same corner. But if her spirit survives, maybe she’ll resolve to find her way to a safe place where she can change things and make a better life.
<p>In this election season, there’s ample rhetoric about family values and education, employment and welfare. While politicians search for solutions, thousands of Virginians are in and out of homeless shelters, on and off jobs, starting out fresh and sputtering to new dead ends. 
<p>In Virginia, more than 70 percent of the homeless are children with single parents, usually mothers.
<p>Beyond the politics of welfare reform, there’s a Richmond program that, since 1989, has been quietly working to help homeless women and their children walk the walk, on their own. 
<p>Flagler Home at St. Joseph’s Villa is a two-year transitional living program that provides temporary housing and support for up to 27 homeless families. While there are other facilities that provide long-term housing for women and children in need, Flagler’s comprehensive, individualized continuum of care is unique in Virginia. The program is nationally recognized as a model for helping women help themselves out of the cycle of poverty and abuse. As Villa director Ray Pardue says, “We’re giving them a hand up, not a handout.
<p>“We are not an emergency facility,” he says. “Our vision is to provide long-term solutions and prevention of future homelessness. It’s a two- to four-year process, including after-care. This is not what welfare reform has envisioned, but it parallels what it’s about.” 
<p>What the government plan lacks, Pardue says, is an effective way to equip citizens to work. 
<p>“If you want to be successful and support a family you are going to have to go to school, be trained, learn to deal with authority figures and stop depending on everybody,” says Pardue.
<p>Women who land at Flagler Home are seeking refuge from a string of dead-ends — abusive relationships, unsuccessful attempts at employment, empty pockets and young mouths to feed. Most are on welfare and lack the know-how to get off.
<p>Becky Lee, program director for Flagler, says that part of what sets Flagler apart from other transitional programs is its all-encompassing nature. “The program is truly comprehensive and it’s structured around each individual family.” 
<p>The curriculum includes educational and vocational assessments, parenting skills and resources, counseling and housing guidance. “When your basic needs are being met, you can focus on the other issues.”
<p>The average stay is 14 or 15 months. “We’ve had women stay longer than the two years, maybe 26 months, while their housing situation was coming together. But they can’t stay here forever,” Pardue says. Women are given a second chance at Flagler “only if circumstances warrant it.” Pardue estimates that 80 percent of the women who complete the program improve their ability to live on their own independently. 
<p>Virginia Department of Social Services Commissioner Clarence H. Carter calls that number “a good success rate for an intensive remediation program.” Says Carter, “It’s truly different interventions in every community around the commonwealth that will get this job done. ... We need to find all possible mechanisms to help, and vehicles like Flagler Home do just that by addressing the needs of a portion of the case load.”
<p>When welfare reform kicks in next spring, families in need may find brief respite in shelters, but most are temporary solutions to deep-seated challenges. In two years a woman has long enough to take a breath, restore her family’s spirit and set a new plan into play, one that could last a lifetime. 
<p>In the front hall of Flagler Home a small sign hangs near the playroom door. Printed in bold black letters on hot pink poster paper: “When you believe you can, you can.” The maxim is easy to dismiss. The transformation of Kelly Howard, 32, who has taken the words to heart, is not.
<p>“I came here mad at the world,” she remembers of her arrival at Flagler Home a year ago. “I was too closed to myself and I wasn’t asking for the help that I needed. I wasn’t responding.” Fresh out of a bad situation, she says, “I was cautious and careful of our safety.”
<p>It’s hard to imagine. She is friendly, funny and relentlessly smiling. Her silky white blouse is tucked into jeans, hair smooth and pulled back in a clip, pink lipstick applied expertly. She’s chatting rapid-fire-style about bright possibilities for her future, eyes alive with the thrill of being on her own.
<p>How could this sunny woman ever have been so angry?  
<p>Howard grew up in Baltimore, one of three children. “I was raised by stepparents,” she says. Her childhood was not a cheery one. When her mother became unfit to raise Howard and her siblings, Howard spent some time in a foster home. Her guardians made sure she stayed in school where she discovered a love of art. “When I was 9 years old I drew an Indian, and it came out so much like the picture that I was like ‘whoa!’ I just kept drawing and coloring. I never liked reading so I spent more time marking in my notebook.” 
<p>Although Howard knew down deep that art was her first love, she tried other areas where she thought she’d make more money. After completing high school, she took early-childhood education classes at a community college and drove a school bus. But she kept coming back to art, learning how to airbrush and cut stencils at a graphics company. She moved to Hampton, where she worked as a bus driver and a service attendant in a garage.
<p>“I kept trying to sway away from art again. I became a jack of all trades,” she says. She eventually left the bus station to escape the fumes. By then, she had three children and was living with the father of her third child. The relationship was not a healthy one, and another escape would soon be necessary. 
<p>She remembers the day she knew she had to get out. “It was Mother’s Day and we had planned to take the kids to Busch Gardens, but I found out he had taken the money we had and spent it his way.” That way was crack cocaine. 
<p>“I fear violence — that’s not me, not my heart,” she says, “and the way things were going, somebody was going to get hurt. I said to myself, ‘This is not what my kids deserve.’”
<p>She packed up the kids and moved into a shelter in Hampton.
<p>With family hundreds of miles away, Howard found herself at a crossroads with no clear destination.
<p>Her former boyfriend had shown her Flagler Home on a trip through Richmond, and she felt it was a place where she could make a new start. The shelter in Hampton gave her the referral she needed to get in Flagler Home, and she moved into a second-story corner room in Building A a year ago with her three children.
<p>Adjusting to life in a crowd of women and children had its challenges. “Being in a group, you learn to accept people. Living here, you have to understand so many different things about people.” The families share a kitchen equipped with an industrial-strength Garland stove and separate refrigerators, a telephone and common areas. 
<p>Living at Flagler has also forced a turn to self-discovery. “Flagler helps you to balance-out things. At first I would not go to the staff for anything. I was so determined to do everything myself. I’ve had to learn how to reach out, sometimes tripping over rocks, and how to share myself and receive too.” 
<p>On a more formal level, like all Flagler residents, Howard met with staff to set goals and complete self-evaluations. Her to-do list included attending school and getting a certificate that she hopes will help her get a job in graphic art. Equally as important, she says, was “re-establishing a relationship with my kids. ... That was my main focus for a while. The bad relationship [with my boyfriend] had taken a toll. I had allowed someone to come into their lives and disrupt.”
<p>On the Villa’s 75-acre campus, grassy with Mediterranean tile-roofed buildings, her children attend the Janet Patton Lewis Child Development Center, play on a new playground and swim in the gymnasium’s pool. She buys her own groceries, but utilities are covered by the Villa. The second-floor corner room they all share, while crowded, is homey and comfortable. The place is neat — “The kids love tearin’ up and I love cleanin’ up,” she laughs. Together they hang out there watching TV and listening to music. “I like it quiet, just being a family. This is our home.”
<p>It may be only one room, but Howard’s ingenuity is in the details. Hats are perched on what’s left of a potted plant stalk; a Nerf basketball hoop hangs on a closet door. A solar system rendering she did for her daughter’s science class is taped outside the bathroom, which features six sinks, a holdover from the days when the building housed tens of orphans. She holds up a painting done on Masonite — “I like painting on boards, not paper, ’cause somebody could come by and ball it up.”
<p>Slowly shaking her head and grinning, she puzzles over how any woman at Flagler could possibly “cry the blues.” Her own assessment of the program is purely positive: “I don’t know how some people feel about coming here, but I think it’s a castle. This is a dream come true for me, to finally get support.”
<p>She plans to move out this month, when she’ll join the FITNESS program — Families in Transition in Need of Extra Support Services (see box) — and finally pursue that career in graphic art. 
<p>Howard says the stay at Flagler House has given her the time she needed to get her family and life back on-track and has also helped her learn from her own past. She watched her mother lose her children to foster care and resolved to do things differently. “I looked at them and said ‘no, I’m not gonna be like her.’” Her own children, she says, “are my world. If something happens to me, they’re gonna get tossed and turned the way I was.” 
<p>Her yearlong stay also leaves her with hope for the future. 
<p>“If [God] created all of this,” she says sweeping a hand toward the green freshly cut lawn in front of her cottage, “what can stop me? ... I just know my future is gonna be great. There’s so much out here to do. And Flagler will always be by my side — they’re family.” <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><font size=6 color=#333366>M<small>eeting a</small> N<small>eed</small></font>
<br><font size=5 color=#333366><b>E</b></font>stablished in 1834 as an orphanage and girls’ school, St. Joseph’s Villa has evolved as community needs change, but the non-sectarian, non-profit human services organization re-mains focused on the needs of area children and families. 
<p>The Villa provides respite care, housing for persons with disabilities, child care and education for learning-disabled children and those with emotional and behavioral problems. A Villa-operated emergency shelter offers short-term residential care and treatment for children who have experienced or witnessed abuse.   
<p>When the Villa opened its long-term shelter for women in 1989,  director Ray Pardue says it was “on a wing and a prayer. We had the facility and Emergency Shelter Inc. had the population.” ESI opened the program at the Villa, and women and their children began to arrive at the Villa’s two 9,400- square-foot “cottages,” some women driving cars packed full of possessions, others with only one change of clothes. ESI eventually turned the program over to the Villa but has recently opened its own transitional program.
<p>Setting up house for 27 families required considerable expense. Lawrence Lewis Jr., a Richmond philanthropist who directed his family’s Flagler Foundation until his death last year, took a special interest in the project. His original five-year financial commitment to the program has been extended indefinitely, Pardue says.
<p>“Lawrence Lewis and his family have been a guiding force in all of this. I’ve always felt like the Lewises were the key to our being successful. In social services you’re lucky if you get blessed once in life — this is our blessing,” Pardue says. Lewis’ wife, Janet, and his children and their families have continued the tradition; the Villa’s Child Development Center is named after Mrs. Lewis.  
<p>The Villa employs a clinical director and specialists in child care and family issues. Key to the success of Flagler’s residents, Pardue feels, is their self-governance — there’s no staff resident telling them when to clean up, how to live. “The risk is higher, but the payoff is better,” he says, explaining that you can’t treat adults like children, then ask them to go out on their own and live like adults. 
<p>At Flagler, 30 percent of the welfare benefits residents receive are turned over to Flagler as “rent” and held in an escrow account. When women leave Flagler, the money is returned to help them get established in a new dwelling.
<p>Applicants must meet certain qualifications, including one year of sobriety. “It’s for women who are motivated, are willing to risk and make some real changes in their lifestyle,” Pardue says of the program. “Some people don’t make it. They’re not ready.” 
<p>But many do make it. He tells of a former Flagler Home resident who stopped by his office recently to visit. She and her two children struggled out of an extremely abusive situation and found refuge at Flagler five years ago. “Now she’s a legal secretary. She told me, ‘Ray, I still struggle, but I’m in control of my life.’” <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><font size=6 color=#333366>W<small>elfare</small> R<small>eform </small>101</font>
<br><font size=5 color=#333366><b>T</b></font>he thrust of the 1996 welfare bill is to move 12.8 million welfare recipients off welfare and into work. The bill eliminates the guaranteed, open-ended handout that generations have collected, saving the federal government some $55 billion over six years. Democrats set up the original welfare system as part of the New Deal in 1935. It was meant to aid widows and orphans. In the new New Deal, welfare recipients will be weaned off benefits, required to work within two years and limited to a lifetime cap of five years’ of government aid. States must implement their own plans by April 1997 in accordance with federal guidelines.
<p>So what does this mean to women and their children living in poverty?
<p>In Richmond, where social services director Mike Evans says he’s already begun reforming the city’s welfare system, it means that women on welfare will be assessed for job potential, sent out to look for work if they have basic skills or taught how to if they don’t. They’ll receive assistance for medical and child-care costs. They’ve got two years to learn to stand alone, and the clock starts ticking next spring.
<p>“It’s a politically simplistic approach to what people ought to be able to do. The reality is that a large majority of people on welfare don’t have skills. They’re going to have to have a period of time where we try to teach them,” says St. Joseph’s Villa Director Ray Pardue. 
<p>At the Villa’s Flagler Home, women are given that time. “I’ve seen women just blossom.”
<p>Like Pardue, Emergency Shelter, Inc. (ESI) Executive Director Janice Fatzinger is concerned that welfare reform is not focusing enough on job training. “I’ve seen people who are not job-ready, who don’t have a strong work ethic, who come from several generations of welfare, can’t hold a job.”
<p>Ultimately, the lost jobs due to underqualification take a toll on the children who live with those women. “The fastest growing homeless group in the U.S. is children age 5 and under, and we see it. To me, that is depressing.” Fatzinger adds that 90 days — the time allotted individuals who are fortunate enough to get a bed at the Emergency Shelter or the Salvation Army — “is not long enough when you’re dealing with increasingly complex problems.  ... There’s a huge need for a place where people can stabilize their lives.” 
<p>Two weeks ago ESI opened its own transitional living facility with room for 17 families to stay two years. It’s similar to Flagler’s program though not in competition — plenty of women and children are waiting for beds. “We just really need Flagler,” says Fatzinger. “It’s going to continue to be extremely important. If you’ve been living pillar to post with no experience budgeting, no GED, this gives you the opportunity to get your life together.”

<br><font size=5 color=#333366><b>F</b></font>or Fawzia Abdelbaki, 34, her two years at Flagler Home were more than a respite — they were her ticket to freedom. A farm girl from Egypt who had moved to the United States with her arranged-marriage spouse, Abdelbaki had been confined to her home for eight years. Her husband forbade her to leave the house without him, per the Egyptian tradition, and he emotionally and physically abused her to boot. She couldn’t speak any English, save what she’d learned from watching TV, had no friends and didn’t even know her own address.
<p>One day she scribbled down the YWCA’s phone number while watching a special TV report on spousal abuse. Two years later, she made the call, uttering the simple phrase, “I need help, I need help.” The YWCA rescued Abdelbaki and her three children. Several months later the YWCA’s Battered Women’s Shelter referred her to Flagler.
<p>While at Flagler, Abdelbaki learned how to catch a city bus, drive a car, speak English, interview for jobs, make friends — basics for most of us, but foreign to a woman who had never been allowed independence. Leaving Flagler was scary, she concedes, but the staff supported her every step of the way. “They kept telling me ‘you can do it.’” Today, she holds a full-time job at a mortgage company and plans on buying the house she rents in six months.
<p>For some women and children who move on from Flagler Home, the challenge of re-establishing their lives in the community requires a safety net. 
<p>The Community FITNESS (Families in Transition in Need of Extra Support Services) Program is an extension of the mission of St. Joseph’s Villa, which is to serve children in need and their families by providing effective, innovative programs. The program bridges the gap between Flagler and the real world by helping families find permanent housing and plan for the future.
<p>FITNESS is administered by the Villa with a supportive service grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Participants get help with their housing search and start-up costs, transportation, child care, parenting and scholarships, as well as financial planning, budget monitoring, health and mental support, independent-living skills workshops and job search and training options.

<font size=7 color=#333366>A Matter of Time</font>
<br><font size=4><b>With burgeoning neighbors wanting their land, the clannish people of Oregon Hill face an unsure future.
</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i><b>by Lisa Antonelli Bacon</b></i></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#333366><b>I</b></font>t’s a scrappy piece of land that starts at Belvidere and ends at Hollywood Cemetery, roughly bounded by Cary Street on the north and the James River on the south. Spittin’ distance from the white columns and rolling green grass of Ethyl Corporation, Oregon Hill repeatedly has been the issue in turf wars. They began more than 30 years ago, when outsiders — students and speculators — started moving in. The late ’70s brought more change, with VCU seeking to take over pieces of the Hill in its quest for expansion.
<p>Now neighboring Ethyl Corporation has taken back 13 residences it owns on the Hill, evicting the residents and possibly shrinking the 500-house neighborhood. Ethyl spokesman Prescott Rowe says the corporation hasn’t yet decided what will be done with the houses. On Sept. 4, however, Ethyl officials had an informal dinner meeting with six representatives of Oregon Hill. The result of that meeting, according to Kelley Lane of the Save Oregon Hill Organization, was an agreement to “explore alternatives to tearing down the houses.” 
<p>Through it all, people have stayed on the Hill, like their mothers and fathers before them. More change seems inevitable for Oregon Hill, which has changed relatively little for an urban neighborhood bounded by a growing campus and an expanding corporation. With so many questions surrounding the neighborhood’s future, it seems a good time to learn about its past and the people who give the neighborhood its character.

<p><center><font size=5 color=#333366><b>&#149 &#149 &#149</b></font></center>
<p>Come-heres frequently are heard to moan that Richmond society is hard to crack. They don’t know the half of it. These days, with some money and a few well-placed friends, almost anybody can join The Country Club of Virginia. The Commonwealth Club is even more accessible. And even if certain parvenus aren’t really treated like insiders at venerable old Richmond institutions, gestures are made, invitations extended, to give the appearance of acceptance. For even the landed gentry know they can’t continue to exist without an occasional infusion of money and influence from beyond Richmond’s environs.
<p>Not so Oregon Hill. There was a time — about 100 years, until the 1950s — when people didn’t leave the Hill, except to work. Not for schooling, not for entertainment, certainly not to marry (which gave rise to tales of cousins coupling with cousins, and even closer relations). It wasn’t until the 1960s, when VCU students moved their stereos and tie-dyes into the Hill’s ramshackle structures, that people outside the Hill took notice. In the 30 years since, a few commercial enterprises — Zahara’s Fine Food Superet, Pine Street Hair Shop, and Mamma ’Zu — have thrived. Not counting, of course, the Chuck Wagon, a bar serving a select clientele of hardcore locals and folks who have moved away from the Hill.  
<p>Named for the state which, in 1845, was embroiled in a boundary dispute, Oregon Hill is a place out of time. Crime there, like house prices, has always undercut more desirable parts of town. Rich in history, the neighborhood played an important role in the Civil War. In the dark of predawn hours, thick-armed ironworkers — described by historian Samuel Mordecai as “a hardy and industrious and fiery race” — left their homes on the Hill for Tredegar Iron Works where they cast the hot, molten iron that would become the Confederate arsenal. And it was there, in Belvidere Baptist Church, that the famous Bread Riots of 1863 took root, culminating in a starving populace storming stores for food. While other neighborhoods around the country have changed with city growth, county development and, until the mid-’70s, white flight, Oregon Hill has remained primarily white and working class since its beginning in the 1840s.
<p>But those are only historical facts and surface observations that just about any Richmonder can spout. The real Oregon Hill is harder to find. And even harder to know.

<p><center><font size=5 color=#333366><b>&#149 &#149 &#149</b></font></center>
<p>The musicians, artists and professors who are considered newcomers to Oregon Hill (even after they’ve lived there 20 years) are quick to point out the eccentricities that drew them there. They proudly point to characters with names like Catfish, Apple Butter and Butter Beans as local color. Facts, no doubt, have been embroidered with myth over the years. True or not, some stories are too good to let go of, like the one about a fellow named Spark Plug who stole hams off boxcars, placing one on each doorstep for Christmas dinner.
<p>But real Hill folk know fact from fiction. David Shankle, 36, a second-generation Hillian and a handyman by trade, is one of many such local historians who learned their subject from elders who sat and watched, from the inside, for many years. For instance, a visitor wants to know, is it true that Butterbeans has a dog named Doo-Doo?
<p>“Naw,” says Shankle. So much for myth.
<p>“Doo-doo died years ago.”
<p>On a hot August afternoon, Shankle sits in cutoffs, T-shirt and a ponytail that hasn’t seen soap lately in front of an empty Cary Street building where he’s been working. Raised on the Hill like his mother before him, he’s wary of outsiders, because outsiders, in his opinion, haven’t shown the proper respect for Oregon Hill. “This neighborhood used to run from Meadow to Second Street,” he says. “You can see how much has been torn away.” 
<p>Shankle has a point. Corporations like Albemarle, James River and Ethyl long ago supplanted the neighborhood’s downtown quadrant that once lay south of the former Penitentiary. Then, VCU’s growth made it apparent that encroachment would be an ongoing issue, and natives and newcomers banded together to form a resistance. Seeking to hold their ground, groups like Oregon Hill Home Improvement Council and Save Oregon Hill Organization came together. In 1978, when VCU wanted to tear down the city’s oldest subsidized housing to make room for the ever-expanding urban campus, the Hill prevailed. Then, in 1989, VCU wanted to demolish buildings north of the expressway — some three square blocks and 100 houses — to make way for dormitories and athletic facilities. But the Hill won that round, too, as well as an agreement that the university would look elsewhere as it needs to expand. 
<p>“(VCU President Dr. Eugene Trani) made a commitment not to go (into Oregon Hill) and will stick to it,” says VCU spokeswoman Melissa Burnside. “VCU and Oregon Hill have a cordial relationship.” 
<p>The relationship became somewhat strained last year when VCU moved the historic Jacob House to make room for its School of Engineering. The school’s long-range plans include the possibility of putting a building there sometime after 1998. 
<p>Such developments, make even newcomers, like 20-year-resident Charles Pool, suspicious.
<p>Pool, who is active in both Oregon Hill preservation organizations, and other restorers and rehabbers once ruffled natives, who viewed gentrification as a threat.
<p>But newcomers and established Hillians share a common concern. They’re all worried the neighborhood will shrink like 100 percent cotton in a Laundromat dryer. “We don’t know what’s going to become of the Hill,” says Pool.
<p>To Shankle, oddities like the late Catfish and Apple Butter, whom he remembers walking the neighborhood swinging a banjo or blowing a harmonica, are just life as he knows it. “Apple Butter was just an average Joe,” he says. “He served his time in the war, had a couple marriages go sour. He turned to drinking. Then he was binging full time.” He remembers Catfish jumping off Lee Bridge into the canal that’s no longer there. “He was a little slow, so people picked on him.”
<p>Like any old-line Richmonder who revels in the depth of his ancestral roots, he is proud that there are families who have been on the Hill for as many as five generations. But unlike other neighborhoods, where social mobility has diluted bloodlines, Hillians have pretty much stuck to their own, from the early stages of settlement, right on up to the present generation of middle-aged adults. Shankle confesses to “marrying off the Hill,” which means that even though his estranged wife grew up on the Hill, her parents did not.
<p>Over the last 20 years, he says, things have loosened up a little. But not much. “A lot of these people don’t like change. They like things the way they always were. That’s why they live on the Hill. It hasn’t changed much.”
<p>Catherine Tate doesn’t see much of the Hill anymore. Confined to her Laurel Street home by a bad back and an 86-year-old husband with Alzheimer’s, she doesn’t have much occasion to enjoy the sight of beautiful but modest old clapboard cottages butting up to asphalt-shingled hovels; of fluffy, fuchsia crepe myrtles shading houses with hopelessly peeling paint; of neighbors tightly gathered in a clutch of kitchen chairs to pass the day on someone’s front porch. Even if she could stroll the neighborhood again, she probably wouldn’t notice the knee-high pile of empty Bud Light cans stacked against a plastic swimming pool in a front yard. She might even miss the house on whose red front door is stenciled “Hugh P. Fisher Jr. In God We Trust.”
<p>Perhaps she’s better off missing those things. The Oregon Hill of her memories was a neighborly place. When she moved to the Hill more than 50 years ago, Catherine Tate was fresh off her daddy’s Hanover farm. Married at 15, she moved to the Hill with the man who is still her husband. “If one got sick, another would take care of ’em,” she says of old neighbors. “Most all them people are dead now.”
<p>Next door, a middle-aged woman, whose own roots clearly are closer to Fifth Avenue than to Pine Street, eyeballs Mrs. Tate’s yard, trying not to be obvious. She forgets herself and locks on a cluster of large marigolds sprouting from a planter made from an old tire.
<p>“Honey,” the woman calls to her daughter in the doorway, “hydrangeas would look nice here, don’t you think?”
<p>“Bye, Mom.” The front door slams with a bang.
<p>Even though newcomers have brought change, and change that many natives don’t appreciate, Mrs. Tate won’t leave. The only other place she’s ever been except for the Hanover farm was Louisa, which she visited once. “My daughter said they’d help me if I’d move out of here, but I won’t go. I’m used to being here. Only thing I know is Oregon Hill.”

<p>Don Carver and Mike Gahan were pioneers when they bought houses in Oregon Hill some 20 years ago. Coming from Fredericksburg, Carver found house costs on the Hill closer to what he expected than costs in other areas of Richmond. “I went to rent a house,” says Carver, “but it was so cheap, I bought one.” That was 1976. Carver’s house on South Laurel cost him all of $6,500. Ten years later, he bought the 1,200-square-foot house next door — almost identical to his first purchase — for $16,500. Back then, Gahan counted only seven owner-occupants on the 400 block of South Laurel. The rest were rentals.
<p>The next year, Gahan moved in across the street from Carver and rehabbed his house into a lovely little cottage with a flower garden and a fish pond. Before he bought it, there were three generations — he estimates 12 or 13 people — living in the 1,300 square feet he bought. It was a fitting introduction to the neighborhood, where a family a few doors down was without water for six months. “They used to walk across the street to a neighbor’s house to use the bathroom.”
<p>Gahan brought his business, a hair salon on the University of Richmond campus, with him. He moved it into Pine Street Barber Shop, where Hillians had been getting haircuts since the 1940s. He spruced up the place, but he kept a lot of the remnants of the old barber shop and one of its barbers who has since retired. He wanted the old shop to be different from his West End venue, but he didn’t want to put off locals. A lot of his clientele followed him.
<p>“We had a lot to do with people noticing Oregon Hill,” says Gahan of the hair shop. “We were an alternative haircutting joint that was a step up from the old barber shop, without the fluff of a Main Street hair salon. People like that, and the prices are reasonable.”
<p>By the 1980s, when Pine Street Barber Shop had become a hip place among Fan dwellers and Main Street business people, the number of owner/occupants on South Laurel’s 400 block had swelled to 25. But in the last two years, Gahan and others lament, many houses have become vacant, left to rot. Nonetheless, business is still good. So good, in fact, that Gahan has turned his shop into a full-service salon and changed the name to Pine Street Hair, dropping “Barber” from the name.
<p>Up the street from Pine Street Hair, Mamma ’Zu, an Italian restaurant of considerable reputation, draws people from all over the city for its great cuisine and its Bohemian atmosphere. Owner Ed Vasaio, who has lived on the Hill since 1985, says he wouldn’t live anywhere else.
<p>After spending much of his childhood in his father’s popular Washington, D.C., restaurant, Vasaio sees a similar romanticism here. Sipping a glass of Corvo Bianco at a picnic table behind his Pine Street house, he can see the string of plastic lanterns on the front porch and the different colored panes of glass in the window of the house behind him. “I like the way it looks,” he says. “Litter in the alleys, bombed-out cars. It’s real life. There’s no attempt to mask anything.”
<p>Despite a prevailing us-them mentality, Vasaio mixes with the natives as best he can. He notes that each block seems to have its matriarch or patriarch. A native named Ben Harris was the elder on Vasaio’s block. “When I was first doing the restaurant, Ben kept me strong-minded, strong-willed. He kept me believing in what I was doing.” Last winter, Harris died. “I lost a good friend,” says Vasaio.
<p>Not all newcomers break the inner circle, though. And that’s been a fact for the 150 years since the area got its name. In 1950, Mary Wingfield Scott wrote that, despite the “interesting fact” that two of the houses there “were built by free Negroes, the Hill has remained fiercely white, at least two near-riots having occurred in this general neighborhood when colored people attempted to move in in recent years.” Hillians, both newcomers and natives, point out that people of other races have indeed moved in at various times. And moved out pretty quickly. Gahan says that the “occasional Vietnamese or Salvadoran” doesn’t seem to stay “much more than three or four years.”  
<p>Zahara’s owner Sunita Mittal, an Indian, says she hasn’t had any trouble. But she might be one of the very few immigrants who has made peace with the neighborhood. Carver and his companion of 15 years, Barbara D’Adamo, say there’s no Welcome Wagon for African-Americans coming to the neighborhood.
<p>“Blacks have moved in before and had very few problems,” says Carver. “But they always seem to move out after a year or so. People weren’t necessarily very neighborly.” Carver does remember, though, a black couple who lived in the neighborhood for 10 or 15 years without incident. “They were both blind,” notes D’Adamo.

<p><center><font size=5 color=#333366><b>&#149 &#149 &#149</b></font></center>
<p>Even though historians and Richmond natives might strongly hold that Oregon Hill hasn’t changed in 150 years, those on the inside say things are different now. Whereas 50 years ago the neighborhood was nearly empty during work hours, now you’ll find many residents at home during the day or visiting on each other’s porches. One resident, who declined to be identified, says drug use is a growing problem. Says another resident who prefers not to be named, “What was once working class largely has become welfare class.”
<p>Instead of one big neighborhood where everyone knew everyone and many were related, now “there are communities within the community,” says Vasaio, counting students, artists and musicians, natives, and newcomers “who want to make it like the Fan.” And the natives still aren’t too receptive of newcomers. Even though she’s dug in, Mrs. Tate thinks gentrifiers are the ruin of the Hill. “The new people moved in, and they just don’t care.”
<p>Meanwhile, a once-talkative David Shankle has had enough of inquisitive visitors for this day. His short answers signal he’s said all he’ll say about the color and character of his lifelong neighborhood. Perhaps he’s right about one thing: Some things should stay on the Hill. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<br><font size=4><i><b>Dynamite performances launch UR’s new Modlin Center for the Arts.</b></i></font>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#aa9933><b><tt>T</tt></b></font>he first day of classes doesn’t seem any different from any other first day at the University of Richmond. Bewildered freshmen wander beneath the high Gothic arches, clutching their schedules and stopping to ask directions to music appreciation or elementary drawing. 
<p>But today isn’t just another first day — these students are wandering through the brand-new George M. Modlin Center for the Arts, a $24 million complex that’s about to burst onto the arts scene next month.
<p>Modlin is UR’s Chancellor Emeritus, and the building bearing his name is the largest building project in the West End university’s history.
<p>In the first week in October, the freshly painted performance spaces will be filled with brass quintets playing Bach and Dixieland, tap dancing, Renaissance choral music, and the famed juggling of the Flying Karamazov Brothers.
<p>The university has made a point of opening the center with a bang.
<p>The diversity of acts mirrors the diversity of vision and purpose for the Modlin Center. While at first glance the center seems to be a fancy new academic building for arts students, a closer study finds more. The theaters, studios, galleries and courtyard create a place where both the university community and the people of Richmond can experience culture and art — together in high style.
<p>An equal balance of community members, faculty and students is Kathy Panoff’s ideal audience for any performance, lecture or showing at the Modlin Center. Panoff, the director of the center, is charged with bringing the multiple visions of the arts complex into reality.
<p>First, the complex is a functional space for students. The scenery shops, experimental black box theater, art studios and music hall are classrooms where students can practice in a state-of-art space.
<p>Art, music and visual arts disciplines living under the same roof is a unique situation for a university, Panoff says. At other colleges, the departments may be on opposite sides of the campus. Having all three in the same building gives a “great sense of flow” between the different areas of art, allowing students and faculty work together, incorporating the arts.
<p>Planning for the center started with function, says David Leary, dean of arts and sciences at UR. In the early 1990s, the university began “bottom up” by asking faculty what they wanted in a new center. 
<p>“It was a complicated process,” Leary says. “If we had just had one idea or architect, the project would have gone a lot quicker.”
<p>However, the results of the consensus planning seem to be the best facilities for all disciplines. The painting and drawing studios on the third floor are flooded with light and have open, vaulted ceilings that look like New York studios. The music hall, which was once UR’s main theater, has an expanded stage wide enough for an entire orchestra, and acoustics that make the slightest sound reverberate through the hall. The new main-stage theater is built in a thrust configuration, where the farthest seat in the balcony is practically on top of the stage, giving a sense of intimacy in a room that seats between 500 and 580.
<p>But the center wasn’t built for just art students. Exposing all students to the arts is part of the liberal arts education. UR and the arts are firmly rooted in the liberal arts tradition, says Jack Welsh, UR theater director. Welsh believes that participating in theater or other arts gives students a cultured mind, effective communication skills and a mature way of understanding different experiences.
<p>Panoff knows that it will take some persuading to convince the student body that the arts aren’t just for art students, and she’s planning to win those students over one event at a time.
<p>“My goal is to get as many people through that front door in the first year as I can,” Panoff says. “Then they become vested in what we’re doing here and will return.”
<p>Leary knows a city of arts patrons will be drawn to UR like never before. “By enhancing the quality and quantity of performing arts events and visual arts exhibitions on campus ... they will provide continual opportunities for stronger relations with our surrounding community,” he says. “This will be good for us, for our students and hopefully for our neighbors as well.”
<p>Panoff is drawing people to the center with a hip marketing campaign dubbed “Not Your Father’s Wingtips.” The cover of the first season’s brochure features paint-splattered wingtips stuffed with sheet music, paint and brushes, a play bill and a microphone.
<p>Making the arts less mysterious to students and others is one of Panoff’s goals because she feels strongly about the different worlds that art can open.
<p>“This center will bring diversity,” Panoff says, gesturing to the blank gallery walls that will soon be hung with art from around the world. “There are no cultural barriers in art. Exposure to art can open up the world of diversity on this planet.”
<p>This diversity will be evident when “Seeing Across Cultures,” a combination class/lecture series/exhibition begins. Art from Asia, Africa, Europe and North America will be on display in one of the galleries, says Doug Sattheson, a UR studio art graduate who now works as a curator at the center. Halfway through the course, students can suggest a rearrangement of the exhibit, placing pieces in a way they think best represents the way the cultures relate to one another.
<p>This project — and many others — are possible because of the function of the buildings. The new galleries have more space and security than the hallway where art was previously displayed at UR, Sattheson says. The improvements allow UR to bring not only the multicultural pieces from several different collections, but exhibits from the National Gallery of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
<p>Those are just a few of the big names in art that the Modlin Center will be bringing to Richmond. Making an impact on the arts community in the city is another vision for the complex.
<p>The state-of-the-art performance areas will draw national acts who have never been to Richmond before, Panoff says.
<p>“It’s going to put Richmond on the arts map,” Panoff says.
<p>In the Modlin Center’s Inaugural Series — all free events — (October to April) Dance Theatre of Harlem, the Shanghai Quartet, pianist Ruth Laredo playing with the Shanghai Quartet, Canadian Brass and Manhattan Tap and the Hard Bop Trio are all scheduled to perform. Tickets have to be reserved in advance.
<p>The Great Performances series runs from October to February and features comedy troupe Reduced Shakespeare Company presenting “The Complete History of America (Abridged)”; jazz pianist Marcus Roberts presenting “Portraits in Blue,” his interpretation of Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s and members of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra; and Mazowsze, the 90-member State Folk Song and Dance Ensemble of Poland.
<p>UR’s University Players will present a “Season of Winners,” including Tony award winner “Into the Woods,” “The Heidi Chronicles” and “King Lear,” which will feature stage and screen actor Ralph Waite.
<p>The Marsh Art Gallery will feature exhibits such as a late-20th-century furniture exhibit which includes works by Roy Lichtenstein and Scott Burton, a still-life exhibit from the Metropolitan featuring works by Georgia O’Keeffe and others, and a 1970s exhibition with works from Andy Warhol and others.
<p>If there is any criticism that Richmond is too small a city to support this many performances and another arts center, Panoff is quick to quiet it. 
<p>“More is better,” she says. “Here at the university, we’re breeding a new generation of patrons for the arts. People will leave this place and make art an important part of their lives, their friends’ lives and their families’ lives.”
<p>This is not an unreachable goal for a woman who says “the sky’s the limit” when asked about the future of the center. It is a sentiment echoed by both administration and faculty at UR, and it seems to forecast possibilities much higher than the vaulted ceilings for the Modlin Center.<img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

<a name="#mark"><font size=5><b>The Running Man</b></font></a>
<br><font size=5><i>Candidate Mark Warner’s running the race of his life, and the clock is ticking.</i></font>
<h3><i>by Greg Weatherford</i></h3><p>
<hr size=1>

<font size=6><b>H</b></font>e’s running again. Literally.
<p>U.S. Senate candidate and gazillionaire Mark Warner trots through the shadowy Farmers Market restaurant in Petersburg, accosting people waiting in line at the cholesterol-soaked lunch buffet stocked with fried chicken, fried pork chops and fried fish. 
<p>“Hey, how are ya?” he says cheerfully, flashing big teeth. “Mind if I say hello? Mark Warner. Running for the U.S. Senate.” 
<p>He moves quickly from one customer to another. His style: First, a handshake — firm, but not too firm; senatorial, you might say. Sometimes a little talking, a little joking around. He gazes intensely into people’s eyes when he speaks to them. Sometimes he grips their biceps in his right hand as though to emphasize his connection, his understanding of their lives. Regular folks. 
<p>He’s wearing average-guy clothes: khaki pants; a blue pinstripe oxford shirt, sleeves rolled up; a tie, not too flashy. 
<p>“I know who you are,” says Margaret Humphries as Warner canters to her table. “I’ve seen you on TV.” She’s a grandmotherly woman out for lunch with her sister, Nancy Meade, and her mother, Barbara Browden. They look at Warner with amusement and a little surprise, as though Jay Leno had materialized in front of them. 
<p>“How’s it going?” asks Warner. 
<p>“Not too bad,” Humphries replies. “You going to pay for my lunch?” 
<p>Warner laughs largely, pats his pockets. “Sorry! Don’t have enough on me.” 
<p>The women laugh, and Warner soon bounces on, going around the room, shaking hands at every table in the place. He works the line like a pro — which he is. Though this is the first time he’s been a candidate, he’s been involved in politics since the 1970s. 
<p>With Warner gone, the women admit they are all Republicans. “I’m sure he’s a fine man, and I admire him for making it on his own,” Humphries says. “But I can’t vote for a Democrat.”
<p>She thinks for a moment. “Isn’t he a millionaire or something?”
<p>OK, let’s get this out of the way: Mark Warner is rich. Really rich. By his lonesome he’s richer than many corporations. In his 1994 tax returns, the most recent he’s made public, he paid more than $3 million to the IRS on income of $11 million. He’s worth more than $100 million, according to his campaign-finance reports. 
<p>The fact is, Warner could be doing anything. He could sit on the beach all day. He could take up painting. He could squire his family around tropic islands, sucking placidly on straws stuck into coconut shells. 
<p>Instead, he’s dropped at least $2.3 million of his own money on this race. He’s driving in a van seven days a week, campaigning against apparent Senator-for-Life John Warner, an 18-year veteran who has a 25-point lead in the polls. 
<p>No one can say he’s not doing it vigorously. “Most politicians in parades, they sit on the float and wave, you know,” Warner says. “I get out and run up one side of the crowd and around, back around the other side. Shaking hands.” He chuckles, delighted by the image. 
<p>The idea behind this road race is to get Warner’s face out among the people, to be able to say that he’s been to every jurisdiction in Virginia — all 135 of them. He’s using every opportunity to point out that his opponent doesn’t work for the vote as hard as he does.
<p>“I hope to goodness that someone will go behind me and check that I’ve been to every event and every jurisdiction,” Warner hints to a couple of reporters. 
<p>And, later: “Everybody I talk to out there around the state has a vivid memory of when [John Warner] was last around with Elizabeth Taylor.” That would have been in the ’70s, when Sen. Warner was the actress’ seventh husband. 
<p>Nonetheless, the polls are abysmal for Mark Warner, and they drive him onward. He’s shaken thousands of hands, popping into every mom-and-pop shop in his way. It’s as though he’s swimming gamely, furiously, against the current. 
<p><center><img src="./images/feat35-1.jpg" align=right width=250 height=444 border=3 alt="<p>Image: [Thanks to an advertising blitz, most Virginians now know who Mark Warner is, according to a recent poll. But Warner’s still trying to shake the incumbent’s lead — one hand at a time.]<p>"></center>
<br clear=all>He battles through each day from dawn to bedtime, with barely a break between. Mornings start around 7:30. Then he does a couple of morning radio shows. Then at least one breakfast meeting, often two. From 9:30 a.m. to 11 a.m., it’s time to meet the press for a round of interviews. Then lunch meetings with local Democrats. Then a tour of a ball-bearing plant or some such thing. After that, an evening fund-raiser. 
<p>Not to mention the door-knocking and the obligatory stops at barber shops. Warner loves barber shops. “Barbers and beauticians love to talk about who’s been to see them,” Warner notes. “Word will get out, especially in these smaller communities.” 
<p>On this day, he travels through Petersburg with a hovering flock of city sheriff’s deputies. He barges endlessly into restaurants, beauty shops and car-parts emporiums. Everywhere, he shakes hands. “Hey, how are ya?” he says again and again. “Mind if I say hello? Mark Warner. Running for the U.S. Senate.” 
<p>Each stop’s events are planned by local Democrats. In the afternoon, Warner heads to Republican-rich Prince George County, where few show up for a halfhearted rally. Warner is left to lope through the nearly empty halls of the county’s police department and government center, introducing himself to a handful of startled secretaries. 
<p>Although he later makes it obvious that he’s upset by the county’s poor turnout, he doesn’t let that show as he makes his rounds. “Hey, how are ya?” he says gamely, big teeth gleaming. 
<p>As advertised, Warner travels in a plum-colored Ford Windstar minivan complete with a nasty scrape on the right side. It’s his wife’s car, he says, and he’s logged 5,000 miles in it the last few weeks. 
<p>“My staff’s idea of a day off over the last two weeks was to give me Sunday night off, from 6 o’clock on,” he says while riding in his van, straining his seat belt to peer around his seat. “There are days when I’ve been bone-tired. It’s not the kind of tired you get over after seven hours of sleep.”
<center>
<hr size=1 width=50%></center>

<p><font size=6><b>W</b></font>hy is he doing this? 
<p>Warner says he’s running to give Virginians a plausible choice, and to make his case for issues he believes in: abortion rights, education, the role of the technological revolution that made his fortune.  
<p>He says that John Warner, the silver-haired, cocksure senior senator from Virginia, has lost touch with average folks. Between the lines he makes it clear that the senator’s avuncular condescension gets on his nerves.
<p>Despite his millions, Warner says, he’s out there and talking to folks. And, he adds, he would listen in the Senate. 
<p>Other observers have other ideas. 
<p>“When you’re worth as much as he is,” says Larry Sabato, a political analyst at the University of Virginia, “you don’t have to win your first election. You could run a campaign on the interest of the money in the bank. ... You could be building for the future.” 
<p>Sabato suggests that Mark Warner’s fight for John Warner’s job could be an introductory gambit to succeed U.S. Sen. Charles “Chuck” Robb, a Democrat, in 2000. Robb could retire from the Senate, Sabato says, leaving an open seat for Warner to fill.
<p>After this campaign, Sabato says, voters would say about Mark Warner, “We want to see more of this young man. He runs a good campaign and he seems like a nice guy.” 
<p>Fellow political pundit Robert Holsworth of Virginia Commonwealth University scoffs at that idea, saying Robb is unlikely to step down. If he doesn’t, Warner probably won’t contest him, Holsworth adds. 
<p>There’s a story there, of course, but to get to it one must know a little about Mark Warner. 
<p>He started as the son of a middle-level insurance executive in Indiana. Though his family moved to Connecticut in the 1960s, his voice — all flat vowels and emphatic, rat-a-tat delivery — still reflect his Midwest upbringing. He retains a Hoosier’s obsession with basketball: He hauls a ball with him on the campaign trail, and his aides joke that before being hired they had to agree to join his basketball team. 
<p>You can learn a lot about Warner’s political style by watching his basketball game. Though not the most elegant player on the court, he fights hard for points, shoving his way through a crowd. He hustles. 
<p>To judge from his history, Warner always drove himself harder than other people. He graduated as valedictorian from George Washington University, a school he chose largely because of its location near the U.S. Capitol. He went on to Harvard Law School, hardly a place for slackers, and graduated in 1980. On his off time, he worked for Connecticut politicians.
<p>Warner then worked as a fund-raiser for the Democratic National Committee for two years before leaving to try his hand at business. The first two tries — marketing a device to burn factory emissions, then a real estate firm  — flopped. The first lasted six weeks; the second lived six months. 
<p>Then a Connecticut real-estate developer agreed to put up $1 million to back him in the untested cellular-telephone business. 
<p>That’s when he made money. Big money. Bigger than most people’s craziest Lotto dreams. 
<p>He never lost his love of politics, though. In the mid-1980s Warner moved to Alexandria partly to be near Lisa Collis, his future wife; perhaps not coincidentally, the city also is a short drive from both Washington, D.C., and Richmond. 
<p>By 1989, Warner had entered Virginia politics by helping Democrat L. Douglas Wilder’s campaign to become the country’s first elected African-American governor. Four years later, Warner was elected state Democratic Party chairman. In that post he helped pull together the party, which had been stymied by recent Republican successes in the General Assembly and in Washington. 
<p>By the 1994 senatorial race between Robb and Republican Oliver North, the time was right for Warner to step out as a candidate. 
<p>Robb, staggering from scandals about behavior even he called “unworthy of a gentleman” — most notoriously a nude massage from a 20-something Virginia Beach woman — was seen as vulnerable. And Ollie North was tarred by his involvement with the Iran-Contra controversy. 
<p>Another principal opponent, Wilder, dallied for months before announcing an abortive campaign as an independent, thus giving up the Democratic nomination and the party apparatus that comes with it. 
<p>All told, a Senate seat seemed ripe for the picking. “That was [Warner’s] better chance,” Holsworth says. “Warner could have beaten Robb handily.”
<p>But Warner finally decided not to attack Robb and unleash an ugly battle within his party, Holsworth says. Instead, as head of the state Democratic Party he worked for Robb’s eventual win. 
<p>“He didn’t have the desire to fight inside the Democratic Party,” Holsworth says. That would have been “bad for the party and unappealing to him,” Holsworth adds.
<p>After Robb’s convincing trouncing of the well-funded and charismatic North — a drubbing Warner worked hard to achieve — Robb now seems far less beatable, Holsworth says. 
<p>So Warner, like any aggressive athlete, took the next shot offered: taking down Sen. John Warner, the most popular politician in Virginia. In any other campaign, observers say, he would have a chance.
<p>“Mark’s very bright, he’s energetic, he’s extraordinarily talented in business,” Holsworth says. “He’s a very attractive, appealing candidate. He should have a future. But he couldn’t have picked a tougher race.” 
<p>Back in the van, Warner reflects on what he’s learned from his time with two of the state’s most successful Democrats — Wilder and Robb. 
<p>“They’ve both fought through adversity to be successful,” Warner says. “They’re both good friends. ... I’ve learned something about charm from Doug [Wilder]. He’s one of the most charming people I’ve ever met.
<p>“From Chuck [Robb]? During the 1994 campaign I learned a lot about determination,” he continues. He grins, a little ruefully. 
<p>“From Chuck, I’ve seen this kind of dogged determination to fight through brick walls.” 
<p>Then Mark Warner goes back to work. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top width=17 height=18>

<br><font size=5><i>Warner stoops to conquer an opponent he finds unworthy of the right.</i></font>
<h3><i>by John W. Maloney</i></h3><p>
<hr size=1>
<font size=6><b>I</b></font>n the autumn of his third term as a United States senator, John William Warner isn’t campaigning through Southside Virginia — he’s on tour.
<p>When he gets out of the car, there isn’t a poster, button or pin in sight that signals this man is a candidate for re-election. To Warner, it’s not a contest at all. The polls support that — with margins of 25 percent being reported in his favor. 
<p>The S&S Barbecue restaurant on Danville Street in South Hill feeds the locals, who smoke cigarettes over platters of pork, slaw and dessert. Men in hats with farm equipment logos flirt with the smiling waitresses.
<p>Sensing a photo-op, Warner goes back to the kitchen and finds cook Darryl Phillips slicing the freshly roasted pork. Holding poses as he contrives a conversation about his own barbecue skills, Warner asks Phillips where — in his opinion — the best meat is. Those steaming pieces eventually go into a bowl Warner takes back to his seat.
<p>That’s the Warner campaign message in a snapshot.
<p>The senator is running his campaign on the plain-but-powerful stance that seniority counts for everything in the U.S. Senate. Among other things, his three-term clout brings submarine contracts to Newport News — that evening’s last campaign stop.
<p>Unlike GOP congressional hopeful George Landrith, a relative unknown who coolly intrudes on every table in the restaurant, trading his campaign leaflets for handshakes, the senator places a lunch order at the counter, then sits down with reporters and his staff at a table to eat.
<p>“The state knows me and I know the state — I’ve been there,” Warner says, noting both he and his father attended Washington and Lee and the University of Virginia, while his opponent “is a Connecticut Yankee — ever heard of that?”
<p>The aristocratic heritage of this doctor’s son is no slip. Who your parents were is standard fodder in any corner of the state, and he knows that.
<p>Second in seniority on the Senate Armed Services Committee behind Washington monument Strom Thurmond, 93, the 69-year-old Warner swallows some spaghetti, and says, “Defense is the number one industry in the state, and Virginia is number one per capita in defense spending.”
<p><center><img src="./images/feat35-2.jpg" align=left width=270 height=218 border=3 alt="<p>Image: [His political invincibility intact, the senator’s career points to an elusive chairmanship.]<p>"></center>
<br clear=all>There’s your pork, Virginia.
<p>If the two Warners were debating over this wipe-and-dry table, you get the sense the senator might try to reach over, muss the challenger’s hair and say “run along, punk.”
<p>The Warner campaign car is a rental sedan, hitting 20 towns from Roanoke to Tidewater in three days. It’s a far cry from Ollie North’s “Rolling Thunder” mobile home, and even short of your average campaign caravan or entourage.
<p>Two young campaign workers are seen but not heard. Their man doesn’t need handling. Reporters offer little resistance to the senator, unlike fellow Sen. Chuck Robb’s perpetual tilting with the media over “the character issue.”
<p>Warner says his campaign swing is simple: “These are plants and military bases I’ve helped out for years. That farmer [sitting at another table] came to me years ago for help with his immigration [labor] problem. ... It’s about jobs.”
<p>Technology and computer-industry issues are Mark Warner’s advantage, a reporter suggests, raising the senator’s eyebrows: “In Northern Virginia there are hundreds of help-wanted high-tech jobs in the papers,” the senator says. “Down here, you’ve got a lot of people who are looking for any job. [Technology] doesn’t have a damn thing to do with it ... that cyber-stuff surfing.”
<p>The senator’s campaign message is divided between bashing his opponent’s absent birthright and boasting about his own record as a moderate conservative with seniority ... who also rebuffed right wingers Mike Farris, Ollie North and Jim Miller.
<p>“[Mark Warner] comes born in Indiana, out of Connecticut,” the senator surmises. “What really bristles me is why does a man run from his heritage. He just breaks out in a sweat at the debates when I say ‘Look, condemn me if you wish that I started politics under Richard Nixon, that I worked with Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Go ahead, trash it, that’s fine, but I put it out there,” Warner says.
<p>Mark Warner’s liberal connections to Sen. Chris Dodd, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder and the union-backed Democratic National Committee aggravate the senator, who feels the challenger hasn’t been flushed out as the liberal he really is. “You don’t see a word of that,” in Mark Warner’s campaign, he says disgustedly. “It’s all this puff TV stuff out here, and yet you cannot find out who this guy is.”
<p>The nerve of this Democrat. And his $100 million.
<p>“He has said he’s willing to spend whatever it takes,” the senator says, respecting ample ammunition when he sees it. “Virginia has never experienced this type of threat of total unlimited spending to seek a public position.”
<p>Warner conveys astonishment that his opponent is seeking the U.S. Senate for his first public office. “I know Virginia history very well, particularly as it relates to the Senate. I’ve gone back ... you’ll find they’ve all come having been thoroughly tested in public office before they took on the governorship or the U.S. Senate seat.”
<p>The night before South Hill, presidential nominee and Warner endorser Bob Dole promised a 15-percent tax cut and a balanced-budget amendment. His former colleague isn’t so sure about the tax break, and says so. With a huge lead, Warner doesn’t make tax-cut promises. He doesn’t have to. He doesn’t even have to get out of his seat to campaign.
<p>The people at S&S Barbecue come over to him for handshakes.
<p>And autographs.
<p>And to have their picture made with the country squire.
<p>Some thank him for something he did recently, or over the years. Some praise his stand against the state Republican party. This is incumbent buoyancy. This is why it takes millions to even challenge a sitting senator, because John William Warner is a celebrity.
<p>“It doesn’t bother me,” he says of the fawning women and the admiring men. “I’ve seen all the celebrity status a person can have, I suppose to the extent that I’ve ever been a model celebrity. I was the youngest man in history to become secretary of the Navy; that brought a good deal of celebrity status. Of course, obviously, Elizabeth Taylor, with whom I still maintain a good friendship — she was here just two weeks ago. We visit together. She’s on hard times now and a little support is helpful. I get along beautifully with both former wives.”
<p>(Back in 1978, some felt Warner’s race against Andy Miller actually pitted Doris Miller against Liz Taylor in a challenge few candidates’ wives would win.)
<p>Across the street from the restaurant, the senator strides into Billy Farrar Sr.’s empty tobacco warehouse, meets the owner amid the sweet-scented emptiness and says bluntly: “That fellow running against me is pretty tight with Clinton.”
<p>The South Hill Enterprise photographer gets the shot he came for.
<p>Farrar, 66, understands the Clinton association already and gives Warner a “Keep FDA Off the Farm” hat, which the senator dons.
<p>South Hill sent nine buses to the tobacco farmers’ march on Washington, Farrar says. Leaning on a desk between them, Warner reminisces that the day was rainy and reminds Farrar that he marched, too.

<p><font size=6><b>W</b></font>hat telecommunications whiz Mark Warner wants — but doesn’t appear likely to win or be able to buy — is John Warner’s office, which is room 225 in the Russell Senate Office Building — a marbled fortress with 20-foot ceilings, senate bronzes scattered about and occasional rotundas that evoke silent awe. These are the halls of power.
<p>The senator’s reception area is a picture gallery of Warner’s passage through the GOP, including a shot of Dick Obenshain, whose death in a plane crash made Warner’s candidacy in 1978 possible.
<p>Warner, with his gray hair thick and coiffed, and wearing a navy blue suit that he keeps buttoned, selects an antique chair in his office that, in his opinion, will make a good picture. He even moves the reporter to a second seat after five minutes to free his good side for the camera, with that prominent Leading Part closest to the lens.
<p>Here on his home turf, the senator is asked why the opponent says the senator is out of touch with Virginia, which is why the Democrat’s ads show him traveling to every county and city in the state.
<p>“In the first place, you’d think if he came up here to work with [Sen. Chris] Dodd he would have some idea how the Senate operates. If I’m not in this chair, be it this one or the one on the floor of the Senate, some other senator is going to steal something from Virginia, maybe the word steal is not correct. He’s going to take advantage of my absence. ... I can’t be traveling to all these little remote places, but that’s fair in politics.”
<p>The ads peeve Warner, whose aide later produces a sheet that says he’s made 98.4 percent of 6,940 votes in his career.
<p>Bronzes of Winston Churchill, Robert E. Lee and a sailor occupy the mantle, and a few pieces of furniture made the trip from Atoka farm, his former Middleburg homestead. 
<p>Three still-life oils of flowers by the senator himself brighten the otherwise masculine, hunting-lodge look of this warrior’s den. Black-and-whites from decades of military service blend together.
<p>There’s a framed copy of “S.J. Res. 2” — the most significant moment of Warner’s career, he says, when he led the floor fight in the Senate in 1991 authorizing the use of force against Iraq in Kuwait.
<p>But the battle for his own political life lasted longer, when he repelled the state Republican leadership, which sought to oust him for not supporting GOP nominees Ollie North and Mike Farris.
<p>At times, Warner seemed alone among Republican power brokers, an island in the Potomac, perhaps.
<p>“I may have been an island among a small coterie of leaders, but among the general population of Virginians, they were proud of their senator,” he says, “You talk about people losing contact with the voters.”
<p>In vanquishing the anti-charismatic Jim Miller by a two-to-one margin in the statewide primary in June, the three-term incumbent got a boost on the integrity scale most beltway insiders wouldn’t dream of.
<p>What if the party had run you out — what would that say about politics today? “I don’t do what-if questions,” he says, “but you haven’t heard a peep out of them since.”
<p>In U.Va. political expert Larry Sabato’s opinion, “it’s very rare” to see a politician openly buck his party’s nominees: “Warner has been true to himself and in the process he has not been true to his party.”
<p>As the Virginia GOP has grown increasingly conservative since 1972, Warner has held his ground as a moderate, Sabato says. Back in 1978, he played the middle ground among the three GOP candidates, left of Obenshain and right of Linwood Holton.
<p>In a mini poli-sci. lesson, the senator makes a campaign point about his seniority: While the Senate chamber seats 100, 10 members wield the most power: the majority leader, the whip, and the eight chairmen. Warner chairs the rules and administration committee. He’s among the 10.
<p>But what Warner really covets is Thurmond’s place atop the armed services committee. That, he all but admits, would be the apex of his military-dominated career.
<p>Privately, Warner has told his closest allies that this would be his final term. For the record, he says he will take the Senate “one day at a time.”
<p>News accounts have captured Thurmond’s mental lapses in committee meetings and interviews, as well as Warner’s effort to help his fading colleague through embarrassing situations.
<p>“Be careful with this chairmanship thing,” the senator says, mindful not to sound too ambitious. Thurmond’s office is only two doors down.
<p>For now, the senator who forsook horse country for an Alexandria apartment, there’s little left to do, save run the nation’s military, and those orders haven’t come.
<p>The gentleman from South Carolina hasn’t passed the gavel yet. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top width=17 height=18>

<hr size=2 noshade>
<font size=6><b>From Noble Beginnings</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Descended from aristocrats, Serge Troubetzkoy’s family history is a treasure chest of pre-Fabergé Russia. Travel through the centuries with a prince who lives in the Fan.</font>
<h3><i>by Edwin Slipek Jr.</i></h3><p>

<hr size=1>
<img src="./images/feat34-2.jpg" width=150 height=339 align=right alt="<p>[Born in 1914, Serge Troubetzkoy fled Russia with his divorced mother, Ulga Demidoff Troubetzkoy, as the Romanovs were overthrown. She married an American in Paris and they moved to the U.S. in 1928.]<p>">
<font size=6><b>I</b></font>t is one of those impossibly tropical August mornings when folks stay behind closed doors unless (as my grandmother used to say) they absolutely have to go out. It’s not yet 10 o’clock, but whoever was trimming the unwieldy hedge in the Troubetzkoy’s Fan District yard has already fled the wilting humidity. The sidewalk is carpeted with holly clippings.
<p>I rap the brass knocker twice, somewhat surprised to find a quintessentially American eagle affixed to the front door. Wouldn’t a grand imperial double-headed eagle be more fitting? For on the other side of the door is Prince Serge Troubetzkoy, scion of a Russian noble family whose line runs directly back to the early Middle Ages.
<p>For the past 45 years, he has made Richmond his home.
<p>My call on the prince is occasioned by the Aug. 24 opening of the Fabergé exhibition at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. 
<p>Rarely has there been such hoopla locally as that being generated by this showing of the Russian jeweler’s art. And the museum’s upcoming Fabergé Ball in September has the local bourgeois nothing short of atwitter over what they’re paying, what they’ll wear and what they’ll see when they arrive at the soiree.
<p>Amid all the hype, perhaps a visit with Troubetzkoy, born 82 years ago in czarist Russia, will put things in perspective.
<p>What tales will this gentleman, now living just a few blocks from the museum, tell of the life he and his family once lived before revolution swept their homeland? 
<p>Remarkably, Troubetzkoy is probably the only Richmonder who actually lived in Czarist Russia as a member of the nobility — a group that, when threatened by the socialists and communists, either fled the motherland or was killed during the period culminating with World War I.

<p><img src="./images/feat34-3.jpg" width=302 height=246 align=left hspace=5 alt="<p>[For 45 years, Troubetzkoy and wife Ulrich, a poet and journalist,  have lived in Richmond. They examine Troubetskoy, Demidoff and Romanov objects in their possession.]<p>">
<p>My knocks are answered almost immediately by Troubetzkoy himself. He extends a surprisingly large hand for someone so trim. He has a full head of gray hair and a mustache. The broad rims of his eyeglasses keep his bushy, upswept eyebrows in check, but the thick lenses can’t obscure a warm and intelligent gaze. Casually dressed in slacks and a solid sport shirt, he doesn’t look particularly royal.
<p>No sooner do I cross the threshold than Dorothy Livingston Ulrich Troubetzkoy, the ebullient Connecticut native he wed 55 years ago, emerges from the rear of the house.
<p>“Those sleigh bells are from a family place in Maine,” she says as she closes the door and jingles the antique leather strap hanging on the inside. “It’s hard to hear sleigh bells and think of Maine on a day like this, isn’t it?”
<p>Come to mention it, the air is a little warm and close, heightening the pleasant smell of old books and wool rugs. I’m struck by how much she looks like the late-Margaret Chase Smith, the elegant and distinguished senator from Maine. A pale blue A-line dress accentuates her white hair and bright blue eyes. A necklace fashioned of split seashells encircles her neck.
<p>“Rest your bones there,” Mr. Troubetzkoy says as we enter the parlor. He steers me away from a cluster of fragile-looking seats into a solid mahogany armchair. The large, long room with off-white walls is cluttered — filled with three sofas, two wing chairs, numerous side chairs and more than a few side tables. At the room’s far end a grand piano is almost buried under old toys, cardboard boxes full of old records, books, paintings and family photographs. The top of a handsome pie-crust table (and seemingly every surface in the house) is weighed down with an accumulation of sterling silver trays, crystal vases and porcelain plates. 
<p>In contrast, Pottery Barn-type casseroles (with duck and bunny lids), a bowl of pine cones, and a number of colorful quivers resting in a ceramic umbrella stand lend a lighter and decidedly eclectic touch. An ornate gold-leaf Italian framed mirror and ancestral portraits hang on the walls. Except for a small clearing near the entry, one has to inch sideways to move around the room.
<p>“Our son keeps bringing things and putting them in here,” Ulrich Troubetzkoy explains. The environment appears to be years in the making, created by a family with highly sophisticated interests and a fascinating history.
<p>If there were any question, one has only to glance to the oval portrait looming above the mantle. A patrician-looking man with a sash of medals peers off the canvas into the distance.
<p>“That is Czar Alexander II,” says Troubetzkoy as he glances at the monarch (no relation) who ruled Russia from 1855 to 1877. “It belonged to my grandfather.” He then adds with earthy zest, “We have a portrait of Nicholas I [who preceded Alexander as czar and served from 1825 to 1855] in the front hall. My grandfather hung it in his toilet in Paris.”
<p>“Are you descended from the same royal line as were the Romanovs?” I ask blatantly, not hesitating to reveal my interest in visiting. My reference is to the Russian royal family that for a number of generations patronized Fabergé.
<p>Ulrich Troubetzkoy looks at her husband who smiles knowingly. She gives a little laugh and says, “Oh no, his family goes back much further.”
<p>I offer that the reign of the Romanovs lasted about 300 years, until its rule came to an end when Czar Nicholas II and his family were slaughtered by the Bolsheviks in 1918.
<p>My hosts concur: “The Romanovs go back to about the time of Ivan the Terrible [the first Czar of Russia who ruled from 1547 to 1584]. The Troubetzkoys,” explains the prince, “are descended from Guedimin,” a ruler [of what became Lithuania] in the 14th century.
<p>I settle back, a little sobered by the realization that here in old Virginia people get excited about ancestors who fought for the Confederacy, or served as officers under George Washington during the American Revolution. Here is a soft-spoken man who can trace his forbearers back past Guedimin to early Christendom.
<p>Troubetzkoy explains that Guedimin had seven sons who settled and ruled parts of what is today is Hungary, Poland and various regions of Russia. The family flourished during medieval times despite constant and brutal warring between other families, tribes and emerging nations. Troubetzkoy’s eyes brighten and his voice gets excited as he discusses wars and battles fought centuries ago when “every famous family lost members.”
<p>Suddenly, Troubetzkoy rises and disappears toward the rear of the house.
<p>In his absence, I chat with his wife about how she and her husband first met: It was in 1941 at a Long Island house party that Ulrich’s mother had pushed her to attend. “I wasn’t the least bit interested in the party or almost anyone there, but Serge must have been intrigued when he came upon me reciting ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’ from ‘Alice Through the Looking Glass.’ It was my way of counting to 10,” she says, explaining that the dull weekend was trying her patience. 
<p>Troubetzkoy addresses his wife as Dorothy, but she is better known in Virginia circles as Ulrich Troubetzkoy. After the couple moved to Richmond in 1950, her byline became familiar locally when it appeared in such publications as Virginia Wildlife, Virginia Cavalcade and the Independent Virginian (a Chesterfield newspaper which she founded and edited from 1970 to 1982). She also did a stint as the City of Richmond’s first public information officer. She is a poet and for many years she wrote art criticism for the Richmond Times-Dispatch and later the Richmond News Leader.
<p>“Sometimes when I’m asked where I’m from, I say I’m a Yankee,” Ulrich says, referring to her birthplace of West Hartford and to having graduated from the University of Chicago and doing post-graduate studies at Columbia and Cornell, “but my husband is a Southerner.”
<p>He comes in, saying on cue with a theatrical inflection, “Southern Russia.”

<p><center>— • • • —</center>
<br><font size=6><b>T</b></font>roubetzkoy was born in Kiev in 1914. Soon after his birth, his father, Prince Serge Peterovitch Troubetzkoy, was mobilized to serve in World War I in the Russian military.
<p>His soldiering father and his mother, Olga Demidoff Troubetzkoy, were divorced when Serge was a youngster. Although circumstances made him far closer to his mother’s family, it is through his father’s side that Troubetzkoy’s title has been passed down. 
<p>Troubetzkoy says that his name began with a 14th-century prince, Dimitri Timotheovitch of Troubezkoy, who lived near Moscow.
<p>Centuries later, it was through a great uncle, Serge Peterovitch, that Troubetzkoy became a household name in Russia. Serge was a Decembrist, the name given participants of a conspiracy against Czar Nicholas I upon his accession to the Russian throne in 1825. The goal of the insurrectionists was to establish a constitutional monarchy. The revolt was thwarted, and the agitators were either hanged or shipped off to Tobolsk in Siberia. Because he was a nobleman, Serge Troubetzkoy’s life was spared and he was given the latter option. His French wife followed and together they eventually flourished in the harsh northern environment. They established a rich cultural life that included sponsoring operas, building a library and even some agricultural experimentation.
<p>Troubetzkoy says that when a later czar eventually pardoned his forbearer, Serge and his wife found their old stomping ground of St. Petersburg a little predictable and dull.
<p>From the time of Peter the Great, the Troubetzkoys played a role in the court until the deposition of the monarchy in 1917. Troubetzkoy says that during the reign of Nicholas II, a number of his great uncles, including one who taught at the University of Moscow, warned the Czar that he was making bad decisions and needed to introduce social and political reforms. “They told him, ‘If you continue like this, there will be dire circumstances. You’d better shape up.’ They were bold, no doubt about it.”
<p>The curtain fell on the Romanov dynasty in March 1917 when Nicholas abdicated the throne, his brother declined to be crowned, and Russia became a republic. The handwriting on the wall also spelled an end to Russian nobility when Nicholas, his wife, children, two servants and the family doctor were killed with revolvers and bayonets in a cellar in Ekaterinburg, Russia.
<p>Today in Russia, the Troubetzkoy name elicits varying reactions.
<p>“When my son visited the Soviet Union in the 1970s,” says Troubetzkoy, “one night at dinner a group of young people raised their glasses and toasted him ‘as a descendant of a revolutionary.’ The communists had evidently left Serge in the textbooks. The people in Moscow look back on that revolution [of 1825] as a good thing. Our branch of the Troubetzkoy family has been proclaimed.”
<p>Other Russians, however, still connect the name with nobility: “Last summer when Dorothy and I visited Russia [for the first time since he fled the country during World War I in 1917], someone came up to me at a train station and said with slight disdain: ‘You’ve got a lot of nerve coming back here.’ But everybody knows the name. People acquainted with the name were coming up and giving us icons and cheese [as tokens of respect].”
<p>“I had a wonderful time in Moscow. We saw some property the family once owned. The house was a big, yellow mansion like ‘Gone With the Wind.’ It had five beautiful garden paths leading from the house and into the woods. Today it is a home for retired scientists. That’s a good thing.” 
<p>As the Troubetzkoys talk animatedly, finishing each other’s sentences, following and expanding each other’s always fascinating tangents, it’s clear their marriage has flourished for more than half a century because they share an insatiable love of history and an interest in ancestral lore. 
<p>The Troubetzkoys have two daughters and a son. Daria (Russian for Dorothy) Troubetzkoy Lewis, lives in Fairfield, Conn., and teaches English to foreign students. Vilna (named for the old capital of Lithuania) Troubetzkoy Roorda is married to a Dutchman and lives in the Netherlands where she is employed in corporate communications for KLM airlines. Closer to home is son Sergei, who is director of tourism for the City of Staunton. The Troubetzkoys have two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
<p>The empty nesters are kept company by two cats named, appropriately enough, Czarina and Nikki.

<p><center>— • • • —</center>
<br><font size=6><b>T</b></font>roubetzkoy has few memories of his own childhood in Kiev where he was baptized at the Russian Orthodox St. George’s Church. As battles of World War I raged about them — the Polish front was a mere 150 miles from Kiev — his mother became increasingly disillusioned about the war. It was about 1916 that she initiated divorce proceedings from Troubetzkoy who eventually reached the rank of captain in the Russian army.
<p>In August 1917, a few months after Czar Nicholas’ abdication, young Troubetzkoy and his mother fled Russia by train. Troubetzkoy says that his grandmother later told him that there were such huge crowds at the train station there were fears the family wouldn’t get aboard. A family friend and Cossack, Zibour Gazovitch, as legend goes, hoisted Serge on his uniformed shoulders and pushed through the station calling out, “Are you going to allow the grandson of the White General to be taken by the Bolsheviks?” People cleared a path.
<p>The Troubetzkoys’ arduous travel route took them to Finland, Norway, Scotland and England before they settled in Paris, which would become the adopted home country of his family. Young Serge soon discovered the city’s parks under the watchful eye of his governess. He remembers the Prince of Wales paying a visit in his naval uniform.
<p>While in Paris, his mother married a Philadelphian in the diplomatic service, and in 1928 the family moved to Philadelphia. Troubetzkoy graduated from Germantown High School in suburban Chestnut Hill.
<p>He later worked in a Manhattan brokerage firm, married Dorothy Ulrich and served in the U.S. Army during World War II. Although he saw combat, his mastery of several languages served him well on army intelligence assignments. He speaks French, Italian and Russian — the latter two “not as well as I used to.”
<p>While he was in the military, Ulrich developed her career as a free-lance writer. In 1950, they moved to Richmond when he was assigned a southern territory as a representative of Belgian-based Val St. Lambert, a manufacturer and designer of fine crystal — a subsidiary of The General Society, a large and powerful Belgian conglomerate.
<p>Ulrich applied for a job at the Richmond Newspapers and confronted the sexism not unusual for the times: “‘We don’t have any jobs on the women’s pages,’ I was told. I was delighted because I didn’t know anything about women’s pages.”

<br><font size=6>The Family Tree</font>
<img src="./images/feat34-5.jpg" width=228 height=445 align=right hspace=5 alt="<p>[Paul Alexandrovitch Demidoff, Troubetzkoy’s grandfather, shown here in 1904 in uniform, like much of the family emigrated to Paris after the collapse of the Russian monarchy.]<p>">
<br><font size=5><b>O</b></font>f all his ancestors, Serge Troubetzkoy perhaps speaks most fondly of his maternal grandfather and godfather Paul Alexandrovitch Demidoff.
<p>“The Demidoff family has intrigued me the most,” he says, adding that very little has been published on the line. “They were the richest family from the time of Peter up to the revolution. And although he was on Lenin’s list, my grandfather lived through the revolution,” getting himself settled in France well before World War I. Grandfather Demidoff descended from a man who had been a gunsmith and munitions manufacturer to Peter the Great and later amassed a fortune from gold, iron, silver and platinum mining.
<p>One of grandfather Demidoff’s homes was the castle of Vychnievetz, which had belonged to the kings of Poland. That Polish royal line also was related to Guedimin, the same royal from which the Troubetzkoys are descended. Demidoff served as aide-de-camp to Grand Duke Boris, a Romanouv, and he was later named head of the Nobility Association of Volhynia, a province near Poland.
<p>As a boy, Troubetzkoy was a frequent visitor to his grandfather’s magnificent estate, “Les Pearles” near Nice. “He sold some pearls and got the land,” says Troubetzkoy. “The estate covered a stretch of land comparable from the Boulevard to the VCU campus.” 
<p>Today, the Troubetzkoys still dine on the family china emblazoned with the Demidoff crest.
<p>Troubetzkoy’s maternal grandmother, Olga Cheremetiev Demidoff, was also from great wealth; at one time the Cheremetievs owned one half of the land on which present-day Moscow is built. After her brother’s death, grandmother Olga became the wealthiest woman in Russia. Today, the Moscow airport is named Cheremetiev.
<p>After she and Demidoff were divorced, Olga remarried one Prince Michael Kotchoubey and took the title of princess. Troubetzkoy has fond memories of Kotchoubey, a pretender to the Ukrainian throne, but says he was a strict taskmaster. Kotchoubey believed that a young man should first master the essentials of defending himself, horseback riding, swimming, shooting a gun, fencing and skating. Only then, was it was OK to play with a ball.
<p>Troubetzkoy shifts to another ancestor, Prokofi Demidoff who lived in the 18th century: “He did nutty things and loved books. He was fascinated to read of holidays and proclaimed a holiday in honor of himself. To celebrate, he announced ‘Drinks are on me.’ The town took him up on it. They say 80 people died from alcohol.” In France at the time, inventor and statesman Benjamin Franklin had introduced eyeglasses, and they were all the rage in the courts of Europe. As a joke, the same Demidoff put eyeglasses on all of his horses and dogs. And then there was the time Catherine the Great came to call and was wowed by his formal gardens and statuary. On a second stroll through the gardens, her majesty must have felt temporary disorientation because the “statues” had disappeared. Demidoff had disguised the serfs to look like statues. They had stepped off their pedestals. Funny guy.
<p>The eccentricities of the Russian nobility in the Troubetzkoy sphere extend to the present century. On a trip to Paris in 1958, when the Troubetzkoys took their children to visit their paternal grandfather, they also visited Prince Felix Yusupov, a cousin by marriage and the man who killed Rasputin, the reportedly mad monk who held immensely influential sway over Czar Nicholas II and Czarina Alexandra. The Troubetzkoys found Yusupov living with his pet pigeon — and sleeping at night under an open umbrella to protect himself from unwelcome bird droppings in the night.
<p>“There’s a reason why we only learn about the ‘Victorian’ age of the monarchy in school,” says Ulrich Troubetzkoy with a twinkle in her eyes as she shakes her head. 
<p>Makes Charles, Di, Fergie and the whole House of Windsor seem downright dull, doesn’t it? — E.S.

<font size=6><b>Ghost in the Machine</b></font>
<br><font size=5>The man behind the candidates, political consultant Boyd Marcus proves there is power in anonymity.</font>
<h3><i>by Janet Giampietro</i></h3><p>


<hr size=1>
<font size=6><b>O</b></font>n a brisk and cloudless Saturday morning in March, brightly colored signs decorate the drab institutional brick outside J.R. Tucker High School on Parham Road. Inside, a hazard-orange tarp covers the gymnasium floor in preparation for one of the world’s oldest contact sports. There will be an election here today.
<p>More than 300 Henrico Republicans are gathered at a party mass meeting to elect a chairman for the county committee. They mill about in their stars-and-stripes sweaters, conservative suits, power ties and campaign buttons, talking politics and stealing a second or two of face time with the stars in the room — Congressman Tom Bliley, Attorney General Jim Gilmore, Sen. John Warner and then-Senate candidate Jim Miller. 
<p>Somewhere in this crowd is a man arguably more powerful in state Republican affairs than the candidates themselves. He is so successful in the party nomination process that his critics accuse him of hand-picking nominees and ramming them down the party’s throat, of pre-selecting candidates so that rank and file party members, like the ones assembled at the mass meeting today, have virtually no input into the process. 
<p>His supporters, meanwhile, praise him for his unwavering loyalty, his stamina and his skill. “I don’t think there is anybody in Republican politics in this state with better knowledge,” says Bliley.
<p>An unknowing observer could scan the crowd for hours and never pick him out.

<p><center>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</center>

<p><big><b>B</b></big>oyd Marcus is everywhere and nowhere.
<p>Everywhere because he can cover every corner of this gymnasium seamlessly, appearing to be four places at once. He is at the front of the gym, close to Bliley one minute; he is in the back whispering directives to young campaign workers the next.
<p>Nowhere because he is very nearly invisible, a ghost in the political machine — unknown to Joe and Mary Constituent — whose power and influence stretches far and wide and deep throughout state GOP politics, from Bliley’s office to the governor’s mansion right down to this small county mass meeting. A balding man with glasses and a Pillsbury Doughboy paunch, Marcus is perfectly inconspicuous, crafting political careers while in effect telling voters, “Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.”
<p>This race today is for county committee chairman, between the incumbent, Ed Fuhr, a boyish-looking attorney, and Jane Wagner, a diminutive, no-nonsense woman who has been here and lost before. But it is so much more.
<p>It is a chance for candidates like Jim Miller, trailing in polls and money behind Sen. John Warner, to come out and meet the people and say things like “Let’s veto Bill and his tree-hugging vice-president, Al Gore!” to the delight of the conservative crowd. It’s a chance for Warner to shore up his conservative credentials with a county that is all but desiccated of Democrats in the western part. Warner takes more subtle jabs at the president and kisses up to perpetually popular Tom Bliley, saying there is “no stronger voice in the U.S. Congress than that given by the dean of the Virginia delegation, Tom Bliley.” 
<p>For Bliley, in the infancy of an election year, it does not hurt to turn in an appearance and listen with interest to everyone with whom he speaks. Attorney General Jim Gilmore, a graduate of Tucker High School, still more than a year-and-a-half away from his gubernatorial election, gets a standing ovation from the home crowd, whom he calls “the heart and soul and the lifeblood of the Republican Party.” 
<p>All of the candidates except Warner are clients of Marcus, one of the most powerful political operatives in the commonwealth. Bliley paid Marcus and his consulting firm Marcus & Allen more than $140,000 in 1995, an election off-year for the congressman. In the first six months of 1996, Gilmore, still more than a year away from his race, has paid Marcus’ firm close to $80,000. Bliley calls Marcus’ services “the best political advice that money can buy in this state.” 

<p><center>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</center>
<p><big><b>F</b></big>uhr wins his election, as expected. 
<p>Wagner goes home the loser, but not defeated, she says. She vows to be back. She takes perverse pleasure in her role as The Thing That Wouldn’t Die, the thorn in Boyd Marcus’ side. 
<p>“Boyd manipulated my destruction,” says the long-time Republican activist and one-time friend of Marcus. She says he has punished her for years for the unforgivable sin in 1985 of backing Gerald Baliles, a Democrat, for governor. There are even murmurs about her more than 10 years later at the mass meeting. “Chutzpah is what it is,” one participant says to another, “to run for chairman after you back a Democrat for governor.” Wagner blames much of her lingering bad standing within the party to Marcus. She says there is no room for dissent in the Marcus wing of the Republican Party. “It’s his way or no way. ... He’s powerful, ruthless and smart. But he’s ruined the party,” she says. “[Voters] have no say, no input, not even a pretense.”
<p>Even with the backing of every Republican Henrico supervisor (which is four of the five), Wagner cannot fend off the sweeping wrecking ball of Marcus’ campaigning power. In a letter endorsing Wagner, Henrico supervisors David Kaechele, Jim Donati, Pat O’Bannon and retired Supervisor Ray Shadwell wrote: “In recent years, the fate of Henrico County Republicans has been subject to the wishes of special-interest groups, fueled by professional political consultants who make their livings from candidates who desire to run for Republican office. We would like to put behind us the perception that the Party candidate selection decisions are controlled by a small group of self-interested political consultants. ... [W]e have become increasingly concerned with undue influence these people exert within the Party on our nomination process.” 
<p>At the mass meeting, Wagner delivers a fiery if somewhat over-the-top speech promising to lead “a grassroots organization like it used to be, instead of an organization run by professionals for professionals” — a clear jab at Marcus. 
<p>But it barely scuffs the armor of Marcus’ forces. With one whole side of the room brimming with Fuhr supporters, Wagner’s relatively sparse crowd on the opposite set of bleachers resemble fans of the away team. Add a nomination from Commonwealth’s Attorney Toby Vick and the officially neutral heavy hitters in the room such as Bliley, Gilmore, Del. Eric Cantor and candidate Miller — who all seem tethered to Fuhr’s side of the gym — and there is no doubt which way the room tilts.
<p><center>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</center>
<p><big><b>F</b></big>or a man with a Machiavellian reputation in some circles, Marcus is not the least bit slick or contrived. He is friendly and engaging, and if he is being guarded, it is hard to tell. He is nothing like the political operatives that have become the equivalent of rock stars on the national scene: He does not speak with the sound-bites-for-every-occasion as James Carville does; he does not greedily grab attention as the guitar-wailing Lee Atwater did.
<p>For a busy man, he does not rush through conversation. He seems to enjoy talking about two things: politics and his family. He is married to Karen Marcus, who also consults for Tom Bliley and runs his Richmond office. They have five children between them, two each from former marriages and one son together. They live in a large but not opulent frame Colonial home in the Pine Run subdivision in the far West End. 
<p>His comfortable home surroundings stand in stark contrast to his admittedly gnarly offices, tucked away in a squatty, rectangular building at 4914 Fitzhugh Ave., just behind the Willow Lawn shopping center. The Marcus & Allen offices look like the leavings of an exploded paper factory, with pamphlets, brochures, and posters — loose and in boxes — piled in every corner. Young campaign workers — Marcus maintains a permanent staff of five — dart around in college T-shirts and big shorts. In a back office, workers stuffing envelopes and keying data into a computer take liberal advantage of the lack of “no smoking” rules. 
<p>It is from this chaotic setting that Marcus has run the invincible campaigns of Tom Bliley and consulted for Gov. George Allen, Attorney General Jim Gilmore and a whole slew of Republican winners and losers over the years.
<p>Allen recently appointed Marcus to the Board of Visitors of Virginia Commonwealth University.
<p>Marcus’ office itself offers no more glamorous a picture of the lifestyle of a political operative. It is bare-bones — desk, chair, requisite wall hangings including his University of Virginia diploma, a photo of himself with former Vice President Dan Quayle and a National Rifle Association certificate of membership.
<p>Marcus apologizes with a laugh about the condition of his offices but says it sends a message to his clients: We put the money you spend where it belongs, on the campaign.
<p><center>~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~</center>
<p><big><b>P</b></big>erhaps it was destiny that Mahlon Boyd Marcus would grow up fiercely political when he was born on the Fourth of July, 1952, in Leesburg, Va. He grew up there and some in Winchester, where his father ran an auto parts wholesaling business and a car dealership and his mother was an operator for Ma Bell. He graduated in 1970 from Loudon County High School.
<p>He discovered his political identity, he says, at age 8 during the 1960 presidential election. Marcus’ father, a Harry Byrd Democrat (as Marcus later discovered), voted for Nixon. “So I was a Republican,” Marcus says. He says he has never once ticked the lever in the D column. 
<p>But it was at the University of Virginia, where Marcus majored in American government, where “the political bug really bit me,” he says. He joined the College Republicans in his first year, where he met a senior classman named Jim Gilmore. Their friendship solidified when Gilmore returned home from the Army, a relationship Gilmore says has gotten closer over the years, through campaigns for the Legislature, commonwealth’s attorney and attorney general. Gilmore calls his friend “loyal and trustworthy, absolutely. That’s very important in the political world, the world he lives in.”
<p>In 1972, Marcus attended his first state convention, at which Dick Obenshain was elected party chairman. In 1976, he was a delegate for Ronald Reagan in Kansas City, during the Gipper’s failed presidential bid. He names both men as personal heroes who inspired him in his political life.
<p>Later, Marcus says he got “a real job” as an assistant planner with the Virginia Office of Emergency Services and stayed there until 1980 when former Richmond mayor and funeral director Tom Bliley decided to run for Congress. Bliley tapped Marcus to run his campaign — one which raised and spent more than $200,000.
<p>Bliley quickly made his decision to run after the unexpected retirement of David Satterfield. He had 30 days to secure a nomination and a friend recommended a man who could do just that: Boyd Marcus. 
<p>Bliley invited Marcus to lunch. “He walked in with what I call Coke-bottle glasses and a Fu Manchu mustache. I thought, ‘Oh my God,’” Bliley says. But Marcus mounted a campaign for the nomination, steering the politician through what Bliley calls “the most difficult 30 days of my political life” and won.
<p>After winning the general election, Bliley named Marcus his top aide and administrative assistant. Marcus went to Washington to run Bliley’s office and ran his campaigns from Richmond. In 1986, Marcus was making a reported salary of $59,000 per year, not counting the more than $15,000 Bliley paid Marcus as a campaign consultant. “I write the fund-raising letters for the campaign,” Marcus was quoted as saying in 1986. “I have got to put together the campaign plans and stuff.”
<p>The game of politics has gotten more sophisticated since then, and Marcus has ripened along with it. In 1995 alone, in addition to his work for Bliley and Gilmore, Marcus ran five House of Delegates campaigns. All of them lost. But of the five Senate races in which Republican challengers defeated incumbent Democrats, Marcus managed four of the candidates — Ed Shrock, Marty Williams, Bill Bolling and Emmett Hanger.
<p>With the kind of money being spent to win nominations, let alone elections, there had better be some high-tech tools and experienced brainpower that comes along with it. Marcus says the same strategies being used 10 years ago in statewide elections are now being employed at the local level — television and radio advertising among them. 
<p>It is a technology-driven process. With fax machines and networked computers, candidates can shoot allegations, responses and rebuttals back and forth in hours, all in time for the nightly news, a process that might have taken days a decade ago.
<p>The availability of technology makes it desirable to candidates in even the smallest races. Paid phone banks with computer dialing, radio and TV advertising are all within reach. “It encourages you to raise the money to get that next thing,” says Marcus. “It drives the cost.”
<p>Regardless of technology, what Marcus really sells is his experience — everything from speechwriting and fund raising to knowing that the name Bliley is virtually unrecognizable when printed vertically. “He is a superb organizer, down to the smallest detail,” says Bliley.
<p>Buying Marcus’ full range of services gets a candidate some strategic campaign planning — on what core issues does the candidate focus and where does he position himself? — opposition research (investigating opponents’ background and political history), events planning, voter lists, volunteer coordinating and, most of all, experience. 
<p>“[With a political consultant] you are buying his experience of having been through a situation,” Marcus says. “If the other side drops a bombshell, how do I react?” 
<p>David Johnson went for it all. Johnson, an engineer in the industrial pumps and compressors industry, spent more than $20,000, nearly 35 percent of his entire campaign cost, with Marcus & Allen — all for the part-time job of occupying the Tuckahoe seat on the Henrico County Board of Supervisors in 1995. But Pat O’Bannon, who had been active in the party for many years, opposed Johnson’s nomination. 
<p>She had been a teller, the person who collects votes and marks off voters, at the mass meeting that nominated Johnson against two other candidates. 
<p>She and others describe a case of possible ballot stuffing: One box contained more than 30 votes when O’Bannon first got it. She reported the problem to Ed Fuhr and says she got “a casual response to what appeared to be a major discrepancy.”
<p>O’Bannon is highly critical of the mass meeting system in general. She says she has seen it all — people from other districts coming and voting, registration mix-ups, audio-visual glitches during a candidate’s presentation.
<p>“People think it’s an accident and it’s done on purpose” by those who control the mass meetings, she says. “It’s very subtle. It’s hard to know [it’s happening] even when you’re the person watching.”
<p>O’Bannon, now the supervisor for the Tuckahoe district, is careful not to point the finger directly at Marcus. But she and other vocal critics of Marcus as well as his supporters agree — Marcus is a master at securing a nomination, be it through the mass meeting process, caucuses or primary. 
<p>“Boyd is the leader of a clique that maneuvers to control county mass meetings,” says former Henrico Supervisor Ray Shadwell.
<p>Says Wagner, the Henrico County Republican activist: “He surrounds himself with young suits who look like they came off the Xerox machine. ... There’s no way you can have scruples if you want to be on that team. Once you question ‘Why?’ you are a potential problem.”
<p>Ed Fuhr, who had Marcus’ help in getting re-elected to chairmanship of the Henrico Republican Committee, says, “Boyd is as skilled or more skilled than any political consultant in Virginia. It’s better to run without all his skills going against you.”
<p>That’s exactly what O’Bannon did when she decided to take on Marcus’ nominee, Johnson, for the Henrico Board of Supervisors. She announced her candidacy as an independent Republican and mounted a grassroots campaign against him. 
<p>With all of Marcus’ political muscle and fund-raising sources and the party nomination behind Johnson, O’Bannon stood little chance. And yet, she won. Of all the losses Marcus has had over the years, it is the one he says stings the most.
<p>“David Johnson was a big surprise,” Marcus says. “The expectations were so high. That’s the race in my life I’ve missed by the most.”
<p>Loss is part of the game, he says. Just one day after Jim Miller’s drubbing by John Warner in the June primary, Marcus was philosophical. “It’s disappointing but you’ve got to let it go. If you don’t have your emotions involved, you are not doing your job.” But life goes on too. “It’s not apocalyptic every time you have an election. It’s not the end of the world.”
<p>Still, the intense pressure to win political campaigns has not yet claimed Marcus as a victim. He remains standing in a field of bodies that have collapsed along the way — losing candidates, cynical activists, dried-up volunteers and burnt-out consultants. 
<p>“He is probably one of the most durable figures on the Republican side,” says Larry Sabato, political analyst and professor of government at U.Va. “His reputation is a fair one. He is a very tough, very competitive, very able political consultant. To survive you must play hardball.” 
<p>Marcus would agree. “I’ve always been very aggressive about using the rules to my advantage. If someone wrote the rule with a loophole I can drive my truck through, I will. Then they get very mad when you use it to win.” 
<p>He is a master of parliamentary maneuverings at conventions and mass meetings: He’ll keep the debate going until supporters of an opponent buckle with fatigue and go home; when it’s his right under the rules — whether or not it’s often done — he’ll “slate off” an opponent’s delegates, keeping them home from a convention. 
<p>Shadwell says he saw Marcus corner an opponent of Johnson’s at the nomination mass meeting and keep her talking past the time she could have thrown her vote to another candidate. All within the rules. Perhaps not popular, some would say not even right. But legal, and therefore, Marcus says, fair game.
<p>“It doesn’t make the people who are not elected happy,” Marcus says. “But you’re not happy when you’re not elected.” <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<font size=7><b>Echoes of an Era</b></font>
<hr size=2 noshade>

<p>When the Richmond delegation arrived at the Democratic convention in Chicago in August of 1968, the members found a startling scene. 
<p>Demonstrators against Lyndon Johnson and the Vietnam war confronted Mayor Richard J. Daley’s police outside the Convention Hall. The result was tear gas, violence and mass arrests, and more violence when the protestors tried to lead a march from Grant Park to the Convention Hall. 
<p>Television, Nixon’s downfall in the 1960 presidential debate, swept the Republican candidate into the presidency in ’68. After Chicago, Democrat Hubert Humphrey didn’t have a chance. 
<p>Abbie Hoffman, who proudly bore the title of Yippie (member of the Young International Party) was a prominent participant.  In 1969, as one of the famous Chicago Seven, he was indicted and tried for conspiracy and crossing state lines to incite a riot. He was acquitted of conspiracy but found guilty of the second charge.
<p>A generation later, Hoffman’s son Andrew has announced plans to lead groups of demonstrators in a “Festival of Life” during the 1996 Democratic Convention, again in Chicago. And Richard J. Daley’s son Richard M. Daley will be responsible for maintaining order. Hoffman’s group will join other groups like Chicago United Black Communities and the Not On The Guest List Coalition who say they will be there to demonstrate. It is the ultimate déjà vu.
<p>The late ’60s and early ’70s have become an era as heavy with myth and symbolism as with historical significance. When reminders of that chaotic and inspiring time reemerge, so do the same fears and expectations. 
<p>To some, the era symbolizes a loss of control and government run amuck. Kids grew long hair, screamed for the Beatles and the Stones, followed Timothy Leary’s lead in sampling and extolling the virtues of marijuana and LSD. The Great Society programs of the 1960s represent the country’s greatest failures, they say. 
<p>Other observers are nostalgic and romanticize the era. People believed in the system, believed all you needed was love and believed nonviolence was the key to social change. 
<p>Marketers tap that nostalgia and uncorrupted hope and use rock anthems of the ’60s and ’70s to sell investment opportunities and retirement planning. The flower children traded love beads for stock portfolios years ago. Now they worry about how to send their own kids to college, and how to protect them against repeating some of the same mistakes. 
<p>As we close in on the end of this century, we’ve resurrected the pop culture icons of a generation ago. With time taking the edge off the fears and the ecstasies of the ’60s and 70s, perhaps it’s just the elixir we need to ease into the 21st century.<img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<font size=6><b>A Useful Ferment</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Coming of age in the ’60s.</font>
<br><font size=4><i><b>by Betty Joyce Nash</b></i></font>
</ul>

<p>The  movements of the ’60s — civil rights, women’s, peace, environmental — that ultimately fashioned the nation’s attitudes and policies also influenced Richmond. VCU and the ever slightly bohemian Fan District drew area youth bored by the sameness of the suburbs and their parents’ conservatism.
<p>They created their own block parties and congregated in Monroe Park — one student house on Grove Avenue even seceded from the Union. It became The Grove Avenue Republic, to the consternation of most of the city which had thought to let this national agitation pass Richmond by. A group of some 200 protesters against the war garnered national attention when they held a demonstration in Monroe Park and threatened to burn a puppy. (No dogs were actually burned.)
<p>Hair became an international symbol of community, along with flared jeans, flowered shirts, marijuana and the peace sign. The nonconformers believed in a free and open society where peace and justice reigned. Long hair became such a potent symbol that, in 1968, the seniors at St. Christopher’s School were admonished to cut their hair or be barred from commencement. St. Christopher’s was not alone in its disdain for long hair and beards. In 1965, Richmond Professional Institute (the precursor of VCU) refused Robert Shoffner, Salvatore Federico and Norman Marshall permission to register for classes unless they shaved their beards and cut their hair. Shoffner and Marshall fought the ruling in court. When the Virginia Supreme Court sided with the college, Shoffner and Federico complied with the demand, but Norman Marshall took the case to the U.S. Supreme Court — which refused to hear his appeal.
<p>Richmond’s hippies were a tame lot. The 1967 hippie “wedding” and “love-in” in Monroe Park was such a tidy affair that the participants organized cleanup crews and cleared the park of debris afterward. Even the dialogue between the establishment and the young ’60s rebels was relatively gentle. When Councilman Phil J. Bagley complained about their use of the park, Greg Denton, 18, an art student, replied “I’m not saying I disagree with Mr. Bagley, but I wouldn’t want my sister to marry him.”
<p>This all may seem a little weird to us today, but the current culture of conservatism on today’s college campuses may set the stage for a return of the ’60s freewheeling attitudes, says VCU political science professor Herb Hirsch. He says he sees no signs of political activism or interest among his students. For his generation, protest was a badge of honor.
<p>Nowadays, he says, students are worried about getting a degree and a job. The skyrocketing costs of higher education forces them to work and go to school, sapping energy for reflection on the world’s vices and virtues.
<p>“There’s no time to sit around the commons talking about Bosnia,” he observes. But the harsh conservative rhetoric and efforts to implement what he calls “conservative cliches” may backfire. “If there’s anything that’s gonna bring back the ’60s, it’ll be the repression.”

<p>It’s impossible to remember the 1960s in Richmond without talking about race. Richmond native Carol Swann-Daniels, one of the first black students to attend all white schools in 1960, sees little hope that racism is ebbing. Rather, she says, it’s more overt than ever.
<p>“People are actually willing to take a personal situation and blame it on an entire class of people,” she says, referring to affirmative action and attitudes summed up in bumper stickers like the one that reads: “I’m an endangered species. How about a federal grant?”
<p>In the Richmond of 1960, to placate federal authorities, several black students were chosen to integrate public schools at time when black people were picketing Richmond businesses for front seats on the bus and at the Thalhimers lunch counter.
<p>At Chandler Junior High on the North Side, white students threw rocks, food, ink and paper airplanes with pins at the two black students. As a science fair winner, Swann-Daniels was asked to stay in a separate hotel from the other five winners. When students went bowling in gym class, the school had to purchase black students’ shoes so the bowling alley owner could assure white patrons he had not rented shoes to black people. And a school guidance counselor, writing to colleges to which Swann-Daniels had applied, referred to her as “it” throughout the letter. Sometimes she wanted to quit.
<p>“Little old black ladies would come up to me and say, ‘We’re counting on you.’” The teenager chose to go on.
<p>When she graduated from John Marshall High School in 1965, she wanted to get as far away from Richmond as possible. She earned a bachelor’s degree from Colby College in Maine and now works for the New Jersey Statewide Systemic Initiative, a movement to improve science and math education.

<hr size=1 width=75%>
<p>Desegregation opened the city to debate, something that had been mostly absent in Richmond. In 1968, Edmund Rennolds III graduated from St. Christopher’s and left his West End home for Harvard. He returned in 1972 and founded the Richmond Mercury with fellow Richmonders Rob Buford and Garrett Epps. It was an effort to provide investigative reporting for the city. The newspaper staff included journalists such as Frank Rich, who later became the drama critic and an op-ed columnist for The New York Times; and Lynn Darling, whose byline regularly appears in Harper’s Bazaar and other national magazines.
<p>The Mercury immediately caused consternation among the largely conservative citizens by opposing the Richmond Metropolitan Expressway, taking on the telephone company and supporting populist Henry Howell for governor. Howell appeared regularly in front of the State Corporation Commission opposing VEPCO and other “big boy” corporations when they asked for rate increases.
<p>Nevertheless, “we found a city surprisingly open to new ideas,” Rennolds recalls. “There had been some change in those four years. Many people who we considered conservative were interested in an alternative point of view.”
<p>Rennolds says his goal, then and now, was to generate more information so people could decide on important issues of the day. He started the non-profit American Forum and America’s Future Media Project, both of which distribute guest editorials to newspapers.
<p>“We loved Richmond. We wanted to do what we could to provide information to help people make good decisions,” he says. Advertisers were few and the Mercury folded in three years. But the paper contributed to the debate essential in a democracy, he says.
<p>Richmond has benefited noticeably from 1960s efforts to change the world. “Things built on what had happened before and there’s more open discussion of ideas. Richmond has opened up to that kind of thinking,” he says. “That ferment was useful.”
<p>That “ferment” helped shape the thinking of Richmonders like Les Smith, a former DJ for the wild and woolly WGOE Radio of the early 1970s who works in the education and resource division of the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.
<p>“It probably taught me liberal thinking, compassion and a cynicism for government and business that I didn’t have before,” he observes. “It led me to question more than I would have, including the counter culture. “
<p>Dan Brisbane, senior conservation technician at the Virginia Museum, had what many think was the quintessential ’60s experience: He went to Woodstock. He and five friends packed themselves into a Volkswagen, got to the site two days early and, as he says, “had a ball.” 
<p>To Brisbane, the decade meant soul-searching and anti-materialism. He says he sees the same thing among youth today.
<p>“When I look at the ’80s kids, they were interested in material things,” he recalls. “They had this feeling they had to go get theirs, go for the dough. Younger people now have a different attitude.”
<p>And Terry Rea, who has lived most of his life in the Fan and who ran the Biograph Theater in the 1970s, says his daughter and her friends, in their mid-20s, appear to “distrust the media and question the people who seem to be designing their world.”
<p>“I think that style [of] kid, instead of being thought of as a renegade, is starting to get cool again,” Rea says. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<font size=6><b>Why Are My Children Reliving My Life?</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Today’s teens conform to their parents’ rebellion.</font>
<br><font size=4><i><b>by Frederica Mathewes-Greene</b></i></font>
</ul>
<p>When my daughter came home from college she announced she wants to paint something else on her car. It’s already covered with daisies. Now she wants to add cartoon depictions of the Beatles, Yellow-Submarine style, on the doors. The tape rack inside is filled with Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix and the Doors. “Everybody I like is dead,” she says. 
<p>Her brother David is a couple of years younger. His golden hair flows over his shoulders, and he’s attempting by sheer force of willpower to generate a moustache and goatee. Wire-rim glasses complete the look. The other day I found him bent over his guitar, picking out the chords to Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone.”
<p>The funny thing is, I was picking out those same chords 25 years ago. I had granny glasses and daisies and boyfriends with long hair. It’s strange to see it all reappearing decades later. Why are my children reliving my life? Being around them is like stepping into my own high school yearbook.
<p>When I was a teenager, I wasn’t sneaking off with my mother’s old Sinatra records. I didn’t try to copy her shiny postwar hairstyle. The whole idea was rebellion. What’s confusing me is the current crop of teen-agers’ penchant for conformity — conformity to my adolescence, my rebellion.  
<p>Maybe this is just the fruit of an amazingly successful marketing ploy. About the time the Baby Boomers’ kids became teen-agers, we started recalling our tie-dyed years fondly. We resurrected our stars and styles and told our kids, “Isn’t this cool?” And they fell for it. As my daughter said at the time of the megahyped Woodstock II, “They just want us to spend our money on their old recycled hippie culture. We’re always celebrating some boomer anniversary. Our whole present is just boomer past.”
<p>Generation X may feel compelled to walk in lockstep 20 years behind the boomers. But another generation is coming up. My youngest son, Stephen, falls over the line into Generation Y. His hair is short, and his clothes are snappy and carefully coordinated. Lately he’s taken to referring to himself as “Stevebo” and “the old Steverino.” His Mother’s Day card to me read, “We love ya, ya big lug!” 
<p>My son, the 14-year-old Ratpacker. It’s not my teen years that he’s reliving; he’s skipped right over me and gone straight to a previous generation: his grandmother’s. I wonder if my mom still has those old Dean Martin records. I think she’s in for a surprise. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<font size=6><b>Now and Then</b></font>
<br><font size=5>For better or worse, icons of the ’60s and ’70s are back.</font>
<br><font size=4><i><b>by Maribeth Brewster</b></i></font>
</ul>

<p>Could there be anything more mystifying, more derivative or more insatiable than popular culture? Mercurial and inexplicable, it churns out stars, heroes and must-have fads at breakneck speed. But it also eats its own. In many ways, pop culture is one long regurgitation of ideas. Though the kinder, gentler consumer might call it the ultimate recycling effort, the fact remains that yes, everything old is new again.
<p>Currently, it’s that confusing transitional time of the late ’60s and early ’70s that is enjoying a cultural revival. What? You don’t believe it? Then you haven’t been peering in shop windows, checking out who’s starring at the mall multiplex or noticed the return of hip-hugging bell bottoms. The Beatles are back with new songs. White go-go boots are back on sale. And a streaker made it across Court One at Wimbledon. Hey, what year is it, anyway?

<p><b>Come On, Come On...</b>
<br>At first glance — and first listen — more than a few former rockers thought that the Queen of Rage and Blues, Miss Janis Joplin, was back. But closer scrutiny showed a slightly less ravaged young woman named Joan Osborne. More than reminiscent of Joplin in delivery and demeanor, at least Osborne has her own contemporary edge.

<p><b>All You Need Is Digital Remixing</b>
<br>After decades of silence — other than keeping the nation’s oldies radio stations in business — the prolific Fab Four proved that even a tragic death does not mean the music dies. Out with an anthology set of their music, including unproduced songs and vocal tracks by the late John Lennon, the remaining members of The Beatles experienced a financial déjà vu. The rest of us were doing doubletakes at seeing The Beatles back on Billboard’s charts.

<p><b>Terror in the Aisles</b>
<br>Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton pinned under a footbridge by the raging forces of Mother Nature. Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine pinned underwater by Shelley Winters. Oops, sorry, pinned underwater by a tsunami from an earthquake. Disaster movies are now hot properties, something Irwin Allen discovered back in the late ’60s, and total destruction will be coming soon to a theater — or at least a video store — near you.

<p><b>Have a Nice Day — Yeah, Right</b>
<br>It’s baaack. Oh yes and with a vengeance. From adorning candles to watch faces to earrings to little girls boxer shorts (yes, young ladies now want to wear boxers) that obnoxious, ubiquitous face is back in your face. What were they thinking?

<p><b>Retro Soles</b>
<br>Pounding the pavement these days are a variety of retrofitted footwear straight from the not-so-distant past. Chunky heels, platforms and Fab Four black Mod boots, the ’60s revival is a shoo-in. Don’t look now, the show your mother warned you about is back as well. Yes, now reappearing are those unyielding wooden summer staples of the late ’60s — Dr. Scholl’s sandals.

<font size=6><b>Best Restaurant Awards</b></font>
<br><font size=4>Some are rock-steady restaurants we’ve been writing about for years. But others are new, building big-portioned reputations fast. Spanning the various cuisines, from continental to Indian, French to Southern (perhaps an ethnic class all its own when done right), these are the best restaurants in Richmond, say our venerable table of four, having reviewed their way through yet another year of dining out.</font>

<hr size=1>

<br><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Amici</tt></font></b>
<br>Along with Franco’s, Amici is the Rolls Royce of Italian restaurants in Richmond. While the interior affords cozy comfort, the front patio fills for alfresco dining in welcoming weather. Chef Antonio Capece keeps his fans right at the forefront of Italian cuisine as it changes, offering classical presentations with an au courant twist. Fresh raviolis, stuffed with Chef Antonio’s special mixtures, are always whimsical and delicious. After all, Amici did introduce the fresh fennel salad to Richmond palates. But classical favorites, like osso bucco or calamari, are all that the great masters promised. Foccacia, made in its kitchen, changes daily, with different herb enhancements. Located in the heart of Carytown, it’s a favorite of intowners and suburbanites alike. 
<br><i>3343 W. Cary St. 353-4700</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>The Dining Room at the Berkeley</tt></font></b>
<br>The Dining Room at the Berkeley has been a dining mecca for six years. The graceful dining rooms, the polished service, and the good food have made dining here a good bet. Changes are clearly in store for the place now that Chef Jay Frank has left. His subtle fusion of classic, Asian, and old-fashioned Virginia food made dinner at this restaurant a standout culinary experience. Frank’s successor, Brad Haley, who was sous chef in Frank’s kitchen, has big shoes to fill. 
<br><i>1200 E. Cary St. 780-1300</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Fox Head Inn</tt></font></b>
<br>Owned by Sheryl Robins and Chef Robert Ramsey, The Fox Head Inn in Manakin is a real contender to join The Inn at Little Washington as a world-class Virginia restaurant. Chef Robert brings a world of creativity to this place, having worked in Europe and South America before choosing Richmond as the place to build his dream. 
<br>It’s a place where every dish is prepared with herbs and vegetables fresh from the garden in back, and where Chef Ramsey chooses high quality fish and meats. The place also has a terrific wine selection. 
<br>1840 Manakin Road 
<br><i>Manakin-Sabot 784-5126</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Franco’s Ristorante</tt></font></b>
<br>Chef/owner Paolo Randazzo takes traditional Italian ingredients and gives them new life in inventive combinations. The regular menu has lots of goodies, but look beyond the pastas and traditional favorites to the seasonal offerings for the real winners. Of particular note on the new summer menu are the fish and shellfish preparations, almost always given a delicious finish, whether off the grill or out of the pan. The wine list (mostly Italian) is terrific. The restaurant can be very busy, particularly on weekends, so make reservations. 
<br><i>Sassafras Square Shopping Center 270-9124</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>The Frog and the Redneck</tt></font></b>
<br>The Frog and the Redneck is a vaunted destination for out-of-towners and a list of Richmond regulars. With the latter has come a more serious and formal atmosphere than the livelier early days. Even “Happy’s” murals are more discreet than in the early days.
<br>Chef Jimmy Sneed domesticates the exotic and creates something as inviting as Sunday dinner at Mom’s. An example is the almost-signature red pepper-crabmeat soup, smooth as silk to palate and taste. Sneed’s drive for perfection is apparent in the variety of perfectly fresh fish finished with minimum enhancements so that the primary flavors come through. Accompaniments don’t compete with the main act (grits have never been in such good company). Adam Steely’s wine list is probably the most interesting in the city. 
<br><i>1423 East Cary St. 648-3764</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Grafiti Grille</tt></font></b>
<br>Owned by Kenneth Bendheim, this West End eatery is a year old, brashly colorful, gregariously noisy and usually crowded. The menu changes every three weeks, and we haven’t ordered a loser yet. Risotto-stuffed quail with red cabbage and mashed potatoes is a winner, and the lamb chops, goat cheese and fresh spinach are delights here. Customers’ favorites sometimes stay on the menu or reappear in the menu cycles. And it all comes at a fair price. 
<br><i>403-B Ridge Road 288-0633</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Lemaire</tt></font></b>
<br>All the components add up to make dining at Lemaire in The Jefferson a satisfying experience. The setting is unequaled in these parts. The several lavish and elegant rooms offer an intimate space for romantic dinners, and other areas are large enough to accommodate private parties. Chef Mark Lagenfeld has a talent for the traditional. His preparations are varied, balanced and well-presented. The wine list is extensive and carries numerous Virginia wines. 
<br><i>The Jefferson 788-8000</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Millie’s</tt></font></b>
<br>It’s hard to say anything about this place that hasn’t already been said in Gourmet magazine, Bon Appetit, House & Garden or in Style Weekly. It’s the preferred diner for gourmets, anointed by the harshest critics as well as by hungry folks just looking for a rolling good time. It has the best juke box in town and, if no one’s sliding in the quarters, the staff puts ’em in. 
<br>The Devil’s Mess, a curried omelet with great lumps of sausage, veggies and cheese, is still Millie’s signature. For dinner, you might see grilled salmon over black beans one week, only to have it replaced by something equally exotic the next. Owners Paul and Lisa Keevil have opened Millie’s in the Outer Banks and are no longer onsite. Let’s hope nothing changes. 
<br><i>2603 E. Main St. 643-5512</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>La Petite France</tt></font></b>
<br>La Petite France has, for 25 years, set the standard in the area for formal dining. Chef Paul Elbling and his lovely wife, Marie-Antoinette, are full of charm. The plush clublike comfort and ambient formality of the dining rooms, the attentive and impeccable service make the restaurant a good destination for special occasions as well. The food remains classic French. The seasonal specials are usually even more interesting than the “regular” menu, and some Virginia favorites are often given a French twist. Finish the night off with one of Chef Paul’s dessert souffles.
<br><i>2108 Maywill St. 353-8729</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>The Track</tt></font></b>
<br>The Track has been going strong for almost 15 years. Owner Chris Liles and Chris Saladino (his chef going on 10 years now) know how to get the job done. Daily specials play up what’s seasonal and prime. Regulars know that shad roe is featured in early spring, and that soft-shell crabs have a place on the menu during the summer. Among the fish and shellfish, there may be duck breast, a couple of cuts of beef, lamb chops and a chicken breast. This small Carytown spot is quiet enough for good conversation, and an early reservation may land you your favorite table or booth. 
<br><i>2915 West Cary St. 359-4781</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Chopstix</tt></font></b>
<br>When Madeleine Wood came to the U.S. from Vietnam in 1979, she had no intention to open a restaurant. But one thing led to another, and four years ago she opened Chopstix in Carytown. Lovers of Vietnamese food are glad she did. The former piano teacher and her husband serve up some of the best Asian eats in town, and many of their recipes are her mother’s. Others are pulled from cookbooks she brought from her homeland. 
<br>Fresh spring rolls packed full of shrimp, rice noodles and a touch of cilantro are perfect starters. Favorite entrees include beef and potato, seafood delight and grilled chicken over rice noodles. Occasionally, a special dish like stuffed squid is offered. 
<br><i>3129 W. Cary St. 358-7027</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Full Kee Restaurant</tt></font></b>
<br>In their eagerness to adapt their cuisine to American tastes, Asian restaurants often edit out all but the most familiar and end up with dull imitations, served with rice of course. Full Kee, in the diverse Crestview area, has a big following of Chinese Americans because it serves the real thing. The restaurant is plain and unassuming, and the menu offers a chance to expand horizons beyond the popular Chinese-American dishes. Duck feet may be too exotic for some, but others will love it. 
<br><i>6400 Horsepen Road 673-2233</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Greek Island</tt></font></b>
<br>Year after year, this continues to be our favorite getaway. And if you live anywhere near the city, a getaway it is, located on the far reaches of Hull Street Road, across from Victorian Square. But once you get there, you’ll think you’ve arrived in the homeland. Owners Faye and Ted Kefalas oversee everything with such sharp eyes that you know you’re getting the real thing. And all the cooking is done by a family member, if not by Ted or Faye, then by son George. Over the years, the Kefalas’s have created such a following that they stay open seven days a week for dinner. Ted’s marinated and grilled chicken tenders sound simple, but you’ll never figure out the complexity of flavors he imparts. Everything — from spanokopita to tiropita and back to bread — made here, lovingly, by the hands you see. Ted and Faye are always dreaming of going back to their home on Paros, but their fans beg them to stay. Better get there before they change their minds. 
<br><i>10902 Hull St. 674-9199</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>India House</tt></font></b>
<br>Two of the charms of this modest dining room are the owners, Ram and Suguna Pai. Ram’s easy friendliness and concern for his diners’ well-being makes a meal there a pleasant and, if you choose, informative experience. Knowledgeable about food, Ram can tell you much about the foods of his native land. He’s worked the American food chains, too, and knows a thing or two about American food habits. The kitchen has a big following among vegetarians and among the local Indian community. 
<br><i>2313 Westwood Ave. 355-8378</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Indochine</tt></font></b>
<br>Good Asian cooking brings flavors, texture, and colors into a harmonious and subtle balance. If you stir the strong and long French presence into the already diverse Vietnamese culinary stockpot, it makes what’s in the pot even more interesting. Indochine, a relative newcomer to Carytown and the growing number of Vietnamese spots around town, gives us a taste from this culinary melting pot. The food at Indochine is not about bold and sassy flavors, but nuance and refinement. 
<br><i>2923 West Cary St. 353-5799</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Mamma ’Zu</tt></font></b>
<br>I’ve heard all the complaints about waiting too long for a table at Mamma ’Zu. All I can say is I’ve never had a problem. If there were but one day left before the end of the world, I’d spend it at Mamma ’Zu. I like the kitchsy decor. I like the Elvis-to-Pavarotti sound selection. I even like the long line, because I know that many people can’t be wrong. I like knowing that I’m just as likely to run into friends from the West End as I am to see very different pals from the East End. And most of all, I like the food. Whether it’s a meaty, plate-sized Portabella mushroom, or shrimp swimming in a fiery Fra Diavolo sauce atop a pile of linguine the size of Bermuda, I love it all. Owner/chef Ed Vasaio walks the edge. He always offers the requisite Italian dishes, like eggplant Parmesan (although it sells out fast) and various pastas. But he usually has something extra special for the gastronome. It might be calves brains; it might be a gigantic seafood soup. 
<br><i>501 Pine St. 788-4205</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Mékong Restaurant</tt></font></b>
<br>Mékong is a fairly recent addition to the growing list of Vietnamese restaurants in Richmond. This comfortable and pleasant spot has an extensive menu offering specialties from all areas of Vietnam. From familiar spring rolls, a dozen noodle soups, barbecues, stir-fries to more exotic dishes like eel in a hot pot. Owned by Liem Bui, the restaurant offers an exciting mix of flavors, and all at a good price. 
<br><i>6004 W. Broad St. 288-8929</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Hana Zushi</tt></font></b>
<br>If sushi is what you want, this is the place. And not just because it’s the only restaurant in Richmond dedicated to sushi. During the past eight years, Hana Zushi has built a reputation for being not just good, but very good in the food department. Service, however, can be slow. Lunchtime bustles with downtown workers looking for light, healthy food. And dinnertimes bring enough folks from farther away to fill the tables. In the summer, the spider roll is a don’t-miss dish. Crispy slices of softshell crabs are rolled into rice with a spicy paste for a delicious variation on a seasonal favorite. If your mate loves the raw stuff, there are plenty of selections for all tastes. Teriyaki, tempura, gyoza (dumplings) and a variety of noodle dishes are tasty and filling. 
<br><i>1309 E. Cary St. 225-8801</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Saigon</tt></font></b>
<br>If you want to follow those in the know, this little Grace Street eatery is the place for Vietnamese dining. There are more lavish places, like Vietnam Garden, Chopstix or Indochine, that afford greater creature comforts, atmosphere or longer menus. You won’t find carved carrots or linen tablecloths at Saigon, but owner Tai Vannguyen’s countrymen prefer to dine with him. It’s also a favorite of VCU academes and artists, as well as of other professional foodies in town. (Ask The Frog and the Redneck Chef Jimmy Sneed where he goes for Vietnamese food.) The Saigon salad, laden with shrimp, can be a meal for one or a great warmup for two. And the soups — especially Nam Vang or My Tho — take the nip out of a chilly day. Family-owned and -staffed, Saigon is the quaint and friendly choice of Vietnamese restaurants. 
<br><i>903 W. Grace St. 355-6633</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Thai Dinner</tt></font></b>
<br>It’s a most unlikely marriage, but it seems to be working. Exotic Thai food served in the evening alongside hot fudge cake and triple scoops of Rocky Road. The varied and exotic flavors of Thai cooking are somewhat tamed in the atmosphere of an American ice-cream parlor, but not to worry. The curries, red and green, are particularly interesting, spicy and complex without being overpowering. The noodle and fried rice are also interesting dishes. It’s a good value, and you can always finish with a double dip of Butter Brickle. 
<br><i>Westland Shopping Center 270-2699</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Vietnam Garden</tt></font></b>
<br>Among the early Vietnamese restaurants in the area, Vietnam Garden has long provided bowls and plates of this savory, diverse cuisine at reasonable prices. Whether you want a light supper of one of the noodle soups, a heartier meal from the several stir-fries, or a more exotic combination, you’ll find that the food is flavorful and ample. The space is modest but comfortable, and the waitstaff is cheerful.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Blue Point Seafood</tt></font></b>
<br>Starters at Blue Point include Cockenoe oysters, jerked shrimp and jumbo shrimp cocktail from the raw bar. Appetizers are clam chowder, fried calamari and Maryland crab meat balls. Two of the more unusual entree items are the pan roasts, rich bodied, delicate bisque-like stews, and Provencales, a tomato-sauce-based dish. Dinners include three preparations of shrimp among other seafoods, plus chicken and a token New York strip steak.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Crab Louie’s Seafood Tavern</tt></font></b>
<br>Crab Louie’s, open more than 10 years, is housed in the reworked remnants of an 18th-century plantation house on the South Side. The eatery has a loyal following. Its real strength is the big menu (almost 30 entrees). The kitchen takes the fresh catch from charted waters and doesn’t bother with trendy offerings. There’s something for everybody.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>The Hard Shell</tt></font></b>
<br>Tucked in a row of warehouses on East Cary Street, The Hard Shell is the relative newcomer on a block that includes The Frog and the Redneck. Open since early last summer, this place has become a standard for fresh seafood prepared in a wide variety of creative ways. 
<br>Raw bar fare includes a lobster bar, shellfish lovers can choose from shrimp, mussels, oysters, clams and crab served in several ways. For entrees, you can’t go wrong with jumbo lump crab cakes or the pasta.

<br>Azzurro is wonderfully cosmopolitan, a bit of New York and Milan right here in Richmond. The food is good (everything from antipastis to pasta to secondi piattis) and ranges from grilled veggies (Grigliata Di Verdura Con Aglio e Olio, $8.50) to spinach linguine with a Gorgonzola cream sauce (Trennete Verde Al Gorgonzola, $11.25). The menu, printed in Italian with English subtitles, is diverse. Azzurro’s brick oven heats up Azzurro’s pizzas.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Buckhead’s</tt></font></b>
<br>With all the world being so health conscious these days, it’s a wonder that any place specializing in red meat could keep its doors open. Even in its humble location at Beverly Hills Shopping Center, Buckhead’s draws not only the hearty appetite but the discerning one. If you consider it tacky to leave with leftovers, you probably won’t enjoy the value of this place. Prices are comparatively high, but if you swallow your pride instead of forcing down those last bites, you’ll dine again on that same dish. Beef isn’t the only star, although it certainly shines. Lamb chops are excellent, as is the creamed spinach. Onion rings are freshly made and 
<br>proportionally as big as the cuts of meat. Waiters are gregarious, efficient and as good as any you’d find in a New York chop house.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>du Jour</tt></font></b>
<br>In its 12th year, du Jour continues to offer creative seasonal menus for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch. OK, so lunch can be a bit noisy, but that’s no reason to miss out on the grilled vegetarian with its creamy pepper dressing and avocados. Or the roast beef and brie sandwich, Manakintowne red lettuces salad and 10 different specials du jour. The dinner menu changes weekly with a seasonal slant. Chef Michael Cadaret is a talent.

<br>Chef Q Derks at Avalon is one of many chefs around who’ve caught the spirit of the culinary revolution that started more than two decades ago. She is also one of the more imaginative, often combining unlikely ingredients and ethnic flavors in unusual ways. Her menus are seasonal and make use of each season’s wealth with a style all her own. Derks likes using fruits in unexpected ways and has a penchant for piquing the palate with chile peppers — a wake-up call to soporific summer appetites. The food at Avalon is never dull.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Davis & Main</tt></font></b>
<br>Davis & Main is one of the Fan’s most reliable bistros. An excellent neighborhood destination, the place offers a diverse menu, reasonable prices and comfortable setting. The grill is the cornerstone of the restaurant. For years, it’s been the place to head for those who want to eat when most places only want to turn off the stoves. The nightly blackboard specials (pasta, fish, or meat) are dependably good. It’s often noisy and busy, but the good waitstaff keeps everything moving. 
<br><i>2501 W. Main St. 353-6641</i>

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Helen’s</tt></font></b>
<br>One of the best restaurants around for people looking for inventive, well-prepared food. The place was revamped two years ago; the interior is comfortable and casual, so people can immerse themselves in perusing the eclectic menu. Recent winners include the scallop katsu with fried noodles and soy butter ($8) and the shrimp ravioli ($8). The grilled tuna with gingered miso and roasted scallion sauce ($18) is also superb. Desserts are creative. The menu changes weekly.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Zeus Gallery</tt></font></b>
<br>This tiny Fan restaurant near the Virginia Museum is a gem. Getting one of the few tables can be a challenge, but it’s worth the effort. The little chalkboard menus change often, relying on fresh and seasonal ingredients and running the gamut from pastas to meats. The chef sends the plates to table with interesting and lovely presentations. Salads and entrees are quite good. The wine list is superb.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>La Grotta</tt></font></b>
<br>While Amici is the place for an upscale, full-of-frills Italian meal, its sister restaurant La Grotta (both restaurants are owned by Carlo Gaione and Antonio Capece) offers equally good food in an earthy setting. Walking down into the belly of a wine cellar, you know you’re in for a heady experience. If you can pass the antipasti bar — laden with fanciful delights like stuffed artichokes, seafood or white bean salad, tomatoes with fresh mozzarella and more — without gorging, you’ll have room for all the wonderful breads made daily, the pizza cooked before your eyes in a wood-burning oven, or a thick, hearty sandwich on fresh foccacia. Catering to the downtown lunch crowd, prices are quite affordable. 
<br>Unlike at Amici, pastas are not freshly made but rather of the higher quality dried variety. (Fresh pastas would drive the prices up too far to keep lunchtime filled.) Nonetheless, the sauces are brimming with flavors of fresh herbs and vegetables. The green lasagna — green pasta, red sauce — has hooked many a diner. And the cheese-stuffed zucchini is so rich you’ll think you had a quart of cream for lunch. This may be the best bargain in town.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>The Tobacco Company</tt></font></b>
<br>We sometimes forget that The Tobacco Company was a pioneer in Shockoe Slip and also in the national trend toward warehouse chic. The multileveled restaurant is still a visual stunner. With attention to good live music and a bar that serves everything under the sun, the restaurant has never become dull, even in its lauded success. It has never pretended to be a trendsetter with its food, but the menus almost always reflect the changing tastes of the volatile food scene.

<br>Michael Ripp, owner of Havana ’59, knows the visual is often as important as the culinary. The restaurant (clotheslines flapping overhead and towering banana trees) seems to have as many different cultural influences as Cuba itself. The almond-crusted rockfish and the grilled salmon on baby greens with saffron hollandaise are delicious. The appetizers are creative. Weekend brunch menus are inventive. (Chef Robert Hayes has recently moved over to Ripp’s newest venture, Chico’s Mansion.)

<br>At the bottom of Bottega’s lunch menu, it says, “Water is served upon request.” Now that’s European! Everything about the place feels like an Italian bistro from the low lighting to tables placed close to one another. Located next to sister restaurant Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Bottega and Chef Brian Light have stolen the hearts of diners in search of gourmet pasta, salads, pizza and entrees.
<br>Starters at Bottega include a melt-in-your-mouth carpaccio of seared beef tenderloin with greens, crostini and white truffle oil and cornbreaded calamari. Pizzas are popular lighter fare choices. Six different specialty pasta dishes, from fettucine to crispy ravioli, combine ingredients popular with ’90s palates. Bottega has a good Italian wine list.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=5><tt>Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse</tt></font></b>
<br>Best known for its large portions and classic steakhouse atmosphere, Ruth’s Chris serves more prime cuts than almost any other steakhouse in town. This is one place where beef tastes “like buttah.”
<br>Located in Bellgrade in an old farmhouse, the place is part of a nationwide chain, but it doesn’t have that cookie-cutter feel. Chef Roger Murphy prepares all the standard cuts of beef, plus a few seafood entrees. Nightly specials might include a petite filet with portabella mushroom, lamb with rosemary sauce or swordfish stuffed with crabmeat. A side order of asparagus is big enough for two.

<h2>Chef Talk</h2>
<h3><i>by Madeline Hutcheson</i></h3>
<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=4><tt>Paul Ebling</tt></font></b>
<br><b>Q.</b> What brought you to Richmond?
<br><b>A.</b> I met a Virginia legislator 26 years ago when I was in Washington over Bastille Day. We became friends. I wanted to open a restaurant in Washington, but he persuaded me to come to Richmond. I opened La Petite 25 years ago.

<p><b>Q.</b> What’s your background?
<br><b>A.</b> I’m from Alsace, France. My mother was a teacher, my father a forester. I started a three-year apprenticeship when I was 13 and then attended the Cordon Bleu in Paris. I also worked during the summer season at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes on the Riviera in Engleberg, Switzerland ... and then at the Georges V in Paris. For three years I was in the French Army during the Algerian War.

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=4><tt>Ram Pai</tt></font></b>
<br><b>Q.</b> What’s new?
<br><b>A.</b> My wife Saguna and I recently bought Amy’s yogurt shop on Grace Street. We’re calling it Cafe India. It’s a custom yogurt shop and we also serve Indian specials for lunch. What we’re doing is similar to India House. When we bought [India House] five years ago, it was owned by a Greek man and had been the Westwood Grill for years. Originally, we opened for dinner and served Indian food, but kept the Westwood Grill open for lunch. Gradually we began adding Indian food to the menu. Now, we don’t serve anything but Indian food.

<p><b>Q.</b> Yogurt and Indian, together?
<br><b>A.</b> The yogurt machine is a one of a kind. We’ve also got a deli case and have Indian food to go. We’re hoping to hire a chef from India and are awaiting word on whether he can come. My wife is from Bombay, and she says being on Grace Street is very familiar to her because it reminds her of Bombay. The menu will be mostly vegetarian. 

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=4><tt>Q Derks</tt></font></b>
<br><b>Q.</b> Why cooking?
<br><b>A.</b> My parents had a house in Duck, N. C., and while I was in high school, I worked at the Barrier Island Inn. That’s where my interest in food began. By the time I’d graduated from high school, I’d worked my way up to head chef. It was a steak and seafood place, but I was able to get more and more creative with the specials we’d have. 

<p><b>Q.</b> What do you try to do at Avalon?
<br><b>A.</b> Originally [owner] Ron’s Houck’s concept was based on foods from different islands, inspired from the mythical island of King Arthur. ... I’m now creating menus that I feel comfortable with. We’ve moved away from the island thing and into what we call “contemporary global” cuisine. On the last menu, I [created] what we called a New Mexican duck enchilada — roasted duck rolled in a red corn tortilla with goat cheese, spinach and tomatoes with a “drunken” chili sauce and topped with avocado, sour cream and served with beans and rice. 

<p><b><font color=#3333cc size=4><tt>Robert Hayes</tt></font></b>
<BR><b>Q.</b> What’s Chico’s Mansion all about?
<br><b>A.</b> Chico’s is owned by Mike Ripp, who also owns Havana ’59, and that is what brought me to Richmond. It’s an eclectic restaurant with a theme from a fictitious character named Chico who wins the lottery and purchases a magnificent mansion on the Pacific Coast of Mexico. He converts it to a wonderful restaurant. The cuisine is a fusion of Pacific Coast Mexican and Southern Provincial French. Both are light but very flavorful. As the story goes, Angelique, Chico’s beautiful French girlfriend, has a hand in the very definite French influence. 

<p><b>Q.</b> And the food?
<br><b>A.</b> We’ve blended the cultural cuisines into a creative, classical style. If I have to choose favorites, the avocado tart with smoked trout and truffle vinaigrette is a good example of the fusion of classical French and Mexican cuisine. The veal Chico is a wonderful variation of veal Oscar, using lobster and a chipolte pepper hollandaise. ... I plan to change the menu with the seasons. Since we import many of the products, we begin preparations many weeks before we offer a new menu.<img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<br>They start from scrimmage. First, the Yellow Team lines up, then the Green Team. The ball is snapped. Drew Brydie and Latasha Burwell go wide left. Charmae Drake and Tenesha Pettus stay back. O’brien Phillips runs left and fakes a pass while Tiffany Hill and Ratrelle Jackson rush in to tackle Jonith Irving. 
<p>Between plays, there’s laughter, jostling, gossip and a bit of flirting. 
<p>This is tag football, played by kids who usually play on the streets of Jackson Ward, Blackwell or Gilpin Court. Today, they’re running up and down the big, bright Cary Street Field at VCU. Coach J.J. Myers calls the shots. “OK now, line up, let’s get ourselves together, we’re a team, let’s play like a team!”
<p>Olympic-caliber athletes, they’re not. At least not yet.
<p>These kids may never bring home a gold medal, but National Youth Sports Program (NYSP) officials hope they’ll bring home something even more important: the desire to go to college.
<p>“For some of these kids, this is their first experience on a college campus, and we’re hoping that they will feel comfortable here, and that they’ll see people who look just like them and say, ‘Hey, I could do that, I could go to college,’” says VCU project administrator Julie Appleby.
<p>The camp gives kids from low-income neighborhoods a chance to experience summer camp, with everything from football to basketball to African dance to art. The program, which receives money from the NCAA and a federal grant, has more than 66,000 participants nationally; more than 200 are enrolled at VCU this summer. The goal is to get kids familiar with college campuses, and to whet their appetite for education and sport.

<font size=6 color=#669900><b>Kings Dominion Grows Up</b></font>
<br><font size=4>From Yogi Bear to Star Trek, the little amusement park that could emerges a bona fide theme park.</font>
<h3><i>by Janet Giampietro</i></h3><p>


<hr size=1>
<br>They come in droves to Paramount’s Kings Dominion.
<p>Even on weekdays in the summertime, the families, the teens, the couples dressed alike pour into the Doswell theme park looking for non-stop entertainment. They park in, say, the Funky Phantom row of the 10,000-space parking lot, pay their $28.95 apiece and shlep the cameras, the sunscreen, the diaper bags, the huge stuffed animals and the kids from ride to ride, from line to line, from snack to snack all day until someone declares they’ve had their fill.
<p>Some things never change.
<p>While the park experience itself is a constant, the landscape all around park goers for the past 21 years has evolved from the humble beginnings of an 80-acre “wild” animal safari to a bona fide theme park, a transition sealed when the park was sold in 1992 to Paramount. Its ties with Paramount and parent company Viacom (which also owns Blockbuster Entertainment) give Kings Dominion the kind of muscle to exploit a world of intellectual properties including Star Trek, Nickelodeon, “Wayne’s World” and “Days of Thunder,” with many more to come.
<p>What Paramount’s Kings Dominion is banking on for the future is the synergistic effect of an amusement park ride with the added bonus of a movie, TV or other intellectual property tie-in. Executive Vice President and General Manager Wilson Flohr calls it top spin. “Four years ago we didn’t have the ability to readily afford ourselves these intellectual properties. Disney and Universal are masters of that.”
<p>It’s strange to think of the Funky Phantom as an intellectual property. The obscure 1970s Hanna-Barbera cartoon character is a throwback, a symbol of a time when Kings Dominion was just an amusement park. Back before “theme” became a verb. But if you look closely, you’ll see that there are a lot of remnants of the old Kings Dominion still lurking inside the nooks and crannies of every themed area. Sometimes it is as obvious as the antique cars that putter by just yards from the entrance of the Days of Thunder race simulator, or the old Wave Swing. Other hangers-on are a little more subtle — the kitschy flower street lights that line the blacktop walkways, the Liberty Bell replica you’ll walk by a thousand times before wondering what the heck it’s doing there, the state fair/boardwalk games that, while popular, would most likely never make it into the plans for a modern-day theme park.
<p>They harken back to a time when rides and games and maybe a few wild animals were all it took in the amusement park game. James E. Copp arrived as controller for Kings Dominion when they were digging the footers for the park’s trademark replica of the Eiffel Tower. Today, he is vice president of finance and administration. 
<p>“When I came, corn was growing here,” Copp says tapping the surface of a long conference table in the park’s modest marketing offices, located in a whole other world just behind an inconspicuous green gate inside the park. “The county was pretty much in favor of us,” he says but acknowledges that there were skeptics who anticipated the arrival of a roving band of carneys.
<p>That was back before the state and county would throw incentives the way of a major theme park and corporation. Times have changed. It was Kings Dominion that anted up for the interchange at the I-95 Doswell exit and for widening Route 30. Staffed by 250 full-time employees and roughly 2,000 part-timers, it was owned by Taft Broadcasting Co., which also owned the successful Kings Island park in Cincinnati, Ohio.
<p>It seemed a winning formula, but the ripple effects of Disneyland could be felt 3,000 miles away. Opened in 1955 in Anaheim, Ca., Disney had changed everything. It eschewed the traditional amusement park elements — the midway, the standard rides — and provided guests with a fantasy world. A theme.
<p>When Kings Dominion opened the amusement park in 1975, it introduced Happy Land of Hanna-Barbera, Coney Island with the Rebel Yell roller coaster and midway games, and International Street gift shops. In the mid-1980s, armed with the licensing for the Smurfs, it introduced Smurf Mountain. It was the beginning of theming, but still a loosely tied notion at best.
<p>Today, the theming in some parts of the park is tight as a drum. From the moment guests enter attractions like Days of Thunder they are immersed in a singular experience. Along the snaking line route, they can peer into an authentic NASCAR race car. While they wait for the doors to open they watch (sometimes three or four times) a wall of video screens that prepares them for the simulator experience with pre-race instructions from Kyle Petty. Even after the ride, the ride is not over. The exit doors deposit riders directly into a video arcade from which it is harder to excise an 8-year-old than an abscessed molar from a terrified dental patient. There is also a gift shop with NASCAR gear and in the realm of theming the virtually unthemeable, a woodcarving shop called the Speedway Workshop.
<p>Days of Thunder, however, was a mere dry run for areas like Wayne’s World, an entire section of the park with a roller coaster, games, gift shops and snack bar all related to the movie Wayne’s World. Though Flohr calls it a “teen, hip place,” park officials already concede that Wayne’s World may get dated quickly. By the time the movie becomes nothing more than a most excellent memory, Kings Dominion could re-theme it as a rock ’n’ roll area, park officials say.
<p>This year’s big draw is the Outer Limits: Flight of Fear attraction. It is obvious from the second guests enter the compound that the full power of Paramount, with all its movie-making creativity, is at work. Inside, the spaceship, a silver pie plate with green lights, looks as good as anything in movies, except perhaps the spectacles of “Independence Day.” 
<p>A number of video monitors follow the drama that is supposedly unraveling at the fictional Fort Cooper military base that is holding the top-secret craft. Creative smirks, like a newscast speculation that the spaceship is nothing more than a hoax by a local amusement park promoting its newest attraction and a White House aide named Dick, pepper the production. 
<p>But once the coaster launches, from sitting still to 53 miles per hour in four seconds and into a dark loop, the previous show is left behind. For 68 topsy turvy seconds there is nothing but the hope that you will make it through the knot of steel alive.
<p>“I’m still shaking, man,” says Dan Dryman of Portsmouth as he emerges into daylight and holds out his hand for proof. He and his four companions agree: it was the coolest ride they’d ever been on and it was well worth the two-hour wait. Other riders agree, after they catch their breath.
<p>It’s hard to say what will come next for Kings Dominion, especially since park officials won’t divulge future plans. But with access to Paramount intellectual properties such as the Academy Award winning “Braveheart,” this summer’s “Escape from L.A.” and “A Very Brady Sequel,” it’s anyone’s guess. A battle simulator that throws you into the middle of 15,000 screaming Scotsmen and a snackbar that serves raw lamb intestines? A roller coaster that plunges you into the depths of post-apocalyptic Los Angeles? A retro SeventiesLand where kids don plaid polyester and tumble around on Astroturf and where the snack bar serves porkchops and applesauce? We can only dream. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<br>Kings Dominion has only one thrill, the Lion Country Safari. More than 600,000 people will pay $3.50 to drive their own cars through 80-acres filled with 200-300 animals normally not found along the interstate. 

<p><font size=5 color=#669900><b>1975</b></font>
<br>KD opens the entire park to the 1.8 million visitors.  Visitors shell out $7.50 for general admission and a buck extra to see the safari. Original attractions Rebel Yell and the Eiffel Tower open.

<br><font size=6 color=#990033><b>Thrill Rides</b></font>
<br><big><i>Kings Dominion boasts more wooden roller coasters than any park in the U.S. Add to that the three steel coasters, and roller coaster enthusiasts could spend the whole day without once looking in the direction of the Eiffel Tower. 
<br>Like the varied sections of the park itself, the coasters reflect different times, different eras, different sensibilities.
</i></big>
<p><font size=5 color=#990033><b>Outer Limits: Flight of Fear</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Description:</b></font> They call it the spaghetti bowl, a twisted knot of steel coaster track a little longer than the Anaconda — 2,764 feet — in one-quarter the space. The thrill here is the launch, from 0 to 53 mph in four seconds straight into a loop. 
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Personality profile:</b></font> “Type A” roller coaster, most frequently described as “intense.” In a big hurry too. The whole ride lasts 68 seconds.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>White knuckle test:</b></font> They’ll be white as snow, presuming you can ever pry them off the shoulder restraints.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Worth-the-waitness:</b></font> Definitely worth the two-hour wait the first time you ride. After that, wait for off-hours.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Expression on your face in the photo:</b></font> Unmitigated terror.

<p><font size=5 color=#990033><b>Anaconda</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Description:</b></font> The highest lift hill at Kings Dominion, with a 144-foot drop. The only looping coaster in the world with an underwater tunnel. You’ll be upside down six times.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Personality profile:</b></font> The one your mother always warned you about. Slick and good looking but unpredictable, with dangerous curves and corkscrews. And of course he drops you at your door way too soon. Total ride time: Just over a minute and a half.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>White knuckle test:</b></font> Just try not to burst a lung as you plunge toward the lake and into the underwater tunnel.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Worth-the-waitness:</b></font> Always worth even a lengthy wait, but avoid it if the Outer Limits is closed. 
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Photo:</b></font> Hair-raising.

<p><font size=5 color=#990033><b>Shock Wave</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Description:</b></font> A ride you can stand up for. In fact, you must stand for. There are no real seats on the Shock Wave, only 2,231 feet of steel track with two loops and a 95-foot drop. Screams are audible from the pizza parlor.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Personality Profile:</b></font> Over-the-top. The Jim Carrey of roller coasters. It’s wild and crazy, like the person who is constantly “on.” Always trouble, the friend most likely to get you arrested. You’ll have a blast ’til it’s time to get bailed out. Not the kind of coaster you build loyalty to.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>White knuckle test:</b></font> Remember to tell your mother you loved her. Wear clean underwear.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Worth-the-waitness:</b></font> This ride’s a quick fix. You can’t wait much more than 45 minutes without feeling cheated once the buzz wears off.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Photo:</b></font> Shock. What else?

<p><font size=5 color=#990033><b>Hurler</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Description:</b></font> The first heavily “themed” coaster, it’s tied into the “Wayne’s World” movies, and scenes from both loop over and over on overhead monitors while you wait. Can get annoying by the third time Wayne explains that the ride’s height requirement excludes Keebler elves. Practically new (1994) wooden coaster with 3,157 feet of track that hurls you at 50 miles per hour. In ten years, we may have to explain to Generation Next that hurl was a cute word for puke.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Personality Profile:</b></font> The well-meaning class clown. You’ll laugh more than scream every time you get lifted out of your seat. The Hurler is your fast-moving, funny friend who wouldn’t hurt a fly. He’s not trying to toss you upside down. He’s laughing with you, not at you.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>White knuckle test:</b></font> No time for your knuckles to turn white, besides you’re having too much fun to hold on that tight.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Worth-the-waitness:</b></font> Way.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Photo:</b></font> Delight.

<p><font size=5 color=#990033><b>The Grizzly</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Description:</b></font> Hidden in the woods, this 1982 wooden coaster drops you 87 feet then twists and turns you through a convoluted double figure-eight track.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Personality Profile:</b></font> The strong and silent hermit. A loner who lives in the woods. You can’t get a good look at him until you’re deep into his territory and he’s got you right where he wants you. The Unabomber of roller coasters — mysterious, troubled, smart and terrifying.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>White knuckle test:</b></font> From the first clankity clank of the chain link pull to the last rattle, you’ll shake and quake with fear — especially as you plunge into the pitch black tunnel that threatens decapitation. Pump up the fear factor by three in the dark of night.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Worth-the-waitness:</b></font> With a fairly lengthy 2:15 ride time, it’s a good return on your time investment. Satisfies every time.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Photo:</b></font> Gritted teeth.

<p><font size=5 color=#990033><b>Rebel Yell</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Description:</b></font> Up, down, up, down, up, down, repeat as needed. Twelve hills, no curves, no surprises. When it was built in 1975, named one of the best roller coasters in America.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Personality Profile:</b></font> Dad in plaid. A throwback but a classic. Dependable, but a little shaky. Borders on the downright corny. He’s still holding onto your training wheels, not quite ready to let you go. Ride backward and it’s dad with a couple of cocktails in him, less predictable and a littly wacky.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>White knuckle test:</b></font> The “Psycho” of roller coasters, not really scary anymore but a must-do just because it’s a classic.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Worth-the-waitness:</b></font> It’s one of the most popular rides in the park, but the line moves quickly. Do it.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Photo:</b></font> They don’t take one on the Rebel Yell. Perhaps the faces don’t register enough emotion.

<p><font size=5 color=#990033><b>Scooby Doo</b></font>
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Description:</b></font> Thrills in bite-sized morsels. A bona fide coaster in miniature with a 35-foot drop and only 1,385 feet of wooden track.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Personality Profile:</b></font> Like Scooby himself — cute, loveable and a littly silly. You’ll come back to him again and again just for the nostalgia. Still, it provides a better-than-expected thrill. A great first coaster to indoctrinate the young, would-be coaster enthusiast.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>White knuckle test:</b></font> Judge by the kids, who still scream as loudly as when the Scooby Doo was built in 1975.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Worth-the-waitness:</b></font> Rabsorutely.
<br><font size=3 color=#ff0066><b>Photo:</b></font> Amused.

<font size=6 color=#669900><b>Early Morning Activity</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>Unknown to thousands of visitors, park employees work to ensure a day of safety and fun.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b><i>by Kathryn Masterson</i></b></font><p>


<p>The park is peaceful.
<p>The sun is shining, the streets are clean, and the only sounds are movie theme music piped through the attractions and the putter of a landscaping cart filled with flowers. It’s 8:30 a.m., and Kings Dominion is quietly preparing for another 20,000 people to walk through the gate.
<p>It’s the middle of the day for Craig Fox. He arrives at 5:30 every morning to walk the wooden roller coasters. Four coasters — six miles of track — must be checked for loose bolts, cracks and other problems that could jeopardize the safety of coaster riders.
<p>This time of the day, Fox is walking the Grizzly. He is wearing a safety harness resembling a tangled web of seat belts that go around his arms and legs. The harness is wrapped around a post and clipped to itself when Fox and the others stop to work on the track. While Fox walks the coaster, two men check the cars for any problems. 
<p>The steel girders glint in the sun, and Fox inspects each one as he ascends and descends the track, which is barely wide enough to stand with both feet together. The woods below are visible through the beams. A great sense of balance and attention to detail are essential for this job. 
<p>Even if Fox and the other crew members don’t find any missing or loose pieces, they will still tighten and make any improvements on the coasters. “Our motto is even if everything is fine, we like to leave things a little better than we found them,” says Fox, who has maintained roller coasters for 10 years. 
<p>In the winter when the park is closed, the coaster walkers will do renovations on the track and cars to make the rides that little bit better. But for now, they are busy ensuring the safety of today’s riders.    
<p>On the other side of the park, Paul Kelly is watching the Outer Limits workers through mirrored sunglasses with alien eyes. He is setting up the souvenir stand. He pulls out the racks of T-shirts, making special note of his favorite. It’s an alien dressed as Elvis that says “He has left the planet.” He dons a Cat in the Hat hat with spaceships and aliens wearing Cat in the Hat hats. “We’re supposed to advertise the products,” Kelly says.
<p>Dressed in navy and khaki military uniforms, the Outer Limits ride operators are a sharp contrast to alien sunglasses and hats. They execute a manager’s orders set up for day’s crowds — 1,800 people are expected to take the 60-second ride every hour. The operators grab yellow poles and chains and hurriedly set up barricades from the ride to the arched entryway to the attraction. It is 10:20, 10 minutes and counting until the gates are opened to the area.
<p>By 10:30 the barriers are set up and the Outer Limits employees are in position. Seconds later, a dozen kids sprint toward the line, yelling and giving each other high fives for being the first in line that day. The trickle of visitors does not seem to warrant the park’s elaborate preparations.
<p>A few seconds later, the deluge hits. Hundreds of people stream toward the attraction, running, pushing and jockeying for a position in the front of the line. After perhaps hours of waiting outside park gates, visitors stampede right past the tamer attractions.  
<p>A game booth worker cries in vain for the first customer of the day.
<p>“Come play my game! Who will be first to win a prize?” No one stops. This herd of park visitors is only interested in being first to climb aboard the park’s newest and most heavily promoted ride. 
<p>Within five minutes, the line stretches past the game and the snack stand. But it’s not moving, and those who stood at the gate and waited till 10:30 have longer to wait. The ride is still undergoing safety checks, and no one knows how much longer it will be until the ride opens.
<p>Tommy Rouse, who has the unfortunate job of standing at the archway directing riders, is bombarded with questions. “When will the ride open?” “How much longer?” “What’s the problem?”
<p>Rouse is used to this job. The day before, the Outer Limits did not open until 12:30. Those in the front of the line waited two hours.
<p>“I should just get a megaphone,” he says, shaking his head as yet another person asks him when the ride will open.
<p>Even without a megaphone, the din of the waiting crowd, added to the barking of the game operators and the screams from the Anaconda, shatters the morning peace. King’s Dominion is open for another day. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<font size=6 color=#660033><b>A Day at “Kids” Dominion</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>The parent’s handy dandy guide for surviving — and enjoying — Kings Dominion</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b><i>by Elizabeth W. Cogar</i></b></font><p>
<p>There are parents who dread taking the kids to Kings Dominion. The lines, the heat, the whining and walking bring out the worst in children, not to mention grown-ups. But there are ways to make the day less of a hassle and more of what it’s cracked up to be: fun.
<p>Call us insane — we took our two children, ages 6 and 7, to Kings Dominion on the Fourth of July. Yes, we joined 25,000 other Americans in the quest for thrills and large stuffed animals. Call us cruel — we’d never taken our children to Kings Dominion during open season (only for media day which doesn’t count because only the new ride of the year is open). Here’s what we learned:
<ul>
<p><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> If there is even the tiniest, most remote chance that you’ll need a stroller, do yourself the biggest favor of the day and get one at the booth near the entrance. A single stroller for the day is $5; a double is $10 and it’s worth every penny. And strollers aren’t just for babies — they’re for older kids and stuff (coats, towels, bags, etc.). Believe me, there is no greater agony than being deep into the park with a child who “can’t” walk. People will stare as you are reduced to threats, bribes, piggyback rides and dragging.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Map out a plan for what you want to do. You could start by going to the top of the Eiffel Tower and scoping out the rides. Having a plan helps eliminate constant backtracking, wandering aimlessly and arguing shamelessly in front of other people.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Get measured up front. There are professional kid-measurers on International Street who determine which rides your children are tall enough to ride according to park safety policy. Colored bracelets are given out and signs at each ride tell you if you’re eligible, eliminating the need to measure as you go. Waiting in a line only to discover your child is too short could be unpleasant.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Embrace the Zen of line waiting. <i>Accept</i> that there are lines everywhere and you will be waiting in them. The key to surviving the wait is going to the park with another adult. That way, one of you waits while the other takes the kids around to do other stuff and checks back in, sort of a divide-and-conquer strategy. The beauty of the lines at Kings Dominion — at least the ones for rides our children wanted to do — is that they do move fairly quickly.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Encourage frequent use of the restrooms which are, fortuitously, located everywhere. Mere feet away from the front of the Scooby Doo coaster line, a child of mine who will remain nameless announced that he had to go <i>badly</i>. I was alone in the line with him (my husband was doing Avalanche duty) and had to forfeit our hard-earned place.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Take a light backpack for plastic bottles of water, sunscreen and souvenirs. Hand-carrying little bags full of sand art, cotton candy and Gak gets old.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Wear a bathing suit and pack dry socks and a towel in your backpack. There’s enough at Kings Dominion that involves getting wet (Nickelodeon’s Splat City, White Water Canyon, Hurricane Reef) to warrant appropriate attire just in case.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Avoid skill games. Teens toting clear plastic bags full of life-size stuffed Tweetys and Sylvesters will entice you to win same for your children who want these items. Put simply, the games (throw a quarter on a plate, ball in a basket, ring around a bottle neck, etc.) are nearly impossible to win, and children do not easily understand this concept. They’ve been to too many church bazaars where everybody wins a prize. 
At $3 a try, these games must be major moneymakers for the park, and I’m figuring that Paramount must have warehouses full of Tweetys that will never be won.
<br><font size=5 color=#ff0066><tt><b>¤</b></tt></font> Leave the park before everyone crumbles from fatigue and sore feet. Based on the old quit-while-you’re-ahead theory, set a time that you will leave and stick to it. We had lots of fun at the ice show, on the flume ride and in the ball room, but you would never have known it if you’d seen the condition we were in when we limped to our car — about an hour too late. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<br clear=left><font size=2>Sculptor Paul DiPasquale with clay fragments from the
<br>childrens’ statues surrounding the Arthur Ashe monument.</font>
<hr size=2 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#996633><b>Paul DiPasquale</b></font>
<br><font size=7><b>UNMASKED</b></font>
<br><font size=5>With Arthur Ashe on Monument Avenue, the artist proves just 
how far he can take his concept of acknowledgment through art.</font>
<h3><i>by John W. Maloney</i></h3><p>


<hr size=1>
The air conditioner in Paul DiPasquale’s Dodge van is vainly muttering something, but the humidity of Richmond controls this vehicle’s climate. The choice is to roll down the windows and shout back and forth in this mobile interview or roll up the windows and take the heat like gentlemen.
<p>In the oft-raging debate over the Arthur Ashe statue, its symbolic location and its critically berated artist, DiPasquale has never lost his cool.
<p>The windows stay up for a while. The subject is public art, through the mind of a very public artist whose work now takes center stage in Richmond.
<p>Ashe was like any project, starting with an inspiration, he says.
<p>“Our responsibility as artists is to investigate an idea. Ninety percent of my investigations are private, but the 10 percent that become public get seen,” he says. DiPasquale’s daughter Kate, 14, probably sensing a well-worn lecture, lies down across a seat and goes to sleep.
<p>What happens after the art is made, he continues, is the very important and often controversial third step that separates him from many other artists: marketing the piece. If he’s willing to take that step, somebody obviously has to buy the art, he says. Arthur Ashe in many ways was the ultimate sales job.
<p>And DiPasquale knows how to sell his art.
<p>“If you’re going to be a professional artist, guess what? You’ve got to sell it. If not, you’re a professional waiter, a professional sheetrock hanger who does art on the side.”
<p>“What people learn in art school is not what it’s about. Selling through galleries, it can be done but it’s never served me, not as a professional,” he says, his investigation into Arthur’s world complete.
<p>Ashe represents a cumulative product of DiPasquale’s varied talents. He says that the closest thing to a beginning in sculpture for him were  life-size figures he formed as a boy in the mud beneath his swingset. With the unveiling of his ultimate enterprise — bronzes of Arthur Ashe and four children reaching toward him — DiPasquale, 45, is now the best-known artist in Richmond, with the world media headed this way.
<p>

<p><font size=6 color=#996633>Investigations of art</font>
<hr size=1>The decision to make a statue of Ashe was DiPasquale’s, and the concept was approved by the subject — Ashe would be depicted his way. Art is a process of transforming things, according to DiPasquale. The Ashe that stands on Monument is very literal, it’s educational message obvious. Ashe approved of the sculpture’s concept — children around a figure who is teaching with books and a tennis racquet. In that approval — in the last stage of his life — Ashe himself was making his final statement, wheteher he knew it or not, to his hometown, which he fled.
<p>Had the critics prevailed with an open statue competition, Richmond — and not Ashe — would have dictated the monument’s message. Would he be the Wimbledon champ or the political activist? Would he be shown in his usual sweat suit or in a business suit?
<p>Which Ashe would it have been?
<p>The question was never asked because DiPasquale beat them to the punch. DiPasquale, in all his entrepreneurial savvy, was there to pull off Ashe’s statement before anybody else ever tried. He wears Ashe’s general approval like body armor on a dangerous street.
<p>Now, in the striking context of Confederates Lee, Jackson, Davis and Maury, stands a new hero — Arthur Ashe in all of his social, racial and intellectual complexity.
<p>Had the artist not come forward with his statue; had certain key citizens like former Gov. L. Douglas Wilder and the cast of Virginia Heroes not endorsed Monument Avenue as its site; and had City Manager Robert Bobb not decided to bring the site east on Monument from the near West End, the artist says “they would have talked about the next monument for 20 years.” 
<p>The loudest critics of the statue as art have been art writers, educators and gallery owners. Their distaste for his monument project, DiPasquale says, is partially rooted in their inability to control it.
<p>Conversely, the critics have lamented DiPasquale’s selfish control of the opportunity to honor Ashe. This one-time opportunity should be a shared responsibility, they say. 
<p>To that charge, he reflects, “I felt that way three years ago and acted on it.”
<p>This week, and in the weeks that follow, the masses, in their cars, their tour buses, on the sidewalks, will be the ultimate jury. He expects he will be exonerated. No critic has seen the piece fully assembled in bronze on the granite base. Those who have evaluated it from photographs have been harsh.
<p>“What hurt initially was that I was believing what they were saying, then I realized people had all kinds of reasons to be critical,” he says. “Sorting it all out wasn’t my job. My job was the art.”
<p>Having his life’s greatest work compared to a man being held up at gunpoint translated in DiPasquale’s mind into “education by criticism.” He found this extremely healthy and made changes to the statue.
<p>DiPasquale moved on, the critics readjusted their sights. 
<p>He was the wrong artist.
<p>It’s the wrong site.
<p>It’s the wrong art.
<p>Too fast, the process was too fast.
<p>Those complaints don’t matter to DiPasquale. 
<p>If they don’t like it now — and there is a sizable “they” here — their opinion will probably change, he says. “People’s response to any art form is one that evolves. My response to my own work changes over time,” he says.
<p>He presents a moving target.
<p>Life’s challenges, he says philosophically, can have three outcomes: “productive,” “maintenance” and “destructive.” Guess how he sees himself, then place the critics in the other two categories.
<p>In 1982, the Smithsonian commissioned him to make a full-scale cow. When he was finished, having worked off a bovine model from Maryland, the Smithsonian flew in a group of Vermont dairymen to judge the sculpture as if it was entered in the state fair. “It went great,” he remembers.
<p>Everything was fine except the hocks, whatever that is — a minor adjustment. It was his toughest critique to date, he says.
<p>

<p><font size=6 color=#996633>Clay, Plaster, Wax, Bronze</font>
<hr size=1>Making all the right moves with the Ashe project, DiPasquale gained the eventual support of the Commission for Architectural Review, the Planning Commission and City Council, with council voting before a packed house and a citywide TV broadcast. A passionate community conversation eclipsed the critical debate about the angle of the racquet head, the position of the children, the broadness of the champion’s shoulders or whatever else people thought was wrong with the statue’s design.
<p>In death, as the statue process moved forward, Arthur Ashe held a commanding presence in his former city whose segregation scarred him in youth when tournament directors denied him a spot on their drawsheets.
<p>The visiting press crammed the aisles of City Council’s chambers in search of that racially explosive scene. What they went home with was the smiling countenance of the artist and the public’s consensus that a statue anywhere in the city would honor the tennis player, but a statue on Monument Avenue would honor the man.
<p>And there it would stand.
<p>Taking his art directly to the people, with the great outdoors as his gallery, DiPasquale knows his communications aren’t all well received, but that’s art’s role, he says.
<p>“The Headman” on Brown’s Island, with its muscled boatman steering his bateau along the river, depicts the contributions of black Richmonders to the commerce of the city. But in its previous-fiberglass incarnation it was stolen by high school kids, only to be recovered in a rock quarry after a tip to police. Like the discarded appliances in the remote place, “The Headman” was full of bullet holes.
<p>“Connecticut,” usually referred to as “the brave” at The Diamond, was initially crafted as a powerful and positive Native American who could seize the public’s attention from a building top. When DiPasquale placed “Connecticut” atop a building in Washington, D.C., vandals shot guns at it, and one person even took the trouble to fire an arrow into the massive red head. A store manager in Cheyenne, Wyo., where the sculpture was considered momentarily, called DiPasquale to say he couldn’t put the Indian on the roof because someone surely would burn the whole place down to destroy it.
<p>“You don’t understand it because you’re not here,” the manager explained before hanging up. Even today at his Boulevard address, “the brave” takes an occasional bullet.
<p>

<p><font size=6 color=#996633>Awaiting freedom</font>
<hr size=1>The top floor of the Waynesboro foundry where the statue came together is so big that a hi-fi system’s music is simply swallowed by the noisy space, lyrics and melodies slurred into atmosphere. Bronze-burnishing tools scream in three workers’ hands, each concentrating on a body part that is meant to last forever. Industrial fans blow the hot air around in microbursts. In this busy corner of the top floor, there is the heat of creation.
<p>DiPasquale’s copy of “Days of Grace,” Ashe’s memoir written while he was dying, rests on a work bench with the early castings for the eyeglasses the statue will wear. Pictures marked with paper slips show snapshots of Ashe’s extraordinary life, from the smiling child in Richmond around 1945, through UCLA in the ’60s, Davis Cup captaining in 1984. There are pictures with John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors, Doug Wilder, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Andrew Young and Nelson Mandela. There is also a hallway shot from New York Hospital, the frail activist in 1993, waiting in his wheelchair with his things in a Woolworth bag between his legs.
<p>From these pictures, DiPasquale gleaned instant references for the hands, the ears and the eyes of his final draft. This Ashe is a composite figure, the lean champion’s muscularity still intact, but the eyes and face come from later years, stopping somewhere between the last heart operation and the man’s ultimate and tragic decline from AIDS.
<p>DiPasquale only met Ashe once and that was at a tennis clinic for children where a group of 50 or so people came out to see the former star. The scene inspired the statue being unveiled this week. To this day, DiPasquale says he is amazed how few people paid attention to Ashe when he came back to Richmond. 
<p>With the strength of several winches and a rolling table, the monument’s arrangement is assembled on the factory floor. It’s not as if DiPasquale, with his 25 years of professional art experience, has many larger-than-life bronze castings in his portfolio. This is his arrival at a new destination, made possible, ironically, by his second chance at “The Headman,” which was reborn in bronze after being recovered from the quarry.
<p>“After ‘The Headman’ I knew I could do this,” he says, referring to the technical aspect of the project. “I knew then that I could do a statue of anybody as a speculative work. I asked myself, ‘Who should I do?’”
<p>Ashe was receptive to his offer, liked the concept but died before he could pose.
<p>“‘I want to be involved with children,’” the artist heard from the subject over the phone. In keeping with that wish, DiPasquale says, “It’s what’s good for Arthur Ashe and it’s good for Richmond,” to have a design he authorized in theory.
<p>

<p><font size=6 color=#996633>A public life</font>
<hr size=1>“We are all artists,” DiPasquale says. “We just give it up and other things take over.” Children investigate their creative urges in amazing ways, he says. Society, for some unexplained reason, weans people away from that urge. In his case, “I never got disinterested in art.”
<p>A 1973 graduate of U.Va., with a 1977 MFA from VCU, DiPasquale was accepted by U.Va. law school but chose to attend the Boston Architectural Center instead.
<p>Kate DiPasquale was 9 months old when her father quit his full-time teaching job at Northern Virginia Community College so he could pursue art as a job. Teaching in Alexandria “was a nirvana job,” with summers off, he says. All he wanted was a year off to make his big Indian.
<p>He spent $10,000 of his own money to create it, requiring two years instead of one and $20,000, not $10,000. To cover the difference in cost, he sold 50 etchings at $200 with the promise that he would refund the buyers’ investment when he eventually sold it.
<p>After a whirlwind tour of Best Products properties, “Connecticut” was temporarily homeless in Richmond when Signet Bank raised $39,000 to place it at The Diamond. The resourceful artist gained a reputation for effective marketing, taking his work wherever it would sell. Some in the art community found this commercialism crass and many oppose the Ashe statue today for that same reason. DiPasquale just rolls with the punches.
<p>He and wife, Kelly, a singer and actor, live with Kate, 14, and Mary, 10, in a 19th-century house on Fulton Hill with a menagerie of dogs, cats and possibly other critters too busy whipping about to be identified. An enormous and pregnant Amazon ballerina, formed from a seamless skin of epoxy, stretches in one room while an equally formidable naked guy bathes in a huge wooden bathtub in the upstairs hallway. These are but a few of the many DiPasquale pieces in his home gallery, which could wreak havoc on somebody walking through for the first time in the dark.
<p>DiPasquale’s grandparents were from Italy, but his father, Attilio, refused to teach him Italian growing up. “My father wanted me, more than anything, to be an American.” His mother, Lois Mayfield of St. Louis, died when he was 13. As a boy he summered in Kentucky. Today, he still counts his mother’s presence as a guardian angel of sorts. His father, who remarried, lives in Florida but recently suffered a stroke and won’t be able to attend the unveiling.
<p>

<p><font size=6 color=#996633>Affordables mixed with monuments</font>
<hr size=1>With Ashe converted to bronze and installed, all that remains of the project in DiPasquale’s barn studio is the plaster shell, and that is destined for a museum soon. A recently completed bust of Mills Godwin acknowledges the powerful legacy of the two-term governor, as well as an obvious ability of the artist to render classical sculpture. But overhead waiting to be sold is a row of porcelain fish that are made to look as thought they are swimming through a wall. A swimming dog, 
made with a similar technique, attaches to the buyer’s ceiling. DiPasquale also markets ducks that do the same thing. These are the commercial novelties by the same artist who just created a $400,000 work for Monument Avenue. They are also ready reminders that this is a professional career in progress — that all of the achievement being celebrated this week isn’t Ashe’s and Richmond’s but the artist’s, too. With the biggest fee of his life, something in the $100,000 range, he can finally install some heat in his studio. More investigations await. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<hr size=1>
<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>1992</b></font>
<br>Richmond artist Paul DiPasquale meets Ashe at a tennis clinic. 
<br>The image of the former champion teaching children is the basic inspiration for the statue. 
<br>Ashe later suggests that books be included somehow in a piece that could stand at a proposed African American sports hall of fame based on his 1988 book about black athletes, “A Hard Road to Glory.”

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>FEB. 6, 1993</b></font>
<br>Ashe dies due to complications from AIDS, which he contracted through a blood transfusion.
 
<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>DECEMBER 1993</b></font>
<br>Virginia Heroes decides to raise money for the statue.

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>DECEMBER 1994</b></font>
<br>L. Douglas Wilder, a friend of Ashe’s and the first elected black governor in the nation, urges Richmond to send “a transcending message” by placing the DiPasquale statue on Monument Avenue.

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>JUNE 1995</b></font>
<br>Richmond’s Planning Commission approves Monument Avenue as the site.
<br>Statue-backers from Virginia Heroes Inc. say that limiting public debate was part of their strategy in expediting the political process of gaining city approval. 
<br>Critics, shocked at the sudden reality of DiPasquale’s initiative, compare the statue to a person being held-up, a cactus, or someone holding a “Will work for food” sign.

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>JULY 1995</b></font>
<br>City Council holds a nationally covered public hearing where Ashe family members argue persuasively to erect DiPasquale’s statue on Monument Avenue. 
<br>The vote is 7-0, with one abstention and one absence. 
<br>Weary from conflict, many say a national embarassment is averted. 
<br>Council also votes to develop an Arthur Ashe park downtown, where the sports hall would be located.

<p>Hours before the hearing, someone city officials decline to identify offers to pay the full price of the monument — $400,000 or more — to place it at Byrd Park overlooking the public tennis courts.

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>AUGUST 1995</b></font>
<br>Ground is broken on Monument Avenue for the statue.

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>DECEMBER 1995</b></font>
<br>Commission for Architectural Review approves the statue, with slight modifications to the arms and the angle of the head. 
<br>Poet Maya Angelou is mentioned as a possible author of an inscription.

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>JANUARY 1996</b></font>
<br>Long silent on the subject, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe writes in the Richmond Times-Dispatch that her late husband authorized a statue for a sports hall of fame, not for Monument Avenue, especially not in a sweatsuit in DiPasquale’s chosen pose. 
<br>She also says she opposes the Monument Avenue site, unlike other Ashe family members.

<p><font size=4 color=#663300><b>MARCH 1996</b></font>
<br>Planning Commission recommends to City Council a proposal by Citizens for Excellence in Public Art to raise $1 million and hold an international statue competition for a permanent Monument Avenue statue to Ashe and other black heroes. 
<br>It also approves DiPasquale’s statue, which would move to the African American sports hall of fame, when constructed.

<p>City Council subsequently derails Citizens for Excellence in Public Art, dismissing it as a nearly all-white group that is non-inclusive to blacks. 
<br>Council also approves a plan to move DiPasquale’s statue to the sports hall, though many, including Doug Wilder, doubt it will ever be built.

<font size=7>The Best of Richmond ’96</font>
<br><font size=6>The people, places and peculiarities you love. </font>

<hr size=1>
There’s nothing about this city you, dear reader, don’t know. Fastest way to get across town? Been there, done that. Best micro-brewed beer? Drank it, thanks. Best place to get a little black dress for a big important cocktail party? Bought it. On sale.
<br>You and hundreds of your fellow readers provide the answers to these and other important aspects of life in Richmond. And when you don’t have the answer, you <i>do</i> have an opinion. Read on.
<p>
<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<hr size=2 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#300090><b>THE BEST OF THE BEST</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>The people and places you picked the most.</b></font>
<p><b>Jim and Bobby Ukrop</b>, perennial favorites in the reader poll, get your votes for Best Civic Leaders, Best Person Who is Not an Elected Official and Should Be and Best Bosses or CEOs. Their beloved chain of grocery stores won Best Inexpensive Lunch and Best Place for Quick Lunch/Dinner.
<p>If you had $150 to blow on dinner, you’d either go to <b>The Frog and The Redneck</b> or to <b>Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse</b>. Both restaurants tied for first in the Best Way to Spend $150 and a night out on the Town category. Ruth’s Chris also has the Best Steak and the Best Waitstaff, you say. Back in the kitchen, the Frog’s Jimmy Sneed gets your vote for Best Chef and the restaurant wins the best high-priced dinner category. The two are also part of a virtual five-way tie for Best Established Restaurant in Richmond.
<p><b>Byrd Park</b> is Richmond’s recreation mecca — it’s the best place to Ride a Bike, Toss a Frisbee and In-line Skate.

<hr size=1 noshade>
<font size=6 color=#300090><b>WHERE WE LIVE & WHAT WE DO</b></font>

<p><font size=4><b>Best thing to happen in Richmond in the past year</b></font>
<br>Hands down and resumes ready, you say Motorola’s announced arrival was the best thing to happen in the metro area since we last asked in July of 1995.  With a promise of up to 6,500 new jobs between the Motorola site in Goochland County and the Siemens-Motorola venture in Henrico County, the city talks about little else. State officials say employees will earn an average annual salary of $35,000 as they churn out millions of semiconductors.  
<p>Some of you think former city council member Chuck Richardson’s arrest and incarceration for heroin distribution did the city a lot of good. Others were glad to see another change in city council membership, specifically Shirley Harvey’s departure. And after a ferocious winter, some were simply grateful for the spring thaw.

<p><font size=4><b>Best thing Gov. Allen has done all year</b></font>
<br>As the Times-Dispatch put it in May, perhaps gushingly, “Republican George Allen just completed the most successful two weeks of his administration.” The time was spent in three Asian countries drumming up  $40 million in economic deals for the state. Coupled with the Motorola-Siemens announcement, the Asian windfall left our governor “flat dog tired” but proud. Angling to be remembered for economic development (in lieu of conquering the Democrats of the General Assembly) Allen dubbed his state “the Silicon Dominion.” 
<p>A close second for this question was “got out of the country,” and the readers probably didn’t mean that in a good way.

<p><font size=4><b>Worst thing Gov. Allen has done all year</b></font>
<br>Virginia is special in so many ways, including its rejection of Goals 2000, which readers found to be the worst thing Allen did over the past year. Taking the federal money for the program would place greater federal control on the Old Dominion’s schools, the states-rights governor explained in rejecting the cash. Critics of that stand likened it to Old South isolationist thinking that closed Virginia schools in decades past.

<p><font size=4><b>Best established neighborhood</b></font>
<br>With its quiet streets angling west from VCU, the Fan District’s true-grit quality is its ace in the hole, making it a place most Richmonders have to try at least once in life. Corner anchors like Fan Market, Buddy’s Place, John and Norman’s, and Soble’s support a residential community of high-ceilinged houses and open-minded urbanites. Their civic association is one to be reckoned with. These are the city people, living reminders of past generations that grew up on Franklin and Grace, Park and Stuart, Hanover and Floyd, while the metro area sprouted up around them. There’s an ecclectic coolness here in these anti-’burbs, mixing students with seniors, busy duplexes that hold their character among beautifully restored “house tour-quality” classics, all in a neighborhood that no urban planner could duplicate today. The only drawback is the tow truck that just dragged your car away because of street cleaning.
<p>A close runner up: Windsor Farms, with all of its established trappings. Third: West of the Boulevard.

<p><font size=4><b>Best neighborhood improvement</b></font>
<br>Church Hill, with its ancient brick houses and even older frame homes, still stands like the last survivor of the Civil War, with more preservation opportunities than any other part of Richmond. Maybe for that reason, the neighborhood is getting better, one renovation at a time. Carytown received some votes, as did Oregon Hill and West Cary Street where the Cary 2000 project continues the replacement of worn-out row houses with respectable townhomes.

<p><font size=4><b>Best new neighborhood</b></font>
<br>Almost 800 homes and counting and just a few minutes away from an interstate and a Wal-Mart. No wonder Wyndham in Richmond’s Far West End is your favorite new neighborhood. Sally Buzzell and her family moved to Wyndham two years ago from Chicago. She likes the fact that there are so many stay-at-home moms in her neighborhood, which is filled with children. “You don’t have to make play dates for your children, (they) just walk down the street. You don’t have to find a babysitter, we just swap. It’s like the ’60s.”
<p>With golf, tennis, swimming and other recreational opportunities for residents to get to know each other, Wyndham has quickly grown into its own community. “It’s really like its own little town. Everybody seems to know everybody,” says resident Julie Stark.

<p><font size=4><b>Best stock brokerage</b></font>
<br>Considering the bull market of the past year, you would have to be one sorry stockbroker not to make money for your clients. But the vote for best brokerage was close, with Wheat First Butcher Singer selling slightly higher at the end of the day than Scott & Stringfellow.
<p>With 110 retail branch offices in 15 states and the District of Columbia, Wheat has 1,000 financial consultants, including 50 in the Riverfront Plaza office. The whole company boasts 525,000 client accounts served by 2,700 employees.

<p><font size=4><b>Best local official who should be sent to Washington/higher office</b></font>
<br>“Wow, I’m thrilled,” says 2nd District Councilman Tim Kaine on his win in this category. He just nosed out Gov. George Allen and finished at least a head in front of Mayor Leonidas B. Young. Kaine says he hopes his philosophy about the job shows through to his constituents. “The biggest problem we have in this country is that people are unattached to civic institutions of voting and public participation [in the process]. ... Local government is the place for people to be reinspired to take democracy seriously. I view it as my mission to be a positive contact with people in government.” Kaine says he has no specific plan for his future in elected office but would like to turn the century mark on City Council. After that he’s still “thinking about ways to stay in this game.” 
<p>Bad news for gubernatorial candidates Jim Gilmore and Don Beyer, who only scraped up one and four votes respectively in this category. Perhaps a quick call to Kaine ... ?

<p><font size=4><b>Best Richmonder to be stranded on Belle Isle with</b></font>
<br>Richmond readers were either too faithful to indulge the fantasy of this question, or they filled out the form together with a significant other because the winner was “spouse.” Not that Belle Isle is particularly romantic, and that foot bridge is right there so it would be hard to be stranded ... A distant second was that mysterious novelista Patricia “Give Blood, I do” Cornwell. Maybe a psycho-killer could be there, too, body parts could be discovered and a gutsy female forensic pathologist could show up to determine who did it. You both fall in love with her, the relationship sours, you hold a gun to the minister’s head ... alas, we digress. Just trying to liven this up.

<p><font size=4><b>Best national product made locally</b></font>
<br>Eskimo Pie beat out cigarettes and condoms to be the best locally-made product. Perhaps all the snow developed a kinship between Richmonders and their Native American friends to the North.

<p><font size=4><b>Best mispronunciation of a Richmond landmark or locale</b></font>
<br>You can tell an out-of-towner as soon as the visitor attempts to tackle Powhite Parkway. Readers note this street is pronounced “Pow-white,” “Pow-hite,” and “Poor-white.” Another favorite is Henrico pronounced “Hen-reeko,” with a Spanish flair. Several clever readers wrote that even Richmonders are guilty of mispronouncing an institution of our own — pronouncing the Richmond Landmark Theater as “Mosque.”

<p><font size=4><b>Best street for hitting consecutive green lights</b></font>
<br>In the eternal search for consecutive green lights, Cary Street places first this year with Main Street running second. Let’s hope these east and west thoroughfares don’t become jammed with drivers looking for a faster way in and out of downtown. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to people watch</b></font>
<br>Next time you spend a Saturday perusing the shops and cafes of Carytown, make sure you look your best. Richmond is watching you. The overwhelming majority of voters chose Carytown as the best place to study mankind, and they all seemed to have their own favorite spot. Preferred vistas ranged from the racks of used records at Plan 9 to the tables among the pillars at Simon’s Cafe.  

<p><font size=4><b>Best reason to keep your Philip Morris stock</b></font>
<br>It’s the money, stupid. Overwhelmingly, readers said the best reason to hold on to Philip Morris stock is to collect on those dividends. PM stock has rallied of late, despite the ever-encroaching specter of anti-smoking advocates and government regulation of tobacco. But would this category be any fun at all if it weren’t for those delicious smart-alecky naysayers among our readers? Our favorite reason to keep Philip Morris stock was “to pay for your funeral.” As one reader put it, “It’s a black lung thing.” Guess we wouldn’t understand.

<p><font size=4><b>Best reason to sell your Philip Morris stock</b></font>
<br>It’s the cancer, stupid. On the flip side, the smart-alecky naysayers win big with the No. 1 reason to drop Philip Morris stock: “They kill people.”

<p><font size=4><b>Best new cool thing</b></font>
<br>His future may be uncertain, but at least for now Howard Stern is the coolest new thing in Richmond. WVGO Station Manager Buck Albritton didn’t sound overjoyed with the news of Stern’s win in this category. “You know it’s not scientific,” he says of the STYLE poll. “No matter what size the sample is, his supporters are very vocal.” 
<p>Since the sale of WVGO to ABS Communications, the owners have been conducting research to determine the fate of the station’s format and the future of Howard Stern in Richmond. So is this good news for you, Mr. Albritton? “Oh yeah, sure,” he says in a phone conversation. “You can’t see me but I’m doing cartwheels in my office.”

<p><font size=4><b>Best old cool thing</b></font>
<br>In a grim way, old doesn’t get any cooler than Hollywood Cemetery, with its twisting roads, shadow-throwing knotty trees, leaning, worn tombstones and battalions of dead Confederates. It remains one of the most peaceful and profound places in Richmond. Just try not to be pensive standing at Jefferson Davis’ grave site overlooking the mighty James. In votes, the James River itself came in just behind Hollywood Cemetery, and Monument Avenue and the Byrd Theater followed, proving that you still love the things that make Richmond, Richmond.

<p><font size=4><b>Best use for the Valentine Riverside site</b></font>
<br>The public has spoken. What they say is, “No more museums.” The winner in this category: shopping and restaurants. Whether Ethyl Corp. will follow that recommendation is still up in the air. A company spokesman says no decision has been made.
<p>Shopping and dining, though, is what’s on tap for the canalfront nearby. A riverside walking path like the one in San Antonio — often cited as a model for the riverfront development project — garnered a few votes, too. The planners presumably don’t want the second-place winner: a new home for the Daily Planet, an advocacy group and shelter for the poor and homeless. 
<p>A handful of never-say-die optimists say the best use for Valentine Riverside would be, well, Valentine Riverside — again. That’s unlikely, says The Valentine’s director, Bill Martin, who took over when the multimillion-dollar museum park nearly bankrupted the parent museum. “It’s an exciting public space,” Martin says of the site that almost killed his museum. “How that’s defined in the next three years will be interesting.” 
<p>One thoughtful — or mercilessly cynical — voter suggests a tourist mecca that oughtta bring ’em in droves: “Murder World, an urban theme park.” 

<p><font size=4><b>Best office building to work in</b></font>
<br>You love the James Center, with its shops and restaurants and its Cary Street access and its adjoining Omni Hotel. With a dominating tally, the James Center affirms many peoples’ belief that the new main street is Cary Street and that attractive plazas bring people together.
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank building has its fans, as do Riverfront Plaza’s twin towers, which still seem a bit aloof over there by themselves. Innsbrook and Old City Hall earned honorable mention, as well.
<p>And only one vote was cast for the State Capitol.

<p><font size=4><b>Best public place to play golf</b></font>
<br>Originally part of the promising Figgie development (seemingly disappearing like a Fig-ment of our imagination), and more recently reborn as Pittston, The Crossings golf course (261-0000) in Henrico County, adjacent to Interstate 95, is the top choice for good pub-links. If you want to take your time, the pro shop recommends a weekday morning round. The cost is $39 with a cart. On weekends, the price is $45. Tee time reservations can be made a week in advance. Several beautiful elevated tees. Driving range, chipping and putting greens.
<p>Honorable mentions: Belmont, which is owned by Henrico County; Glenwood Golf Club and the miniature golf courses and driving range on Patterson Avenue in Goochland. And Mr. Bobb, Bryan Park got two votes.

<p><font size=4><b>Best private place to play golf</b></font>
<br>With an invitation to play at the Country Club of Virginia, you have three choices: The woodsy Westhampton Course in town, with its short, rolling fairways, is what you see from Cary Street Road and the River Road Shopping Center; out River Road off Gaskins Road lies the spacious Tuckahoe Creek course, with its broad greens and omnipresent pond hazards and finally, the club’s championship James River course, recently renovated and the toughest to get on. While the clubhouse screams “Brady Bunch” era architecture, the course is classic golfing, mixing scenic tee shots with harrowingly hilly lies, buttery fairways, only occasional water hazards and lots of sand. If you get a chance to play there, take it.

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to watch a sunset</b></font>
<br>The scenic James River wins out in a big way over every other part of the city to watch a sunset. Other votes were cast for Belle Isle, Church Hill, the roof of City Hall and on TV. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best aerobics class</b></font>
<br>The YMCA’s aerobics classes make the highest impact, say the aerobics afficiandos. The Y offers 300 aerobics classes a week at nine area branches. Spokesperson Lanie Odell says the Y tries to offer something for everyone, including Funk Aerobics, Country Aerobics and Boxercise.
American Family Fitness, the Jewish Community Center, Main Street Nautilus and Richmond Athletic Club are popular as well. An apparently sweat-averse reader says the best aerobics class is one in which “someone else participates.”

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to walk the dog</b></font>
<br>Dogs and their owners prefer the tree-lined streets of Monument Avenue when going out for a walk. The street can provide endless entertainment for dogs — grass in the spring and summer, leaves in the fall, and of course, other dogs. Several readers say the best place to walk the family pooch is “not on their grass.” Wonder if they live on Monument?

<p><font size=4><b>Best local website</b></font>
<br>Clearly, a question whose time has not come. In the handful of answers we received, VCU’s website <a href="http://www.vcu.edu/">(http://www.vcu.edu/)</a> tied with “none.” The University of Richmond’s Window on the Web <a href="http://www.urich.edu/">(http://www.urich.edu/)</a> also is worth a click of the mouse, you say. We were happy to see some of you cast your votes for Style’s very own website at <a href="http://www.infi.net/style">http://www.infi.net/style</a>. (You can link to both university sites from our home page.) Our favorite response: My front porch. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best thing to do with kids on Saturday (besides watch cartoons)</b></font>
<br>They’re neck-and-neck, coming down to the wire. It’s Maymont out front — now it’s the Science Museum of Virginia! And the winner is ... Maymont, by a Bison’s nose! Apparently, the baby ducks edge out the animated dinosaurs in the hearts of Richmond parents. The goofballs weigh in, as always: One voter says the best place for the kiddies is the Old Dominion Club, a private after-hours bar. “Send them out to play in traffic,” suggests another. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to show off the trophy date/spouse</b></font>
<br>Some of you didn’t like this question very much. You thought it was “sexist or just plain disgusting.” You said we were “gross” and “tacky” for the “foul” way we asked the question. We were told to “get a grip.” Too bad — it’s funny. And don’t think it doesn’t happen. People love to show each other off, and apparently there is no better place than The Tobacco Company Restaurant. Owner Jerry Cable is pleased but not surprised. “I appreciate them saying that,” he says, adding, “We go out of our way to make is special for everyone.” Among the “haves” of Richmond it is still the place to be seen — and to show off whichever gorgeous creature happens to be on your arm.

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to propose</b></font>
<br>You like your romance, Richmond. It seems there is no greater place to pop the 
question than in the Ivory-Merchant surroundings of Maymont. The Italian Garden or a 
spot beneath the dramatic waterfall can make young lovers feel they are the only two 
people on earth. Eric and Laura Fox were engaged there in 1994 and married there last year. 
In the dead of winter, on a frosty day just before Christmas of 1994, Eric asked his then-girlfriend 
if she would like to go to Maymont on a Wednesday afternoon. “This is unusual,” she thought. 
He asked her what her favorite spot was, and she took him to the bamboo forest in the Japanese 
Garden where they sat on the side of the hill and he asked the magic question. “He chose it 
because he knew it was my favorite place in Richmond. It is such a gift, such a legacy for 
Richmond.” It was that attention Eric paid to Laura’s most cherished setting that made it special 
for her. That makes us wonder about those of you who chose less obvious places to begin a life-long 
commitment: Richmond International Raceway, Twisters, the backseat of a car and, of course, that 
garden of romance and promise, Hollywood Cemetery. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to take the future in-laws</b></font>
<br>It’s a safe bet — nothing outrageous, quirky, funky to see, hear or be accosted by and nothing bizarre on the menu. And all in the plush surroundings of The Jefferson Hotel. You are sure to impress the future in-laws at brunch or tea or even just with a stroll through the lobby to show them the Scarlett O’Hara staircase. They will undoubtedly conclude you are good enough for their son or daughter. But if you want the potential in-laws to impress you, one reader says to take them to Texas-Wisconsin Border Cafe. That’ll bring out the best — or worst — in them.

<font size=6 color=#300090><b>ENTERTAINMENT & MEDIA</b></font>
<p><font size=4><b>Best party host or hostess</b></font>
<br>You are your own favorite host. So if your life is not a dizzying whirl of dinners, cocktails and pig roasts, you have only yourself to blame. Most voters voted themselves best host or hostess. Fund-raiser extraordinaire Pam Reynolds, who is helping organize one of Richmond’s most elaborate-ever parties, the Fabergé Ball, is another fete favorite. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to wind down after work</b></font>
<br>All right, so some of you have lives and choose to vent your pent-up frustrations after work at places like Friday Cheers, Buddy’s and Innsbrook After Hours. One person out there likes to stare at the river. But the majority of us, apparently, just want to go home. 
<p>But is home really the best place to wind down? We decided to find out. Rick Duncan, a dispatcher for a local trucking company, checked his pulse at around 4:30 p.m. when his self-described mood on the job was “irritated.” He clocked his pulse at a pounding 120. Back home at 7:30 p.m., nestled into his oversized Catnapper brand recliner, remote control in his lap, Duncan’s pulse had dropped to 74, proving once and for all what Style readers already know: There’s no place like home. (This highly scientific experiment is in no way associated with any reputable health care facility or licensed medical professional.)

<p><font size=4><b>Best TV anchor team</b></font>
<br>They’re unstoppable. Continuing their four-year reign atop Style Weekly’s Best of Richmond poll, WWBT-12’s Gene Cox and Sabrina Squire once again trounce the competition, gaining three times as many votes as the rest of their competitors combined. 
<p>How to explain their dominance? Perhaps it’s the pair’s easy familiarity, earned after 14 years together; perhaps it’s their — apparently unforced — friendly banter when they have to fill a few more seconds. 
<p>More likely, it’s the way they counteract each other. Gene and Sabrina, as they are known to all, are cut from different cloths. Gene is intense when he’s serious and goofy when he’s not; Sabrina has a stately dignity and charm that enables her to weather with ease any sort of technical difficulty or sensitive story. 
<p>They seem like real people, not like news-reading androids. The two don’t always agree, as Cox notes in his book, “Peccadilloes and Other Strange Animals,” and that can come across on the air — there are times when Cox starts talking over Squire, who shoots him a ferocious look that shuts him up. 
<p>Nonetheless, this perfectly mismatched duo remains Richmond’s favorite.

<p><font size=4><b>Best weather forecast</b></font>
<br>When it rains, it pours — the voters like what they like. And in weather reporting what they like is Channel 12, which got more votes than all others combined. Far and away the biggest vote-getter is WWBT’s perennial weather king, Jim Duncan; second place goes to Channel 12 in general. Also placing: Tracy Capps and Tal White, both at ... you guessed it, Channel 12. 
<p>“I don’t want to say anything self-serving,” Duncan says modestly. “I feel like I’m just up there being myself and doing the weather.” Maybe that’s what so many like about him. Or it may be that he’s like an old pal: Duncan’s been doing the local forecasts for 15 years. 
<p>The votes for other weather-news outlets are so stingy that it’s best they remain unreported here. Of course, a few wisenheimers voted for things like, “Hot, humid, chance of afternoon thunderstorms,” and “Sunny, high in the 70s.”

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to go (outside Richmond) for a weekend</b></font>
<br>Richmonders apparently don’t hold that unpleasantness of the 1860s against the North. The voters choose that other capital, Washington, D.C., as their favorite weekend-trip site. The regal White House, the informative Smithsonian, the always-fascinating departments of State and Agriculture, the swampy summer heat and the office of George Stephanopolous — need we say more? Following as a distant second: Virginia Beach. One big spender suggested San Francisco. Yeah, right. On whose salary? 

<p><font size=4><b>Best art gallery</b></font>
<br>The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts is your favorite place to see art in Richmond. Two floors of priceless art, a children’s resource area and its own cafe and cappuccino bar make this your favorite gallery-going experience. You also like what you see at Cudahy’s and 1708. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to rent a movie</b></font>
<br>By an absolute landslide readers tout Blockbuster as the movie rental mecca. The average store stocks some 10,000 videos for our rental enjoyment; whenever there’s a blockbuster release on video, Blockbuster puts 40 to 90 copies on their shelves. Aside from selection, Blockbuster’s accessibility is key: They’re open 365 days a year until midnight. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to see a movie</b></font>
<br>Rocking seats, drink holders, video arcades and acres of parking be damned. By a nearly two-to-one margin, readers want to see their movies at the Byrd and only at the Byrd. It’s not hard to figure
<p>— who can resist 99 cent admission, awesome interior decor, the mighty Wurlitzer, cartoons and the cult-status Virginia Litter Control short? Mega-theaters take note: Flick fanatics in this town want retro atmosphere at a fair price.

<p><font size=4><b>Best local band on the verge of Greatness</b></font>
<br>On top of the music heap this year: Fighting Gravity. The group, which will always remain Boy-O-Boy in the hearts of the locals, swamped the voting. Ska music lives, around here at least. Guess it helped that this year Rolling Stone ran an opus in which band members opined on the travails of being in a successful, albeit unsigned, rock ’n’ roll band. In second place: The Dave Matthews Band, stretching the bounds of “local.” Hey, people, they’re from Charlottesville. And stretching the definition of verge of greatness, too. In third place, another genuinely local group — salsa maestros Bio Ritmo. Judging from this year’s first- and third-place winners, we love dancing happily to music imported from downtrodden, underdeveloped countries. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to see a play</b></font>
<br>Richmond is blessed with loads of talented directors, actors and choreographers, and our dinner theaters (including the Barksdale and Swift Creek Mill) are standouts. Our readers like to stay close to the city action, it seems, choosing the big Carpenter Center stage as the big winner. TheatreVirginia won a number of votes, and so did the beautifully renovated (if not so beautifully named) Richmond’s Landmark Theater.

<p><font size=4><b>Best way to spend $15 and an evening out on the town</b></font>
<br>Frankly Scarlett, you’re young and uncompromisingly in love. The octoplex in the suburbs is anything but romantic, and you ain’t got the scratch for two drinks after you get past the ticket window, much less the gas money to get home. In most towns, you’re looking at a video store date, micropop and a six-pack. In Richmond, you’re bound for the The Byrd, with its still-fresh moviefare, palatial interior and the MIGHTY WURLITZER!, which if you haven’t seen it will blow your MTV-fried mind.
<p>Joe’s Inn with its massive spaghetti platters got some votes, as did free  music Friday Cheers and The Diamond, home of the MIGHTY R-BRAVES!

<p><font size=4><b>Best morning drive-time show</b></font>
<br>The oft-criticized shock jock Howard Stern, who’s aired locally on WVGO-FM, wins this category by a furlong, even as WVGO’s new owners mull whether to keep him on the air in Richmond. 
<p>The question the owners want answered, says new station manager Buck Albritton, is, “Can a music format and talk format coexist?” Despite Stern’s apparent ratings success in Richmond, Albritton isn’t ready to commit. “You can’t make a radio station off one daypart,” he says of the drive-time show.
<p>The dare-to-be-dull National Public Radio, which will never be confused with Howard Stern, comes in a distant second. Apparently, we like our radio produced out of town. 
<p>Trailing in third place: Millard the Mallard & Co. on our own homegrown WRVA-AM talk radio. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best example of media hype</b></font>
<br>The Ashe statue controversy had all the ingredients for press, local, national, international: a perpetual font of white vs. black, good art vs. bad art, the widow in New York writing editorials, the local Ashe family, the impenetrable sculptor, Confederate heritage vs. New South pride. Everyone’s opinion counted ... truth was stranger than fiction, providing a media feast at Roseneath and Monument. (Doug Wilder, reporting live on WRVA from the groundbreaking, for example, was weird.)
<p>The trials and tribulations of the Howard Stern invasion, including the Ukrops’ failed intervention, garnered votes for media hype, as did the constant snow coverage by the celebrated TV and radio Snow Teams. (Channel 6 did a live shot from the sidewalk outside of their building, commenting on cars as they motored down Broad Street.) The Golden Years murders rocketed to CBS’ “48 Hours” then seemed to fizzle back down to earth. There was the trial that wasn’t in Gottwald vs. Mercer; Motorola called; and the Bonnie Blue Ball drew Bryant Gumbel’s ire.

<p><font size=4><b>Best bumper sticker</b></font>
<br>“South of the James: By Invitation Only,” in the defiantly cheesy italic white on black was the winner, outscoring other classy communications: “Mean People Suck,” “My Son Is a Saint,” “Save the Males,” “My kid beat up your honor student,” “Rush is Right Fat” and “Gilmore ’97".

<p><font size=4><b>Best Blab TV show</b></font>
<br>There is an intrigue to the Ben Franklin Craft Hour — just as there is to Martha Stewart. Sensible and crafty women who know how to use a glue gun, transform everyday household items into celebrated objets d’art — with the help of the Ben Frankin decorating empire. Hostess Kay Cameron leads this weekly passage into local craftdom on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. Readers also liked The Pet Club, The Wedding Party, and Law Line with Magic Mike.

<p><font size=4><b>Best TV ad for a local product or enterprise</b></font>
<br>Two ads tied for first place — the Joynes & Bieber catchy-tune commercial and Virginia Lottery’s version of the fairy godmother, Lady Luck. Bullets also received several votes. Another vote getter — Channel 12 weatherman Jim Duncan running around with that little dog. Goes to show Virginia has a sense of humor.

<hr size=1>
<font size=6 color=#300090><b>FOOD & DRINK</b></font>
<p><font size=4><b>Best restaurant to open or reopen in the past year</b></font>
<br>Bottega, an upscale Italian bistro on the South Side, has been busy since it opened last October, says General Manager Robert Sawrey. He lists many reasons for the restaurant’s popularity (grilled Portabella mushrooms, 43 bottles of wine priced around $20, the pasta specials and the upbeat atmosphere). You’ll be comfortable in jeans or a suit here, and that’s a big plus too.

<p><font size=4><b>Best established restaurant</b></font>
<br>Only five votes separated the top five vote-getters in this category. Mamma ’Zu and Ruth’s Chris Steak House won the top two places, with The Frog and the Redneck, Millie’s and The Tobacco Company right behind. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best vegetarian fare</b></font>
<br>Grace Place Restaurant takes, by a big margin, the category of best vegetarian fare. The clientele is an eclectic mix of food lovers with only a small minority of devout vegetarians, says Tim Harding of Grace Place. He says more and more people aren’t afraid to have a meal without meat anymore.

<p><font size=4><b>Best coffee house</b></font>
<br>The World Cup is the place to go if your caffeine level is almost down to empty. Cafe Mocha is the most popular drink, but you can sample 25 different varieties of coffee and more than 30 kinds of “specialty” coffees at their Fan, Innsbrook and River Road Shopping Center locations.

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to buy wine</b></font>
<br>J. Emerson Inc. overwhelmed the competition to take honors as the best place to buy wine. It managed to beat out Strawberry Street Vineyards and The
<p>Price Club. 7-Eleven did make a showing (winning three discriminating votes).

<p><font size=4><b>Best pizza</b></font>
<br>Loaded with toppings like artichoke hearts, shrimp, crabmeat, spinach and broccoli that practically hang over the side of the plate, Bottoms Up pizza once again claims the top pizza award. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best bagel</b></font>
<br>Chesapeake Bagel Bakery gets votes for its willingness to bring your bagel right to you. One vote for Ukrop’s was sent along with an apology to the voters’ Jewish parents.

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to eat at 3 a.m.</b></font>
<br>For those homeward bound after a night in the Bottom, downtown’s Third Street Dinner is the place to grab a very early morning meal. It’s the hip spot for folks who like to stay up all night, smoking and talking. On a really busy weekend evening the diner serves between 400 and 500 people. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best bar</b></font>
<br>Beating out tried and true local hangouts, newcomer Havana ’59 has become our readers’ favorite bar. Cigar smoke, hanging laundry lines, Cuban music and memorabilia — Richmond loves it. Buddy’s and Cobblestone are also popular watering holes.

<p><font size=4><b>Best burger</b></font>
<br>Kids and adults seem to love Fuddruckers, which wins the Best Burger in Richmond (yet again). This popular hamburger outfit leaves all other hamburger joints behind in this illustrious category, but Sobles’ one-of-a-kind bacon cheeseburger made a strong showing to win second place.
 
<p><font size=4><b>Best ethnic food</b></font>
<br>Peking restaurant is a taste of the East in the West End — and every other part of town. With six restaurants covering all areas of the metro map, Peking is able to satisfy everyone’s craving for eat-in or take-out Chinese food. Indochine, the French Vietnamese restaurant, came in a close second.

<p><font size=4><b>Best onion rings</b></font>
<br>Richmonders’ favorite onion rings aren’t even rings. The Outback Steakhouse’s  Blooming Onion, the fried onion flower with the spicy sauce in the middle, is the big winner in this category. The Broad Street restaurant serves about one onion for every two tables, says Keeva Pawlick of Outback.  This works out to 900 to 1,000 one-pound onions a week. Yikes!

<p><font size=4><b>Best local micro-brewed beer</b></font>
<br>It’s only been in existence for about two years, but Legend Brewing Company has won over palates in Richmond.
<p>Legend brewmeisters say the most popular choice is the Brown Ale, a blend known for its quality and consistency. Readers also tapped Richbrau and Cobblestone breweries for favorite local brews.

<p><font size=4><b>Best doughnut</b></font>
<br>Krispy Kreme’s hot, fresh, still-sticky glazed doughnuts are the clearly tops in this category. If you take a minute to sit on a stool rather than running out the door with a box of the glazed goodies, you can watch the doughnuts travel through an icing waterfall and up a conveyer belt before they’re packed away. If you’re lucky, your doughnuts will be picked right off the line.

<p><font size=4><b>Best frozen yogurt</b></font>
<br>The two Little Yogurt Shops are the source of Richmond’s favorite frozen yogurt.

<hr size=1>
<font size=6 color=#300090><b>GOODS & SERVICES</b></font>
<p><font size=4><b>Best Bookstore</b></font>
<br>Barnes & Noble is unchallenged in the hearts of our readers. The chain has three stores in Richmond, each with sections for topics such as computers, psychology, children’s books and travel. The wide selection of periodicals and out-of-town newspapers, the comfortable chairs for reading, book-signings and the discounts on best-sellers have helped B&N establish a firm place for itself in the city. At Willow Lawn, it’s a few steps from the shop to Starbucks. On Huguenot, there is a coffee bar inside the store. 
<p>Borders Books & Music, also part of a chain of large stores, was runner-up to Barnes & Noble. It, too, features coffee and is known for events such as lectures by the likes of George Manahan.
<p>An independent store, Carytown Books, came in third. It was until recently known as Biff’s and emphasizes special orders. Readers must need caffeine, for Carytown Books, like its larger cousins, is close to a reliable source of espresso and cappucino: Coffee & Co. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best bookstore for kids</b></font>
<br>By a miniscule margin, Richmond-owned Narnia draws more children’s book buyers than national chain Barnes & Noble. Interesting, isn’t it, that we’re willing to search for a parking place in Carytown and accept a much smaller inventory just to enjoy the personal, knowledgable service at Narnia. Sure, if you want a book and you want it now, you’re thankful for Barnes & Noble’s shelves and shelves of kids’ books and their discounts. Perhaps Narnia earned its winning edge because the staff is qualified to advise and suggest reading that’s just right.

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to buy a gift</b></font>
<br>It seems our gift shopping ways have strayed from the traditional leather desk set to a more modern, sophisticated realm located in Carytown. Lane Sanson barely edged out Mongrel as the surefire place to find the very thing for everyone from brides to brothers. Lane Sanson’s townhouse, packed to the brim with all manner of neat stuff for the home, offers a shopping adventure as you wander from room to room. At Mongrel, the mainstay is a massive array of cards for every imaginable occasion. Plus, there’s a mix of metalwork, frames, funky magnets and other amusing elements. And, what’s really great is that both shops are locally owned.

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to buy a cigar</b></font>
<br>It was a close vote, but when the smoke cleared, Stogies in Innsbrook was the winner. Others like to get their cigars directly from Havana ’59, as in the restaurant in Shockoe Bottom. We’d like to say close but no cigar about the rest, but of course they have plenty of cigars and they received a respectable number of votes: Tobacco House, Tinder Box and Tobacconist of Richmond.

<p><font size=4><b>Best car repair shop</b></font>
<br>Solarium-like Bruce’s Body Shop on West Broad Street gets your vote for the best place to get the car fixed. Grove Avenue Exxon is also a popular place for repairs and maintenance. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to buy a tux/cocktail dress</b></font>
<br>If zee quality shows ... Franco’s should be expecting quite a bit of business as the Faberge ball gets closer. The Richmond clothier is the top choice for an outfit when our readers go out on the town. Freda and Jefferson Clothing also are popular when sequins and cummerbunds are in order. 

<p><font size=4><b>Best place to buy office attire</b></font>
<br>The elegant and upscale Franco’s has dressed generations of Richmond’s business elite and is your top choice for smart clothes for the office. You also turn to Hecht’s and Freda when you’re dressing for success. 

<p><font size=6><b>And ... </b></font>
<p><font size=4><b>Best thing we should have asked</b></font>
<br>Next year, you’d most like to find out where to meet the opposite sex, where to have sex, with whom to have sex, etc. You’re also interested in politics and haircuts. Stay tuned. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<br clear=left><font size=2>DR. BILL REGELSON</font>
<hr size=1><h1>The Miracle Doctor</h1><p>

<h3>Is the hormone DHEA an aging antidote or hormone-replacement hype?
<br> The loudest voices on both sides of the debate workwithin a block of each other.</h3><p>
<h3><i>by Greg Weatherford</i></h3><p>

<hr size=1>
<p>Bill Regelson speaks in circles. His conversation makes long, looping circuits around his subjects, dropping the names of senators, colleagues and chemicals, telling war stories of a life in academia, making brief stops to ponder literature and the virtues of quackery. 
<p>It’s the kind of speech granted the old, the famous and the eccentric, and Regelson is all of these things, to varying degrees. 
<p>Dr. William Regelson, a medical oncologist, operates out of a small office at the Medical College of Virginia that’s an explosion of books and papers. They spill out of bookcases, cover his desk, pile in drifts on the floor. 
<p>His phone rings continually. He answers it in his gravelly baritone: “Bill Regelson,” then leans back in his chair and puts his feet on the desk. These days, the person calling is as likely to be a reporter or editor as a scientific colleague. 
<p>Since his first book written for the public, “The Melatonin Miracle,” became a best seller and the flash point of academic controversy, Regelson has luxuriated in the public spotlight while suffering lacerating attacks in scientific journals. 
<p>“We wrote the last book really because we were mad, we were angry,” he says. “We’re still very frustrated about melatonin because of the way it’s been treated.” 
<p>Now Regelson is making another end run around the medical establishment, in a book about hormone-replacement therapy to be published, like his first, by Simon & Schuster. “When this book comes out,” he promises, “I’m going to become a guru in this [field].” 
<p>Regelson’s self-appointed mission is to push medical science, kicking and screaming, out of its caution and into the areas he finds interesting. 
<p>“It takes a hell of a long time for something to enter the mainstream of American medicine,” Regelson says, “because of the conservatism of most physicians. On one level it’s good. On another level it’s bad.” 
<p>The new book — Regelson won’t reveal its title because he fears others will steal it (“It’s a great title,” he says)  — will focus on a hormone with a mouthful of a name: dehydroepiandrosterone. 
<p>Fortunately for publicists, it’s better known as DHEA. This hormone, once a chemical byproduct thrown away by the vatful, is poised to become a public obsession that makes the furor over melatonin pale into insignificance. 
<p>Its supporters say that a wealth of studies show that the DHEA hormone helps to fight diseases, reverses depression, adds muscle strength and a sense of energy. 
<p>Its detractors say: We don’t know enough yet. Very few studies have been done on the hormone’s effect on humans, and those are inconclusive. Let’s study it some more. 
<p>Each side claims the moral high ground, claims to be protecting life. This battle, once relegated to scientific journals, now has shifted into the arena of public relations. 
<p>In May, the Federal Drug Administration allowed DHEA, a hormone naturally abundant in young humans, to be sold in drugstores and health-food stores. It’s classified as a food additive — like a vitamin. 
<p>But many scientists are aghast at this development. Even Regelson, the hormone’s loudest defender, decries the prospect of free public access to DHEA because of its potential for harm, should it be used in large doses. Because the human body changes DHEA into both female and male hormones — sometimes unpredict-ably — DHEA may cause some women to develop facial hair or other male characteristics, or increase the chances of developing some forms of cancer. 
<p>Some of the same scientists, however, say the hormone holds the potential for much good. 
<p>A debate has sprung up in the scientific world over DHEA that tests the tensions in medicine between caution and caring. How quickly should science accept unusual treatments that may save lives? One side holds that aging is a disease, and like any other disease, aging should receive quick treatment that may slow or stop it. The other side contends that any treatment should receive close scrutiny — and, should it prove harmful to people, be banned.
<p>To understand the emotional charge imbedded in this discussion, consider thalidomide, a drug commonly given to pregnant women in Europe during the early ’60s. Because doctors prescribed the drug to women before its effects on fetuses were completely understood, “thalidomide babies” developed flipperlike, stunted limbs. 
<p>On the other hand, consider the political fury that spurred the FDA’s decision to push experimental AIDS-fighting drugs quickly through its usually laborious testing process — a widely praised exception to the medical establishment’s traditional caution. 
<p>The dispute over DHEA and other anti-aging hormones — such as melatonin — strikes aging baby boomers directly between the eyes. As the population ages, the prospect of a longer, more vital life grabs the debate from the realm of scientific journals and shoves it into the popular press. 
<p>Although DHEA, as a naturally occurring hormone, can’t be patented, drug companies now plan synthetic versions that they can control. And the prospect of a hot story with a big audience has the media salivating. 
<p>The two spokesmen for this dispute have offices within blocks of each other on MCV’s downtown campus. Both men have studied DHEA closely for years. 
<p>On one side is MCV’s iconoclastic Regelson, who fulminates about the aching slowness of medical research and says he models himself after Old Testament prophets who foretold the future and led their people to promised lands. Everyone in their 40s and 50s should take DHEA, he says, though he acknowledges that the hormone’s levels should be carefully controlled. He takes DHEA himself, as does his wife. 
<p>“I’m going to be 71 on July 12,” Regelson says. “It’s like someone has a contract out to kill me! I can’t wait around for the National Institutes of Health to save me.” 
<p>On the other side is Dr. John Nestler, a researcher and endocrinologist also at MCV. The two say they are friends, though each also says the other drives them crazy.
<p>Regelson on Nestler: “I respect John a lot, but he’s an idiot.” He adds, “He’s doing very good work, elegant work. He’s very careful. That’s what he has to do to make his reputation. I don’t feel that necessity to be very cautious about what I say.
<p>“I’ve always felt that if I got into an area and studied it I could equal anybody, and people don’t like that, of course,” Regelson continues. “You’ve got to stay within the bounds of your area, and I’ve never been able to do that. So I’ve had problems with certain people. But at the same time, I don’t care anymore.”
<p>Nestler on Regelson: “He’s an eccentric personality who at times has inspirations of genius. We need people like that who see these connections. ... On the downside, physicians and doctors have to be cautious by nature. He isn’t.”
<p>Nestler’s in his own office, which is as obsessively tidy as Regelson’s is chaotic. A Hungarian tapestry hangs on the wall, celebrating Nestler’s heritage — though born and raised in the United States, he pronounces his G’s as K’s, Zsa Zsa Gabor-like: he pronounces “aging” as “agink.” 
<p>“[Regelson] looks at the animal studies and just assumes that they’re going to be applicable to human beings,” he says. “I am much more cautious.” 
<p>Although Nestler recently tested his own DHEA levels and found them unusually low, he doesn’t take any. 

<p><hr size=1 width=50%>
<p>DHEA is often called a “master hormone” because the human body transforms it into both male and female hormones — testosterone and estrogen. From youth through early adulthood, the adrenal glands produce gradually increasing amounts of DHEA. But when people get to their late 40s, the amount of DHEA drops off. By age 80, people have 80 percent to 90 percent less DHEA than they did as early adults. 
<p>That leads some scientists, such as Regelson, to posit that increasing DHEA levels in older people could reduce or even reverse the effects of aging: arthritis, cancer, hardening of the arteries, the decrease in libido and loss of energy. By increasing DHEA, they theorize, the body can be fooled into living as many as 30 years longer — and those years will be better.
<p>But other scientists, such as Nestler, have tried to put a damper on such speculation. Nestler points out that there have been only five studies of DHEA in humans, and most of those are inconclusive. 
<p>Recently, this debate spilled into the media. Gail Sheehy, who wrote the bible on mid-life crises, “Passages,” wrote about DHEA for Vanity Fair. National television shows such as NBC’s “Nightline,” “CBS This Morning” and “Hard Copy” have examined this once-humble hormone. Inevitably, the question asked: Is this the fountain of youth? 
<p>All this is familiar ground to Regelson. After all, he’s the beneficiary — and partly the cause — of the earlier frenzy over melatonin. “The Melatonin Miracle,” along with several other books on the subject, promised a better, longer life. Regelson’s book touted melatonin, which is secreted by the pineal gland, as a key to reversing the body’s clock that governs aging. By taking small doses of the hormone, the advocates claim, people can feel and look younger.
<p>“The Melatonin Miracle” sold more than 235,000 copies in hardcover. With some relish, Regelson tells the tale of how he sparked a national obsession. Last year, a science editor from Newsweek called him to ask about DHEA, which had received some publicity in the wake of an article in The Sciences, a publication of the New York Academy of Sciences. 
<p>“She said, ‘Tell me about DHEA,’” Regelson recalls. “I said, ‘There’s a lot about DHEA. Why don’t you do a thing on melatonin because our book’s just come out.’ She said, ‘Oh really?’ So Simon & Schuster sent her the book, and the next thing I know, there’s a four-page spread on melatonin.” 
<p>Regelson’s media savvy paid off: That article prompted a craze that at one point saw the huge health-product company GNC selling more than 4,000 bottles of melatonin a day. 
<p>“That was tremendous,” Laurie Bernstein, Regelson’s editor at Simon & Schuster, says of the Newsweek article. “Before that, we had what we referred to as the ‘mela-what?’ problem.” Though she says she expected the melatonin book to sell well anyway, the article “was certainly helpful.” 
<p>But becoming a media guru didn’t happen immediately. Regelson had to learn to love being a populist. He called the first draft of his book on melatonin “The Discovery of the Aging Clock.” That changed to the more visceral “Melatonin Miracle” at the behest of Bernstein.
<p>Other changes to the book were required as well. “I wanted the book to be full of ‘maybes’ and ‘might haves’ and that kind of thing,” Regelson says. “I was used to writing for scientific journals, and I was very cautious.” 
<p>When the ghost writer’s drafts came back, they made stronger statements about the values of melatonin. “I kept reading his copy,” Regelson says, “and I’d say, ‘I’m a scientist, I can’t say that.’”
<p>That writer quit the project, and Regelson began working with another. In the meantime, he says of his earlier scientific caution, “I got over it.” Essentially, he decided that if he was going to tell the tale of melatonin, he should really tell it. 
<p>“I guess I owe [“The Melatonin Miracle’s” success] to the new science writer... and also to my editor, Laurie Bernstein,” he says. “It boiled down to her saying to me, ‘Look ... who are you writing this for? Your colleagues who are competitive with you? They’re going to hate you anyway.’ ... That’s true. They hate my guts.” 
<p>There are two ways to interpret that story. 
<p>Nestler offers one take on Regelson’s popularization of medical issues, and on the enthusiasm embodied in “The Melatonin Miracle.” 
<p>“I said, ‘Bill, why did you write your book without [using words of caution]?’” Nestler recalls. “He said, ‘My publisher told me to take all of them out.’” Nestler throws his hands up, exasperated. “That’s sensationalism! 
<p>“His attitude is, ‘If I exaggerate the truth, so what? This is a good thing,’” Nestler says. “Another way of exaggerating,” he adds pointedly, “is to not tell the truth.”
<p>Bernstein, interviewed on the telephone from her New York office at Simon & Schuster, offers another. “In no way did we, or do we ever, push anyone to puff up anything or make any claims that aren’t scientifically founded,” she says angrily. “That is categorically untrue. ... We are not in the business of making the loudest or the most dramatic claims, and if you say we did that I will be writing a letter of complaint.”
<p>A few minutes later, she concedes that she did tell Regelson and his partner, Italian researcher Walter Pierpaoli, that “they needed help in understanding what the lay person needed to understand [melatonin]. As an editor, I was saying you need to know who you’re writing for.” 
<p>Bernstein explains that she told Regelson and Pierpaoli that rather than writing for technical journals, the pair was writing for the general public, and the language had to be understood by all. 
<p>However it happened, Regelson found himself with a gold mine. His book written with Pierpaoli and the ghost writer became so successful it dazzled even him. 
<p>“I had no idea,” he says. “When they offered us the initial ... $150,000 in advance royalties, split three ways, I was overwhelmed. It was just incredible.”  
<p>Other books he’d edited — scientific monographs, mostly — netted him at most $2,000, he says. Suddenly, Regelson says, he realized the cash possibilities of becoming a popularizer.
<p>“This new book will be even better,” he notes cheerfully, “because we’re just splitting it two ways. I’ve just got myself and my science writer.” 

<p><hr size=1 width=50%>
<p>Frank Bellino, who heads the National Institute on Aging’s endocrinology program, says popularizers such as Regelson may be damaging the public’s health by raising hopes that won’t be realized.
<p>“The melatonin book was roundly criticized in the scientific literature,” he says, “though not in the lay media, who were extremely positive. It was a very incomplete story. ... [Regelson] is taking the opinion that because he’s getting old, he doesn’t feel he has the time to do these studies. To me it’s kind of self-serving. He’s looking out for himself.” 
<p>As for those who publish such popular books hyping unproven scientific claims, Bellino adds, “They’re money-grubbing vultures. ... Sure, they seem to sell well. They hit a chord.” 
<p>Does Bellino despair of outshouting book publishers’ public-relations departments and the attending media hype? 
<p>“I don’t know,” he answers wearily. “People listen to who they want to listen to. If someone says, ‘Take it easy, we don’t know what this does,’ it doesn’t do much. People will take Regelson’s position. He’s a doctor, a scientist, and people look to us for answers. [People] tend to listen to him more than to just some lay person writing a book. ... You can say anything you want in the press.” 
<p>Counters Regelson’s editor, Bernstein: “It was very important to me that Walter [Pierpaoli] and Bill [Regelson] were involved very early on in the research on melatonin. They were really hands-on and not trying to cash in on whatever was the latest fad.”
<p>The fad cycle seems ready to begin again. “With Regelson writing a book,” Bellino says, “it’s going to go sky-high again.”
<p>Not everyone is following Regelson’s lead, however. One of the country’s largest makers of health-food supplements, Twin Labs, isn’t selling DHEA and has no intention to do so. “It’s just not proven yet,” says a spokeswoman. 
<p>Regelson responds to such skepticism by pointing out that most researchers are in their 40s — Nestler, for example, is 43 (Bellino, however, is 57). 
<p>And he says that the hidebound conventions of medical science push out people who think differently or who try to reach out to the general public. 
<p>(Bellino, of the aging institute, acknowledges Regelson’s point by saying that the low number of human studies on DHEA is the result of scientists’ bias against the hormone’s snake-oil reputation. “It’s the media hype that turns some people off,” Bellino says. “[Scientists] say, ‘Look, Regelson’s publishing in The New York Times or The Washington Post rather than in the scientific literature.’”)
<p>But Regelson seems gloomily accepting of his position as an outsider.
<p>“If you’re an innovator and a popularizer, you’re dead,” Regelson says. “It’s enough being an innovator, but if you’re going to go [to] the public and come out with a pizzazzy thing and appear on television, they don’t like it.” <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top>

<hr size=1><h1>Race, Religion & Reconciliation</h1><p>

<h3>Almost 40 years after Virginia ended its direct segregationist policies, Richmond’s Christian leaders try to reconcile the often painful history of race and religion in our community.</h3><p>
<h3><i>by Carolyn McCulley</i></h3><p>

<hr size=1><p>On a rainy Memorial Day weekend in Richmond, about 1,200 Christians gathered at Chimborazo Park on Church Hill to participate in the 1996 March for Jesus. This was one of a global series of marches held on the same day to promote unity within many denominational and culturally different churches. As the multihued participants made their way to the Capitol on that damp Saturday morning, a Korean youth pastor, a Native American pastor’s wife, a white Presbyterian minister, a messianic Jewish rabbi, an African-American evangelism director and an African-American Baptist ministerial leader led the crowd to pray for reconciliation in Richmond.<p>

The event’s unity theme, participants say, stems from a concept not always present in Christianity’s history: racial reconciliation. As black churches throughout the South erupt in flames, the issue now tops the agenda of nation’s political and religious leadership.<p>
As in most American cities, Sunday morning is traditionally the most segregated time in Richmond, a legacy rooted in the city’s history of slavery, segregation and Protestant evangelization.  <p>
But even as dialogue between the races is regularly trumped by the race card, some say the foundation for real and lasting change may be coming from one of the very institutions that laid the foundation for race relations today: Christian churches.  <p>
In fact, Richmond is attracting a small but steady stream of national and international interest in its budding racial reconciliation efforts. <p>
“Most Richmonders probably don’t realize this, but we’ve got cities all around the nation looking to us to see how this will work,” says Rob Corcoran, national coordinator for Hope in the Cities, an interracial, multifaith reconciliation coalition based in Richmond. “We’re at the point where a lot of people are actually engaging in real conversations on a personal level for the first time.”<p>
Hope in the Cities is leading a national effort to encourage communities to openly discuss and solve racial problems. According to dozens of church leaders throughout Richmond, Hope in the Cities is one of the many efforts here promoting reconciliation among Christians of many cultures.<p>
“My impression of Richmond is that it has been steeped in a religious tradition that has had very little impact on the way people live or their effect on society,” says the Rev. Douglas McMurray, a white pastor at Christ Presbyterian Church in the West End. He organizes Richmond’s Concerts of Prayer — monthly citywide prayer meetings. “What I see now is people coming out of their religion ghettos. ... We’re not preoccupied with ourselves, our religious traditions, our little religious kingdoms.” <p>
Most Richmond-area pastors and ministry leaders say the local unity trend parallels significant changes that began about three years ago at the national level among denominational groups traditionally divided by race. <p>
At the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) meeting in Atlanta last June, the SBC chose its 150th anniversary to apologize for its history of condoning racism. (The SBC was formed in 1845 after a split in Baptist ranks over whether Southern slaveholders could be missionaries. It now represents more than 15 million members and 39,900 congregations.)  <p>
In January 1995, the leader of the white National Association of Evangelicals publicly apologized to the leaders of the National Black Evangelical Association for racism within evangelical ranks. The evangelicals’ meeting followed on the heels of the December 1994, decision by the nation’s leading black and white Pentecostal groups to merge their organizations, which would close a historic racial rift in the Pentecostal denominational movement. <p>
These reconciliations had begun before today’s particularly tenuous time in U.S. race relations. The trial and not-guilty verdict in the Nicole Brown Simpson-Ronald Goldman murder trial left the nation polarized. O.J. Simpson was either a predator who eluded punishment or the rightful recipient of hard-fought justice, depending on your point of view and often, your color. <p>
And as every week seemingly brings a fresh report of an arson investigation at another black church, state and federal investigators say many of the rash of church fires throughout the South may be racially motivated. The Glorious Church of God and Christ in Richmond’s Randolph neighborhood, destroyed by a February fire, is one of at least 34 black Southern churches torched in the last two years. <p>
“The greatest problem racial reconciliation faces is the implementation of it at this stage of history,” says James Bell, a black pastor at the primarily white Rapture Time Assembly of God.<p>
Others say the challenge is a personal one. <p>
Harold Wilson, an African-American pastor of Victory Life Fellowship in North Side’s Gilpin Court, says successful implementation is not in programs initiated from the top down in religious organizations, but in personal relationships built across cultural differences. To that end, his church has partnered with Third Presbyterian Church in the West End to promote interracial friendships. <p>
Several churches are following this trend. They include North Side’s nondenomina-tional Faith Life Tabernacle and South Side’s Swift Creek Baptist churches, St. Paul’s Episcopal downtown and St. Peter’s Episcopal on Church Hill, St. James’s Episcopal downtown and Fourth Baptist church — pastored by Richmond Mayor Leonidas Young — on Church Hill, and a team of black and white churches that are part of the STEP outreach program to families in Gilpin Court.<p>
“I’ve been working in Gilpin Court for over 10 years, and we’ve had many different people from my groups and churches come and say, ‘I want to help.’ And what’s often happened is that they came with a program in mind. When we showed them that the ultimate program was building relationships and earning trust and opening hearts, they often felt that they weren’t ‘doing’ something. But if the relationships aren’t there, then there’s nothing to last when the programs discontinue or the funding ultimately dries up,” Wilson says. “When Jesus came as a human being, he didn’t send a program.”<p>
<p>
<hr size=1>
<p>
The Gospels, the four books of the Bible that record the teaching and work of Jesus Christ, are filled with the acts of a man who defied social and religious traditions to teach and heal the despised ethnic or social groups of his time, usually one person at a time. In fact, the Greek word for “gentile” (the word the Bible uses for non-Jews) means “the nations” and is the root of our word, ethnic.<p>
“This is fundamental in the Scriptures: that God appears to people different from me, and that communicating with other peoples is what will reveal God in fuller measure to me. If I isolate myself from persons of different cultures or despised person of other cultures, I isolate myself from my God,” says Ben Campbell, pastor and rector of Richmond Hill, who is white.<p>
Campbell says he used to think racial integration on Sunday mornings was the most important thing to do, but now he’s not convinced.  “When you have racial integration in this society, it usually happens with the persons of other cultures and races adopting the culture of their white counterparts. It may be a color mix, but it is not a culture mix.”<p>
Victor Torres, pastor of New Life Outreach International on the South Side, testifies to the challenges of building up a multicultural congregation in Richmond. New Life, he says, is currently about one-third black, one-third Hispanic, and one-third other races. But when Torres, a first-generation Puerto Rican, came to Richmond to start this church 25 years ago, the congregation was 75 percent white. He says his message has not changed during this time, but he has learned to be aware of practical cultural issues involving foods, worship styles, ways of relating, and more.<p>
“My wife and I have literally seen the face of Richmond change in the 25 years we’ve been here. In the last six years and especially the last three years, we have really seen a breakthrough in fellowship among pastors of different races and colors,” Torres says. <p>
Like Torres, Randy Gilbert, pastor of Faith Landmarks Ministries, an integrated church of about 2,000 members at Parham and Chamberlayne roads, says relating to people of different cultural backgrounds requires flexibility.  <p>
“I had to realize that I was not the only person on this planet and that another person’s perspective from out of their culture is just as valid as mine. You have to yield your personal views on things non-essential and preserve your doctrinal views on things that are essential,” says Gilbert, who is white.  <p>
While local ministers point to programs, better communication and integrated churches, those who bring a more global perspective see that much remains to be done. <p>
“We don’t see much racial reconciliation at all,” says Tony Fitzgerald, a white Australian pastor who moved here three years ago to start Harvest Church in Richmond’s West End. He heads an international ministry with a significant number of churches in South Africa.<p>
“There are more integrated churches in South Africa than there are in Richmond,” says Gerrit Wolfaardt, a white Afrikaaner minister who lives in Fulton Hill in Richmond’s East End. “In many unchurched people’s minds, the church is irrelevant in this issue because what they see in the church is not how they’d expect to see the love of God portrayed,” he says. <p>
So can all the prayers, meetings and new relationships make Richmond a better, more harmonious place to live?<p>
Civic leader Alicia Rasin, an African-American woman who is Mayor Young’s volunteer administrative assistant and a member of his church, is patiently optimistic. “I can see where it’s happening, but we need more of the cultures coming together and worshipping together. People who don’t attend churches don’t see it yet, but it’s happening and it’s going to take time.”<p>
The Rev. Robert Hetherington, who is white and is the rector of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church downtown, agrees that racial reconciliation within the Christian community — which is one of his church’s current seven major initiatives —  won’t immediately affect Richmond in general.<p>
“Racial division is a community-wide problem. To bring that deep a healing, it won’t come overnight.” he says. “But there is reason to be optimistic. There are so many initiatives out there — there’s really a lot going on. And I celebrate the diversity of efforts. There’s no program that’s going to do it, however. It’s got to be the power of God.”<img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" align=top><p>

<hr size=2>

<h2>A March Through History</h2>
<h3><i>From the beginning, race and religion<br> 
have been central to Richmond’s history.</i></h3> 
In 1607, Christopher Newport sailed up the James River to the falls, held a prayer meeting and erected a cross at Gamble’s Hill. Twelve years later, the first group of slaves arrived; Chimborazo Park, where the March for Jesus and other unity marches have started, overlooks Manchester Docks, where slaves were traditionally unloaded to be sold.  <p>
This year’s March for Jesus passed by the original sites for the First Baptist Church and the First African Baptist Church, which started near the current Medical College of Virginia campus. Originally, black and white Baptists worshipped together as a congregation until 1841, when the white members moved west along Broad Street to a new building and “sold” the old building to the black congregation. Because the black congregation couldn’t legally own property at the time, the white congregation retained the property in trust. More than 30 years later, an 1874 Harper’s Weekly article called the First African Baptist Church “the oldest colored church in America, if not in the world,” and marveled at its then-congregation of 4,000 members and the oratory skills of the pastor at the time, the Rev. James Holmes.  <p>
With emancipation, blacks generally created their own churches or assumed full leadership of black congregations that prior to the Civil War were required by law to have a white minister. These churches provided a place for the social, educational and political activities of the newly freed black communities and nurtured many influential black leaders.<p>
Robert Alley, who teaches the history of religion in America at the University of Richmond, sums up Virginia’s history with race and religion this way:<p>
“White Christian churches in colonial Virginia endorsed slavery.  They created a two-tiered faith: one for blacks, one for whites. The scheme claimed that slavery was God’s will. Slaves who became Christians denied that premise, infused the new faith with their own cultural heritage and, with rare exceptions, provided the sole repository for authentic free Christianity in the South. White churches provided bogus, Biblical endorsements for slavery, and after the Civil War, created a diabolical theory of segregation. After 1954, segregationist Virginia politicians, abetted by a majority of white Christian churches, defied the law and sought to destroy public education. This record suggests that when reconciliation between the races is discussed, it must originate with black churches, the guardians of the freedom of the believer.”<p>

<h2>Building Bridges</h2>
A few years ago, Annie Junios was homeless. But now the 25-year-old African-American mother of three has received her GED certificate, is pursuing a career as a pharmacy technician, and is a new member of Fifth Street Baptist Church. <p>
She attributes her brighter future in part to the relationships she’s built with three couples who are active in Gilpin Court’s multichurch STEP program. The three white couples share social, holiday and family events with Annie’s family.  <p>
“They were very open right from the beginning. There was no walking on eggshells. It wasn’t about being from different races or me living in a high-crime area. Even though those are real issues, this relationship is more than I could have imagined. I’ve learned there’s more to life besides Gilpin Court,” Annie says. “These days people are just sticking to themselves and it takes the church to bring them together.” <p>
STEP stands for Strategies To Elevate People. It is a non-profit group to bring black and white churches together to address the relational and economic problems of the inner-city. <p>
“We believe that the problems in the inner-city are never going to be solved until people are personally involved, which is what the family share teams do,” says Linda Tracey, STEP executive director. <p>
STEP is just one of several church-based programs aimed at building personal relationships between people of different races and cultures:  <p>
The <b>Richmond Men of Vision</b> is the local Promise Keepers organization. While the national organization has its share of critics for its stand on men’s roles as family leaders, officials say racial reconciliation tops the group’s agenda. Through Promise Keepers, men meet across denominational and racial lines to form friendships.  <p>
Local pastors and church leaders also are involved in interdenominational, inter-racial efforts like the monthly <b>Concerts of Prayer</b> and last year’s <b>Reconciliation Encounter</b>, which brought together approximately 200 leaders to discuss how to dismantle racism in Richmond.  <p>
This encounter gave birth to the <b>Richmond-area Christian Reconciliation Coalition</b> (RCRC), which informs area churches and the community at large about events, programs and services aimed at reconciliation.  <p>

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>
</head>
<h2><center>November 19, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>The Sun Shines</h2></center>
<h4><center>Cafe du Soleil has begun serving dinner, adding yet another step to the Carytown
dinner shuffle.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>Cafe du Soleil still shows its boutique origins. Where many restaurants have a bar, this little
Carytown eatery has shelves to browse -- fancy foodstuffs, soaps, candles and other diversions.
The cafe/boutique has been serving lunch and catering for several months now and has, more
recently, begun serving dinner.
<p>This long, narrow space, typical of many retrofitted restaurants in the city, is cleverly
manipulated. Faux finishes in warm colors and "trompe d'oeil" landscapes, combined with good
lighting and airy garden furniture, add illusions of a sunny terrace in a place where the sun
always shines. The kitchen at the rear, semiexposed but not intrusive, adds to the casual
atmosphere.
<p>The dinner menu is ambitious for a cafe -- more than a dozen main dishes and a couple of
daily specials. A dozen appetizers and salads add up to a lot of choices. The sunny
Mediterranean seems to be the primary inspiration, but several American beef and potato dishes
offer traditional alternatives.
<p>After studying the menu and making our selections, we chose a wine from the modest wine
list. I was interested in the lack of usual wine protocol (which, admittedly, seems a bit
pretentious for a $14 merlot) -- the bottle was brought to the table already opened, poured into
green fluted parfait glasses without presentation of a cork or the usual tasting, and without
comment. And we made none. After all, it was cheap red wine. But fluted glasses don't optimize
the taste of red wine, nor does green glass add to the appeal. We hope this is merely innocence
and not an attempt to be iconoclastic. The rituals of wine opening and drinking, including the
traditional glasses, are done for a reason -- to encourage and enhance the enjoyment of wine.  
<p>Either of the two appetizers we sampled could have easily served two or more. Tuscan
bruschetta -- toasted baguette slices rubbed with garlic and olive oil -- is accompanied, by a
fragrant pile of tomatoes, basil, black olives, and feta cheese -- a real teaser for the appetite. A
daily special of crab and cheese quesadillas was an equally generous serving and quite good,
though an imaginative salsa could have added additional spark. Other starter choices ($4-$6)
mostly take their inspiration from the Mediterranean, though a tropical chicken satay adds a nice
Asian touch.
<p>All the salads ($3-$4) are starters rather than light entrees and continue the Mediterranean
theme of the other appetizers. A grilled rendering of the popular and ubiquitous Caesar and an
updated version of old-fashioned wilted spinach salad sound promising.
<P>Popular Mediterranean ingredients -- basil, feta and Parmesan cheeses, artichokes,
mushrooms, garlic, and tomatoes in various combinations flavor a half-dozen pasta dishes
($9-$14) to which shrimp, chicken or meat are added.
<p>Black Angus beef is a feature in several of the entrees ($7-$16), dubbed "grills." Others
include a Portobello burger, chicken, shrimp, lamb and pork, in addition to the daily specials.
Many are accompanied by the house potatoes -- a delicious, rich concoction of red skin potatoes,
bacon, and feta cheese. We chose a mixed grill, a sampling of the cafe's meats and poultry,
which was delivered as the large order that it was. Thinly cut meats on hot grills lose their juices
quickly, which was the fate of those on this handsome pottery plate. Sauces might have restored
some moisture; instead, good grilled vegetables and those wonderful potatoes -- the lemon rice
on the plate is superfluous -- were more interesting.
<p>A special of pork medallions suffered the same grilled fate, but they, too, were redeemed by
cafe potatoes and a wonderful autumn "chutney" of apples and walnuts in those deep-brown
spices and sugars that remind us of good cheer.
<p>And that was a good transition to dessert, a delicious seasonal pumpkin ice cream on sugar
cookies, topped with whipped cream and raspberries. The picture-frame dessert menu offers
other tempting choices, too.
<p>Cafe du Soleil is a stylish addition to the ever-diverse and dynamic Carytown culinary scene.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>

<H2><CENTER>JANUARY 15, 1996</H2></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>Vietnamese Splendor</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>by Brad Bradley</H2></CENTER>            

<p> The new Indochine is a good addition to Carytown.

<p>The French influence melds flavors, tones down the heat and still makes for an interesting meal.

<p>Now that Vietnamese cuisine has caught on with the masses, we've got another layer to explore. Not new, mind you. French Vietnamese had long since made its debut in Washington when I tried it in the early '80s. Virginia Beach's La Caravelle has pumped it for years, though not to much avail. And New York's Le Colonial, an East Side eatery with a distinctly colonial prewar attitude, has become a popular see-n-b-seen spot.
<p>Though visually more dazzling, French Vietnamese isn't as exciting or as spicy as traditional Vietnamese. It's milder, less challenging to the constitution. You have to know that going in. Otherwise, if you expect all the complexity of tastes as well as the fire of traditional Vietnamese, you'll be disappointed. The French influence melds flavors, tones down the heat and still makes for an interesting meal.
<p>Although I've been to only a handful of the French-Viet variety, these shared a difference in attitude that translates to a more refined ambience. While our straightforward Vietnamese favorites concentrate on the food and let the atmosphere take a back seat, their French-flavored counterparts create the full experience, from food to mood. They're tuned in to lighting, wines and all the other indulgences that the French have made an art. And so it was on our visit to Indochine, Richmond's stand-alone French-Vietnamese restaurant in Carytown. 
<p>We were delighted when we walked into the former Cary Cuisine and found that the atmosphere of the old building hadn't been destroyed. It was warmly dark and cozy, and the tableclothed booths were inviting. We were remarking on the sophistication of the place (at the same time wondering how to keep our 5-year-old contained) when a hostess appeared with coloring book and crayons. Food, ambience and comfort aside, how many "grown-up" places are so accommodating to children? We were-- and are-- impressed.
<p>We began with crispy spring roll ($1.50) and were not only surprised but pleased with it. It was an excellent metaphor for the French-Vietnamese vs. traditional Vietnamese argument. While it wasn't as spicy, the Frenchified version contained not only chicken breast and shrimp but crabmeat as well. We then split two appetizers, shrimp Royale ($7.95) and stuffed rice crepe ($7.95) or, more colloquially, a Vietnamese pancake. The crepe was nicely crisped and stuffed to overflowing with shrimp, pork, onions, mushrooms, and mostly, sprouts. The shrimp Royale was more unusual. There were six large shrimps stuffed with a chicken and shrimp mixture and fried. Although the batter was on the bready side, it was remarkably not greasy.
<p>We skipped soups and opted for salads. Either the chicken sesame seed salad ($6.95) or the warm beef salad ($6.95) could be a reasonable lunch as both were large and satisfying. Large strips of grilled chicken breast topped the sesame salad. The grilled beef strips were overcooked to the point of crunchiness but the salad was fresh and crisp.
<p>Confronted by a tantalizing list of entrees (and being rather full on top of that), we had a hard time selecting entrees. Finally, we settled on what the menu calls "spicy" curry noodle ($10.95). While we'd argue with the "spicy" description, we did find these rice noodles tasty. Pieces of pork, chicken and shrimp were mild additions, but the curry coconut sauce was delicate and a nice blend of flavors. Our other entree, also promoted as "spicy" while falling short of that description, was spicy chicken and lemongrass ($10.95). This included slices of chicken breast sauteed in a mild lemongrass sauce over fresh vegetables with steamed rice on the side. Both were quite good, although the term "spicy" was somewhat misleading.
<p>We're fascinated by this new addition. It's comfortable, hospitable, and extremely accommodating, not only to families with children but also to vegetarians. The menu notes that most of the stir-fried dishes can be prepared sans meats. It's also a brilliant alternative when you wan

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>
</head>
<h2><center>November 12, 1996</h2></center>
<h4><center>A Carytown Find</h4></center>
<h4><center>The new Nacho Mama's is a good addition to Carytown.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Brad Bradley</h4></center>

<p>Slowly but surely, Carytown has evolved into a long string of cute-but-cool shops, boutiques
and chow houses. Before Amici opened, La Maisonette was among the first to up the ante from
"joint" to upscale restaurant. When it didn't stick, Amici came in with its freshly made breads,
pastas, and northern Italian cuisine, and brought in a clientele that was glad to see such
out-of-the-ordinary boutiques as Lane Sanson and Pink. Over time, even places like the old shoe
repair shop, the vintage clothing shop and the corner diner advertising fried chicken, pizza and
burgers were no longer viewed as shabby, but sort of Village chic.
<p>With the closing of Josie's, a trendy, exotic soup-and-salad spot, I was surprised and sorry to
see one of my favorite Carytown eateries replaced by a Mexican restaurant. Sorry, that is, until I
ate at Nacho Mama's.
<p>The flavor of Josie's lives on in glassed-in food cases, unusual art and mood lighting. A
flashy mural of "the mama" covers one first-floor wall. Good service, another hallmark of the
old spot, also lives on at Mama's.
<p>Chips and salsa appeared shortly after we were seated. While I would dispute the
"homemade" claim on the chips, the salsa appears to be Mama's own version, slightly sweet with
a distinct afterburn. My guest began with El Pollo Loco nachos which, for the $5.95 tariff,
would've made a nice meal for two. Spicy grilled chicken topped mounds of chips that had
already been covered with refried beans, some tomato and chopped onions, all atop bits of
lettuce. My spicy chicken wings ($4.95) came fried and doused in a sauce that was deliciously
tart, tangy and hot. I ordered a side of guacamole ($1.99) for a coolant, but it, too, had some fire.
<p>We had already ordered entrees, so it was too late to bail, even though our stomachs were
urging us to do so. I had ordered La Panchita, a real bargain at $7.25. A heaping platter with rice
and refried beans featured a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada and a chicken taco. It was
refreshing to actually see what I was eating instead of poking through one continuous layer of
sauce and cheese just to know what I was eating. While the burrito could've used some
additional spicing up, the shredded chicken inside was moist and tender, not strings of
overcooked meat that many Mexican restaurants pass off. The enchilada was the star, with
creamy, minced chicken inside and a light, tangy green sauce on top. The taco was pretty
standard, but not to be dismissed.
<p>My guest chose wisely, as most of my dinner went home in a box. Her crab cakes ($14.95)
were very thin but nicely cooked and served with three sauces: chipotle, roasted red pepper and
cilantro salsa, a mild accompaniment; jalapeno pesto, too mild and subtle to appreciate; and a
sweet pineapple and tomato salsa. I didn't think any of the three enhanced the crab. Even better
than the crab cakes was the vegetable melange that accompanied them. Roasted corn, squash,
green and red peppers and onions all had a smoky, grilled, buttery flavor.
<p>We quibbled over dessert, as my guest had never had fried ice cream ($3). Fat-wise, you
might as well drink a bottle of Crisco, but the allure was too much for my friend. I must say,
Nacho Mama's seems to have perfected the art. The fried, coconutty covering on the scoop of ice
cream was seamless and firm. My only complaint is that it seemed to have been pre-made and
frozen. The result was that the ice cream inside remained hard, making it more difficult to eat
than the crusty-outside, creamy-inside version.
<p>All in all, if Mexican is your bent for an evening, Nacho Mama's should be a top
consideration. It's very moderately priced, and most dishes are a bargain. And while you're there,
have a look around Carytown.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>APRIL 23, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>A Star Is Born</H2></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Davis Morton</H4></CENTER>

<P>Once upon a time when stars came to Richmond they played on a stage or in an arena. Now
they sometimes work in the kitchen -- and sometimes cooking to a full house. Such was the case
last week at The Frog and the Redneck when the eponymous Frog, and culinary star, leapt in for
a command performance. 
<P>Jean-Louis Palladin is recognized in his profession as one of the premier chefs in the
country, and his restaurant at the illustrious Watergate gets the same acclamation. When he
comes to Richmond to cook for his former associate and good friend Jimmy Sneed, we can
expect that it will be a performance that's up to par.
<P>Tasting dinners have become popular with an increasing number of people who seek out
excellent and interesting food and wine. It's an excellent opportunity to explore the foods a
restaurant or chef offers and, in many instances, to taste wines professionally chosen to
complement the food.
<P>A look over Palladin's audience as we sample an Oregon champagne (1988 Argyle Brut)
suggests a food-serious crowd -- with a tariff of $85 plus tax and gratuity they're clearly not
there merely to catch a quick bite. 
<P>Chef Jean-Louis, relaxed and amiable, chats in front of the wood-fired oven in one of the
special-events rooms at the restaurant as assistants work rapidly to complete the hors d'oeuvres.
Palladin, who received coveted Michelin stars in France before he was 30, was among the first to
shake the rigors of classical French cooking and explore a more elemental style, known
eventually as "nouvelle cuisine." He is recognized for his ability to combine tastes and flavors in
unexpected, and usually compelling, ways.
<P>As we find our places, we peruse the printed menu of six courses and as many wines. On
paper it seems daunting and excessive; in reality, it is a well-orchestrated and delicious, keeping
all "entertained" for three hours.
<P>The hors d'oeuvres were Virginia favorites -- with a twist: soft-shell crabs on toasted brioche
and a "pizza" of shad roe and pancetta (Italian-style bacon). Soup followed: cream of fava-bean
with crayfish, a delicate spring-green in color and as subtle in flavor. (Fava beans, not much seen
in this country, are plumper but similar to lima beans). The first real tour-de-force of the evening
in flavor and presentation was a large diver scallop presented in the shell (top and bottom) with a
fondue of Vidalia onions, blood oranges, and a vintage vinegar -- a wonderful melding of
unlikely flavors .
<P>The next course was bolder: lowly baked fish made "haute" again -- a thick cube of
succulent halibut "breaded" with wild mushrooms on two puddles of contrasting sauces, one
made with mellow roast garlic. The final savory of the evening was loin of rabbit, baked in a
thin blanket of dough and served with a blood-red sauce infused with the spicy flavors of India.
Accompanied with a very good 1993 Chateauneuf-du Pape, it was taken even higher.
<P>After all this, only dessert could follow -- a wonderful assortment of parts that were as good
separately as together, namely, thin slices of mango and pastry, nougatine, caramel ice cream,
and intense huckleberry coulis.
<P>Tasting dinners are available at some restaurants on a regular basis and are an excellent way
to sample an assortment of dishes and the gamut of the kitchen. Most restaurants request that all
at the table participate. The Frog and the Redneck, in addition to its series of dinners with guest
chefs, offers a four-course tasting dinner nightly ($45). 
<P>The Dining Room at the Berkeley offers a five-course dinner which includes appropriate
wines ($55) and also has a series of dinners with visiting chefs. Franco's Ristorante introduces its
seasonal menu with a tasting dinner of wines and foods ($75). Other restaurants offer occasional
evenings when vintners and chefs collaborate to promote their fares and wares.
<P>If you enjoy food and want to expand your experience, we recommend you try a tasting
dinner.

<h2><center>June 11, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>A Congenial Spot</h2></center>
<h4><center>King Arthur and his Court could happily make their home here, dining on fish,
steaks and chocolate stuff.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>The crowds are in Shockoe Bottom by the hundreds, mostly on the weekends, but there's
also a fair amount of traffic during the week, particularly in good weather. Most are young and
hip, but there's a smattering of tourists, and a few suburbanites escaping the kids for a night out.
Lots of people go just to be in the center of the action.
<p>Dressed in the hottest fashions (this is not the "grunge" crowd) and with incomes (and credit
cards) to support their nights on the town, this throng may get hungry as well as thirsty, and a lot
of money has been invested in the Bottom, making the competition for your food dollar fierce.
<p>Camelot, one of the newest restaurants in the city, is the latest to cater to people who want
something more than loud music, quickie food and a sturdy barstool.
<p>This space has been through several transformations, the most famous as the 1708 Gallery.
Now, the rooms are handsome in retro fashion, suggesting an Edwardian influence (period
chandeliers, glazed walls, stenciled borders, velvet dividers, a decorative pressed-tin ceiling, and
a suit of armor). The dining scene spills out through French doors onto the not-so-formal
sidewalk where one can see or be seen as part of the street action.
<p>The idea to use space and staff before the late-night onslaught of revelers makes sense, and
Camelot has gone one step further by making good dining very affordable. In addition, the wine
list is interesting, its prices appealing. On the night we visited recently, the servers were attentive
and informative.
<p>The appetizers ($3.95-$5.95) range from a Saganaki cheese flamb‚ to sauteed calamari. We
chose shrimp treated with the Thai flavors of coconut milk, lime and fresh herbs. The thin sauce
was more interesting than the six butterflied shrimp it was meant to support. The sauce was a
better accompaniment to bread than butter.
<p>Seafood entrees ($14.95-$22.95) include shrimp in bourbon sauce, grilled swordfish,
crabcakes, lobster tails, and the chop-house standard, turf and surf ($22.95). Other entrees
($8.95-$16.95) include chicken, pork, three kinds of beef steak, lamb chops, as well as crepes
wrapped around spinach and other savory tidbits in a cream sauce.
<p>After a good salad with a base of baby greens and lettuces (served with all entrees), we
sampled the special, a steak of black-fin shark au poivre and finished with a brandy sauce. It's
trendy to treat these firm-fleshed fish like tuna, swordfish and shark as if they were meat, and it's
often successful. In this case, the fiery black-pepper coating humbled the fierce fish, but the
sauce smoothed out the flavors.
<p>We also tried the lamb chops from the menu -- three thick loin chops served medium-rare as
requested. Our server suggested that the servings were "Southern style," and, indeed, the food
was plentiful. The lamb chops ($11.95) were garnished with a compote of garlic, tomato, black
olives and feta cheese, which was good enough to stand on its own. Both the fish and the lamb
were accompanied by redskin potatoes roasted with rosemary and fresh string beans, a hint of
crispness still intact.
<p>There were only a few desserts to choose from -- one was a decadent chocolate concoction;
the other, pecan pie, a rich little wedge in a cookie-like pastry -- with rich coffee a pleasant
close.
<p>As we finished, the late crowd had begun to wander in, checking out the action. As we
departed, tablecloths, stemware and votive candles were disappearing, making way for a more
casual scene.
<p>King Arthur's mythical island of Avalon lives in a restaurant of the same name in the Fan.
It's fitting that his kingdom should also be represented in Shockoe Bottom.

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>
</head>
<h2><center>January 7, 1997</h2></center>
<h2><center>Singular Style</h2></center>
<h4><center>by Lisa Antonelli Bacon</h4></center>
<h4><center>None Such Place takes on a new chef and a new outlook.</h4></center>

<p>As restaurants come and go in Shockoe Bottom, a select few have proven their staying
power. Along with Awful Arthur's, None Such Place at the corner of 18th and Franklin streets is
one of those. A lunch visit some 18 months ago made me wonder why. But, after a recent dinner
visit, it's apparent why this rather non-distinctive place has stood its ground.
<p>I say "non-distinctive" because None Such is one of the only places in the Bottom that
doesn't flaunt a personality. It's not a pool-room bar. It's not a hangout for the beer crowd. It
doesn't cater to seafood lovers or those seeking ethnic cuisine. It's just a good food place, with
little individuality and no readily apparent niche. But now, the food is special enough to
recommend it.
<p>That may be the result of new management or a new chef who, our waiter informed us, came
from Ukrop's. The menu, which changes seasonally, offers an array of meats (one vegetarian
entree), and a couple of ocean catches. The new catch is None Such has risen in sophistication,
and those of us who live nearby are pleased that there is still a place for elders (the over-30
crowd) to dine now that our beloved Island Grill has closed.
<p>Sophistication, in this case, refers to dishes that are carefully thought out, that offer
interesting pairings of ingredients and flavors, and that, although somewhat overdone, are
beautifully presented.
<p>I say "overdone" because on our visit, it seemed that a new shipment of baby onions,
radishes and fresh herbs inspired the manager, the chef and our waiter all to plunge sprigs of this
and that into our entrees, making them look like fountains spraying greens everywhere. 
<p>In the course of the evening, we were checked on several times by no less than three people,
which usually means someone has spotted a reviewer. That also might explain why everyone got
in on the garnish act. Still, the service was certainly attentive.
<p>Our appetizer choices were good ones. The Parmesan potato cake ($5.50) was a generous
serving of flavorful chopped potatoes formed into a big, thick pancake and topped with melted
Parmesan. Definitely comfort food, if a little too salty with ham and added seasonings. The
prosciutto and crab vol-au-vent ($8.95) was more intriguing if not substantial. The weakness
here was that the salty ham muted the crab and the Dijon Hollandaise that accompanied it. 
Having scouted out the entrees, which all sounded hearty and filling, we shared the Harvest
spinach salad ($5.25), which combined fresh spinach, cherry tomatoes, boiled egg and fried
leeks in a wonderfully sweet and sour dressing flavored with country bacon. The salad was
drenched, puddling in the bowl, a problem that can be alleviated by asking for it on the side.
Our entrees weren't exactly what we'd expected, given menu descriptions, but we weren't too
disappointed. My guest ordered the Chesapeake duck ($15.50), which promised one-half a
muscovy duck that had been marinated in Thai seasonings and "crackle roasted." We thought the
crackle-roasted designation would bring crispy skin. And, if you're a marginal duck-eater as I
am, that crispy skin is the big selling point. The skin wasn't crispy, but the duck inside was
moist, mild of game flavor and had absorbed all the intricate flavorings to make it tasty. It came
with a mound of smashed (not creamy or whipped) potatoes that were a nice counterpoint to the
highly seasoned duck.
<p>My Jefferson and Jackson ($19.95) paired a petit filet mignon of Angus beef with
sweetbreads sauteed in brandy and sauced with veal glacee. I've eaten lots of sweetbreads in a
variety of ways, but I've never seen two such large mounds of them. Although they were
delicious, it is my contention that such rich innards should be meted out more judiciously.
<p>Desserts aren't on the same level of sophistication as the appetizers and entrees, but they're
all made onsite. I went with apple pie ($3.50) with a scoop of ice cream ($1.50) and, to be sure,
it rivals anybody's mother's, with a light, sugary crust. My guest's chocolate Oblivion ($4.50)
featured Grand Marnier-laced mousse and whole Oreos inside a chocolate crust. It was so rich
she wound up taking half home.
<p>The whole experience was a resounding success. While we wouldn't say there's no such
place as None Such, there certainly isn't one in the Bottom. We're glad it's there.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>APRIL 30, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>My Hillbilly Home</H2></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Brad Bradley</H4></CENTER>

<P>I always laugh when I go to New York and some native tries to steer me to "soul food" or
"good home cookin'." Invariably, they suggest some diner in the Village or Sylvia's in Harlem.
Well, I've done both, in the spirit of being a good guest. And I can tell you that New Yorkers
don't know from either.
<P>One might argue that I don't know one from the other, or either separately, for that matter.
My ma, as it would turn out, was never at home in the kitchen. In fact, she was never at home,
unless her tennis racquet was being restrung. Turns out it's a genetic thing. There are other
places I'd rather be than over a cooktop. But I've lived in the South long enough to know home
cookin'. And I've lived in Church Hill long enough to know soul food. And while there are
subtle differences, to me they're equally good, if not one and the same.
<P>Let me be precise. I'm not talking diner food. Not burgers and fries. Not even chili or
shakes. Although Southern Sugar and Spices has all those except the shakes. I'm talking limas
cooked with fatback. I'm talking fried chicken made from a generations-old recipe. I'm talking
fried fish with the bones still in.
<P>Southern Sugar and Spices, at the East End of Shockoe before you get to Millie's, started out
as Sugar and Spice, a lunch counter and a few tables that catered to the labor force in the
factories of the East End. When it reopened a few months ago (with a new name, restrooms with
handicapped access, roomy booths and a new paint job) I was a little skeptical. My first visit to
the new, the different Main Street eatery was not a disappointment. The fried chicken was just as
I'd remembered. And the limas were just like before. 
<P>I couldn't believe as much of the old place had been retained, so I went back again, this time
for a barbecue sandwich, just to be sure. It was tart and tomatoey, and I was began to believe the
original restaurant had survived modernization.
<P>Wanting to be positive that the old place was still in evidence, I went back a third time. This
time, I brought in the pros, the guys who won't eat just anything. These guys are as likely to
fling food they don't like as they are to scarf down food they do. And still being in the
single-digit age, The Twins aren't allowed to make their own choices, since those would feature
only one or two food groups. The menu isn't overly long, with one page devoted to breakfast,
and slightly over one page devoted to lunch and dinner, so choosing isn't hard. We settled on
meatloaf ($6.95) and ribs. Dinners come with two sides, and this is equally important when it
comes to making decisions.
<P>There are ample choices in the sides section. Being that the limas were a given, we settled
on mashed potatoes, onion rings, and macaroni and cheese. The onion rings I wrote off quickly,
recognizing them as frozen. But everything else was authentic and down home. The mashed
potatoes were fluffy but substantive, no phony flakes here. And they were buttery and perfectly
salted before I even touched them. No baloney with the mac and cheese, either. It was the real
thing, with real cheese. And the limas were flavorful and mushy, just like they ought to be. 
<P>On this Friday night, there was a special rib offering, Western-style for $7.99 as opposed to
the slightly more expensive menu listing. These were a long, meaty rack, slathered in a tart, if
thin, brown sauce that made for delightfully messy eating. And even though the meat loaf was
only two pate-thin slices napped in brown gravy, it was dense and moist.
<P>None of us wanted to pass up dessert. All are homemade and usually include a choice of pies
as well as some other favorites. We agreed on the coconut pie ($1.55), and forks flew. It was a
rich chess with lots of moist coconut, and The Twins wanted more, but we were on the verge of
bankruptcy.
<P>This is one of those places I almost hate to write about, because next time I'll have to wait in
line. But it's only fair to share the secret. In the future, when some Yank tries to act like he
knows the real thing, I won't listen. I'll just wait 'til I get home.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>MAY 21, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>The Italian Shuffle</H2></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Sally Flemming</H4></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>When in Italy, do as they do at Caffe Di Pagliacci.</H4></CENTER>

<P>I've eaten a few meals at Caffe Di Pagliacci and always had good experiences, so I knew our
recent visit would be noteworthy. And in fact, the evening turned out to be memorable, but not
in the way I'd expected.
<P>I called on Saturday to make a reservation and asked if we could bring along our tot. No
problem, said the hostess. When we arrived, we discovered that diners of all ages had convened
at the restaurant, including couples, families, and several tables of sequined and bedazzled
promgoers.
<P>We were seated almost immediately downstairs in a room that's cozily lit and intimate, with
tables spaced far enough apart so you don't butter your neighbor's bread. 
<P>Initially we thought it was a good idea to bring our little one, but it quickly became apparent
that she wasn't up for a long, leisurely dinner. In fact, as she bounced up and down at the table it
became clear that we would have to hustle through our meal. (Anyone who is a parent is familiar
with this scenario.)
<P>We hurriedly waded into our basket of hot and crusty garlic bread, and then steamrolled
through our appetizers. My husband chose the Fritto di Calamari al Marco ($4.25), lightly
seasoned and fried squid whose coating could have been a bit more crisp. I opted for the broiled
mushroom caps that were stuffed with what crabmeat dressing, as described by the menu.
($3.95). 
<P>A few moments later, our house salads arrived consisting of a refreshing assortment of
lettuces, green and black olives and cucumbers. Sometime during the salad course, our toddler's
behavior took a turn for the worse and my husband and I decided that we'd have to rush a bit
more than we'd hoped.
<P>The best way to gauge the professionalism of a restaurant is during a tot crisis. When it was
clear to the management that we'd have to hurry just a bit, they leaped into action. Our entrees
were brought promptly.
<P>Of our two choices, I preferred my husband's, the Lonza di Maiale Arrosto al Bernardo,
slices of pork tenderloin in a zesty Bernardo sauce over fresh pasta ($10.95). The meat was
tender and the sauce had an interesting peppery bite.
<P>I liked my entree of Crocchette di Grancevola Alla Roma (crabcakes) just a tad less, perhaps
because I was expecting large pieces of crabmeat, rather than the crabmeat dressing. The two
crabmeat patties had been mashed and grilled, and served over a pesto sauce that didn't add all
that much to the dish. 
<P>Perhaps I should have gone with my first choice, Coscio di Vitello Farcito ($13.95) with its
veal stuffed with homemade sausage, spinach, eggs and breadcrumbs served with a demiglace
sauce. I suspect that one of the restaurant's strongest suits is found in its meat dishes. A few other
intriguing combinations included a rolled beef steak stuffed with bacon, onion, Parmesan cheese
and almonds; and a mixed grill of marinated veal, chicken, pork and homemade sausage
accompanied by mushrooms, peppers and onions. All entrees come with a side dish of pasta or
risotto. 
<P>The fact that the Caffe is such a perennial favorite in town is testimony to its reasonable
prices and good Italian preparations.
<P>Because of our toddler, we didn't have the luxury of lingering for coffee and dessert as we
would have liked, though we saw a lot of people who were during our visit. Caffe di Pagliacci
says its desserts are all created in its kitchen, and this includes a tiramisu ($2.95), chocolate
mousse pie ($2.75) and cannoli ($2.25). At home, we sampled the cheesecake, which true to the
description on the menu, is "not New York style" but a lighter version with a thick graham
cracker crust.
<P>Our tab for dinner was less than $60, quite good considering we had ordered the full works.
But it was the outstanding service and plain old-fashioned helpfulness that proved priceless.

<h2><center>November 26, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Chase's Dream</h2></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>
<h4><center>Chase's Place is a pleasant new site for a casual evening meal or late
supper.</h4></center>

<p>The presence of Virginia Commonwealth University along Grace Street is becoming more
apparent with each passing day, and the blocks directly north of the university have begun to
reflect the diversity of a large urban university. Ethnic eateries now abound. Within a couple of
blocks, you can find Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi, Jamaican, Vietnamese, Greek,
Middle Eastern, and Italian places, not to mention the anchor institution on the corner, "The
Village," the coffee houses, and the pervasive fast-food restaurants.
<p>Chase's Place has been around for a long time though under a different guise. Off Grace
Street by a half-block (and with convenient evening parking across the street), this small eatery
has been refurbished and the menu revamped. It's a pleasant site for a casual evening meal or late
supper. I suspect that the menu will appeal to the post-student set more than to the student crowd
(and the music seems to confirm that). Chase's Place is the kind of eatery where you may not
have to do much ordering after you've been there a time or two. They'll remember, so all you
have to do is get comfortable. The little galley kitchen is at the front beside the entrance so it's
easy to communicate with the man at the stove.
<p>A couple of regulars sat behind us and ordered as they came through the door, drinks and a
half-pound of spiced shrimp ($7.95) appeared almost as they were settling in. Other starters are
Cajun-seasoned shrimp or chicken tenders.
<p>The house salad that precedes entrees is better than average. Ours were wonderfully fresh
with tasty greens and vegetables, and original dressings. Lots of warm garlic bread added charm
to this modest beginning.
<p>Pasta is the centerpiece of all the entrees ($8.95-$12.95), ranging from a simple fettuccine
Alfredo to a grilled filet mignon with angel-hair pasta. The menu lists seven choices, but Chase's
is the kind of place where the chef will stir up a combination to your specifications, and, in fact,
he did come over and ask about our preferences for a couple of things. For the pasta weary, there
are sandwiches ($5.95).
<p>The two pastas we tried from the menu were right on-target. Chase's Mediterranean mix over
penne pasta was enough for two meals -- and almost as good in the warming over. Moist grilled
chicken was combined with zucchini, onion, and black olives in a herby tomato sauce, topped
with feta cheese. Farfalle (bow-ties) was the right pasta (nicely al dente) for a "primavera"  of a
half-dozen perfectly cooked fresh vegetables in a simple sauce -- very satisfying on a stormy
November night, even if one doesn't yet dare have thoughts of spring. Other pastas include
sauces with mustard and shrimp or chicken with scallion and cheese.
<p>In addition to the bar, there are some modest but appropriate wines. If you require dessert,
there are a couple. A version of tirmisu offered completion and resolution, but it wouldn't be my
reason for going back.
<p>Chase's Place doesn't stake out pretentious territory, but what it does, it does very well.

<title>STYLE WEEKLY'S RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>JULY 16, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>GRILLED TO ORDER</H2></CENTER>




<H4><CENTER>By Arabella Byatt</H4></CENTER>

<p>Davis & Main is simply a good, all-round neighborhood restaurant. The food is dependable
despite a truly diverse menu. The service is friendly, the prices reasonable, the atmosphere
relaxing and comfortable. The simplicity and straightforwardness of its name, Davis & Main,
just about sums up the apparent mission of the restaurant: no gimmicks, no wacky dishes, no
attitude, no surprises -- just good food and lots of it. 
<p>What stands out in memory about my latest venture into Davis & Main was the appetizer my
dinner companions and I decided upon. We all agreed that the smoked trout and pork tenderloin
with smoked cheddar and lingonberries was about the best $6 we'd spent in a long time. Both the
trout and cheddar had just a hint of smoked flavor -- not too much but just enough to detect. The
pork tenderloins were in slitherlike medallions and served cold; the accompanying lingonberries
offered a good color and flavor contrast. 
<p>For our second starter, we ordered the stuffed artichoke hearts with Swedish fontina ($5).
The hearts were deep fried, which was a surprise (not entirely welcome, but they were still
good). And the cheese provided an interesting and flavorful addition. The accompanying vat of
clarified and "herbed" butter, however, was a disappointment. We all agreed that fried artichoke
and a custard cup of butter is just a bit too much for conscious waistlines. 
<p>Next, we selected the spinach and grilled sweet potato salad with pecans and grilled
Portobelo mushrooms with a roasted garlic dressing ($7). The dressing provided a nice kick; the
sweet potatoes and mammoth Portobellos were also interesting additions. The grill is the
cornerstone of success at Davis & Main. "Our menu is designed around our grill," says the
menu. "This allows us to offer fresh foods simply cooked and flavored." Naturally, we opted for
a grilled specialty from the menu -- the Virginia farm catfish filet with cornmeal crust and black
bean tequila salsa ($14.50). The cornmeal crust and the salsa proved to be a tasty combination
and complemented the catfish nicely. We also ordered one of the pasta specials of the evening:
linguine with grilled chicken and sausage ($14.50). The resulting dish was a surprise: very
earthy, almost masculine in flavor, a thoroughly interesting selection. It was served with a small
salad of mixed greens. Also on our docket was a grilled vegetarian sandwich with an avocado
goat cheese spread ($6.50). It came as a thick homebaked pita pocket, literally stuffed with
grilled veggies; the accompanying spread, served on the side, was outstanding. The fries, which
came with the sandwich, were superior, as fries go. 
<p>In the past, we've tended to peg Davis & Main a very casual dining spot, despite its
wide-ranging menu. It's a relief that that still holds true, but the place is actually quite a lot more.
Sure, upscale burgers and other sandwiches are available (their half-pound black Angus burger
at $6.50 is tops), but Davis & Main offers patrons a lot more opportunity than just being a
neighborhood "joint," and we were pleasantly pleased to discover its multidimensionality. 
The more adventurous selections are as good as the staples. The black tiger shrimp with tangy
corn relish ($12.50) is as expertly prepared as the grilled chicken sandwich ($6.50). Nightly
specials -- and there are usually a handful of them -- also capitalize on the grill and the talented
chef behind it.
<p>Davis & Main is a good neighborhood destination, an appropriate meeting place and a
perfect after-work watering hole. The menu, which appears to be handwritten, emphasizes the
freshness of the food and popular prices and encourages patrons to ask if they have a special
request. Its neighborhood spirit is further demonstrated on the back of the menu, where logos of
local fine arts organizations (including the Richmond Ballet, Virginia Opera, Richmond
Symphony) are displayed. Copy on the back also touts Davis & Main's support of "made in
Virginia" products sold at the restaurant. In our view, Davis & Main gives a respectable bang for
a buck.

<h2><center>The New Fan </h2></center>
<h4><center>The Fan Station is a welcome addition to the Fan's burgeoning Restaurant
Row.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>Main Street from Belvidere to Boulevard has almost become Restaurant Row. It's always
had a fair number of neighborhood bars and eateries, but in recent years the changes reflect the
gentrification of the Fan, along with its diversity. And now, rather than merely serving the
surrounding residents, the Main Street restaurant scene should be a destination for serious diners
throughout the area.
<p>The Fan Station, now open for almost two months, is the latest restaurant metamorphosis
along Main Street. Formerly known as the Stafford Street Station, the space was most recently
home to a Chinese restaurant. Now these cozy rooms have been spruced up to serve some
serious food. The street facade of glass blocks and corner entrance suggest earlier
transformations. Two steps down from the sidewalk, you're in a small waiting area. Beyond are
the bar and dining rooms. 
<p>The menu focuses on traditional and familiar fare that is given some enlivening twists and
turns. Seafood appears to be the house specialty, but there are interesting choices for the
land-lover too.
<p>I'm not sure how many takers they get for three (of four) of the appetizers which are priced
beyond $8. All the components of The Fan Station version of Oysters Rockefeller ($8.50) -- six
just-warm mollusks on the half-shell topped with chopped spinach and finished with hollandaise
-- were perfectly in order, but the whole was no more than the sum of the parts. A touch of
traditional Pernod, a bit of watercress or scallion with the spinach, or even a snappier
presentation could add a bit of zest to this New Orleans original. Other choices for starters
($4.75-$9.25) are pan-seared shrimp on greens, blackened fish with melon salsa or grilled
vegetables.
<p>Thick seafood chowder ($4.50/2.50) was actually more interesting than the oysters, and a
cup of this rich concoction was just enough to whet the appetite.
<p>A warm loaf of sourdough bread comes to table with a rather ordinary house salad, which
precedes all entrees. The salad, however, is perked up by an interesting peanut vinaigrette.
For those who want lighter fare, a trio of salads ($2.25-$9.25) and a half-dozen, mostly
traditional sandwiches ($5.75-$10.75) offer alternatives. A nontraditional Reuben with crabmeat,
ham, cheese, and completed with sauerkraut whets my curiosity.
<p>Chicken, veal, seafood and the requisite cut of beef, in this case grilled tenderloin, cover the
usual entree territory ($14.25-$18.50). Chicken Chesapeake -- a boned chicken breast stuffed
with asparagus and crabmeat and napped with a creamy sauce supreme -- is subtle and quite
good. Sea scallops, pampered like filet mignon, are wrapped in fresh tuna and given their time
on the grill. The result is just-cooked scallops, moist and sweet, but a rather dry, tough
overcooked tuna. 
<p>The entrees were handsomely plated, and each was accompanied by delicious tidbits -- crisp
sweet-potato chips, tiny Frenchstyle green beans with just a touch of crunch, rich squares of
potato gratin, or warm caramelized sweet potato cakes, and, for the scallops, a "chutney" of
sweet peppers and fruit.
<p>Desserts ($2.50-$4.50) tend toward the heavy, the weight favored by many restaurants (and
apparently their patrons) these days. Wedges of pecan pie and apple cobbler were acceptable and
comforting conclusions.
<p>There's a thoughtful wine list, and most of the selections, including some recent Virginia
labels, are beyond $20.00 for the bottle; many are available by the glass. 
<p>On the atmospheric front, a ceramic tile floor and low ceiling made the piped-in music
reverberate rather intrusively. And the restaurant's temperature seemed to fluctuate between too
warm, and too cold. The heating system could use some attention.
<p>The Fan Station enters the restaurant fray at a price point and in an area where the
competition is fierce. As each new restaurant stakes out its territory, The Fan Station has set its
flags on a traditional, rather conservative plot and has left for others the unstable ground of the
trendy and ever-changing fashions. May the best food win.

<title>Restaurant Review</title>

<h2><center>April 2, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Amazing Grace</h2></center>

<P>Vegetarian goes mainstream with the success of Grace Place.
<P> An exposed brick wall and lots of plants add a touch of intimacy to the second floor.

<P>by Davis Morton

<P>For a long time the usual reasons for eating vegetarian, other than religious scruples, were
that you didn't like meat or that you didn't eat it because of your opposition to the slaughter of
animals. In recent years, the adverse effects of fat and cholesterol have added other, equally
compelling reasons to avoid meat. Another good reason is that vegetarian preparations can be
good and very satisfying.
<P>Our growing national diversity has expanded our knowledge of ethnic foods, many of which
are not geared toward the traditional meat and potatoes approach to eating. As a result,
interesting vegetarian dishes are available in many restaurants. Restaurants that specialize in
vegetarian preparations are coming into their own.
<P>Grace Place Restaurant should have a corner on the market. They've been serving up
vegetarian fare since 1973, and any restaurant that stays around that long must be doing
something right. 
<P>The first floor of this typical Fan row house is devoted to a store that sells a variety of
natural products, everything from food to cosmetics. Antique tables, an exposed brick wall, and
lots of plants add a homey and intimate touch to the dining rooms on the second floor. At night,
subdued lighting and votive candles add some coziness.
<P>The menu at Grace Place offers a range of international flavors from starters through the
dinner entrees. Four appetizer platters ($4.95-$5.95) go from the ubiquitous nachos and cheese
to a plate of exotic Indonesian flavors. The Mediterranean platter has a bowl of humus, subtly
spicy with the bite of cumin at its center, with pita, feta cheese, Calamata olives, and crisp
cucumbers -- a pleasant and light beginning for a meal.
<P>The salads at Grace Place are always a strong point, and there are 12 to choose from
($3.99-$5.75). From sliced fruits with nuts to Moroccan couscous salad, the combinations can
serve as a beginning or as a light meal. The house salad is a model of freshness. The crisp greens
are surrounded and topped with lots of little flavors and treats. The dressings too are interesting.
<P>I particularly like the toasted sesame flavor of the lemon tahini dressing.
Vegetarian cookery must rely, of course, on protein alternatives to meat. Grains, beans, nuts, and
soybean derivatives such as tofu and tempeh are often used. Seitan, a concentrated wheat gluten,
is gaining in popularity as a meat substitute, and at Grace Place it finds its way into the barbecue
sandwich. The quintessential deli Reuben is made with tempeh; tofu gets in the melt in place of
tuna; and a patty of beans and grains is the base for a burger. Even lowly peanut butter and jelly
makes the list of 18 sandwiches.
<P>The restaurant offers a half-dozen complete, simple meals ($5.50-$6.50) on a plate. The
Shepherd's Platter, for instance, is a bowl of soup, a slice of bread, some cheese, and a salad of
greens or fruit -- a satisfying lunch or light supper.
<P>A dozen dinner entrees ($8.75-$9.25) draw from Asian, Mediterranean, Tex-Mex sources
for flavors and preparations. Some are as simple as spaghetti a la Greek. Tempeh Teriyaki is an
interesting variation of this traditional Japanese standard. The tempeh provides a "meat" texture
against the crispness of the colorful vegetables and the tang of the sauce. In another dish, the
delicate spinach-ricotta ravioli was overwhelmed by the hearty tomato sauce, redolent with
oregano.
<P>For dessert, we chose Apple-Blueberry Crisp which, somehow, had lost its crisp. The flavors
of the fruit were good though the texture was, quite literally, a mess. 
Our service was erratic. Other times when I have eaten there the service has been smooth and
professional. 
<P>Although Grace Place is on the fringe of the VCU campus, our fellow diners seemed as far
from student status as are we, perhaps more evidence that vegetarian cuisine is no longer on the
fringe but has, finally, gone mainstream.

<P>I've been to James River Wine Bistro a few times over the past few years and always have
left concluding it's "nice," "okay," "nothing special." So when I heard that "the chef" from Red
Sage in Washington, D.C., had landed there, I was intrigued. Red Sage has a national reputation.
What could woo "the chef," whomever that may be, to a Richmond restaurant that has never
really been known for anything but "the great building" and the fire that overtook "the great
building" some years back?
<P>Expecting the same somewhat pedestrian fare, I was pleasantly surprised to find two pages
of interesting, chef-challenging dishes. So, who is "the chef" and can he step up to the plate?
(Pun intended.) "The chef," it turns out, is Randy Epps III, formerly sous chef at Red Sage.
Given the Sage's reputation for excellent food, that's still a handsome claim. The story felt a little
funny (leave Red Sage for a mediocre Richmond restaurant?), and I considered calling to
confirm credentials. But I have no reason to doubt and, after the first dish, I didn't think it
necessary. With a sense for intricacy and intrigue, or at least a grand ability to replicate intricate
and intriguing dishes, this guy can stand up to the Red Sage, whether he was sous chef or
dishwasher.
<P>Starters were a difficult choice, as there were three I was dying to try. I toyed with ordering
tamarind barbecued tenderloin satays ($6.50) because it would be a rare pleasure not to have to
wrestle with gristly beef strips. But I'm always curious to see what a chef can do with foie gras,
so I went with Hudson Valley foie gras terrine ($11.50). This was an interesting slice of baby
frisee accompanied by toast points made from Brioche. My guest, who manages to vacation out
of the country twice a year and eats like the queen she should've been, ordered crab and wild
mushroom polenta tart ($8.95). While mine wasn't disappointing, hers was the jackpot, with
lumps of crab that, with the polenta, became a creamy mixture melding the vastly different
flavors of arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, large capers and olives. 
<P>The six salad choices created another dilemma. Caramelized goat cheese, arugula, endive
and pink peppercorn salad tossed in sherry-shallot vinaigrette ($4.50) screamed to be tried. But,
fearing tummy fatigue, I agreed to split the Bistro salad ($5.50) with the would-be queen. When
our waiter arrived with a large salad bowl, filled with lettuce, sweet onion, boiled egg quarters,
creamy avocado, crispy buttons of pancetta and lumps of ripe Gorgonzola, I knew I'd made a
good choice. All this bathed in a honey-mustard vinaigrette with the unexpected tweak of
orange-blossom.
<P>Both of us liked our own entrees better than each other's, but only because she likes veal
chop better than fish and I, vice-versa. Her Flintstone-sized chop ($21.95) had a subtle but
discernible flavor of wood-smoked meat, and it was surrounded by polenta flavored with
Fontina cheese, grilled endive, Portabellas, plum tomatoes and a bite of arugula. The chef had
smarted up the au jus with a hint of balsamic vinegar. After one bite, the globetrotting queen was
willing to concede: "This is the best meal I've ever had in Richmond." 
<P>Not a fish fan, she would barely try my Idaho trout ($13), due to her lack of enthusiasm for
things fishy. On the other hand, while I do not place trout at the top of my seafood list, this one
sounded special, crusted in crushed pistachios and poised atop Savoy cabbage, smoked bacon
and champagne buerre blanc. It was special as expected.
<P>Desserts combined fresh fruits with deadly fattening things for the most part, in such dishes
as fresh fruit tart with vanilla custard ($3.95) and fresh berries with Chambord and fresh cream
($6). I prefer not to mix my food groups in the dessert category, so I chose panna cotta ($4.95), a
creamy egg-less flan with fresh fruit syrup. It was lighter than a cloud and kissed with lemon, an
unrivaled hit -- until the queen tried her chocolate and pistachio pate. A nice puddle of creamy
Anglaise broke the heaviness of the chocolate. 
<P>With its kitchen securely in place, James River Wine Bistro should have time now to up the
ambience. Presently, despite exposed brick walls and linen, you still can tell you're dining in the
school basement it used to be. The lighting is off, and the table arrangement does nothing for the
mood. This bistro has the potential to be one of Richmond's finest dining experiences. Let's see
what happens.

<h2><center>Puzzle No More</h2></center>
<h4><center>Tio Tuna's makes a good debut in the old Puzzles space.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Brad Bradley</h4></center>

<p>I was always puzzled by the following that was drawn to Puzzles. This Fan eatery's mission,
it seemed, was to create unusual dishes using the most bizarre combinations of ingredients the
chef could mix. On the one hand, I salute creativity and innovation. On the other hand, without
parameters, both attributes lead to a contest as to which dish can outweird another.
<p>In the same location as the departed Puzzles is the new Tio Tuna's Seafood Grille. Equally as
creative and innovative as its predecessor, Tio Tuna's has imposed loose parameters to guide its
menu, giving it a theme and identifying its influences -- which, by the way, are "Caribbean" and
"seafood." So when the chef sautes prawns in lime juice and seasons them with cilantro, jicama,
and serrano chiles, diners have some idea of what to expect, because the ingredients are all
commonly used in California and Caribbean cuisines. Unlike at Tio's predecessor, where a dish
that might include such scattered flavors as apple, tomato and avocado could leave one only to
wonder how such a mixture would -- could -- taste, we go to Tio's with some understanding and
expectation of what awaits.
<p>When we went of a recent Wednesday evening, there was an interesting thirtysomething
crowd at the bar, and only two or three tables used by diners. A shame, as the service by our
waiter was among the best experiences we've ever had in Richmond. My club soda was never
empty. In fact, when he saw I was low, instead of whisking away my glass to refill it, he
repeatedly brought a replacement for any near-empty glass. He was friendly, patient, and on the
spot whenever we needed him.
<p>Although the kitchen wasn't terribly busy, it, too, seems efficiently run. Perfectly paced,
courses followed one another with space but not lag. Excusing ourselves from the raw bar, we
shared Caribbean barbecue shrimp steak ($7.25) and oven-roasted jalapenos ($6.95) for starters.
Delightfully, even through we had a good idea of what we'd ordered, there were still some
surprises. The shrimp steak, for instance, turned out to be jumbo shrimp stuffed with horseradish
(there should've been more), basted with a barbecue sauce, lined up and bound together by bacon
so that it resembled a broad plank of shellfish. Unfortunately, the bacon was fatty and
undercooked, but the shrimp were delicious.
<p>The jalapenos were less of a hit. Stuffed with a mixture of crab and crawfish, these five
fresh, fiery devils surrounded a small pile of tortilla chips drizzled with a sweet-and-spicy salsa
and diluted sour cream. The filling lacked any discernible flavor, but the poppers lent just the
right amount of kick.
<p>For the second course, my guest opted for the chef's specialty soup, black bean & crawfish
bisque ($4.25), while I chose a Caribbean Caesar salad ($4.95). While her soup was at once
tangy, creamy and spicy, I thought it oversalted. My guest disagreed. We did agree, however,
that the soup was unusual, unusually good, and unusually good-looking, the bright orange color
of steamed shrimp. My special Caesar was mounded with the sweetest scallops and the tenderest
shrimp and dressed with what tasted like its title: Caesar, with some Caribbean spices.
<p>By entree time, we could only pick and pack for the guy left at home. My friend's Chilean
sea bass ($16.95) came fresh from the saute pan, accompanied by a slightly sweet relish of fresh
roasted corn, tomato and cucumber. I ordered one of the evening's specials, crab cakes with a
tangy remoulade ($19.95), sauteed and rife with great lumps of crab. Both entrees came with
Tio's Bahamian rice, an authentic recreation of what's called "peas and rice" in many of the
islands, and a juicy melange of bok choi, onions and squash.
<p>Dessert choices were two, making it easy. I chose coconut rum pie, which was graciously
light on rum and heavy on chess. My guest loved the dense, creamy Key lime cheesecake that
was the other choice. 
<p>When word of the food and service gets out, Tio Tuna's could become the preferred
night-out spot for employed (because it's not cheap) Fan-ites and parents who still enjoy a night
on the town. We'll see.

<h2><center>December 3, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Introducing Tapas</h2></center>
<h4><center>Chez Foushee takes its cue from Spain, creating the city's first tapas
bar.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>For some of us, fast food is still an oxymoron. Our credo is that food should be an event,
eating an occasion to be relished, whether alone or in good company, not merely fuel to be
consumed while we wait at a traffic light. Richmond offers a growing number of places, beyond
chains and franchises, where good food can be enjoyed in good time and in interesting spaces.
Chez Foushee, which has become a very popular lunch place downtown, is now open in the
evening for a bit of fun and food. 
<p>Tapas bars, in the Spanish tradition (whose late dinner hours are almost as well known as
their paella and arroz con pollo), are as convivial as Irish pubs, providing munchies and more to
tide the hungry over until dinner. Now, Richmond has its very own tapas bar at Chez Foushee. 
What goes into tapas is limited only by lack of imagination, but they are rarely elaborate
concoctions. At their most basic, a bowl of green olives or a basket of good bread and a cruet of
olive oil. But most are a bit more creative, featuring shellfish, sausages, vegetables or
combinations thereof. They are rather like eclectic hors d'oeuvres, and can be ordered alone, or
one right after the other, as whim, appetite or friends dictate. Some folks order a tabletop full. At
Chez Foushee we made a neat and ample supper of several tapas before heading off to the
Carpenter Center for a play. The tapas were a perfect overture, and we were just minutes away
from the theater.
<p>Chez Foushee, whose wonderful exterior suggests an appropriate setting for tapas, is just as
inviting inside with its several rooms and levels. The classy finishes and lighting are dramatic,
and a convivially savvy and cosmopolitan crowd on a Friday night reminded us that places like
this are among the great pleasures of urban life.
<p>In addition to the full-service bar, wine is available, mostly by the glass, as are, of course,
beers. Perhaps someday there will be several interesting sherries to sample and savor. They are
due for rediscovery and new appreciation.
<p>Even though the staff was unprepared for a full house, service moved along. When our
harried waiter dropped a "Voila!" on delivering a bowl of steaming mussels, we elicited that
there was, indeed, a Parisian in our midst, a pleasant twist to the usual.
<p>At present the tapas menu ($2-$6) at Chez Foushee features shellfish -- mussels, shrimp, and
clams -- in several preparations. Other dishes incorporate meatballs (which the menu notes as
Spain's favorite tapas), chorizo sausage, and pork tenderloin. And there are dishes that include
potatoes, mushrooms and cheese. Some obviously lend themselves to sharing more than others,
though we each shamelessly speared communally to the finish.
<p>A dozen mussels in a fragrant saffron-wine broth were deliciously sweet. A half-dozen
griddle-cooked shrimp in the shell with roasted garlic mayonnaise were also succulent. I was
disappointed with "patatas tartara con atun," (potatoes in a puree of tuna, capers and anchovies),
mostly because they were too cold for the flavors to have developed. Warm goat-cheese with
roasted garlic is perfect for sharing and spreading on thin slices of bread. Slices of grilled
chorizo with red peppers could have been better drained of rendered fat and given a heavier dose
of peppers, but the two flavors are good companions.
<p>Evening tapas at Chez Foushee are still in the formative, maybe even experimental stages.
The menu will no doubt be changing as they get a feel for the crowd they're playing to. The
menu now is good but a bit timid. We hope that later versions will be tweaked by success and by
imagination sparked with new confidence. Chez Foushee is a great place to pause if you're
headed out of downtown at the end of the day or if you're headed into the city for an evening on
the town.

<h2><center>August 6, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>A Sturdy Elegance</h2></center>
<h4><center>A crown jewel among restaurants, Lemaire continues to inspire lasting confidence
and trust.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>To sit quietly and reflectively in a plush chair in one of the dining rooms of Lemaire at The
Jefferson would probably be reason enough to be there. The design detail of the room --- done in
the style of sibling 18th-century English designers James and Robert Adam, with mirroring
fireplaces, wonderful molding and quiet elegance --- is increasingly rare these days. It's hard to
believe that all this could have been lost had it not been for the tenacious vision of some who
knew what The Jefferson once was and what she still could become. 
<p>Now, several renovations later, the marvelous public spaces of The Jefferson are rivaled by
only a few hotels in the country. The splendid rooms of Lemaire, some as intimate as a family
dining room, are only a part of the charm of dining there.
<p>Another is the impeccable service. Good service is not rare in restaurants around town, but
service at Lemaire takes the art to another level. The servers are knowledgeable about the menu,
work unobtrusively, and never rush patrons. They are masters at anticipating the needs of their
guests.
<p>Chef Mark Langenfeld, whose training includes work in hotels in America and Switzerland,
has struck a good balance between classic haute cuisine and the lighter, more casual style of food
in the '90s. The use of fresh and local ingredients is true to the spirit of Thomas Jefferson and his
maitre d'hotel, Etienne Lemaire, for whom Lemaire is named. The menu is thus rather traditional
but given fresh and interesting turns throughout. The regular menu is augmented by a printed list
of daily specials and wines by the glass.
<p>The wine list, by the way, is well-chosen. A number of bottles bear The Jefferson's
imprimatur; others are taken from respected Virginia, West Coast, and French vintners. It's a
good list, and many of the wines are at a fair, indeed reasonable, price.
<p>On our recent visit, complimentary hors d' oeuvres (a taste of mahi-mahi on a Vidalia onion
tart) were brought while we waited for our first course. From the half-dozen appetizers
($5.25-$12.75) and as many salads ($4.75-$7.25) and several soups ($3.50-$3.75), we decided
upon the escargots in puff pastry with garlic butter ($7). It was a classic dish in conception and
execution. Leaves of just-wilted spinach and julienne of carrots added bits of fresh color to this
handsome presentation. A special salad ($6.95) of shrimp, papaya, avocado and salad greens,
enhanced with a plum sauce, combined tartness and sweetness with a taste of the sea. It was a
perfect appetizer for a warm summer evening,. The other appetizers and salads are all classics
given a fresh spin.
<p>A baker's dozen entrees ($18-$25) with the daily specials run the gamut of a vegetable and
grain plate to beef Chateaubriand. Between, there are fish, shellfish, duck, chicken, pork and
lamb. 
<p>We chose from the regular menu the crab cakes and from the specials the rack of lamb. Both
were beautifully presented. Traditional sauces, baby vegetables, potatoes in one form or another,
and fresh herbs adorned both plates. The lamb (actually half a rack) was cooked to perfection.
The entrees were, all in all, well balanced. But in playing it safe, nothing was absolutely
stunning either, just very good. 
<p>Dessert choices are presented at table and tend toward the heavy --- cheesecakes, peanut pie,
etc. We ended on a pleasant chocolate chord.
<p>Dinner at Lemaire is indeed special. Given the disparate clientele from around the world that
visits The Jefferson each week, Chef Mark's leaning toward the middle course is wise. Our
evening at Lemaire was certainly satisfying. The Jefferson is a Richmond treasure, and Lemaire
is one of its brightest gems.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>APRIL 16, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>Siam Splendor</H2></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Tracy Tierney</H4></CENTER>

<P>There's a certain group of people for whom enjoying a quiet dinner in a civilized setting is
almost unheard of. They're called parents. But my husband and I recently spent a blissful
evening at Beauregard's Thai Room where the food and setting was enhanced for our being sans
children. Don't get me wrong, we adore our kids, but it had been months since we'd enjoyed a
meal in relative peace.
<P>Since like so many parents our chances to be out alone are limited, so we were pleased to
choose a restaurant where the food was particularly good. But what makes my favorable
impressions a tad surprising`is that I had been to the Thai Room about a year ago, and had not
been terribly impressed. To be fair, I hadn't sampled much of the menu then, and the service on
that particular night was unusually rushed because of the patio's opening.
<P>No chance of dining al fresco at the Thai Room when we recently visited though. Despite
the arrival of spring, the forecast called for April snow. We stayed upstairs in the coziness of the
restaurant's plush dining room which is accented with heavy drapes and muted lighting.
<P>Another key difference between my initial impression of the Thai Room and my follow-up
visit was the service. My husband and I have both waited tables, and often long for an
experienced server. (Beware servers who feel the need to introduce themselves.) Thankfully, our
waiter at the Thai Room was unobtrusive and steeped in knowledge of both the menu and the
wines.
<P>The Thai Room is a bit pricey. The appetizers, in particular, are rather expensive, but huge. I
tackled the Siam Sampler ($7.25) which came with a spring roll, and skewers of grilled chicken,
beef and shrimp. Good choice. The meat was perfectly cooked to a juicy turn and nicely spiced,
and the satay dipping sauces (one peanut-based, the other made from sugar, vinegar and Thai
spices) made interesting accompaniments. My husband's satay beef ($5.25) was a little too pink
for his tastes, so our server promptly whisked it off for a tad more grilling.
<P>There are some other interesting appetizers that we didn't sample, including Yum Pla Meok
(squid salad made with lemongrass, citrus leaf, and onions for $5.95) and Gyow Grob (fried
wontons stuffed with ground shrimp). Because the appetizers are so filling, you may opt to order
two in lieu of an entree, which has become the trend in New York.
<P>A fellow reviewer once said that the best way to assess a restaurant's capabilities is by its
seafood, so we ordered entrees that featured it. Mine was the Goong Pad King for $11.25,
featuring shrimp combined with fresh ginger, onion, straw mushrooms and scallions. It was
beautifully presented -- elegant china plate, decorative red and green garnishes, and a heaping
scoop of rice. It all tasted great, but my dish didn't have the "wow" factor. Maybe if it had been a
bit more assertively seasoned.
<P>My husband's Pla Merk Pad Jub Chai (Squid in Love) for $13.95 was just as delicious, if not
a bit more, maybe because it was a little spicier thanks to the chili paste. The Thai Room seems
to use the freshest ingredients so I think you can't go wrong in any entree choice.
<P>I've heard raves about the fish specials, and that night the Thai Room offered salmon or
striped bass in a Thai chili sauce.
<P>Oddly, some of the dessert choices are quite substantial -- like a dense torte-like chocolate
cake and an Amaretto cheesecake. But my husband managed to struggle through every delicious
bite of cheesecake. 
<P>The Thai Room also offers some interesting "combination specials" big enough to feed two
or three people. For $28.95. for instance, you can order ginger chicken, basil beef, and red curry
shrimp. This might be a good way to sample all the interesting dishes the restaurant serves.
Maybe next time.

<title>STYLE WEEKLY'S RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>JULY 23, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>MI CASA ES SU CASA</H2></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>BRAD BRADLEY</H2></CENTER>
<P>Mi Casa es Su Casa

<P>When the hankering for Mexican grows strong, a trip to Su Casa usually follows.

<P> There are places where the house is as friendly as the food.

<P>by Brad Bradley


<p>Su Casa, a new addition to Richmond's Mexican restaurants, may not be a four-star
restaurant, but every time I leave there I'm glad I came. Everyone serving at this family-owned
casa de cuisine is as warm and friendly as your favorite aunt -- without the wet kiss and headlock
hug.
<p>So every dish isn't a winner. Most are, right down to the beans. Some of the dishes I don't
order reflect personal tastes. Like too much cheese in the quesadilla ($1.95). (Now that's a
complaint you don't hear often.) Others, I believe, are reasonably avoided, like the taquitos
($5.75 for four large ones), which are dry and uninspiring. But I don't think you'll find a better
burrito ($5.25 for two large ones) in town. I recently ordered one with rice and beans and had
plenty left over for two more meals.
<p>Another sign of hospitality is that Su Casa has ignored the habit recently adopted by many
Mexican restaurants of charging for all chips and dip beyond the first offering. Admittedly, I
might have chipped out before the entrees came, but, had I not, I still could have got another
meal out of the burrito-beans-rice platter.
<p>A guest and I overordered on my first visit. After demolishing a basket of chips with
guacamole ($1.95 for a generous scoop), we tried nachos supreme ($5.50). This was a mounded
platter of crispy chips interlaced with cheese, seasoned beef, chicken, lettuce, guacamole, sour
cream and everything else Mexican. Most notable was the fact that everything wasn't just
glopped on top but layered among the chips.
<p>Foolishly, for we were already bulging over our belts, we ordered the special Su Casa for
two ($10.25). If we hadn't eaten anything else, this platter would've been plenty as a full meal
for both of us. It wasn't the prettiest dish I'd ever seen. In fact, it looked like a platter of melted
cheese. But underneath we found a spicy enchilada, a crunchy taco with fresh, crispy lettuce,
that bountiful, tangy burrito, and the overcheesed quesadilla. If that weren't enough, there also
came a chile relleno spilling sharp melted cheese and a flauta, a crisply fried, rolled tortilla with
nice, thick shreds of white chicken meat. The flauta, as well as the burrito, are dishes I'd order
here over and over again. And I mustn't forget the thick puddle of creamy, cheese-topped beans
and freshly made spiced rice. When you consider that the Su Casa special makes a full meal for
two, it's a darned good deal.
<p>All the while -- and we're talking a lengthy meal -- our server, as well as other servers,
acknowledged us in one way or another, either to see if we needed anything or just to ask if we
were enjoying our food. In addition to serving us, the helpers were delightful, friendly, and
happy to have us. That set the atmosphere for an overall good dining experience. 
<p>I'd rather go to a restaurant where there are a few very good dishes (how many can you eat at
one sitting, anyway?) and the staff makes me feel welcome, than go to a place where everything
is good but the staff treats me like a door. I can cook. Why not stay home, where I know people
are glad I'm there (most of the time)?
<p>I continue to go back when I get the hankering for Mexican, as much for the welcoming
atmosphere as for the food. In fact, the last time I went, as we were leaving, the papacita stopped
us at the door while he reached behind the cash register and drew out a fistful of minicandy bars.
He gave some to each of us, with a hearty thanks for our business. What a place. It made me
think: Why should anyone settle for less? It's nice to know there are places where the house is as
friendly as the food. Su Casa is one of those.

<h2><center>August 13, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>The Italian Experience</h2></center>
<h2><center>Arabella Bryant</h2></center>
<H4><CENTER>The pesce del giorno was a grilled tuna, cooked just beyond transparency and
served with sweet and sour onions.</H4></CENTER>


<P>What's most unusual about Azzurro, at first glance, is its interior. A brick oven with its
gargantuan and colorful mosaic-tiled sun is an eye-catcher. An ample bar, miniature recessed
lights against a midnight blue ceiling, comfortably arranged tables, and a fireplace leftover from
the glory days of The Butlery all combine to offer a very Italian dining experience.
<P>The menu is decidedly unfrilly, a nice New York touch and a stark contrast to the
restaurant's richly detailed, rather modern interior. It's written in Italian with miniature English
subtitles.
<P>My dinner companions were on strict orders to starve all day in anticipation of a big night
out. The antipastis we ordered included the grigliata di verdura con aglio e olio ($8.50), which
roughly translates into grilled veggies with garlic olive oil. Superb in its simplicity, the appetizer
included fresh grilled squash, endive, eggplant, fennel, radicchio, plum tomatoes and pepper, all
grilled and seasoned to perfection. I topped my portion with a healthy dose of balsamic vinegar
and thought I'd gone to heaven. 
<P>We also ordered the carpaccio del giorno ($8.95) -- or the carpaccio of the day with a salad
of baby artichokes. Another winner. The beef carpaccio was layered, sitting on a bed of lightly
dressed mixed greens and with just enough artichoke hearts to make it all the more interesting.
To round out the course, we chose the cozze al vino bianco ($8.95), or fresh mussels steamed in
white wine with garlic and oregano. Minutes after we placed the order, our waiter arrived at the
table to let us know the chef was "not pleased with the mussels." Would we mind if he
substituted clams? No problem. The switch proved quite favorable.
<P>Since risotto is a signature Azzuro dish, we included it on our list. It was quite good -- this
evening's risotto Azzurro ($16.95) came stuffed with eggplant and topped with ricotta insalata.
Our third course consisted of a pasta and we ordered what we were told was one of the more
popular pasta  dishes -- ravioli con porcini, or ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach in a cream
and porcini mushroom sauce ($14.95). Much too rich for our blood, but quite good nonetheless.  
Our secondi piatti -- or what we ordered as our main course -- came in the form of two specials.
First came the veal genovese ($17.95). The veal, a scallopini, was cooked just right --  sauted
and alternately layered with pesto and fresh mozzarella. Second, the pesce del giorno (fish of the
day) was a grilled tuna ($22.50) cooked just beyond transparency and served with sweet and
sour onions. It was heavenly, and huge. Both the veal and the tuna arrived with accompanying
vegetables, including a chunk of broccoli and a potato croquette. Our waiter explained that this
side dish is, basically, mashed potatoes, with seasonings and ham blended and breaded and fried
into a small log of a side dish. 
<P>On other visits, I've sampled the fettucini con caprino -- fettuccini with cherry tomatoes,
goat cheese and herbs ($12.50), trennete verde al gorgonzola -- spinach linguini with a
gorgonzola cream sauce ($11.25) and pollo palermo -- boneless chicken with chunks of sweet
sausage, fresh rosemary and mushrooms in a chardonnay ($14.95). The veal is particularly good
at Azzurro, as are the risotto specials. 
<P>The sorbets are another signature dish here, and they shouldn't be missed.  The peach sorbet,
for instance, is presented in the shell of a peach. 
<P>Azzurro, located in the River Road Shopping Center, is an easy and convenient place to find
excellent Italian cuisine. Soon, the restaurant's new brick patio will invite dining al fresco.
<P>Anyone who's interested in well-proportioned and creatively prepared and presented food is
bound to find many selections that please at this upscale, rather cosmopolitan destination.

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>

<h2><center>Coastal Cuisine</h2></center>
<h4><center>We tried the trademarked "Rockefeller Skillet," a version of oysters Rockefeller
served in a 6-inch cast-iron skillet.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>The Blue Marlin has splashed into town and emptied the cattle out of the corral to do it. The
fifth length in a short chain and first in Richmond, this seafood establishment from the Carolinas
has taken over the space previously occupied by T.C. West, which featured beef. The Blue
Marlin takes its inspiration from South Carolina's low country. 
<p>That area's culinary heritage is rich -- by the 18th century, a diverse cultural mix from
Europe and Africa, in addition to the plentiful indigenous offerings from the sea and the low
country. It's one of our country's most interesting cuisines, and it hasn't been promoted, or
exploited, as the Cajun/Creole scene has been. Blue Marlin only skims the surface.
<p>On a Saturday night with a full house and a waiting line, a staff person tells us it's "slow."
The word must be out. The space has been steered from its beefy days as chop house with a
black and white Holstein decor and wonderful appointments into the neutral zone -- it's now
mostly beige and black without any real focal points.
<p>Our service was rather erratic. Just at the point of thinking that either the computer or the
waiter had lost our table, servers arrived with the salad. But we ordered appetizers. Our waiter
eventually stopped by to say that our appetizers would be out shortly and, then, our salad. 
<p>There are five starters ($3.95-$6.95). We skipped the shrimp cocktail, "grit skillet," and
stuffed jalape¤o peppers to try the trademarked "Rockefeller Skillet," a version of oysters
Rockefeller, served in a 6-inch cast-iron skillet with the oysters topped with creamy spinach. It's
a heavy version of a delicate New Orleans classic, and the oysters get smothered. The gumbo,
another classic from Louisiana's low country, was somewhat disappointing. The promising
deep-brown color of a good roux did not yield complex tastes, nor did the other discernible
components (chicken, rice and okra) of this generic gumbo yield much flavor.
<p>Salad comes family-style in a bowl for the table, a nice idea also practiced by the Blue
Marlin's predecessor. The problem is that it's an  unimaginative iceberg-based salad topped with
bland salad dressing. (Another bowl a few days later suggested the problem is not merely a
careless server dipping the dressing from the top without stirring.)
<p>The entrees ($7.95-$14.95) are divided among "Low Country Favorites," fish, pasta and
meat dishes. We were eager to try the signature dish, Shrimp and Grits, which also includes
sausage and a cream-style tasso gravy (used in many of Blue Marlin's dishes). Carolina friends
had introduced us some time ago to their version of this dish, which they serve for breakfast at
the beach. With some slices of late-July tomatoes and a couple of hot biscuits, breakfast doesn't
get much better. This is comfort food, and Blue Marlin's version fits the bill.
<p>Most of the fish preparations are grilled or "Cajun" -- salmon, mahi-mahi, swordfish, or
fried, trademarked "Firecracker Flounder" and catfish. A small grilled swordfish, moistened with
a flavorful broth, is cooked just right, but the accompanying grits with gravy and melange of
vegetables are lacking texture. The complimentary bowl of collards that arrives adds texture and
flavor.
<p>Key Lime pie has become as ubiquitous as sticky chocolate desserts. And cobblers are warm
on the trail. The Key Lime pie and cobbler were good, but the chocolate thing (a brownie, I
believe) was work in progress, perhaps.
<p>Blue Marlin has quickly found an audience. In going for wide appeal, it has rounded off the
edges. Except for grits, collards and tasso gravy, there's very little to distinguish it from dozens
of other restaurants. The "low country" has been somewhat lost in the making. We'll have to wait
for hoppin' John, dirty rice, deviled crab and corn dodgers, to name but a few.

<h2><center>July 2, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Here's the Beef</h2></center>
<h4><center>You'll never hear anyone say "Where's the beef?" when at
Buckhead's.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Brad Bradley</h4></center>

<p>It's hard to say what we like best about Buckhead's. It serves top quality meats. And it's an
accurate reminiscence of turn-of-the-century New York chophouses: checkered tablecloths, dark
woods, highbacked booths, and long-aproned, convivial waiters, professional and friendly but
not too cheeky. (In fact, the only complaint our group had was that none of the four cigar boxes
in the men's room held any cigars. As problems go, this doesn't even make my list.)
<p>We came hungry and ordered accordingly. Don't repeat our mistake. Everything -- from
appetizers to sides -- comes in Hulk Hogan portions. If the three of us had ordered for two, we'd
have left satisfied instead of stuffed. Instead, so much food was left over that we were too
embarrassed to leave with it. 
<p>Our first blunder was ordering Portabella mushrooms ($8.95), onion rings ($5.95) and a cup
of lobster bisque ($3.95) for appetizers. Although they were a little on the dry side, the two
saucer-sized mushrooms lived up to the Portabella promise of tasting like steak. The lobster
bisque was far short of sensational, with barely detectable flavor and too little meat. But the
inch-thick, crispy onion rings -- even at $5.95 -- were on the money.
<p>Entrees come with a choice of mixed green salad or Caesars. We all chose the latter and
agreed that they were too salty. Croutons were fresh and crunchy, but the generous shreds of
Parmesan, we suspect, contributed to the saltiness.
<p>By the time entrees arrived, we were wondering what to do with them. The large filet
($26.95) must've come from the head of the herd. Six lamb chops ($28) might as well have been
a double rack. Even the two crab cakes ($24.50), though light and lumpy, surely cost a lot of
crabs their lives. I'm not complaining. The tariff, you note, isn't small. You get what you pay for,
and here it's quality <b>and</b> quantity. Broccoli being the vegetable that night, we were also
amazed at the half-head on each of our plates, bright green and otherwise naked. That I could've
done without. But the hash browns -- essentially a potato pancake with chunks of potato and
onion bound with sour cream -- are as consistently wonderful as Buckhead's onion rings.
<p>Having established that the large filet was indeed large, it's important to note that none of the
flavor was sacrificed for size. Thick and tender, it took all three of us to finish. The lamb chops
were thick and perfectly done just past the point of pumping blood. In my estimation, the price
of the crab cakes warrants lump and only lump. Giant lumps, in fact. The cakes were meaty
enough, tasty enough, and large enough. For a sea-lover, the best crab is the least seasoned. It
can't be plain enough for me, and these were carefully seasoned just a hint more than au natural.
If all this wasn't enough, I had ordered a side of creamed spinach ($4.95), having declared it on
several past occasions the best spinach dish on the planet.
<p>Yes, it's true, we did order two desserts. One of our group asked for  cheesecake a la mode
($3.50 cheesecake; $1.50 extra a la mode), and our waiter served it without so much as a smirk.
The profiteroles ($4.95) were large puffs of pastry filled with vanilla ice cream and topped
generously with thick, creamy fudge sauce. Somehow, we managed to put a good-sized dent in
it.
<p>Is it possible that high mark-up can still equate to good value for the diner? I think so. At
least in this case. There's no prep, no mess, no clean-up for the diner. And if you should
over-order, you've got another meal, upping the value again.

</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>December 31, 1996</H2></center>
<H2><CENTER>LAGENFIELD ARRIVES</H2></center>
<h4><center>With Chef Mark Lagenfeld at the helm, du Jour polishes its routine</h4></center>


<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>


<p>You've read stories of those indefatigable chefs who arise before daybreak and head for the
markets to buy the freshest and best of the days's offering in order to build their menus for the
day. They're nice stories but perhaps more often true in the past than now. Today, the world is
one big market, and if you're willing to pay, you can have it overnight, guaranteed.
<p>It was a notion of fashioning the seasonal best onto an ever-changing menu that was the
inspiration for the little West End bistro du Jour when it opened a dozen years ago. And it
remains so. Each Thursday brings a new menu. Though its name might suggest that the food is
French, du Jour has always leaned more toward California for its inspiration. Rather than
signature dishes, du Jour has defined itself with its style of cooking -- fresh seasonal ingredients,
lighter sauces, and pleasant but unexpected pairings.
<p>Some cooks find combinations, methods and recipes that work, and they are content to do it
that way endlessly. Others are happier to experiment, to change, to try new combinations. It is
obviously the latter who are attracted to du Jour -- not only those who stand at the stove and
cook but also those who sit at the tables and eat.
<p>It must have been one of the reasons that Mark Lagenfeld, formerly executive chef at
Lemaire at The Jefferson Hotel, joined the ranks at du Jour as executive chef, with Paula Malone
backing him up as sous-chef. We found on a recent visit that his presence has resulted more in
refinement than major changes.
<p>We were delighted to find once more that du Jour is wine friendly, offering a number of
interesting bottles of wines at reasonable prices so that you can complement your dinner with a
decent wine without wrecking the budget. 
<p>You may have as much trouble as we did deciding among the four appetizers and four salads
($3.50-$6.25). A hearty garbanzo-bean-and-sausage soup was perfect for a winter night, and
seared venison with a fresh but fruity version of traditional Cumberland sauce was also a good
beginning. Choosing those starters over seafood ravioli or a salad of smoked salmon with fennel,
winter greens, and roasted pepper and garlic sauce was not easy.
<p>Nor was choosing the seafood du Jour from the other five regular entrees ($16.50-$21.00),
which included seafood, fish, beef, duck and chicken. A potato-encrusted salmon filet sat on a
bed of herb-simmered lentils for the seafood du Jour. The salmon and lentils were wonderful
complements, and a dice of al dente vegetables and mashed potatoes added to the mix. (After
being banned for many years, really good mashed potatoes are everywhere again.)
<p>There's also a category called Lighter Fare ($12.95-$16), which includes four
interesting-but-not-quite-so-substantial dishes. From these offerings, baked polenta Parmesan
and stuffed eggplant, appetizing as it sounded, didn't meld into expectations. The polenta had
lost its creaminess, and the eggplant had not lost its rawness; its dicey stuffing was too much like
the diced vegetables that sat beside it. It's gone from the menu now, but the dish may reappear
transformed into a moistly lovable plat du Jour, mais oui. I'd try it again.
<p>This is not a restaurant to dismiss dessert. There are plenty of other eateries where you
should ask for the check instead. But here a few of the half-dozen will probably tempt you.
Warm chocolate bread pudding might have been better with a warm puddle of creme anglaise
beside it, but I don't know if I could improve much on warm apple-cranberry cobbler with an
artful squeeze of whipped cream.
<p>Those who go to du Jour for the first time are sometimes surprised by the lack of pretension
and the casual ambience. On a busy night, close tables seem even closer, but even that adds to
the experience. du Jour continues to evolve nicely, sending some very interesting meals to table.

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>
</head>
<h2><center>January 14, 1997</h2></center>
<h2><center>Ole</h2></center> 
<h4><center>Funky Cancun features a tamale surrounded by chips, chicken, beef, beans and
rice.</h4></center>

<h2><center>by Davis Morton</h2></center>

<p>The way we assimilate "foreign" foods into our eating habits is fascinating, and the process
has accelerated in the past two decades, partially because we're more aware of ethnic foods and
they are more readily available. Pizza and pasta are probably more frequently on American
tables these days than apple pie. Chili and tacos are not far behind.
<p>With more than a dozen locally owned Mexican restaurants around town, it's clear that the
influence of Mexican cooking has moved well beyond the American Southwest. In fact, it's
unusual to find a restaurant with any claims to a contemporary cuisine which doesn't show
influence from the Southwest or farther south. If basil was the herb of the '80s, cilantro can lay
claim to that honor for the '90s. The flavors of chiles and other peppers are ending up on tops of
steaks, and practically anything may be wrapped in a tortilla. They're fast becoming just part of
what we eat, no longer "foreign." 
<p>After a surfeit of holiday feasting, it was time for palate cleansing, and as I settled down to a
platter of fajitas, I realized that these familiar flavors and the sizzling sound of the skillet are as
comforting as the smell and taste of good pizza and maybe even apple pie.
<p>This little epiphany occurred at El Matador, located in a space that's been serving Mexican
food for a long time. The team now running the restaurant is the granddaughter of the original
owners and her husband. They're bringing new enthusiasm to the space which began life as a
fast-food restaurant. Familiar layouts and furnishings remain, but the restaurant has been
humanized and personalized, and, if not cozy, it's comfortable.
<p>A recent, attractive change is the design of the menu. All the offerings are clearly described,
with a neat little flap with definitions and pronunciations of menu items, helpful and fun for a
family. The menu includes several meals for children ($2.95). Rather than decide among
infinitesimal combinations, an "Adventure Combo" lets the diner configure his own sampler.
But before you settle in with the menu, a basket of warm tortilla chips and a chunky,
fresh-tasting salsa with fresh cilantro and a nice kick arrives at the table. There are a half-dozen
choices of Mexican beer and as many gringo varieties, as well as other stuff to chill the heat.
<p>El Matador's menu isn't noticeably different from those of other Mexican eateries. The main
dishes ($4.25-$10.50) cover familiar territory: fajitas, burritos, enchiladas, and another dozen or
so which feature meat, chicken, shrimp with corn or flour tortilla. Most come with rice, refried
beans, salad or other traditional accompaniments.
<p>The fajitas platter that I chose -- "parrilla grande" ($9.95) --is dubbed a specialty. In fact, it
was a heaping platter filled with savory slices of beef and chicken breast, shrimp, onions and
green pepper, accompanied with another plate with refried beans, Spanish rice, guacamole salad,
sour cream, and, on the side, a covered package of warm tortillas. In short, a big meal! Our other
entree, fancifully named "Funky Cancun" ($6.25), features a tamale surrounded by chips,
chicken, and beef on one side and beans and rice on the other, two taquitos (rolled, cigar-shaped
tortillas filled with meat or chicken and fried), and the other usual accompaniments. Funky
maybe; good value certainly; good tasting for sure. 
<p>The menu designates a dozen entrees that can be prepared as vegetarian, and dishes that are
particularly spicy, hot and flavorful are marked graphically with red peppers.
<p>If you're still game for dessert, I'd recommend the flan ($1.95), really a caramel custard. I've
paid a lot more for versions almost as good.
<p>El Matador probably won't win awards for the originality of its offerings (though the menu
design is a winner) or for the opulence of its ambience, but it will win friends with its honest
food and the good values. The friendly and obliging service is another plus.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>JANUARY 9, 1996</H2></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>The Hooters Way</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>by Tracy Tierney</H2></CENTER>    

<p>Believe it or not, Hooters caters to tots and teens.

<p>There's a stack of high chairs available, and drinks for the little ones are served in plastic foam cups.

<p>Ever since it opened, Hooters has been a hot topic. But not for its food. So I was game to do a review when asked. (It is a restaurant, after all.)
Trouble was, I couldn't think of who to bring along. Then I decided that any restaurant that called itself Hooters was adolescent enough to be reviewed by just that -- adolescents. I enlisted my 15-year-old and his friends, thinking they might shed a little light for me on the Hooters mystique.
<p>Just to be on the safe side, I called ahead to see if they welcome kids. They do. In fact, I got the distinct feeling from my phone conversation that Hooters considers itself "family friendly," so I didn't worry about our toddler tagging along.
<p>As it turns out, Hooters does indeed cater to a younger crowd. There's a stack of high chairs available, and drinks for the little ones are served in plastic foam cups. The menu even features hot dogs, a perennial fave among the smaller set.
<p>But signs like "Caution Blondes Thinking," "Caution Hooters at Play," and "High Levels of Hydrogen Peroxide in the Air" and waitresses dressed like something from "Valley of the Dolls" suggest that this is not a place for them, or for me.
<p>I was less distressed about our waitress' attire -- a low-cut, tight t-shirt and shorts -- than my companions, who averted their eyes each time she leaned over the table. I think they were a little embarrassed for her, and at one point even wondered aloud if wearing that outfit made her feel a little, well, demeaned.
<p>For myself, I didn't find her clothing much more revealing than Peg Bundy's, or what you see occasionally on a big-city street. Mostly, I came away from Hooters feeling that way I do with anything that tries to be shocking: bored and a little depressed.
<p>As for the food, Hooters doesn't pretend to be a gourmet restaurant, and most of the menu falls into the sandwich, salad and seafood category. We dove into a delicious order of chicken wings served in a mild sauce (also available in medium, hot, and Three Mile Island) that were lightly battered and much more tasty than what I've found at other fast food restaurants. The wings came with the usual suspects: celery sticks and a sealed plastic tub of Naturally Fresh blue cheese.
<p>I have to confess I was confused by the menu (more of that Hooters humor, I guess) that lists fried oysters for $75. Could I order them? I wondered, and our waitress looked momentarily confused. She told me no one had ever asked. I guess the high price persuades customer's to settle for the oysters on the halfshell ($6.95 for a dozen, $4.95 for a half) or roasted at two priced, $8.95 and $15.95.
<p>There's also steamed shrimp (half pound for $8.95), crab legs (25 ounces for $15.95) and a seafood sampler plate ($14.95) that includes shrimp, seafood salad and wings.
<p>The Philly Cheese steak sandwich beckoned, even though it can be tough to do well. Hooters made a heroic attempt by using a crusty roll and decent grade of meat, then topping it with sauteed onions, mushrooms, green peppers, and cheese. But the peppers could have used a few more minutes on the grill.
<p>I wasn't about to tell the chefs though. The dining are is adjacent to the kitchen, and you can watch the waitress post the orders and your food being prepared. Shortly into our meal, I could hear the cooks yelling, which they proceeded to do during the entire lunch. "Something wrong?" I asked. No, said our waitress, they do it all the time. It's just part of the Hooters experience.
<p>The rest of our party ordered a grilled chicken sandwich ($5.95), which won raves for the meat and lesser marks for a soggy bun and came with good baked beans; a "gourmet" hot dog plate ($3.50) featuring a juicy jumbo wiener and freshly prepared fries that came salted and peppered, and a grilled cheese ($3.60).
<p>We could have also chosen among several salads, including a grilled chicken breast ($5.95), chef ($5.50), a pasta salad ($3.95, with grilled chicken or shrimp $5.95) and a seafood salad ($4.95).
<p>Be forewarned that there's a lot of insider jokes on the menu, such as the "Gourmet Chicken Wing Dinner" for those who "want their wings naked" is $111.11 and features 20 wings plus a bottle of Dom Perignon.
<p>Our biggest quibble with the menu was that Hooters serves no dessert. But apart from our kiddie party, I doubt if the other patrons (mostly men) minded the omission.
<p>As for the service at Hooters, our waitress was excellent, making a real effort to keep our toddler comfortable and happy. When we were ready to leave, I gave her an extra-large tip because of her efficiency and courtesy, which is what waitressing is all about.

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>
</head>
<h2><center>September 24, 1996</h2></center> 
<h2><center>My Jewish Mom</h2></center>
<h4><center>The Jewish Mother makes a new home in Richmond. </h4></center>
<h4><center>by Brad Bradley</h4></center>

<p>Sometimes the need for serious deli food can overwhelm even the most primal urges. My
first choice is always New York Deli in Carytown, where the food is the real thing, and it's
served with the right dose of chutzpah. (We're here. We're in a hurry. What do you want?)
Having tried the original Jewish Mother in Virginia Beach many moons ago, though, it seemed
right to give the newish Jewish Mother in Quioccasin Station a shot.
<p>A Tuesday night found the comfortably cavernous place moderately filled with diners and
noshers. With its brash, cheerful decor, large tables, graffitoed walls, and a newsprint menu that
begs for crayon assault, I was surprised that there were no children, only suburban middle-agers.
<p>Service was quick and friendly. In fact, when we ordered both Mamacita's guacamole
($6.50) and a side order of seasoned chips with ranch dressing ($5.50), our waitress offered to
simply bring a cup of the dressing with the guacamole order, as that would bring everything on
both orders without doubling the cost. Good thing. Even though the guacamole was a generous
cupful, the price is steep, considering we're talking basically chips and dip. While the guacamole
was creamy, it did nothing to complement the chips. And vice versa. The ranch was a more
likable complement.
<p>The six-page menu offered numerous selections under various headings. I felt obligated to
try the chicken soup ($1.95 cup/$2.95 bowl) and, to be honest, it tasted homemade. My friend's
borscht ($1.25 cup/$2.25 bowl) was sweet and icy, made creamy with a generous glop of sour
cream.
<p>We skipped the quiches (under the heading "Mother's" French Relations) as well as
"Mother's" Delicious Crepes. We even skipped the menu's suggestion to ask about Mom's Heart
Smart & Dinner Entrees, preferring the real deli experience. Being something of a Reuben
aficionado, I requested "Mother's Son Reuben" ($6.25). I realize I'm speaking for a small
segment of the population when I express disappointment at the leanness of the meat and the
toasted-not-grilled, butter-free bread. The grease quotient was nada, making for a healthy but not
so tasty sandwich. I even thought the sauerkraut could've used a little more punch. But I knew I
was all the better for the lack of fat. 
<p>My friend chose from the list of pita sandwiches the Pita Cajun Style ($6.65), which was a
pita stuffed with cold seafood salad. She loved the salad of crab and shrimp, but she noted that
the single leaf of curly lettuce didn't save the pita from becoming soggy. Both of us chose potato
salad as our side rather than cole slaw, macaroni salad or potato chips. Like the guacamole, it
was almost too cold to eat, but it was sweet and creamy with tiny ribbons of shredded carrot for
color.
<p>There are more than 30 choices for dessert, all displayed enticingly in a glass case at the
door. None appear to be made onsite, but all looked rich and creative. We chose Heath Bar
crunch pie and caramel pecan fudge cake. Both were jarringly sweet, and the only thing that held
us back was our diminishing capacity to pack anything else into our stomachs. Both were a
sweet-tooth's dream.
<p>To spur digestion, we each added cafe mocha java ($1.95) as a meal-ender. Billed as
espresso with hot chocolate, it seemed low on both, tasting more like sweetened cafe au lait.
<p>The Jewish Mother is neither an authentic deli, nor is it a full-fledged family joint. With
good quality product and broad-ranging choices, The Jewish Mother could be much more. It has
everything needed to be a great family place. But its lengthy menu contains only three kids'
choices. My friend's teen-age daughter says The Jewish Mother is a favorite among her age
group. And it's the kind of place families with young children could love. In the meantime,
though, you can love it for what it is. Pretty good food in a relaxed atmosphere.

<title>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER> APRIL 9, 1996</H2></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>A Trip to Mexico</H2></CENTER>

Mexico Restaurant has a loyal following of beer-loving, nacho-crunching fans.


by Brad Bradley

We had a real winter this year. Snow. Cold. Snow. Snow. When I get the cold weather blues, my
doctor (my make-believe doctor; the one who used to write my sick slips for school) prescribes
beer, salsa and chips. So with that Rx, I headed for Horsepen Road, where I'd always been
successful in conjuring the summer mode at either of two Mexican restaurants.
<p>That Leap Day evening, I took my friend Stan(dby) to Mexico for what I told him would be
a terrific meal. I'd already made two snow visits and had come away thinking I'd gone to burrito
heaven. This trip and a later dinner visit  would prove less eventful.
<p>When we arrived, we reluctantly agreed to be seated in a very bright room. Crisp, warm
chips and tangy, fiery salsa with enough fresh cilantro to taste appeared immediately. For drinks,
Stan chose Corona from a list of more than 20 beers. We hummed through a basket of chips and
salsa so, for our second basket, we asked for some guacamole. That brought a monkey dish of
creamy spread, about the size of a scoop of ice cream. Delicious. 
<P>Stan thought it only fair we order nachos, and why skimp? Nachos Supreme it was for
$5.75. The menu promised corn chips with melted cheese, beef, chicken and beans, covered with
shredded lettuce, tomatoes and sour cream. There were plenty of chips, but everything else came
in measured proportions. The melted cheese was watered down, and we'd had that in Mexican
restaurants before, not that we've particularly liked it. The soupy version renders chips limp
every time. Service was expedient. So the water kept coming and, when a beer wasn't cold
enough, our waitress quickly replaced it with a cooler one.
<P>The menu is quite extensive. You can choose from any number of combination dinners, or
go a la carte. Either way, this place won't bust your wallet. There are 13 "Specialties of the
House," 25 combination dinners, seven steak variations, 15 chicken choices and seven vegetarian
dishes. Even fajitas have their own category, with six variations. If you're coming for lunch,
you'll find 18 special choices, all under $5. 
<P>Stan went for fajitas Texanas, which came as a sizzling sprinkling of shrimp, beef and
chicken atop a mound of bell peppers, onions and tomatoes. The seafood and meats were
overcooked. Alongside, however, were deliciously creamy fried beans, Spanish rice, lettuce with
a dab of guacamole and three flour tortillas.
<P>Stan couldn't eat it all, but he thought it good enough to take home. I couldn't say the same
about mine. My special dinner, as it's listed on the menu, brought an enchilada, a tamale, a
chalupa, a taco and a chile relleno. It looked like a platter of tomato sauce topped with melted
cheese. Further investigation revealed a naked green pepper that bled hardly any cheese when
pierced.
<P>The taco lived up to expectations. The chalupa was indistinguishable, and the enchilada only
passable. The real disappointment was the tamale. I dug to find the meat filling but, if there was
any, it was disguised as cornmeal. I picked and nibbled but wasn't terribly inspired to go further.
A later visit was more satisfactory. We skipped the nachos and stuck with the guacamole. The
bean-filled burrito was quite good. The chile relleno was even better. The pepper itself was
piquant, and there was plenty of cheese both inside and on top. 
<P>For dessert, we ordered a ChocoTaco and fried ice cream. I should've recognized the
ChocoTaco moniker before it came, fresh out of the wrapper. My neighborhood Chinese market
sells ChocoTacos out of their ice cream case, right alongside the popsicles. They are, you see,
Nutty Buddys in the shape of tacos.

<h2><center>October 1, 1996 </h2></center>
<h2><center>Long Live Monte </h2></center>
<h4><center>It's the little Italian trattoria that just keeps on ticking.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>A half-dozen popular Italian eateries around Richmond seem almost as eternal as Rome. I
don't know which of them is the oldest, but Julian's, the Venice, Robin Inn, the Italian Kitchen,
Italian Kitchen West, and Monte Calvo's (the last three all in the Monte Calvo family) have been
serving up their versions of Italian food for a long time. Their menus are probably as close to the
American mainstream at this point as they are to their Italian origins, but food and cultures
evolve, and these restaurants have found their winning combinations and loyal followings.
<p>One of them, Monte Calvo's, has been on the scene for 30 years -- 20 at its former location
on Patterson and now for 10 years at the "new" spot just off Staples Mill. We were overdue to
pay a call and check out this longstanding Richmond trattoria.
<p>Europeans, by the way, make a more formal distinction in eateries than we do. An American
fast-food spot may use the term restaurant as casually as a fine dining spot. One expects more of
a ristorante in Italy, for instance, than one might of a trattoria, where the atmosphere is more
casual, the menu not as ambitious, and the prices probably not as steep, though one might have a
superior experience, even more interesting food at these humbler haunts.
<p>Even though Monte Calvo's is in a relatively new building, it manages to have something of
an old-fashioned feel. It's casual, reasonably comfortable, with a bit of ersatz decoration that's
homespun and appropriate. A sizable chunk of Calvo's customers are probably loyalists who
know exactly what they're going to order before they get there -- part of the trattoria tradition. It
is consistency, rather than menu changes, drop-dead decor and hot new chefs, that keeps the
doors of the likes of Monte Calvo's open.
<p>If you want to have a glass or two of wine, go for the house offerings. The wine list is
generic, not naming vintner or vintage. Ordering merlot or "Chianti Classico Reserva" may bring
an interesting surprise. All are under $20 for a bottle, half that for a house carafe of Chianti.
<p>We decided to forego sampling any of the nine seafood and mushroom appetizers
($3.75-$6.75) and order the antipasto plate ($4.25). As these plates have evolved in
Italian-American eateries, they are really a deluxe salad, and such was the case at Monte Calvo's.
A couple of slices of mortadella, ham, and provolone are tucked around an iceberg and vegetable
salad, doused with too liberal a dose of vinaigrette.
<p>Rumors are that the pizzas ($7.25-$11.75) at Monte Calvo's are rather good. They're
traditional -- no designer stuff here, though the menu says that white pizza is available.
<p>There are almost 40 pasta dishes -- 20 of them spaghetti in various sauces ($6.00-$11.50),
another nine of fettucini in Alfredo sauce with as many augmentations ($8.25-$12.75), the usual
stuffed pastas ($7.50-$8.25), and assorted pastas with meat sauce ($7.25).
<p>The entrees are led by a dozen veal dishes ($9.75-$13.75), ranging from a simple breaded
cutlet to Tony's special which includes a topping of seafood. There are also entrees that feature
shellfish, beef, chicken, halibut and sausage. All are served with spaghetti topped with the house
tomato-meat sauce, a standard but pleasant version. Our server told us that the most popular
dishes are the veal and chicken parmigiana.
<p>An order of spaghetti with garlic, olive oil and spinach was short of garlic and long on oil
for our tastes, but the fresh spinach was plentiful and tender. Veal francese, scaloppini with
mushrooms in a lemon sauce, was skillfully executed but suffered, too, from an overzealous
pour from the oil can.
<p>Desserts like spumoni and cheesecake are heavy conclusions; a cup of coffee is, perhaps, a
more judicious choice. 
<p>Monte Calvo's serves up copious plates of hearty food and, like the proverbial battery, just
keeps going and going ...

<p> Regulars love the wine and pasta they find at Sal Federico's.

<p>Emilio, the Amalfi-born chef, greeted guests at their tables all night long.

<p>The attention given to the so-called "Mediterranean Diet" recently has sparked a renewed interest in the fare of southern Italy. Health professionals tell us that dishes made with tomatoes, olive oil and garlic are good for us. And what luck: Most of us count pasta, pizza and pesto sauce among our favorites foods. 
<p>Until this trend toward the cuisine of the Mediterranean began several years ago, southern Italian food was often very badly done in American restaurants. In fact, most Baby Boomers grew up thinking Italian food consisted of insipid spaghetti and meatballs, pizza topped with oily, industrial-type sliced mozzarella and rubbery lasagna made with hamburger and acidic tomato sauce. Actually, such stuff bears no resemblance to the real thing eaten in Naples, Amalfi and Capri, as anyone who's done the Grand Tour will tell you. But how many of us can satisfy a craving for good pasta by buying a ticket from Alitalia? 
<p>The next best thing is to venture over to Staples Mill Road, to Sal Federico's. Sal's serves robust fare made with quality ingredients. But the food is only one reason this place is so popular; another is atmosphere. It's a warm and friendly place run by a proprietor who clearly loves his work.
<p>My husband and I dined at Sal's one cold, snowy weeknight recently and found the place half full; a good showing on a night when those without four-wheel drive simply stayed home. Sal's has diehard regulars, no question about it. And we understood why from the moment we stepped inside. 
<p>We were greeted by a pleasant hostess, who gave us a choice among several tables and booths. I was happy already. The room is modest, but each table is spread with a peach tablecloth and lit with a candle, so there's a wonderfully soft glow cast about. We noticed lots of diners table-hopping, speaking to friends at other tables. The clientele included couples of all ages, families with children, and several girls-night-out groups. 
<p>I find that southern Italian food served in America tends to be a little richer and heavier than that prepared in Italy and Sal's fare is no exception. It's prepared with the American palate in mind, but no matter. It's among the best in the city and can rival the top spots in New York's Little Italy.
<p>Caesar salads are very trendy and can be very badly done. But I adore a good Caesar, and was anxious to see what an Italian chef would do with an American invention. The answer: an exceptional melange ACCENT OVER THE FIRST E of fresh hearts of romaine swathed in a spicy, creamy dressing. Homemade garlicky croutons made this starter positively addictive. Mussels Marinara were pleasant, too. Small, sweet mussels are served in a big bowl of tangy, homemade marinara sauce which was so good, we sopped up every luscious drop with bread. House salads are made with iceberg lettuce, and perked up considerably by the spicy dressing. I see no reason, however, for the canned California olive garnish. Why not use real, ripe olives? 
<p>Ravioli Con Carne was rich and meaty and deliciously perfumed with fennel. Lasagna is served in hefty portions; two can definitely share one order as a first course or light supper. (Or, doggy bag what you can't finish and nuke it later.) The veal piccata was a disappointment. Veal cutlets were thin and dry and slathered with a too-lemony sauce not to our taste.
<p>For dessert, we chose cheesecake (pleasantly dense and citrusy), cannoli (traditional, with a not-too-sweet ricotta filling) and the restaurant's own Torta Raphael -- a mild chocolate single-layer cake studded with almonds. We were far too satiated for espresso or cappuccino, but the huge, brass espresso machine up front is a sign that Sal's can probably brew a good cup of Italian-style Joe. (Would that make it a cup of Giuseppe?) 
<p>The wine list is varied, both in selection and price. Italian, French and California wines are offered, plus some very decent wines by the glass and carafe.

<h2><center>November 5, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Rock Steady</h2></center>
<h4><center>Davis Morton</h4></center>


<h4><center>Bistro R has a new chef, but the French accent hangs around.</h4></center>


<P>"Plus ca change ..." A French accent has been standard at Bistro R near Innsbrook, but
recent changes, including a new chef, suggested that an American accent might be the new style.
The new chef is John Huggins, and we're pleased to say that Bistro R is still serving good food
and, in fact, the French accent is not gone at all. Anyway, taking the French out of food is a little
like taking the wool out of suits. 
<P>Bistro R occupies an almost hidden and modest space in a newish shopping center. The
eatery is convenient for the office crowd for quick lunches there or to-go. At night, tablecloths,
candles, lowered lights give it a cozy glow, and the restaurant makes no pretense of being
anything other than a casual bistro. Bistro R is not casual, however, about the food it serves.
Bistro R is one of a few places around that serves a pat‚ platter. This isn't something I often seek
out, but it's fun occasionally to start with a whole platter of taboos, particularly when delicious
little pickles and cornichons are there too. The sampler is good but diminished these days -- only
two pat‚s now, and no smoked cheese. It's a robust starter for two to share ($6.95). Many of the
other appetizers and soups ($2.50-$7.95) also have a French twist. Next time, I'll forego the pat‚
and try the savory cheesecake with shrimp and artichokes, which sounds like a winner.
<P>The five salads ($6.50-$7.50) are really designed as light entrees rather than as salad courses
-- a large but unexceptional house salad precedes the entrees.
<P>The main dishes ($10.95-$19.95) run a good range from meat, poultry to fish and shellfish
as well as a vegetarian ratatouille and a pasta du jour. Braised lamb shanks are a signature dish
and a reason to go to Bistro R if you're a shank fancier. We were lucky on our visit to find a
special of a shank of a different kind -- an osso buco made from venison rather than the usual
veal. Butchers tell us that meat nearest the bone is usually the most succulent, particularly true
when the meat is braised long and slow in good wine and flavorful vegetables. The venison --
farm-raised in Colorado -- was fork-tender in its delicious sauce with just a hint of game, and the
bone-marrow made a delicious spread for the bread. It was a wonderful fall dinner, especially
with good mashed potatoes and an interesting melange of vegetables.
<P>We also had a fish special -- rockfish with a heady tomato-based sauce provencal, a garlic
clove short for our tastes, but nicely executed otherwise.
<P>It's good to see a winelist that features a number of wines which are appropriate and
accessible, and Bistro R's list has interesting choices for under $20, many under $15.
Things get out of control when it's time for dessert ($4.50). If you blew your calorie quota for
the week on the pat‚, you can finish off the month's quota (and the budget) with dessert -- almost
a dozen to tantalize. With so many choices, it's none of this two forks, one dessert stuff. The
trouble is that they're big servings, and I couldn't finish a wedge of delicious
chocolate-butterscotch cream pie.
<P>We came to Bistro R after seeing the foodies' Movie of the Year, "Big Night." It
dramatically raises the essential question: Do you serve the best food you know and hope for an
appreciative crowd or simply design a menu around what sells? When host-owner Ron Wells
stopped by our table to ask how it was, I asked how the venison was selling. Disappointing, he
suggested, "Most people stay with what they know." We won't fault the unadventurous, but we're
thankful for the one who ate the first oyster and those who still bring them to us.

<h2><center>July 9, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>A Goochland Romance</h2></center>
<h4><center>On one sultry June evening, Chef Ramsey goes above and beyond the call of
duty.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>Some remember when the Fox Head Inn, Manakin-Sabot, was in the country, and one of the
reasons to go there was it was a BYOB place -- you could take your bottle and have a drink or
two before dinner. In those days, liquor-by-the-drink was allowed only in private clubs if you
had a locker and at a few restaurants if you brought your own. Before dinner at the Fox Head,
one could sit on Victorian-style furniture in the ultra-cozy rooms of this old farmhouse, have
your bourbon and water brought to you, spread a sticky mix of peanut butter and sweet pickle
relish on a few crackers and know that the world was good. At least for the moment. Then you
went to dinner.
<p>Times change and so has the Fox Head Inn, now only minutes away via I-64. On a recent
evening, the old BYO tradition was part of the invitation, but this time it was a bring-your-own
wine affair (without corkage fee) to a special dinner. Called a "Wine Collector's Evening,"
collectors could dust off a couple of ready-to-drink bottles or shop for wines just right for the
menu, specially prepared by Chef Robert Ramsey.
<p>There are still cozy places at the Fox Head to sip your bourbon and branch; a shady,
handsome new terrace in the front is one. Inside, the country setting is ignored in a redecoration
that is formal and elegant, more urban than country, but a fitting and sophisticated setting for the
sophisticated food served up by Chef Ramsey, who took over the restaurant a couple of years
ago.
<p>Our host-server took our little portable minicellar while we settled in, those crucial moments
when we acclimate and form our impressions. For our first wine, the Omniscient Oenophile had
a 1994 viognier from Sobon Estate in California. This little-known varietal is just beginning to
make appearances from the West Coast. Resembling a chardonnay, it's an interesting wine which
seemed to soften in the glass as red wines often do. It was a good choice for what followed.
<p>The hors d'oeuvres -- crisp little potato nests filled with sour cream and black caviar with a
couple of tiny brushes of scallion underneath -- were delicious and elegant teasings.
<p>The first course stunningly combined several culinary prizes: lobster ravioli garnished with
crayfish tails, tiny leeks (or "Welsh onions"), and slices of earthy black truffle, all bathed in a
rich saffron broth. Heady stuff here, but no ingredient overpowered this harmonious ensemble.
Our wine was a subtle but fitting accompaniment.
<p>Tiny field greens and lettuces were the base for the salad which followed and included
delicious ripe figs, julienne of apples, and hazelnuts. The mellow walnut oil and mandarin
orange dressing avoided the astringency of vinegar-based dressings which are often incompatible
with good wines.
<p>The meat course -- smoked loin of veal with dried cherries, whole shallots, and wild
mushrooms -- was a perfect complement to a '94 pinot noir from Salitage Vineyards in western
Australia. Chef Ramsey's entree was rich in orchestrated flavors designed to let the wine sing the
melody, which was in our case as complex as the chef's accompaniment. But not a thing was
off-key.
<p>A taste of luxury can easily become necessity: After power car windows do you yearn for
cranks? Dessert wines are things I've only flirted with in the past, but I'm getting the notion that I
may want a serious relationship. The dessert may be the villain: a pear poached in merlot and
stuffed with a Stilton cheese mousse, a perfect foil for a sweet wine. A late-harvest Virginia
wine from Rockbridge called V d'Or was wonderful, just short of honey and heaven, and the
delicious but understated dessert let the wine have the floor.
<p>A little chocolate truffle with coffee made it complete. Luxury is a dangerous addiction.
This special "Wine Collector's Evening" in late June was a winner. We hope there are more. In
the meantime, Chef Ramsey's standard, fixed-price menu ($45), which includes four courses,
and the good wine list can get you hooked too.

<h2><center>July 30, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Some Like It Hot</h2></center>
<h4><center>Indian cuisine is not for the faint of heart, or the faint of palate for that
matter.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Arabella Byatt</h4></center>

<p>Tucked away in Sassafras Square, one of West Broad Street's numerous strip shopping
centers, India K'Raja has overcome a few early problems typical for any new restaurant and is
producing meals that appeal to anyone who really enjoys good, authentic Indian food. And, for
those who've never sampled Indian cuisine, do yourself a favor and experience something new.
The kitchen at India K'Raja welcomes the uninitiated, and is happy to cook any dish to order,
particularly if the guest is wary of exotic spicing. 
<p>The menu is large and includes dishes from nearly every region of India. Sadly, Indian foods
tend to get lumped into one grouping in American restaurants, without any real distinction drawn
between different kinds of Indian cuisine. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. The
mighty sub-continent of India embraces many different climatic and cultural regions.
<p>Vegetarianism is a very big in India, and so is its growing seafood industry.
Good spicing (herbs, spices and seasonings) is the heart of Indian cooking and is what sets it
apart from other cuisines. In addition to flavoring food, spices are used to add color and aroma
and to thicken sauces. Some are familiar to western palettes (cilantro and coriander and chilies).
Also used, and probably less familiar to Americans, are black mustard, cardamom, cumin, 
saffron, tamarind and turmeric. 
<p>On a recent visit to India K'Raja, we started with a kachumber salad ($1.75). The "traditional
lemon dressing" is what makes this rather traditional salad come to life. We also ordered
vegetable samosas ($2). Ordering fried food is always risky, but these samosas (plump pastry
turnovers stuffed with potatoes and veggies) were just as they should be; the pastry crust flaky
and the oil almost unnoticed.
<p>My companion and I craved anything "tikka masala." My pal ordered the shrimp variety
($13.95), I opted for chicken ($9.95). A risk-taker, he requested his "hot;" I played it safe asking
for "mild to medium." Neither of us were disappointed. The accompanying tomato sauce (the
"tikka" masala we'd pined for) was just right. 
<p>On previous nights, when I had a hankering for lamb, I had ordered the lamb shahi korma
($9.95), which was tender and seasoned with a mild yogurt sauce. Also, for lighter fare, I had
success with the chicken jalfrezi ($9.50), which comes with lots of vegetables in a light herb
sauce. 
<p>The only mistake I've made at India K'Raja (and at any Indian restaurant, for that matter) is
being a little too cocky when I order, and forgetting that hot and spicy means different things to
different people and cultures. I once asked for the beef curry ($9.50) very hot. I was smoking all
the way home. 
<p>Eating Indian cuisine is always an experience. It not only fires up your taste buds, it also
puts all of your senses on high alert. I'm always acutely aware of the background music, the
decor, the smells wafting through the air. And the unique combination of flavors Indian chefs
use to prepare food -- unique to an American palette anyway -- is always a treat.
<p>For the finale at India K'Raja, I ordered ras malai, a traditional Indian dessert best described
as homemade cheese balls soaked in sweet, rose flavored milk. It was fresh, and at just $2 for the
dish, well worth it in my book. 
<p>If you enjoy an adventure, and aren't afraid to try new things, then Indian food should be on
your "must try" list.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>JANUARY 30, 1996</H2></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>Top of the World</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>by Tracy Tierney</H2></CENTER>             

<p>The North Pole is a home away from home during blizzard season.

<p>The waitress assured me that this was no ordinary potato.

<p>Somehow it seems appropriate that we wound up visiting a restaurant called The North Pole during the week of the blizzard. Because it was located in Crozier, I had thought we might wind up in a snow bank somewhere en route. But no, Patterson had been plowed and the surrounding scenery with its tundra vistas made the trip downright beautiful.
<p>I guess other people weren't put off by the weather either. The North Pole wasn't exactly crowded, but a few people had sidled up to the bar and were seated by the dining room's roaring fire.
<p>I'd heard that the restaurant has a loyal following and now I know why. This is the coziest place I've ever visited. The bar and surrounding tables are paneled in an attractive burnished wood, and the roar of the fire, along with the scent of freshly cooked steak, makes it a welcome haven on cold nights. (Customers desiring a quick warmup can also order from a special "warm drinks" menu.)
<p>We were seated in the restaurant's smaller dining room (which caters to parties with small children) and had the place to ourselves.
<p>We'd heard that The North Pole's specialty is steak, and one glance at the menu confirmed why. All the cuts are at least 16-ounces or bigger, the kind of Flintstone-size portions that made us glad we'd arrived with decent appetites.
<p>Overall, I found The North Pole's menu to be downright old fashioned, a throwback to the days when meat and potatoes were the norm. Don't even mention haute cuisine here. The steak, seafood and Italian dishes are served on huge platters and several of the dishes are fried or cheesy -- just the kind of high-fat fare that the Surgeon General carps about. I'd heard that The North Pole is a great favorite among some college students too. (No wonder, they have years to worry about their cholesterol count.) 
<p>The restaurant has starters like shrimp cocktail ($7.95), nachos ($6.95), and North Pole border dip ($6.95). The stuffed mushroom caps ($8.95) were most intriguing of the lot. A half-dozen mushrooms were sauteed in white wine and served smartly packed with a mixture of backfin crabmeat, Gruyere and cream cheese. Great stuff to take the winter chill off.
<p>Among the Italian dishes, you can choose from spaghetti, manicotti and stuffed shells. The place also lists suggested house wines to accompany each dish. Nice touch.
<p>We plowed ahead to the steak and seafood section and decided that the best way to review the restaurant was by trying both. My husband is a big steak lover and he had trouble deciding among the many cuts of beef that ranged from sirloin to T-bone. I think he was worried about tackling such a big piece of meat. (Be forewarned, all The North Pole's steaks are at least 16 to 18 ounces. Prepare to doggy-bag or share, as the menu sensibly suggests. For $8 you can order an empty plate, house salad, and choice of potato.)
<p>I opted for seafood and struggled between the stuffed shrimp ($16.95) in which the shellfish were filled with a mixture of crab and cheeses or the fried Oriental butterfly shrimp ($14.95). I chose the latter, which brought a platter of a half-dozen jumbo shrimp that had been freshly fried in light batter. It was accompanied by crisp French fries and some decent slaw that tasted homemade. Seafood lovers can also order the spiced shrimp, or the surf 'n turf, which is market price, and at our visit cost a hefty $28.
<p>For a little novelty, I asked if I could substitute a baked potato for the French fries, and was told it would cost $8. "Eight dollars?" I asked, incredulous. All for a lowly spud? The waitress assured me that this was no ordinary potato but one stuffed with three different cheeses and bacon -- a meal in itself.
<p>My husband chose the T-bone special and was pleased with the excellent quality of the meat. He prefers his steaks charbroiled rather than fried, and so he was a little surprised when our server brought a sizzling skillet to the table. But his steak's great flavor and tenderness won him over.
<p>I suspect that most North Pole customers are too full for dessert, and  the restaurant doesn't offer much of a selection. There were just two at our visit: a Black Forest cheesecake and a pecan and chocolate pie. We agreed to split the pie and found it fairly indistinguishable. The restaurant rotates its dessert selection every week, so prospective diners may find something more to their liking.

<h2><center>September 3, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>A Wellesley Terrace</h2></center>

<h4><center>The Terrace Cafe finds a comfortable home in The Shops at
Wellesley.</h4></center>

<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>The planned community of Wellesley was once a western residential outpost in the suburbs
of Short Pump, but it is now surrounded by commercial expansion -- a new Ukrop's and
Wal-Mart are two relatively recent newcomers. Wellesley, as all residential areas eventually do,
has begun to discover who it is, and the surrounding areas have begun to adapt themselves to
provide Wellesley with the services it demands. 
<p>The Shops at Wellesley has the sound of specialty shops for affluent shoppers. But at least in
the current metamorphosis, this center has become a focus for medical services and physicians.
A home-furnishings shop anchors one end and the Terrace Cafe holds up the other.
<p>The Terrace Cafe, occupying the space that was originally Cataldo's, is seeking a niche for
itself as a comfortable and convenient eatery for the neighborhood. The pleasant space, still
wearing its decoration from Cataldo's days, is plum-modern rather than faux-retro -- the purples,
light wood, and glass (along with good lighting) give the cafe a bit of panache.
<p>The mostly young staff offered cheerful smiles on a lazy summer night. Our server was
competent and fielded questions about the menu without hesitation, though seemed somewhat
impatient with our pondering indecisively over the menu.
<p>The menu offerings are divided between Greek, Italian, and American favorites. The five
appetizers ($5.95-$7.95) are mostly Mediterranean standards: grilled shrimp with Cajun spices;
sauteed Shiitaki mushrooms with garlic and balsamic vinegar; spanakopita; a cold sampler with
olives, feta cheese, stuffed grapeleaves, and taramosalata (fish roe spread); and fried calamari.
We shared an order of the calamari, young and tender, but less crisp and somewhat greasier than
we thought necessary, and the warm, assertive marinara sauce made me wish for a refreshing
tzatziki, the classic yogurt, cucumber and garlic dip.
<p>A la carte salads ($4.25-$7.95) include a standard Greek and a "Karpathian" Greek, a
Caesar, and "Cajun," which is a grilled chicken breast on a mixed salad. Three sandwiches
($5.95-$8.95) -- crab cake, steak and cheese, and grilled chicken -- are dubbed lighter fare and
served with steak fries.
<p>The more than 16 entrees ($8.95-$15.95) are divided among "classics," pastas, specialties,
and specials. Beef, pork, veal, chicken, and shellfish are the focus for traditional treatments such
as veal piccata, shish kababs, chicken Marsala, linguini with clam sauce.
<p>The house salad is included with the entree. The inclusion of iceberg lettuce along with
rather unripe, hothouse tomato wedges was unwelcome, especially at the peak of the local
tomato season, but a crumble of feta and a satisfactory dressing assuaged my disappointment.
<p>A whopping bowlful of linguine topped with sauteed shrimp and scallops in a creamy lobster
sauce was a good choice. The seafood was cooked just right, though a heavy hand with the salt
came dangerously close to ruining an otherwise successful dish. The salt shaker almost did the
same for a special of rosemary chicken. Cubes of chicken breasts did not manage to escape the
heat of the stove in time to save them from dehydration. Too bad, especially considering that the
rosemary-garlic sauce was quite good. Side dishes of rice, the quick-cooking variety, and
unseasonal broccoli, perfectly cooked but unseasoned, did little to enhance the special.
<p>Desserts were in short supply, which brought apologies from our server. We had what was
called Key lime pie but it was more nearly a light cheesecake. 
<p>Our impression is that Terrace Cafe is searching its surroundings for an identity and a
following, rather than putting its efforts into make an original culinary statement all its own.
With just a bit more attention to culinary detail, Terrace Cafe could develop a real following.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>

<H2><CENTER>MAY 7, 1996</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>The Grecian Way</H2></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>Real Mediterranean food makes the heart and soul long for the sea
itself.</H4></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Davis Morton</H4></CENTER>

<P>Dena's Grecian Restaurant, tucked away on Mall Drive across from Chesterfield Towne
Center, is another restaurant that includes both Greek and Italian favorites on their menu.
Opened about 11 years ago, the restaurant has been operated by Angelo Sciascia for the last
seven years. In a stereotypical suburban shopping center, the space has few inherent features, but
it is comfortable and the decor unobtrusive.
<P>The strength of places like Dena's is that they serve real food, often made from scratch in the
kitchen, and the food is served at reasonable prices. One usually doesn't leave a restaurant like
this feeling hungry. 
<P>This hearty food with origins around the Mediterranean is even better when it is enhanced
by wine. Dena's, like many of its contemporary counterparts, offers wines at modest prices,
including carafes of house wines. Not splendid wines, really, but they work well with the robust
flavors of the food.
<P>We started with a platter of Greek favorites ($4.25) that included several of the appetizers
offered separately ($1.75-$4.25) -- savory tiropita (cheese-filled pastries), dolmades (rice-stuffed
grape leaves), spanakopita (spinach in phyllo dough), a delicate taramasalata (those of us who
like the salty-fishy taste of the fish roe at its base can get our fix with the salad).
<P>A salad, which comes with all entrees, has a base of iceberg lettuce, loaded with nuggets of
feta cheese and, if you request, filets of anchovies, and topped with a hearty dressing.
<P>Accompanying this and the rest of the meal is a basket of warm bread. Greek bread is
generally a softer, finer-textured bread than the lower-fat breads of Italy and France. It's very
easy to eat a whole, warm loaf, and, with a glass of wine, feel very good about yourself and the
world.
<P>The entrees number a whopping 42 on the menu, and most are variations of Greek and
Italian standards. From the Italian menu, veal and chicken are given their usual or the same,
treatments ($8.95-$12.95). At our server's suggestion, we tried the veal francaise -- sauteed veal
slices with mushrooms and artichoke hearts in an herb-flecked butter sauce. All were in great
abundance except the veal, which came as tidbits rather than slices, and sometimes chewy ones
at that. A simple side dish of spaghetti in a delicious tomato sauce was more interesting.
Happily, it needed no cheese to make it perfect.
<P>There are more than a dozen pasta dishes, including the usual stuffed and layered ones
($7.50-$8.95). "Greek" spaghetti -- mixed with herbs, cheeses, and butter, and then baked -- is a
popular item at Dena's; the Italian pastas are familiar favorites.
<P>The Greek dishes ($8.95-$11.95) include moussaka, pastichio (a layered pasta dish related to
lasagna), spanakopita, shish kebab or a popular combination platter that includes some of the
above and more. We tried their hearty version of moussaka; the texture was sometimes
surprising as in the rather cookielike layer of bechamel sauce on top. It's probably not a dish I
would seek out a second time. Dena's has lots of food I haven't sampled yet.
<P>The restaurant offers several meat and seafood dishes ($9.95-$13.95), including steaks,
shrimp, fish and lamb chops. The most interesting might be broiled shrimp with herbs and feta
cheese.
<P>The dessert that interested us, more than the baklava and the cheesecakes, was that perfect
comfort dessert from Greece, galatoboureko custard wrapped in phyllo, doused in honey or
sugar syrup, and baked. It was a nice close.
<P>We made our visit in midweek and found that many have discovered the way to Dena's, a
clear indication that the restaurant has a devout following. And for good reason. Dena's serves
real food in the best Mediterranean tradition.

<TITLE>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>JANUARY 23, 1996</H2></CENTER>

<H2><CENTER>But Is It Art?</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>by Davis Morton</H2></CENTER>  

<P>You'll get dizzy watching the cook in action at Kabuto.

<P>The cook sprinkles and pours, stirs and tosses, cuts and twirls, and then sprinkles and pours
some more.

<P>We've all been captivated by the performing cook -- the short-order cook flipping pancakes
high in the air, and if we're seen watching, flipping them higher next time. We love watching the
pizza-maker deftly throw and spin the pizza crust, and who isn't awed by the French waiter
filleting a whole fish with just a few agile strokes.
<P>The Japanese have capitalized on that universal fascination with performance cooking and
have taken it to new heights. Many Japanese restaurants have been on the American scene for
decades now, and the tradition is alive and well in Richmond, too.
<P>I'll admit to never having had the experience until my recent visit to Kabuto in the West End
with its "authentic Teppan Yaki tables." These tables, about the size of pool tables and seating
eight or more, have the cooking surface built right into the table. The cook is, of course, the
center of attention (complete with spotlight) at Kabuto.
<P>The best way to experience dining at these restaurants is with a group -- for a special
occasion or, perhaps, an office party. It's not great for an intimate dinner for two, but it can be
great fun for a party of eight or more.
<P>Kabuto has several dining rooms, a large bar area, and is dimly lit. Shakespeare wrote "the
play's the thing." At Kabuto, the cook's performance is the thing.
<P>Since the entrees of everyone at the table are all cooked simultaneously, the menu limits
itself to items that can be cooked hibachi-style at once -- steaks, chicken, scallops or shrimp, or
combinations of these ($11.50-$22). Each entree is priced as a dinner, which includes soup,
salad, shrimp appetizer, vegetables, rice and tea.
<P>We were quickly seated for dinner and, to start, chose the vegetable tempura ($4), which
was more batter than vegetable and accompanied with a lifeless dipping sauce. There is a sushi
menu (a la carte) as well.
<p>Soup -- clear broth with scallions and mushrooms -- followed the tempura quickly, and a
salad of mostly iceberg lettuce came quickly thereafter.
<P>Without fanfare, the main attraction arrived -- the cook, his cart with the food carefully
prepped. The spotlight was on and eyes turned center-stove. Knife (sharp) and fork twirled.
(Which came first, twirling batons or twirling knives?) Am I jaded? Have I lost the joy of
wonder?
<P>First, some oil, then vegetables were spread on the cooking surface and deftly cut into
chopstick-able bites by the cook's very sharp knife. Next came a dozen or so shrimp (tails on) to
be transformed into "dazzling, dancing hibachi shrimp" (tails off, with very sharp knife). Then
on to the stove with chicken, scallops, more shrimp, sirloin steak, some rice to fry, and then
some mushrooms -- our entrees. (But where's my filet mignon?) 
<P>The cook sprinkles and pours, stirs and tosses, cuts and twirls, and then sprinkles and pours
some more. Then it's time to serve the shrimp. Actually, a bit too late; they're overcooked, but
with only four bites (two shrimp) not to worry. I'm still in. Ah, there's my filet going on the grill,
and a heap of bean sprouts.
<P>Soon, more sprinkles and pours, cuts and twirls, and dinner is served. Everybody gets some
vegetables, rice, and mushrooms, his or her own entree except me. Then there are a few tricks
with the bean sprouts as they're served.
<P>"How do you want your filet?" asks the cook.
<P>"It's ready," I say, calmly, having watched it being sprinkled, tossed, cut and cooked. Three
minutes later, I, too, am served -- well-done filet mignon.
<P>Then there was tea, and a check. The whole experience lasted only an hour -- from start to
finish. Take the kids, they'll be practicing the lemon trick for weeks and maybe with bean
sprouts too (but hide the knives). Am I jaded or what?

<TITLE>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>
</head>
<h2><center>December 24, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Italian Accents</h2></center>
<h4><center>The Wineshop Bistro offers an Italian accent to Brandermill.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>The last time we ate in the Wineshop Bistro in Brandermill, the accent was French. The
accent is now Italian, though in contemporary cooking these distinctions mean a lot less than
they used to. New owners have made other changes at this casual eatery. The retail food and
wine operation has been all but phased out. The wine shop itself serves mainly as an entrance
foyer for the restaurant and as a storage-display area for the wines, which can still be purchased
to go but the prices now reflect restaurant markups rather than the regular retail.
<p>The good news is that the food is quite good. The menu is as straightforward as the
furnishings and decor in the plain but comfortable dining room. The menu offerings are
pleasantly old-fashioned without being stodgy, and they are made to order.
<p>Starters ($6.95-$8.95) include a traditional antipasto platter, hot and cold seafood platters,
and fresh mozzarella with tomatoes, basil and olive oil. Soup ($3.95) is always a good opening
for any winter meal, particularly an Italian one, and in this case, a pureed, creamy vegetable
soup struck exactly the right chord. Or you can start the American way with a salad
($3.00-$3.95) of mixed greens or a Caesar.
<p>The seven pasta dishes ($7.95-$14.95) favor lighter pastas and sauces, which mostly must be
prepared on the spot, rather than the heavier layered and stuffed ones with lots of meat and
cheese that used to be the trademarks of many Italian restaurants in this country before fat grams
and calorie intake preoccupied us. In fact, here one can choose a "primavera" topping for fusilli
with cream and butter or with garlic and olive oil -- sort of a choose-your-own-cholesterol
approach. (Pasta "primavera," the Italian word for spring, was traditionally composed of tiny
spring vegetables but seems to have come to mean simply a combination of any vegetables.) The
primavera was a good choice -- al dente pasta, a half-dozen vegetables with just the slightest
touch of crunch, a finish of fragrant olive oil and lots of mellow garlic. Linguine and spaghetti
get traditional toppings of red or white clam sauces and Bolognese (meat-tomato) sauce
respectively. Vodka with cream and tomatoes appears more and more frequently around town,
here it is teamed with penne. Finally, capellini (angel hair) is served with traditional marinara or
with seafood in a tomato sauce.
<p>The "secondi" or entrees ($13.95-$20.95) are pared to an essential half-dozen preparations of
fish, veal, beef, lamb and chicken. Seared salmon on a bed of fresh sauteed spinach, redolent
with garlic and a hint of rosemary, was perfectly finished and quite delicious. Veal scallopine
with mushrooms in a Marsala wine sauce was also good, the sauce deep and rich. Roasted red
potatoes were a nice contrast in both dishes. Each was quite satisfying. Veal parmigiana, filet
mignon in a sauce of Barolo wine, a rack of lamb, an egg-battered chicken breast finished with a
sauce of wine, butter and lemon, and perhaps a special or two round out the offerings.
<p>It seems that almost all restaurants are in collusion about desserts these days. I don't know
when I've been to a restaurant that didn't offer Key lime pie and cheesecake or an Italian eatery
that didn't offer tiramisu. They're also here ($4.50). We finished with the last, which was
pleasant. A birthday celebration at an adjacent table had asked the chef to prepare a special cake,
apparently a great success.
<p>Chef Anthony Compocciai is a veteran. He plied his skills in the kitchens of New York
before choosing a more pastoral life. He came to the Wineshop via Pasta Luna and clearly
knows his way around the kitchen.
<p>Those who live in the area and who have not visited the Wineshop Bistro should discover
that good cooking is alive and well in Brandermill. Such a place is a good neighbor when
driving to town is not what you had in mind.

<h2><center>August 27, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>An Airport Detour</h2></center>

<h4><center>When you're heading out to the airport, make time for a quick stop at The
Gooseberry Cafe.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Arabella Byatt</h4></center>

<p>If you happen to be in the East End or on your way to the Richmond International Airport,
slip by The Gooseberry Cafe. Buried between fast food restaurants and colossal car dealerships
on South Laburnum Avenue near the airport. Nothing fancy, nothing trendy, just lots of good
food.
<p>The menu is arranged like a sort of newsletter, with starter categories ranging from
appetizers to salads. Then it's off and running with entrees, including beef, chicken, veal, pasta,
seafood, and, finally, a raw bar. Sandwiches are also included. 
<p>To start, we chose armadillo eggs ($4.99) and a ramekin of Chesapeake crab served with
toast points ($5.50). The armadillo eggs -- "spicy jalapeno peppers stuffed with cheese, lightly
breaded and fried" -- were fresh and good. The chef recommended a side of ranch dressing that
added a nice kick to the combination of flavors. The crab, while adequate, should have had a bit
more flavor. 
<p>For an entree, I opted for the veal Marsala ($15.35), which was presented nicely. It comes
served with either the vegetable du jour (buttered broccoli), potato or rice, or a side of spaghetti.
Unfortunately, the dish came drenched in pasta water which pooled at the bottom. My dinner
companion ordered fried scallops ($12.95) that were plump and fresh -- breaded ever-so-lightly
in expertly seasoned batter. 
<p>Salads were a la carte and I ordered the small house variety ($2) with blue cheese dressing.
We were told that all dressings are made on the premises and ours was quite good, thanks to the
large chunks of Roquefort. The salad itself was also good, with not a shred of iceberg lettuce. 
<p>Other items on the menu included assorted pastas -- lots of baked spaghetti varieties,
eggplant and veal Parmesan dishes, plus a filet mignon. One intriguing entree was the quail
seasoned with a special Pommery sauce. The prime rib looked appealing and seemed to be a hit
with other patrons. In fact, a banner flapped outside advertising the prime rib special for $10.95
on Friday and Saturday nights. On those nights, the prime rib special also includes a salad and a
soup.
<p>Desserts were plentiful. None are made on the premises, except for the bread pudding with
whiskey sauce, which was drenched in butter. Sadly, the service was not particularly stellar. Our
waiter was attentive enough, but not particularly knowledgeable about the menu. Still, the
portions were quite large, and we felt as though we had gotten our money's worth.
<p>We hear The Gooseberry Cafe has a large lunch following, especially among people seeking
a quick sandwich between business meetings or on their way to the airport. The "Midday Bill of
Fare" lists a slew of affordable and appetizing sandwiches and grilled items.
<p>Would I make a special trip out to the Gooseberry Cafe for another meal? Perhaps. But you
can bet that when I hop the next 7:05 p.m. flight to San Francisco out of Richmond International
Airport, I'll be stopping by The Gooseberry Cafe beforehand. This place sure beats the heck out
of airport or airplane food anytime, and it's a convenient stop along the way to the airport.

<h2><center>October 29, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>At Chico's Home</h2></center>
<h4><center>Chico's Mansion has a little bit of this, and a lot of that. </h4></center>

<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>Chico's Mansion is a most unusual place down in Shockoe Bottom (where Paragon and
Bird-in-Hand watered those "in-search-of" for years). Chico has taken over and he is most
definitely a man with some unique tastes, which he demonstrates in the atypical decor and food
served in his mansion, now open to the public for nearly four months. 
<p>Chico's decorators must have had fun giving him what he wanted. He obviously loves lots of
bright colors and glitz, but he surely insisted on using some of his "found" objects too, so auto
wheel covers and hubcaps, even plastic spoons become chandeliers, while dozens of Chico's old
ties make a wonderful fringe for a divider. There's much to take in on an initial visit -- a cozy
lounge up front for those drinking or waiting, functional and dysfunctional sculpture, zany light
sources everywhere, and some table legs that are, literally, legs, rather stylishly shod. Chico
apparently cleaned out his attic and garage, maybe even bought some stuff, and perhaps
commissioned some too. Clearly, the owners have had great fun putting it all together.
<p>At some point Chico must have traveled abroad before he began to put it all together -- food
is different after you've been to "Paree." Chico doesn't just want plain 'ol Tex-Mex; he wants it
done up. The new chef, John Bullen, has brought some whimsical fusion and delightful
confusion to the menu.
<p>We dared not ask about the menu numbering system -- I personally think it's Chico's favorite
lottery numbers (plus or minus the magic number, of course). For starters (menu items begin 6,
21, 17, 7, and 10 -- you catch my drift). A quesadilla with orange-roasted duck and Brie brings
two typically French classics between flour tortillas (only for purists is it truly outrageous). A
delightfully zesty fresh salsa and a slice of lime add life; unfortunately, the duck and cheese
could have used more heat. Other starters are closer to the expected, like Chico's nachos with
chorizo sausage and Chihuahua cheese. 
<p>Chico offers some light fare ($4.95-9.95). There's the usual Caesar salad with chicken, the
more unusual tortilla soup with chicken, white-bean tamales with pesto and goat cheese (and a
jalapeno for the kick), seared tuna on greens, and enchiladas filled with roast chicken and mixed
beans with cheese and red and green sauces. The latter was surprisingly bland and skimpy in the
fillings.
<p>The main courses ($12.95-$14.95) -- "Before His Siesta" -- are as interesting and whimsical
as the surroundings. There's an offering of classic "arroz con pollo" (chicken with rice) and
grilled Maine lobster with roasted garlic and epazote. A smoked game burrito with a blueberry
chipolte chutney is more exotic. The chutney and a banana-tamarind salsa for a confit of duck
bring Indian flavors to the mix. The pepita (pumpkin seed) encrusted mahi mahi with a "vanilla
rum essence" brought a nice contrast of textures, crunchy on the outside, moist inside, and
completed with a winning sauce. The accompanying black beans were boringly bland; the
tamales were interesting but not compelling.
<p>There are but three desserts (numbers 43, 24, and 5 on the menu). A chocolate mousse
Napoleon ($4.95) was the easy choice. Chefs are into culinary architecture these days, so this
interesting tower was honey-painted sopaipillas held together with a mortar of chocolate mousse
on a sticky foundation of a plummy sauce. I liked it. Hold the rice pudding and the sorbet.
<p>It should be no surprise that owner Michael Ripp, who brought us a taste of Cuba at Havana
'59 around the corner, is also responsible for this whacky bit of fun. The food is good enough,
and it manages to share the stage with the outlandish decor. Chico has got a hot place going, and
most of the heat isn't coming from the chiles. If you're a meat-and-potatoes kind of person, you
and Chico may have some problems.

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>

<h2><center>October 15, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Smooth Sailing</h2></center>
<h4><center>The Blue Quarry has a terrific location and an accomplished chef.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>One of my real pleasures as a restaurant reviewer is to go to a restaurant with neutral
expectations and no preconceived notions -- no advance press releases, no word-of-mouth
recommendations, no traditions -- and to be delightfully surprised by what I find. Such was the
case on a recent visit to The Blue Quarry, the new kid in the Fan.
<p>Taking over quarters just vacated by Kamal Palace, a good but underpatronized Indian
restaurant, these small, traditionally appointed rooms (with a terrace for spring weather) are
conducive to good conversation and serious dining. The restaurant has white tablecloths, fresh
flowers, thoughtful and experienced servers, a pleasant casual atmosphere, and very good food
with a twist.
<p>Chef/Owner Jeff Berry, a native Virginian, grew up in San Antonio, where a swimming
hole, the eponymous blue quarry, and a rich Tex-Mex culinary heritage provide continuing
inspiration. Berry came back to Richmond, working with Paolo Randazzo at Franco's Ristorante
for about nine years, where he couldn't help but learn some good stuff.
<p>It happens that two of the most popular cuisines these days are Southwestern and
Mediterranean, and the hot trend is "fusion." As chefs and their diners become more savvy about
food, as ethnic foods become more mainstream, and as adventurous palates yearn for new tastes,
fusion happens. So what happens when you cross Mediterranean and Southwestern? At the Blue
Quarry, you get a good dinner. Chef Berry may be in the right place at the right time.
<p>There's a short but appropriate wine list of a dozen or so labels, fairly priced. A 1993 Van
Deuser Pinot Noir ($20) from Oregon was elegant and proved a versatile adapter to our varied
choices from the menu. And to nibble while we waited, good cheese bread and delicious little
peppers, whose piquancy threaten the wine more than the palate.
<p>We started with a couple of consummate "fusers" -- smoked mozzarella quesadilla with
roasted peppers, Calamata olives, capers, a fresh tomato salsa ($7.95), and a towering wonder of
tortilla, smoked salmon, and several varieties of caviar ($7.95) with traditional (and
nontraditional) garnishes. There are a quartet of other starters ($6.95-9.50) plus a soup ($3.95)
and a small house salad ($1.95).
<p>The entrees ($15.95-$22.95) are rather evenly divided between fish/shellfish, meat/poultry,
or combinations thereof. Some of the entrees are coupled with pasta, others paired with
southwestern standards such as tortillas in several guises, black beans, or chile relleno. Veal
Rollatini -- veal scallopini stuffed with Portobelo mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and Gruyere
cheese in a wine-herb sauce and accompanied by sauteed fresh spinach and potatoes -- is classic
and luscious as are seared, double-cut lamb chops in a well-balanced, complex port-wine and
garlic sauce. A rice-stuffed roasted red pepper topped with cheese was as delicious as the lamb.
All our plates, by the way, were beautifully presented, with the garnishes integral to the
preparation, not just superfluous decoration.
<p>Desserts had dwindled down to a precious few by the time we were ready to order, but a
pyramid of tender profiteroles (spherical cream-puffs), filled with chocolate mousse and served
with a warm milk-chocolate sauce was handsome and too good to share.
<p>By the way, The Blue Quarry has limited seating -- three dozen or so places -- so call ahead
to reserve a table to avoid disappointment. Also, make time for a leisurely, relaxed dinner.
<p>It's a pleasure to dine in a new restaurant where the chef has a culinary point of view along
with the skill to execute his idea with style. Berry seems to have a knack for taking a traditional
dish and giving it a subtle infusion of the unexpected, adding complexity without obscuring the
expected.
<p>The Blue Quarry is not a watering hole, but rather a welcome addition to our evolving
restaurant scene.

<h2><center>September 17, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Seaside Repast</h2></center>
<h4><center>Shellfish and amazing value are hallmarks of Virginia Beach's
Tautogs.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Carter Braxton</h4></center>

<p>A week at the beach can take its toll. First there's the big pack-up: Boogie Boards, bikes,
towels, sheets, toys, suitcases, cameras of all kinds, books, boom boxes -- all fitted in like an
expert-level jigsaw puzzle into your chosen family vehicle. Then there's the drive: tunnel/bridge
traffic, pit stops, smushed Cheetos, arguing over which kind of music to listen to and which
fast-food restaurant to patronize and who gets to sit where, crying over spilled chocolate milk.
When you finally arrive and get settled in, there are beds to be made and groceries to be gotten.
Half of your clan heads for the beach, the others for the wax museum. After a few days of
dragging your stuff down to the beach and supervising outdoor showers and late bedtimes,
you're wondering why you do this every year.
<p>So here's a plan: Take a weekend this fall and go back to the beach, with a friend or a lover
but definitely not a child. And while you're there, have one unhurried, uninterrupted, grown-up
dinner.
<p>Stopping in a funky little dress shop on Pacific in Virginia Beach this summer, I looked at
the goods then approached the shopkeeper who appeared to have a relatively high hip quotient.
"If you were going to go out to dinner just once in a week and you wanted to eat at a really cool
place, where would you go?" I asked. She answered instantly: "Tautogs."
<p>Later that evening we headed down to 23rd Street for our big night out (the kids were
happily eating hot dogs at home with grandma). We were fortunate to even find the place since I
had misunderstood the shopkeeper (heavy Texas accent) to say something like "Tawtaws." But
find it we did and as we parked the car across the street, a summer rain began to pour down on
the striped awning in front of old Winston's Cottage, now home of Tautogs (named for a fish).
<p>We got a table under the awning. I really wanted to get the full effect of the old beach
cottage that two friends renovated last year. Seated in a booth near the fireplace, we talked with
our waiter, who told us of winter days when the place was packed with patrons who'd braved
knee-deep snow on foot. Even in the heat of summer, I could easily imagine the glow of the fire
and the cozy chatter of snowbound strangers who suddenly became friends.
<p>But, back to reality. Time for dinner. Tautogs' slogan is "We're not selfish with our shellfish"
and the menu is evidence of this generosity. For starters, I chose a bowl of Maryland crab soup
($1.95). It was creamy, sweet and loaded with crab. Significant Other ordered his all-time
favorite appetizer: clams casino ($9.95 for a dozen/$5.95 half-dozen), prepared with a delicious
cornmeal, pepper and onion mixture. And the herb-encrusted bread ($1.75) recommended by our
astute waiter was perfect with both. There were plenty of other first courses to tempt us, and
most would make perfectly good light dinners -- Caesar salad ($3.95), Tautog wings ($4.95),
4-cheese pizza ($2.95), steamed veggies served with hollandaise ($5.95) and Benny's oysters on
the half shell topped with sundried tomatoes, pesto and Havarti ($5.95 for half-dozen).
<p>Perusing the entrees, we were amazed at the value -- no entree was more than $12.95, yet
every dish seemed substantial. Being a self-ordained connoisseur of crab cakes, I ordered the top
dollar Wesley's World Famous Crab Cakes after gaining assurance from our waiter that they
really are world famous. Served with rice, the two crab cakes were a good four inches in
diameter and chock full of backfin bound with a minimal amount of breading. While they were
good, I'm not sure they qualified as outstanding -- they were just a tad gooey for this crab lover
who prefers a slightly crisp exterior.
<p>Sig Other almost chose the Tuna Martinique, marinated in lime, garlic, olive oil and zesty
red onions, but veered unexpectedly in the direction of Jack's Rajun Shrimp Scampi ($9.95).
Jack, wherever he is, must be a genius because his shrimp were awesome -- all 18 of them
sprawling on a bed of rice. They were spicy, tender, cooked to perfection and so plentiful S.O.
had to pack a few up and take them home. Based on the couple of shrimp I sampled, I,
personally, would be happy to take Jack home as my personal chef.
<p>There is absolutely no way I'll return to Virginia Beach without a trip back to Tautogs. There
are just too many menu items I didn't have a chance to try. Maybe next time I'll get the stuffed
flounder in a bag served with fresh lump crab and shrimp stuffing or baked sea scallops served
with leeks and vermouth creme sauce. And, if I'm not terribly hungry, there are five sandwiches
under $5, all accompanied by Tautogs' seasoned chips. Plus, there's always dessert: bread
pudding, chocolate Tautog (chewy brownie topped with ice cream, fudge and whipped cream),
peaches melba and more.
<p>Yes, next time I'm at the beach I'll be heading for that little booth by the fireplace, taking my
own advice and basking in the slow pace of childless dining.

<h2><center>Sailing the Sea</h2></center>
<h4><center>The new Milepost 5 aims to bring the beach to Richmond, but does it
succeed?</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>Those of us who head for the beach at every opportunity always look forward to those great
little seafood places. Some are brand new for the season, others are tried and true, we hope. It's
vacation time, and we're looking for comfort food, beachstyle. The chic new "in" places make us
pay our homage with an hour wait to be seated; the old places that used to please us with big
platters of fried things, french fries, and hush puppies aren't as good as they used to be (or not as
good as we remember them).
<p>Now with sophisticated methods of preserving and transporting seafood, fish and shellfish
can be as fresh and flavorful inland as they are at seaside (though that argument will keep none
of us from heading to the beach at the next opportunity). The folks at Milepost 5 are hoping to
keep you inland. 
<p>This new seafood restaurant takes its name from the mileposts on the Outer Banks (though
this particular "Milepost" has no particular significance).
<p>Milepost 5 has made its place among the specialty shops of Sycamore Square and in the
shadow of Crab Louie's, the long-term fish-cooker in the plantation house that is part of the
Sycamore Square complex. Milepost 5 quarters are plain and comfortable, a rather typical
beach-type eatery. It makes no pretense of being a white-tablecloth, to-the-manner-born kind of
place. It also casts its net in shallow waters, and this results in a rather modest and predictable
menu.
<p>We started with the most unusual of the five appetizers ($4.952D$6.95) -- smoked trout
wontons. Trout smoked in apple-wood is blended with cream cheese and scallions, enclosed in
wonton wrappers, and deep-fried. These crisp nuggets were delicious, though the horseradish
cream we chose for dipping was too assertive for the flavors of the wontons.
<p>A clam-and-corn chowder ($2.25/$3.25) is a flavorful and interesting combination of several
soup and chowder traditions. Steamed shellfish make excellent starters or snacks, too. Milepost 5
offers clams and oysters (half-dozen $3.95/dozen $6.95), shrimp (half-pound $7.95/pound
$14.95) and snow-crab (half-pound $5.95/pound $9.95).
<p>The entrees are served with "Pamlico Sound" salad, a small but good mixed creation,
available also with complements of chicken or tuna as a light meal ($6.95) as are three other
salads ($4.952D$6.95) -- lemon-dill tuna, "Sea-zer" (with shrimp), and a low-fat pasta salad.
The entrees ($8.95-$16.95) don't always make a water connection -- there's steak, chicken, and
pasta, along with fish and shellfish. Being one of those who tries to get it all in, I went for a
grilled combination (there's another combination that's fried) -- shrimp, scallops and a salmon
filet. Timing went askew here, and skewers of scallops and shrimp were overcooked and only
lukewarm, while the fish arrived very hot but was, in time, just right. A standard cocktail sauce
was not a complement to either. The backfin crabcakes were quite good, though overworked in
picking and mixing -- lumps of crab are as delicate as egg yolks and should be treated
accordingly. A choice of potatoes and vegetables accompanies all the entrees except the pastas.
Desserts range from the inevitable chocolate thing -- in this case, a mousse cake -- and Key lime
pie, to old-fashioned applesauce cake, a pleasant, spicy wedge that would have been better with
a bit of caramel sauce or whipped cream.
<p>We had a pleasant evening at Milepost 5. The staff seemed to be intent on seeing that the
experience of their dinner guests was a good one. It's not clear, however, what niche the owners
would like to carve for this relatively new South Side restaurant. We hope they might someday
steer their ship into more innovative, daring waters.

<title>Style Weekly's Restaurant Review</title>
</head>
<h2><center>August 20,1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Plantation Mentality</h2></center>
<h4><center>Davis Morton</h4></center>
<h4><center>There are seven main courses, each given an interesting and contemporary
treatment.</h4></center>

<P>Many of us find ourselves hosting out-of-town friends and relatives who find Richmond a
convenient headquarters from which to see the abundant historical sites and attractions in the
state. You may find yourself in that role and head toward Williamsburg in search of the current
version of our Colonial past.
<P>A quiet repast away from hordes of fellow tourists may be just the way to end the day. We
did just that recently at the Kitchen at Powhatan Plantation, a few minutes from Colonial
Williamsburg.
<P>The main crop at Powhatan Plantation these days is 400 or so time-share units neatly
obscured by clever landscaping. The handsome plantation house, sitting proud down a long
grove of trees, was reconstructed on its original 18th-century foundation. The grounds are
pleasant on a late summer afternoon, and swans on the lake add a touch of poetry. The kitchen
dependency near the house serves as the small and intimate restaurant.
<P>The Kitchen is done in expected 18th-century style, and the servers are in a semblance of
period dress. Fortunately the past ends there. The menu is decidedly current with not a nod to the
distant past, and, as always at the Kitchen, the menu changes with the seasons.
<P>The wine list is a somewhat eccentric but interesting selection of French and American
wines, fairly priced but not inviting easy participation. We settled on a Meritage blend from
Napa's Oakville Estate, a bigger wine than we needed but interesting, nonetheless.
<P>We began with two of the summer first courses ($3-$7), which include salads, a cold
cucumber soup, and four more inventive dishes. We tried a terrine of chicken, veal and shiitake
mushrooms, accompanied by a red onion confit, cornichons, and garlic toast. While this
selection may be reassuringly low in fat, it was delicate rather than robust, a subtle rather than a
full-flavored terrine. 
<P>Our other starter, a nutritionist's model, was in the Mediterranean mode --- a single, seared
sea scallop on a tomato slice spread with a tame tapanade, that heady grind of olives, garlic, and
anchovies. The server warned that one scallop should not be a surprise, but there was no mention
that the menu's promise of a warm tomato gateau would be replaced by a slice of tomato. A
large, perfectly cooked scallop, indeed, but still a skimpy serving. Other starters are steak tartar
excited by an ancho chile puree and catfish with an Asian twist.
<P>There are seven main courses ($13-$23), each given an interesting and contemporary
treatment and ranging from a vegetarian "composition" to aged beef tenderloin. We chose
rum-flamed shrimp with grapefruit and cumin-scented black beans, which pushed the meaning
of "al dente" to the limits. Our other entree was sauteed slices of veal loin with polenta (we say
grits, Italians say polenta --- it's still ground corn), salsa verde, and summer squash --- nicely
done, except that a single, savory slice of rosemary-infused polenta is skimpy.
<P>There are four desserts on the summer menu ($4-$5). We chose a "brazo" (a chocolate, jelly
roll-style cake) with a center of banana mousse and bread pudding, a dry wedge that needed
more moisturizing than the squiggles of sauce "anglaise" offered.
<P>The Kitchen has lots of promise in its inventive seasonal menus. The setting is pleasant, off
the beaten track, and the dining room is quiet and conducive to intimate conversation. The
service is attentive, though we felt we were moved rather quickly through our dinner even
though others were not waiting to be seated. Presentations are handsome. There is something of
a parsimony of spirit, however, that has tinged my two trips to Powhatan Plantation. Perhaps the
chef's eye is focused too tightly on the bottom line. Dinner at the Kitchen could, and should, be a
first-rate experience.

<h2><center>June 25, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>Stepping Out</h2></center>
<h4><center>Under pleasant skies, the patio at the James River Wine Bistro is a good
bet.</h4></center>

<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>We get a few days around the summer solstice when dining outdoors can be a midsummer
night's dream, and Richmond spills out to terraces, patios and even the sidewalks. It seems now
that anybody who serves food or drink also offers a little table somewhere in the great outdoors. 
James River Wine Bistro has one of the more pleasant and spacious patios around, and we
headed there on one of those June evenings which it would have been a shame to waste inside.
And it was a good choice. The patio could almost qualify as a small park. With multilevels, good
lighting by night or shade by day, and a server's kiosk nearby, al fresco dining doesn't get much
better around here.
<p>In less agreeable weather, the bar and its companion room across the entrance hall of this
Fan eatery in the transformed Stonewall Jackson School would be a good alternative for hanging
out. These rooms have a pleasant sophistication. The large dining room in back is comfortable in
a basic way, but it reminds me of a "lunchroom," and memories of the strong, steamy smells of
school food obscure any objectivity on this point.
<p>The current menu at the James River Wine Bistro offers a savory range of choices for light
summer grazing or more substantial dining. An appealing feature of the restaurant, as its name
suggests, is its wine list. Most wines are available by the glass, and the choice is fairly extensive,
unpretentious and mainly affordable. It's better in breadth than depth, but it takes years and big
bucks to stock a good cellar. The wine list offers mostly young wines. The bottle is the best
value, but "by the glass" is an option.
<p>For starters ($4.75-$8.75), you can have humble humus with veggies or haughty smoked
salmon and its attendant garnishes. In between there's the flap of Buffalo wings, the zip of beef
satay or barbecued shrimp, the earthiness of mushroom tart, or the salinity of Long Island
oysters. And salads ($3.50-$6.95), these range from simple garden-style to hearty smoked
chicken Caesar.
<p>The small 10-inch pizzas ($5.25-$8.50) are also good choices, particularly for two to share,
or as a light supper for one. Most here are "designer" (exotic mushrooms, spinach, and Gruyere),
or even "fusion" (Thai chicken with peanut sauce), a few traditional (Margarita). We decided to
share a "designer" -- scallops with mozzarella, pine nuts, shallots, and sun-dried tomatoes. It was
a good choice, with its crisp but tender crust, nice complementary flavors, and still-tender
scallops. We could also have created our own "masterpiece" by augmenting our pizza or
building one with any or all of 15 other ingredients, perhaps the culinary equivalent of
mud-wrestling.
<p>Risottos -- with a base of creamy arborio rice -- have become fashionable, tempting those
who suffer pasta burnout, and the restaurant also offers one with seafood and seasonal vegetables
($16.95). We're still game for pasta when the mood strikes, and spicy chicken on penne with
mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes in a peppery sauce was right on target.
<p>Grilled meats ($12.95-$16.50) or the other seafood dishes ($12.50-$21.95) were less
appealing to us than the salmon filet encrusted with couscous. These tiny pearls of pasta made
for a wonderfully crunchy "crust" and proved a good way to lock in moisture for a succulent bit
of fish. 
<p>We finished with fresh berries on vanilla custard with a shower of Chambord ($6), a fitting
close to our meal.
<p>Perfect, not-too-hot evenings for dining out in Richmond are rare. We hope many more will
come along before summer's end. If so, head for the James River Wine Bistro, it has much to
recommend it.

<h2><center>June 18, 1996</h2></center>
<h2><center>A Dining Delight</h2></center>
<h4><center>by Arabella Byatt</h4></center>

<h4><center> Helen's is one of the best restaurants we've ever been to.</h4></center>

<p>Helen's is outstanding. Just about any superlative will do. Stupendous. Extraordinary.
Superb. They all mean the same thing. If there's a restaurant in town that can top this Fan gem, I
don't know about it. It's one of the best destinations around for anyone who wants inventive,
well-prepared, fabulous food.
<p>Helen's has been around for some time now, but its latest incarnation is what makes it so
memorable, at least from a culinary point of view. Two years ago, the current owners (who had
both spent years traipsing around Richmond's restaurant scene, most recently having racked up
considerable culinary experience at Millie's) bought this Fan landmark and transformed it into
the jewel it is today. 
<p>What's remarkable about Helen's is that it so utterly lacks pretension -- thanks to its subtly
retro exterior and unremarkable but comfortable interior.
<p>And the menu, ah! It's chameleonlike in that it changes often. Our waiter explained that
things change, generally each week, though some items may linger for two weeks, and perhaps a
bit more depending on how well they're received and, of course, availability. 
<p>We started our evening with a sampling of "starters." Sauteed fresh morels in puff pastry
with champagne creme ($9). If any of my readers know a morel, I needn't go on. Suffice it to
say that morels combine easily with a champagne creme and the result is magnificent. We also
ordered the scallop katsu with fried noodles and soy butter ($8). This  was absolutely superb.
Hands-down another winner. Our waiter explained that the scallops were seared first and then
deep fried in a buckwheat flour. They arrived piping hot and seemed suspended in their own
orbits. 
<p>Our final selection from the starter menu was a requisite salad. The greens ($4) were dressed
with a red wine vinaigrette, and we were impressed with the distinct flavors found here --
including radicchio, baby oak leaf lettuce, curly endive and arugula.
<p>Main courses followed. We chose the roasted breast of duck with chili/garlic sate and
cucumber salsa ($17). The duck was tender and succulent but not at all greasy, and both the sate
and salsa made interesting and delicious accompaniments. We also ordered the grilled tuna with
gingered miso and roasted scallion sauce ($18). The tuna arrived cooked to order, and the
accompanying sauce, a brilliant green, provided a nice change from standard grilled tuna fare.
The curious but tasty combination of ginger, miso and scallions was blended nicely for a subtle,
good result. Our third main course was the fresh fettuccine with bacon, greens and tomato ($14),
and it couldn't have been more stellar. True to its word, it was packed with greens and tomatoes
and topped with fresh Parmesan cheese. 
<p>Portions were so ample that we barely had room for dessert. Somehow, though, we managed
to squeeze in two: the chocolate creme caramel and the lemon curd taco with strawberry salsa. 
The only disappointment was the lack of other patrons dining at this treasure spot. We
speculated that maybe traffic has slowed a little bit everywhere, what with June being a
transitional kind of month, kids getting out of school, hot weather, etc. But this actually worked
in our favor, as we could dine peacefully and listen to Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Peggy
Lee, and even Wayne Newton.
<p>Our evening at Helen's was marvelous. Our waiter anticipated everything -- from refilling
our water glasses to replenishing our rolls -- without being too rambunctious. The wine and beer
lists were well-rounded and interesting. Each table sported its own small bowl of freshly ground
pepper, a nice departure.
<p>My guest and I are "foodies" -- that is, we not only have professional culinary experience
behind our belts, but also our collective globe-hopping has carried us through the doors of some
of the world's finest restaurants. Helen's, one of Richmond's finest, is hard to beat.

<TITLE>Restaurant Review</title>  
<h2><center>Fan Double Take</h2></center>
<h4><center>by Arabella Byatt</h4></center>
<h4><center> Stafford Street Station introduces the Fan to "gourmet Chinese."</h4></center>

<p>The latest incarnation at 2329 W. Main Street (Main Street at the corner of Stafford) is
Stafford Street Station, with its new menu and new emphasis on Chinese cuisine. Although the
name of this neighborhood bistro hasn't changed in two years, the ownership has. The new
owner is Ann Sung, and she's been serving up "gourmet Chinese" for almost three months now. 
The menu boasts "delicious gourmet food, friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices," and while
"gourmet," in the strictest sense of the word (meaning "exotic") might be a bit of a stretch, the
claims of friendly atmosphere and reasonable prices are right on the mark. 
<p>What the selections lack in daring originality --almost everything is your standard Chinese
fare -- they make up for with fresh ingredients and healthy portions. We started with soups --
egg flower and wonton ($1.50 each) -- and both were suitably hot and tasty. An order of beef
fried rice ($6.95) arrived, and to our delight, it was neither too greasy nor too starch-heavy.
Here, the chef (Sung runs the kitchen) was generous with onions, carrots and peas. 
<p>For our entrees, we ordered poultry, seafood and vegetarian selections and were pleasantly
surprised with all of our choices. All agreed that the lemon chicken ($7.25) was some of the best
we'd ever sampled. Fresh lemon juice had been used (as opposed to the stuff that comes out of a
bottle), and the chicken hadn't been sunken and dredged to death in the batter. As a matter of
fact, the breading was lighter than the usual. 
<p>The Szechwan soft bean cakes ($6.95) were good, especially if tofu is your thing. They were
cooked with broccoli and carrots, and although this selection was listed on the menu with a
"warning" star (meaning that it's one of the hotter and spicier entries), it could have registered a
few octaves higher on the spicy meter without bothering the tastebuds one bit. 
<p>The sea scallops in lobster sauce ($9.95) were respectable, if unremarkable. Although the
scallops were of the frozen variety, they were properly cooked and the well-seasoned lobster
sauce made a nice complement that (when combined with the added vegetables) made for a good
entree choice.
<p>To our surprise, none of us was clamoring for water during or after our meal, as is generally
our custom when dining on Chinese fare. We were all pleasantly surprised and thankful that the
chef at Stafford Street Station wasn't too heavy-handed with the use of salt. Vegetables were
well presented and fresh. Often too much broccoli is used -- or too many baby corncobs or too
many peas -- which can compromise the integrity of the dish. The chef seems to have gotten the
veggies down to a science.  
<p>On the other hand, the service wasn't particularly a standout, and we felt that the TV at the
bar was a tad too loud. Also, we had to ask our waiter to bring our steamed rice once it had
become clear that the dish, alas, had been forgotten. Still, even with these minor snafus, Stafford
Street Station makes a nice neighborhood destination. The atmosphere in the Fan outpost was
friendly and cozy and the prices reasonable.
<p>Stafford Street Station offers delivery, which is always a hit with nearby Fan residents. Past
incarnations of this place have clearly established this locale as a neighborhood watering hole,
and Stafford Street Station doesn't have any intention of redefining that niche (the ample bar
appeared well-stocked). And while they seem to be fuzzy on a few of their defining
characteristics -- Chinese homestyle and Chinese gourmet are hybrid terms that make little sense
to us -- this Fan restaurant appears to be on its way to a prosperous future.

<H2><CENTER>Sandwich Simplicity</H2></CENTER>

<H4><CENTER>This new, big restaurant is a good addition to a rejuvenating Broad Street.
</H4></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Davis Morton</H4></CENTER>

<P>Eating lunch at The CornerStone Cafe invites wallowing in a big, comfortable space. As we
waited for our food, it dawned on me that folks in the area take the sheer expansiveness of our
interior spaces too much for granted. 
<P>Space in many American cities and much of the rest of the world is at such a premium that
shops and restaurants are often crowded and cramped. Sometimes, restaurants add too many
tables to bolster the bottom line, and living quarters are often too small for gracious living. In
Richmond, we don't often realize how spoiled we are by the amount of big, cheap space that's
available.
<P>The CornerStone Cafe is itself only one small corner of an operation that has brought the
majestic former Masonic hall on West Broad Street in the heart of downtown back to life. The
building, now dubbed simply The CornerStone, was grand in its original conception, and the
new owners have made it shine again. The first three floors of the building house public rooms
that are rented for social and professional gatherings. 
<P>The CornerStone Cafe is actually a huge room, perhaps 30 feet high and almost the length of
a major league basketball court, but the cafe space has been reined in with screens, the judicious
use of just a few tables, and a virtual forest of rich potted plants. These touches are especially
nice because they accentuate the expanse of the space, while making sure that it doesn't feel
cavernous. The room is pleasingly casual.
<P>The Cafe is open for lunch only and has a modest menu that sticks to the simple basics,
including a half dozen salads ($2.95-$4.95), a soup du jour ($1.95), and six appealing
sandwiches ($4.95-$5.95; including a Reuben, a roast beef and Swiss, a hickory smoked ham
and cheddar and a light tuna salad served on wheat toast). We were pleased to see a grilled
cheese and cup of soup on the menu. Sometimes, the simplest things complete the afternoon
wish list. The specials of the day give the kitchen a bit more room to stretch and show off its
talents.
<P>I was intrigued by a salad of baby greens, Brie and fresh strawberries, but chose the regular
mixed salad instead. This was fresh and flavorful with mixed baby greens, julienne vegetables,
and a tangy raspberry-walnut vinaigrette. Other salads include a small Caesar and a tarragon
chicken salad.
<P>Both of the luncheon specials sounded more interesting to me than the sandwich choices,
which are popular standards. Pasta with Mediterranean vegetables was a good choice. Fusilli
pasta was tossed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes, Calamata olives, and
Parmesan cheese. In all, it made for a very pleasing mix of culinary flavors. Thai-spiced shrimp
with basmati rice and a fruit chutney sounded enticing.
<P>Desserts were in short supply, which was OK because we felt sated and happy. Still, the
kitchen pressed an enticing concoction of a chocolate-chip cookie, ice cream, fresh strawberries,
and warm chocolate sauce. Sounded great, but we were watching waistlines.
<P>The towering ballroom on the second floor has been elegantly restored and should soon be a
popular place for big social events. Adjoining rooms, offering a more intimate atmosphere, are
better for smaller functions and business meetings. The upper floors are being transformed into
loft apartments, which should breathe life into the age-old dream of residential living along the
once-majestic Broad Street.
<P>In this world of fast-food menus and tiresome drive-through eating, The CornerStone Cafe
offers a civilized retreat from the working world and gives passersby a leisurely midday repast
without the frills and pretentious prices. It's also another chance to see a glimmer of old
Richmond and to sense what may be on the horizon for a rejuvenated downtown. Good things
are happening in this part of town, and we can't cheer loudly or long enough. Bravo!

<H2><CENTER>The French Connection</h2></center>
<h4><center>The French Quarters occupies a lovely space in the heart of
downtown.</h4></center>
<h4><center>by Davis Morton</h4></center>

<p>I hadn't visited the French Quarters since the transition from Michel's, which had offered the
nuances of classic Belgian cooking. Chef Michel's dishes were always subtle, often rich with
butter and cream, and they gave a continental twist we don't often savor in this town. The menu
now is traditional French with a few popular Italian dishes thrown in for good measure.
This lofty space hasn't quite shaken its identity as a temple of money-changing (the bar and other
restaurant features just don't seem integral). The architecture is impressive, especially in the
dining room, where the ceiling is almost as high as the room is wide. It's comfortable, though a
bit austere.
<p>The menu (in French with English annotations) offers three or four preparations in the
traditional courses -- hors d'oeuvres, salads, soups, seafoods and meats. There's a more
contemporary addition -- the "pates" (pastas).
<p>There's also a bit of sticker-shock thrown in. For a first course, my tastebuds salivated for
medallions de foie gras de canard (Specialte du Chef) but at $15.95 the tastebuds were told to
get a grip. Carpaccio de Thon ($6.50) ("marinated" tuna) is done so well in a couple of Italian
places in town that we settled for smoked salmon ($8.95); our server graciously received our
request to share and brought the very good house-cured fish with its classic garnishes of onions,
capers and herbed cheese on two plates, a nice gesture. The salads ($5.25-7.95) include the
ubiquitous Caesar, a mixed salad and a heartier composed variety. The soups ($4.95-5.95) are
also bistro and cafe staples -- onion, vichyssoise, and du jour.
<p>I can't imagine ordering pasta ($12.95-$18.95) as an entree in an upscale "French"
restaurant, but perhaps some do. At $12.95 I would expect linguini au pistou (pesto) to be quite
special.
<p>The entrees ($16.95-$28.95) include the usual fish, shellfish, poultry and meats. We tried
shrimp and mushrooms ($26.95) sauteed in wine, surrounding two savory stacks layered with
brioche and spinach (unfortunately not quite warm enough) and, according to the menu,
"caressed by a classic French lobster sauce." Valid concept, of course, but the tastes hummed
rather than sang.
<p>Apples, grapes and vegetables were good foils to two bacon-wrapped roasted quail ($23.95).
The flavors, enhanced by a good wine sauce, were nicely balanced; this rich dish was nicely
executed. Other choices almost as rich are a rack of lamb, duck, filet mignon, and a chicken
breast.
<p>We chose to end our dinner with a single dessert, a fruit cup ($5.95), offered in a simple
presentation. The strawberries were a bit soft.
<p>Good food is often enhanced by wine, though the wine need not be terribly expensive wine.
The wine list is not particularly extensive or distinguished, but most bottles are $20 or more. We
chose one of the least expensive reds, a Pinot Noir, and were offered a slightly more expensive
one when it was not available. A restaurant can make a lot of friends by offering, along with its
vintages, some casual wines at modest prices.
<p>We had a single first course, two entrees, one dessert, and wine, and our tab with tax but no
gratuity was around $100. The food was perfectly acceptable -- and in some cases, truly superb;
in others, just slightly off the mark. 
<p>We hoped for more from the waitstaff. Three servers, for instance, asked if we would like
dessert, but none offered coffee. We also felt a bit rushed, in and out in less than an hour and a
half.
<p>The jazz, a feature on weekends, was quite nice, but we found it a bit incompatible with the
small size of the room and the style of food.
<p>You can't give undivided attention to both, so they don't get the attention each may,
separately, deserve.

<title>RESTAURANT REVIEW</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<H2><CENTER>FEBRUARY 13, 1996
</H2></CENTER>
<H2><CENTER>A Southern Kitchen</H2></CENTER>

<H4><CENTER>by Davis Morton</H4></CENTER>

<P>It's misleading to say that Brenda's Restaurant is off the beaten path, because a lot of people
know the way to Brenda's, and it's a path worth knowing. (I suspect a lot of people who know
would just as soon we didn't know!)
<P>We discovered Brenda's when searching for an alternative to fast food while waiting for the
car to be serviced. It is not as convenient as fast food, but almost always more satisfying, so we
took the road less traveled -- one our mechanic knew well. In this case, to Centerville.
<P>Centerville? Take a left off the Rockville-Manakin exit of Interstate 64 west, travel
three-quarters of a mile and it's on the right above the Amoco station. Just 15 minutes from the
heart of the West End.
<P>You go to Brenda's for good, honest Southern home-style cooking. Places like this were
where we went before we called spaghetti "pasta" and knew about pesto and sun-dried tomatoes,
when restaurants were supposed to be clean and well-lit rather than soaked in "ambiance."
<P>Sometimes places like this promise a lot and deliver it straight from cans and packages.
What I like about Brenda's is that -- where it really matters -- the food is fresh, made right in the
kitchen.
<P>The two dining rooms in this rather new building are spacious, comfortable and decorated
with posters of NASCAR racers and such. And the folks, mostly locals, are likely to be hungry.
Some of the customers know what they want even before they sit down, and they probably don't
need to be appetized by wings, sticks and skins ($2.50-$4.95).
<P>I determined a long time ago that a restaurant's soup is a good indication of the quality of the
rest of the menu. At Brenda's the chicken-and-dumpling soup, with its rich and flavorful broth,
should cure most winter ills, medical and perhaps metaphysical, and a thick navy bean soup is
indeed comfort food on a cold night. Both ($1.25/$2.25) are good preludes for what is to follow. 
A chalkboard announces the daily specials, though several are listed on the menu as well. And
like true specials, they may sell out before the evening is over. On a Friday night, the New York
strip is soon gone and so are some of the side dishes, including sweet potato casserole. But there
is plenty to keep us content.
<P>Most of the specials and other entrees, with two side dishes, range from $5.25 to $8.95.
Some steaks and seafood dishes are more: A 12-ounce T-bone at $12.95 is the menu's top ticket.
Two thick pork-loin chops with side dishes of well-seasoned kale and creamy macaroni and
cheese, and another entree, a 10-inch filet of trout, crisp outside and sweet and moist inside,
were delicious. A side of mashed potatoes was as real as the honest and welcome lumps inside.
These and many other Brenda's offerings are the staples of Southern cooking that have,
unfortunately, become almost matters of nostalgia these days.
<P>That the yeasty rolls are large and homemade is almost as significant as the long list of
wonderful, old-fashioned homemade desserts, including lemon-meringue, chocolate cream and
chocolate silk pies (with wonderfully tender crusts), several fruit cobblers, and cakes. The menu
credits "Mama Ray," and our server told us that Mama Ray's biscuits and spoon bread are worth
a weekend trip.
<P>Indeed, the breakfast menu is so appealing I want to head west early on a weekend morning
for Brenda's Special Breakfast -- eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes or grits, gravy, biscuits and
coffee ($4.25). For others, there's chipped beef and gravy, corned beef hash, salt herring, fish roe
and eggs, and all that other good Southern stuff. I'll see you there, buttering two while they're
hot.

<h2><p>Spring Sipping</h2>

<h3><p>Books, Classes, Plus 10 Delicious Wines to Accompany Spring Menus</h3>

<h3><p>by Sarah Belk King</h3>

<p>Frozen, canned and dried foods make things like morel mushrooms, asparagus and
strawberries available year-round, but there's nothing like eating the real thing in season. Which
is why we all look forward to snowpeas and rhubarb in spring, tomatoes and corn in summer,
and pumpkin and fresh cider in autumn. Now is the time to make pasta primavera, risotto with
asparagus and to feast on baked ham, poached salmon and grilled lamb chops. Eat strawberries
every day from now until June. They're at their peak and will never be better than in the month
of May. By June -- trust me -- you'll be ready for peaches and cantaloupe. And don't even think
about cranberries and turnips for the next six months.

<p>Wines for Spring
<p><b>1993 Domaine de L'ecu Muscadet Sevre-Et-Maine ($8.99)</b> A crisp, clean, tangy
white from the Loire region in France. This light-bodied, bone-dry wine has a faint anise hint in
the nose and pleasant melon flavors in the mouth. Sip it with seafood soups or grilled or
pan-sauteed fish and shellfish.
<p><b>1993 Facelli Johannisberg Riesling ($6.99)</b> This dry, crisp, simple white from the
Columbia Valley in Washington state has a delicate, lightly floral nose and flavors of peaches
and spice that make a wonderful aperitif (try it with herbed olives, salted almonds and ham
biscuits) or slightly acidic foods, like main course salads. An excellent value.
<p><b>1994 Rossj-Bass Chardonnay ($42)</b> For a special birthday celebration (or if you
simply feel like indulging) try this luscious white from Gaja, one of Italy's top producers. It has a
bouquet fragrant with vanilla and coconut and the classic, fruity-rich flavors that make
Chardonnay one of America's favorite wines. Despite its richness, Rossj-Bass has good acidity,
so it's a top choice for crab cakes, poached salmon and steamed lobster.
<p><b>1994 Matanzas Creek Winery Sauvignon Blanc ($15)</b> Sauvignon Blanc's natural
acidity and herbaceous quality have traditionally made it a good match for tangy foods (like goat
cheese) and herbal-based foods, like pasta primavera. This one is no exception, and the addition
of Semillon softens the blend for a nicely balanced wine with crispness and complexity.
<p><b>1994 Pighin Pinot Grigio ($12)</B> This light, bracing white from Italy's Friuli region
has a vibrant bouquet with hints of herbs and olives. It makes a terrific aperitif and also pairs up
well with soft shell crabs, fried chicken and simply prepared fish.
<p><b>1991 Anselmi Capitel Croce Soave Classico Superiore Doc ($14)</b> This crisp, clean
white from the Veneto in Italy is one of the nicest ways to complement sauteed shad roe, crab
cakes, bay scallops or poached chicken breasts stuffed with goat cheese.
<p><b>1985 Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Rose Reserve Champagne ($60)</b> This rich,
spine-tingling, salmon-colored bubbly is the essence of spring, and a perfect choice for
celebrating engagements, marriages, graduations, or love and success in general. Although it's
delightful with miniature crab cakes and other subtly-flavored hors d'oeuvres, all you really need
to enjoy this luscious Champagne are crystal flutes and someone special. (Note: if you can't find
the '85 rose reserve, any good wine shop should be able to order it for you.)
<p><b>1993 Georges Duboeuf Moulin-A-Vent ($11.99)</b> A yummy, medium-bodied red
with a nose redolent with figs and dates. Good acid-fruit-tannin balance makes this elegant
Beaujolais terrific with risotto primavera, roast loin of pork and broiled trout.
<b><p>1989 Conde De Valdemar Gran Reserva Rioja ($25)</b> If you can't find the '89, look
for the '85 or '87. This Rioja has rich berry flavors and a lingering, complex finish. And if the
idea of a Gran Reserva Rioja seems too big and hearty for warm spring weather sipping,
consider the bold flavors of leg of lamb with garlic and rosemary or a steak on the grill and think
again.
<p><b>1991 Villa Antinori Chianti Classico Riserva ($12.50)</b> An elegant, silky wine with
hauntingly delicate berry flavors. Medium-bodied and beautifully balanced, it's an outstanding
choice for grilled salmon steaks, pasta with ham and peas, or broiled lamb chops with herbed
butter. 

<h3><p>Spring Semester</h3>
<p>Warmer weather may result in spring fever and an inability to concentrate on homework.
But what if the class had no tests, no quizzes? And what if you could drink wine in class? That's
just what "Steve Fox's Wine School" promises. Starting May 21, noted wine writer Fox will
once again offer his introductory wine course at Franco's Ristorante. The session meets on three
consecutive Tuesdays from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and covers the buying, storing and serving of
wine, how to read a wine label, pairing wine with foods, and more. The three-session course is
$95. (For intermediate-level tasters, a six-session course, "Wines of the World" is planned for
June.) Call Steve Fox 804-750-1759 to register. Checks or money orders can be sent to Steve
Fox, 10507 Walbrook Drive, Richmond, Va. 23233.

<h3><p>Required Reading</h3>
<p>Wine lovers, historians and Jeffersonophiles alike will delight in the recently published
"Passions: The Wine and Travels of Thomas Jefferson" (Bacchus Press, Ltd., $29.95) by James
M. Gabler. The book -- which just won the prestigious Veuve Clicquot award for best wine book
of the year for 1995 -- is a biography of Jefferson seen through his two great loves: wine and
travel. The book is particularly accessible to Virginians, as many of the places mentioned are
right in our back yard. There is no better way to celebrate Jefferson's 253rd birthday (it was
April 13) than with a bottle of one of his favorite wines and this book. Pick up a copy signed by
Gabler from the Very Richmond gift shop in The Jefferson. Call Pam Michael, (804) 644-3613 to
order.

<h2><p>Something New for '96</h2>

<h3><p>Some good wines to brighten up the cold winter months</h3>

<h3><p>by Sarah Belk King</h3>

<p>Buying wine can be fun, but it can also be overwhelming: So many wines, so little time! Which is why many of us tend toward the tried and true: The white wine we had at a party last summer is the one we reach for every time; the red we tasted in Florence in the fall is our standard-bearer.
<p>Although it's great to find a wine that you can depend on, it's fun to experiment, too. Why not explore some wines similar to those you love? Here are some suggestions which -- with the exception of the Brunello di Montalcino -- are terrific for everyday sipping. Open them now with abandon and enjoy. (the Brunello is kind of a special occasion wine, but I can think of about a million "occasions" for drinking it, like a blue jay visited my birdfeeder today, or I picked up my sweaters at the dry cleaners. Things like that.)
<p>If you like Chardonnay, try the 1994 Mitchelton Marsanne from South Eastern Australia ($9.99). It's big, mouth-filling and moderately oaky with a gorgeous, floral nose and a long, luxurious finish. Sip it as an aperitif, or serve with crab, roast chicken or pork tenderloin.
<p>If you like white zinfandel, try the 1994 Barossa Semillon from Peter Lehmann ($9.99). It has aromas of peaches and apricots and spicy, citrusy hints in the mouth. The low acid and slight sweetness make it delightful with roast quail or pheasant, pan-sauteed chicken or stir-fried pork. Or sip it at tea time with plain pound cake and biscuits.
<p>If you like Sauvignon Blanc, try the 1993 Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio from Mastroberardino ($14). The name means "tears of Christ," and it's so good it just may bring tears to your eyes. Made in southern Italy by one of the most noted producers in the business, it's clean, dry and crisp. Serve it with sole, trout or cod, or with pasta primavera or risotto with vegetables.
<p>If you like zinfandel, try the 1993 Horton Mourvedre ($9.99) or the 1994 Bogle California Petite Sirah ($7.99). The Mourvedre is made right here in the Old Dominion, and is deliciously full of briary fruitiness with hints of black pepper. The Bogle has a rich buttery nose which defies its spicy, currant-and-blackberry flavors. Both are big, mouth-filling, zesty wines that are exceptional with venison, steak au poivre, or big aged cheeses. Perfect for cold winter days and hearty menus.
<p>If you like Pinot Noir, try the 1990 La Casa Brunello de Montalcino ($33). This elegant, glorious red will send shivers down your spine! It's medium-bodied, with lush flavors of raspberries and haunting hints of cedar. Try this beautifully balanced wine with roast or grilled veal chops, or tuna steaks.
<p>If you like Merlot, try the 1993 Ceretto Dolcetto d'Alba Rossana ($17). It's a rich, medium-bodied wine with plenty of glorious berry flavors. Try it with simple canapes or simply prepared game birds, pork, salmon or mild cheeses.

<h2>Sparkling Wines</h2> 

<h3><p>'Tis the season for sparking wines and New Year's Eve bubblies.</h3>

<h3><p>by Sarah Belk King</h3>

<p>The characteristic "pop" of a champagne cork signals celebration and makes any gathering more festive. New Year's Eve wouldn't be the same without a bit of bubbly, but there's no reason to indulge only once a year: Sparkling wine is the perfect match to many foods, and it costs about the same as a good bottle of wine. Sparkling wine (the word "champagne" refers only to those effervescent wines actually produced in the Champagne region of France) should be served cold in tulip or flute-shaped glasses, which allow the magical bubbles to dissipate slowly. Remember to open the bottles carefully; a flying cork can be dangerous, indeed. To open, place a tea towel over the cork as you slowly turn the bottle -- not the cork -- which gently releases the pressure.
<p>Here's a selection of bubblies to celebrate the New Year, birthdays, baptisms, engagements or nothing at all. And please remember: don't drink and drive. Cheers!

<p><b>Taittinger Cuvee Prestige Rose ($47.49)</b> -- This gorgeous, salmon-pink elixir is the essence of what champagne is all about. Don't waste it on guests who think a sparkling drink is something with a pop top; savor this special rose with appreciative friends or a significant other. This wine's delicate bubbles and mouth-filling black currant flavors linger long on the palate. Enjoy it with medium-rare lamb chops, roast loin of veal or shellfish. (It's also lovely to sip while you soak in a bathtub surrounded by candles.)

<p><b>Pol Roger Champagne Brut ($25)</b> -- For the price, this is one of the finest champagnes available from one of France's most notable champagne houses. It's a medium-bodied, clean, dry bubbly with mild toasty flavors and hints of ripe pears. Delicious with simply prepared game birds, oyster stew, pasta with wild mushrooms or grilled salmon.

<p><b>Bollinger Grande Annee 1988 ($60)</b> -- In the new James Bond movie, "GoldenEye," 007 impresses his gorgeous companion by revealing a secret refrigerator compartment in his Aston Martin. In it lies a perfectly chilled bottle of Bollinger Grande Annee 1988, and I say, if it's Bond's choice, it's got to be good. And it is. The Bollinger dynasty is a veritable institution, famous for its elegant, full-flavored sparklers. The 1988 has subtle toasty flavors and is luscious with lobster, crabcakes, or angel hair pasta with cream and caviar.
<p>
<b>Zardetto Prosecco D.O.C. ($15)</b> -- The country that produced sculpture by Michelangelo and fashions by Armani also knows a thing or two about making effervescent wines. This Italian sparkler from the Veneto region is a creamy, gently elixir with subtle flavors of almonds and vanilla. Serve this medium-bodied bubbly with risotto, grilled shrimp, and antipasti of any kind.

<p><b>Chandon Carneros Blanc de Noirs ($14), Chandon Rose Cuvee ($18)</b> -- California's Domaine Chandon has earned its stripes for setting industry standards for the domestic production of sparkling wines and for good reason: Chandon produces exceptional wines at affordable prices. The Blanc de Noirs marries well with full-flavored fare, like Thai, Vietnamese, smoked and grilled foods. (How about a romantic New Year's at home with take-out and a bottle of Chandon?) The Rose Cuvee is an elegant potable, with grace and finesse, and haunting flavors of strawberries and lavender. Serve it with pork tenderloin, rack of lamb, or not-too-sweet desserts like pound cake and biscotti.

<h2><p>Jefferson Would Blush</h2>

<h3><p>Virginia wineries are world class</h3>

<h3><p>by Sarah Belk King</h3>
<p>Virginia's 46 wineries have much to be proud of. The first wines made in America were made right here, and nearly 400 years later, very fine wines are being made from Virginia-grown <i>Vitis vinifera </i>grapes; the kind of grapes from which the best wines in the world are made. Thomas Jefferson -- the "Father of American Viticulture" -- dreamed that one day great wines would be made in Virginia; his dream has come to fruition.
<p>I tasted Virginia wines about 12 years ago, and I was impressed but not amazed. I recently relocated to Richmond, and have had the opportunity to taste Virginia wines again. Now, I am amazed. The Old Dominion is producing world-class wines. Previously they were comparable in quality to some well-made California wines, now I tend to compare them to noble European wines -- those of Burgundy, Bordeaux, Tuscany and Rioja.
<p>At this time of year, it's easy to get excited about almost any kind of wine. Harvest concurs with cooler weather, heightened taste buds and the desire to eat and drink with gusto.
<p>There are more good wines made in Virginia than space allows for reviewing. The following tastings were based on wines that have wide appeal and are readily available at most good wine shops throughout the Richmond area.

<p><b>1993 Prince Michel Chardonnay, $14.</b> Fresh, fruity nose with hints of citrus and honeysuckle. Medium-bodied, pleasantly dry, clean on the palate with flavors of apple and Bartlett pear. Try it with grilled chicken breasts, pan-roasted oysters, or broiled swordfish. Buy a case now to enjoy next summer with soft shell crabs.
<p>
<b>1993 Montdomaine Chardonnay, $12.</b> Robust aroma with fresh peach notes. Medium-light bodied and nicely balanced with big, fruit flavors and a clean finish. Pour it as an apertif, or serve with grilled salmon, roast pheasant, roast, stuffed Cornish hens.
<p>
<b>1992 Williamsburg Winery Virginia Chardonnay Acte 12 of Sixteen Nineteen, $12.</b> Lush, seductive aromas of ripe pears; medium-bodied and extremely harmonious with hints of hazelnuts. Nice with simply prepared fish, steamed clams, pasta with shrimp or roast chicken, stuffed Cornish hens.
<p>
<b>1994 Barboursville Pinot Grigio, $15.</b> It's light, slightly spicy and youthful, making it an excellent, refreshing apertif. Ethereal flavors of melon and citrus make this a nice match to roast chicken, crab cakes or linguine with clams.
<p>
<b>Barboursville Brut Natural Sparkling Wine, $12.99.</b> An outstanding bubbly made with a blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes. Delicate, long-lasting bubbles; fresh and bracing with flavors of honey and vanilla. Pleasantly dry, serve it with ham biscuits, cheese straws, or Crab Norfolk. It's also terrific with fried chicken.
<p>
<b>1994 Oasis Virginia Riesling, $11.</b> Luscious nose with hints of golden raisins. Medium-bodied, its slight sweetness is a nice contrast to salty, spicy foods, like smoked trout, sausages or homemade lentil soup. If lightly sweet wines with savory foods are not to your taste, savor this wine on its own, perhaps with toasted almonds.
<p>
<b>1991 Dominion Wine Cellars Johannisberg Riesling, $9.</b> Rich, floral perfume with hints of honey. a medium-bodied, soft-edged silky wine that's lovely instead of dessert, or sip with not-too sweet things like pound cake, shortbread or biscotti.
<p>
<b>1992 Horton Vineyards Norton $11.49.</b> Made from a native Virginia grape, this deep, ruby-red wine has a big fruity nose reminiscent of blackberries. Medium-bodied, somewhat spicy with flavors of plums and cherries. Pour this luscious, velvety red with game, thick pork chops or serve with a cheese course. Its long, luxurious finish makes it great for sipping by the fire, too.
<p>
<b>1993 Oasis Vineyard Cabernet Franc, $16.</b> This blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot has a rich, heady nose with ripe cherry and plum hints. Terrific with roast lamb, duck breasts and coq au vin.
<p>
<b>1993 Barboursville Pinot Noir, $15.</b> This light-bodied clean red has wonderfully appealing raspberry aromas. It's hauntingly elegant, and light enough to sip as an apertif. Try it with veal, salmon steaks, pork tenderloin and lamb chops.
<p>
<b>1993 Prince Michel de Virginia Merlot, $14.</b> This deep, ruby-red wine has a big, fragrant nose with hints of cherries and butterscotch. A lip-smacking, medium-bodied red with excellent structure. Sophisticated enough to pour with game, beef, lamb chops and a formal cheese course, but also delightful with hamburgers and pizza.

<title>Doing the Brunch Thing</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<h2>Doing the Brunch Thing</h2>
New York and L.A.<i> do</i> lunch. We <i>do</i> brunch. As sure as the sun rises over historic St. John's Church in the east, the after-church crowd, dressed in their Sunday best (along with the just-plain-hungry in their "Sunday best-I-could do" outfits) congregate in local restaurants and diners, searching out the perfect omelet, waffle and Bloody Mary combination. Brunch -- it's such a mainstay of Richmond, maybe it oughta be a verb. Let's brunch!
<HR size=1>
<p><h3>The Sidewalk Cafe</h3>
<p>Whoever coined the term "neighborhood hangout" probably spent time at The Sidewalk Cafe.
<p>If you've never been to "The Sidewalk," Sunday brunch would be a good introduction. While sipping Mimosas or Bloody Marys (bartender Sean McClain can't give a number, but he says The Sidewalk serves a lot), check out the always humorous drink board, which offers a shot of Goldschlager for $2.95 whenever a Beatles or Elvis Costello song is played.  
<p>The most popular menu brunch items, says McClain, are the Huevos Rancheros and the breakfast burrito. "People like that hangover food, heavy and spicy with a high-octane Bloody Mary on the side," he says.
<p>I always order the ridiculously large spinach and feta omelet, swearing I can't finish more than half and devouring every last bit. The pancakes are good, too, and will soak up lots of syrup as you soak up the atmosphere.
<p>This place is almost <i>anti-atmosphere,</i> with seemingly no theme or thought about the decor; just whatever fits. A black velvet portrait of Elvis is crammed just above the pay phone in the corner by the front door. Caricatures of Bill Clinton, George Bush and Ross Perot grace the restroom door and plastic Santa lights dangle from the bar year 'round.
<p>Another big part of the Sidewalk experience is the music. The bartenders bring in their own CD collections. On Sunday morning you'll probably hear Sean Cannon's "cool and cocktaily" choices like Esquivel or Les Paul and Mary Ford.
<p>Overall, Sunday at The Sidewalk Cafe has a definite "wasn't-it-a-great-party" mood and many evening regulars stumble back in for brunch. "You were there last night," says McClain, "so maybe you can find your gloves." -- Janet Giampietro

<HR size=1>
<h3>The Hill Cafe</h3>
<p>An easy walk for Church Hill residents, The Hill Cafe is a casual eatery with a laid-back feel. It's a great place to drift slowly through the weekend.
<p>For those who take their waking slow, the cafe has a shelf of newspapers so you can use the printed word and cups of steaming coffee for easing into fuller worldly participation. If you're not up for that, you can pretend to examine one of the interesting photographs in the current exhibition on the cafe walls. The art here rotates monthly.
<p>On a Saturday, it's a quiet crowd that ambles in after 12 p.m. The pleasant jazz provides a background for dilatory conversation among what appears to be "Hill people" -- an extended family or a committee (it's hard to tell which), a few couples, rather subdued.
<p>The brunch menu is short, a baker's half-dozen brunch standards -- eggs and omelets, pancakes and French toast, supplemented by some blackboard specials that include a few sandwiches and soups. The entree items range in price from roughly $4.25 to $6.
<p>An omelet filled with spinach and sour cream is served with slices of bacon, potatoes, and toast. A pork barbecue sandwich -- a blackboard special -- is accompanied by the usual fries and slaw. Neither pushes beyond the ordinary, but we're easy on this lazy Saturday.
<p>Our pleasant server keeps our coffee cups filled to the brim. We've been around enough to know that life isn't always cappuccino. -- Davis Morton
<HR size=1>
<h3>The Strawberry Street Cafe</h3>
<p>If a bathtub full of options is your idea of a great brunch, then Strawberry Street is the place to go. The Strawberry Street Cafe brunch menu includes a variety of egg concoctions, including Eggs Benedict and specialty omelets, as well as sandwiches and entrees. Most folks, however, head straight for the bathtub. 
<p>The bathtub buffet ($7.95) includes pasta salads and fruit salads as well as scrambled eggs, hash browns and danishes. A vegetarian's dream, the bathtub buffet is a far cry from traditional spreads offering pancakes, sausage, waffles and French toast.  
<p>The Strawberry Street Cafe is great for families. Moms and dads prepare plates for their kids while older couples sip Mimosas and Bloody Marys. The cafe is also a popular after-church spot with the unofficial dress-code there called simply "Sunday best." This crowd is full of energy, and probably doesn't spend Friday and Saturday nights up late doing the town.
<p>A fresh flower decorates every table. Pleasant music fills this sunny spot. Most everything about the cafe is inviting and cheerful, from it's bathtub to its waitstaff, and it's no surprise that brunch at Strawberry Street Cafe has become a local tradition. --Clancy Thurston
<HR size=1>
<h3>Millie's</h3>
<p>It's hard to find a table at Millie's during the evening prime time. The same is true for weekend brunch. If you get there before the mid-day crunch, you can probably read your newspaper or linger over coffee and avoid the crowd, but that might spoil part of the fun. At 12:30 p.m. on a gloomy Sunday, the place is rocking with energy. 
<p>Rain has forced those in-waiting to seek refuge in the little vestibule and narrow entrance passage beside the cook station up front, but watching the busy cooks and staff is fun, too. 
<p>At brunch, a couple with two small children sits behind a table of gregarious X'ers, while a nearby table of adults is more subdued. The crowd seems to know each other and the staff, at least casually. 
<p>Like the dinner menu, the brunch/lunch menu fills the blackboards. Most brunch entree selections range from $5 to $10. A few sandwiches (rarely of the standard variety) find their place among the egg dishes which are the core of the brunch menu. 
<p>If you know Millie's, you know that even classic dishes from around the world get a fresh interpretation. It's "fusion cuisine," where things Asian, Mediterranean, Southwestern, or classic French may be combined into a single dish. Almost all the preparations are interestingly seasoned; all plates are finished with squiggles and sprinkles of flavor and color. 
<p>Eggs Benedict, for instance, is reworked with a base of rosemary focaccio, covered with thin slices of flank steak, poached eggs, and a hollandaise sauce that is finished with roasted garlic rather than the traditional lemon juice. A quesadilla gets an unlikely filling of lobster and scrambled eggs and is served with salsa and sour cream -- a nice complement of flavors and more lobster than I suspected. An omelet combining ingredients one might expect in an Asian dish -- crabmeat, asparagus, and shiitake mushrooms -- is one of the few brunch dishes that appears almost every week. Of course, there's always the Devil's Mess.
<p>Naturally, the blackboard menus change often. The one constant is Millie's fabulous home-fries. Millie's also has some interesting (perhaps decadent?) desserts for those inclined to break their New Year's resolutions. -- Davis Morton

<HR size=1>
<h3>Joe's Inn</h3>
<p>Joe's Inn, while not exactly a family brunch spot, has a loyal Fan following. The brunch menu has French toast, pancakes and eggs as well as a variety of sandwiches and salads. It's the perfect place to go if you and your brunch partner can't agree about whether to have breakfast or lunch.
<p>Smoking is still in vogue here, and lots of people light up with a cup of coffee and newspaper. The big booths seat plenty of couples engaged in love-talk, along with lots of people retelling the previous night's adventures.
<p>The eclectic waitstaff likes to chat with customers, but they also know when to back off.
<p>This is the ultimate "come as you are" brunch place, catering to a no-frills clientele. It's the place to go if you're looking for good, inexpensive food without the hassle. -- Clancy Thurston

<HR size=1>
<h3>The French Quarters</h3>
<p>This downtown eatery is a work in progress, but it's definitely headed in the right direction. Housed in a 1927 building at the corner of Franklin and Fifth streets, this former Security Savings and Loan hasn't quite shaken the bank atmosphere. The sound system was hard to listen to during our visit, and the decor could use a little warmth. 
<p>But the mauve walls are soothing, and black enameled metal chairs and white tablecloths topped with fresh flowers make Sunday mornings a fresh start.
<p>The menu was so rife with typos that, in some cases, we couldn't read it. (Oeufs Benedicte, for instance, is described as "French Quarters style of pwith mix greens on sdeoached eggs wtih ham on a crossant topped with holindase.")
<p>Not to nitpik, but when a menu is so filled with boo-boos, it reflects a lack of attention to detail.
<P>So we expected the same from the food. We were rong. Make that <i>wrong.</i> The entree special of the day, chicken breast filled with ricotta and sun-dried tomatoes, was beautifully presented with a fan of fennel, vegetable compote and grilled tomato. The chocolate souffle for dessert was excellent, cooked to perfection, as was the creme caramel. Earlier in the meal, the tomato and goat cheese salad was not only visually lovely, it was delicious, a generous serving of Mesclun with four large, warm, goat cheese croutons. 
<p>Cappuccino at the meal's end was the most generous we've found. Its $2.50 price tag was no more expensive than anywhere else (less expensive than some places), and it came in a large glass mug. The service was so accommodating that our waiter took the trouble to find a cup so we could take it to go.
<p>In spring, French Quarters should come into its own. Tables and chairs on the slate patio surrounded with wrought iron evoke just the kind of ambience this place seems to be going for. --Brad Bradley

<HR size=1>
<h3>River City Diner</h3>
<p>There's no brunch per se at the River City Diner. But breakfast can be ordered any time of day. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a diner.
<p>Still, the brunch types pack the first floor of this Shockoe Bottom diner each Sunday morning for the large breakfast menu: Eggs, omelets, pancakes, French toast (plain or cinnamon raisin), sausage gravy over biscuits and corned beef hash. The specials board offers perennial diner favorites like chipped beef on toast and River City creations such as salsa and cheddar omelets and chocolate pecan pancakes.
<p>The diner's retro feel begins with the almost life-sized cutout of a young, smiling Elvis standing just inside the front door. Cardboard or no, that's what I call a maitre d'!
<p>The crowd at River City is fairly diverse and more than adequate for people watching. The noise can get pretty loud, so feel free to bring the kids.
<p>By the way, if you do bring kids, try to get the booth that sits under the front half of the wall-mounted red Toranado with working headlights. Kids won't believe their eyes, and if you happen to have a 5-year-old who thinks he's Superman, you won't be able to pry him away from the authentic British phone booth at the front door.
<p>
Mom and dad will appreciate the booth jukeboxes with favorites like "Leader of the Pack," "I Think We're Alone Now," and the instrumental gem "Ginchy" by the Ventures.
<p>Reading the old-time metal ads on the walls featuring the likes of Babe Ruth pitching Old Gold cigarettes is a favorite pastime. On most Sunday mornings you won't get your food in a flash, but watching the short order cooks in the back of the restaurant making everything fresh to order is worth the wait. --Janet Giampietro

<HR size=1>
<h3>David's White House Restaurant</h3>
<p>Those who want to combine brunch with a short excursion can take I-64 to the heart of Providence Forge and David's White House Restaurant, so named for the chef/owner David Napier and the lovely white house, once a residence, where the restaurant is located. The dining rooms are cozy and intimate, one with a warm fireplace.
<p>Napier gives an interesting and distinctive finish to familiar Virginia foods. He may offer grits or collards and a flavorful sausage or Virginia ham with bourbon-seasoned apples. The food is often as homey as it is homemade, but it's also sophisticated, delicious, and never boring. --Davis Morton

<HR size=1>
<h3>Havana '59</h3>
<p>This place is perhaps the most atmospheric restaurant in the entire area. Nighttimes see this Shockoe Bottom hangout athrong with diners, drinkers and smokers, as the downtown, West End and Bohemian crowds mix. But even in midday light, the crumbling columns, naked lightbulbs and hanging laundry transport patrons to another time, another place. (Taking in the vintage tin signs advertising Chesterfields, Coca-Cola and Partages cigars, a companion noted, "It cost a lot of dough to make this look like a dump.") Pre-Castro Cuba was not just a time or a place, it was an era. And that era, blending chance, indulgence and cigar smoke, lives at this 18th Street cafe. The ambiance, regardless of the effort it took to seem uncontrived, suggests excitement and something always going on, even when nearly empty.
<p>Waitresses in jeans and black jackets weave deftly through boisterous patrons. And they never seem tired, smoked out or short-tempered, even though they'd be justified at times. They constantly have to deal with one problem: If you're there just to drink and/or smoke, you're sentenced to stand. (If you must sit, there's only the bar.) But those willing to throw down dineros for food not only get a seat, they get good eats.
<p>Brunch finds most people comfortably seated in booths or at tables, as the hard-cores don't show 'til sundown. A special brunch menu touts ambitious offerings that match the style and creativity of the evening menu. Eggs Benedict with saffron Hollandaise, for instance, isn't something the chef can just scoop from a jar in the fridge. Nor can he save it 'til next Sunday's brunch. So he's got to be in there whipping away on order. While something of a deviation in style, woodgrilled Asian chicken salad with greens, crispy noodles and sesame vinaigrette is equally innovative if not as labor intensive. Brunch standards are also available with Havana's own signature presentation. Huevos Rancheros, for instance, covers the entire plate, and tart Manchego cheese finishes it nicely. The ubiquitous Breakfast Burrito, initially brought East by movie crews eating off a catering truck, also showcases Havana's special flair, offering scrambled eggs, black beans, cheese and tomatillo salsa on a tortilla.
<p>Havana has something no other restaurant nearby has to this degree: atmosphere.  -- Brad Bradley

<HR size=1>
<h3>Avalon</h3>
<p>This Fan watering hole/eatery has been tops on some people's brunch lists for awhile. "The food's great," they'll say. But the secret's out: Avalon is a soothing brunch spot when you're bleeding from the eyes from the prior night's indulgences.
<p>Beer choices are many and special, like the Harpoon Winter Warmer or, as was the case during the holidays, the Anchor Steam Christmas Ale. Liquor is also available, and there's nothing like the hair of the dog that bit you when Saturday is still hurting on Sunday. (Hope that Greg is behind the bar when you go. He knows all the best prescriptions to mix up.)
<p>But Avalon isn't just a brunch for refueling. It's easy on the eyes, somber grays mixing with dark woods. (The truly compromised will want to hang near the bar, which is all dark wood.) Black and white photographs of swells from the '30s and '40s cover the walls: Truman, F.D.R., Bette Davis drinking from a spiked-heel pump, all set to a jazz background.
<p>An appetizer special on our Sunday morning visit offered sauteed mushrooms with Parmesan on top and baguette slices on the side. The soup special, Thai pork, was delicious. It was a fiery mix of nice-sized tender chunks of the white meat in a creamy base of coconut milk.
<p>One entree special, the steak and cheese omelet, was a bit bland. And the Jump Start, described on the menu as scrambled eggs with cheddar on an English muffin, topped with sliced avocado and Rouille -- a pepper sauce -- failed the spice test. The highlight of the meal was the bread basket, filled with corn muffins speckled with coconut.
<p>Avalon is certainly more than adequate in the food department. And, as a recovery room, it beats some of the livelier places around. --Brad Bradley

<HR size=1>
<b>The Jefferson</b>
<p>There is no more elegant and satisfying place to do Sunday brunch than The Jefferson. For the full effect, you must enter the upper lobby and pause at the top of the sweeping stairway. There you can gaze upon those already dining and marvel at the immense array of food. Buffet tables, accented with fancy ice sculptures, line one side of the lower Palm Court, and they're stocked full of every imaginable taste sensation. The Sunday Champagne Brunch ($26.95) at The Jefferson is a feast like none other in this city.
<p>The buffet presents a strategic challenge. Should one go for the fresh fruit and cheeses first or last? And how to handle the assorted breads, muffins and croissants? Hot entrees tempt both breakfast and lunch lovers. Oh dear, will it be the steamship round of beef or the sausage and eggs? Or the waffles and omelets? Shrimp, oysters and clams adorn the raw bar and smoked seafood section. Then there's the stir fry, made to order, and pasta and pate and fresh veggies and...
<p>Dessert is another meal in itself. Suffice it to say that The Jefferson has its own pastry chef and the man stays busy. Pies, cookies, cakes of all kinds and more. If you don't see exactly what you want, visit the make-your-own-sundae bar. --Carter Braxton
<HR size=1>
<b>Main Street Grill </b>
<p>Main Street Grill, best known for its ethnic vegetarian dishes and eclectic regulars, reintroduced its brunch this month after a 2-year hiatus.
<p>Wally's Breakfast, the star of the morning menu, includes a cornucopia of wholesome non-meat dishes. But chances are you won't miss the meat with the hearty sourdough hotcakes, home fries, yellow grits (ground by the Main Street Grill), eggs and a vegetarian scrapple, called Grain Street Mill, made from whole grains and beans. 
<p>The Wally Jr. is a good choice for those with smaller appetites.
Main Street's blackboard brunch specials feature a specialty omelet, muffins and pastries. Stone-age hot cakes made from whole grains and other traditional breakfast items -- including meat -- are also on the menu. What fun! -- C.J. Holland

<HR size=1>
<b>The Tobacco Company</b>
<p>The Tobacco Company brunch menu is sure to have something to please anyone. Old favorites include chocolate waffles, blueberry pancakes, crab cakes or N.Y. strip and scrambled egg. More complex entries are a smoked turkey boursin torte with layers of turkey, boursin cheese, herbed omelet, fresh spinach, red peppers and shitake mushrooms in a puff pastry or the roast beef and hash and egg casserole -- a two-egg omelet topped with roast beef hash and cheddar cheese. Southern breakfasts are served with cheese grits, scalloped potatoes, apple fritter, juice and a pastry basket.
<P>There's a "Kiddie Korner" on the menu, too. Occasionally a magician is hired to entertain table side.
<P>Jack McNamee, director of operations for the restaurant, says bloody marys and mimosas are popular in the spring and summer, but in the fall and winter most people go for coffees with. They've been doing brunch here since 1979, so there are plenty of regulars. -- C.J. Holland

<HR size=1>
<h3>Zeus Gallery Cafe</h3>
<P>Sunday morning brunches at Zeus Gallery Cafe are intimate. With six booths in one tiny room, this is not a good place to hide. Nobody's loudly slugging back Bloodies; they're quietly sipping and really <i>talking</i>. 
<P>Your own personal chalkboard tells of the offerings and the decision is difficult. For lovers of the breakfast side of brunch, there's the Cactus Cow, a traditional eggs-any-way entree. On a recent snowy Sunday I ordered two scrambled eggs -- the chef agreed to throw in a little jack cheese -- which were accompanied by two strips of bacon, cheese grits and grilled French toast, all prepared with Zeus's signature twist of Southwestern seasonings. 
<P>A friend had an out-of-this-world French omelet stuffed with grilled shrimp, blue cheese and tomatoes, topped with tomato-basil cream sauce. That and a cup of tea cost a very reasonable $16. Next time we'll try the poached eggs on salmon cakes or maybe the Cajun fritatta.
<P>Brunch at Zeus is a pleasant refuge for the slow to wake up. Couples review the previous evening's events and small families bring well-behaved kids. The key to eating there at all is arriving early. Try 10:30.  -- Carter Braxton

<i>Let Rosie hear from you by telephone (804 358-0825), fax (804 355-9089),or letter (1118 W. Main St., Richmond, VA 23220) or <a href="mailto:rright@richmond.infi.net">e-mail (rright@richmond.infi.net)</a></i>

<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>December 24, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>Season’s Greetings</i></b></font>
<p>A friend here at Style has asked Rosie to write about <b>the Yule log</b>. What is it and how did it get its name? This week seems a good time to respond to that request. 
<p>First, the word, used as a synonym for Christmas, comes to us with a lot of historical baggage. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, <i>yule</i> has come through many permutations: <i>eol, ole, yoli, yool</i> are but a few. OED says, “The modern form descends from OE [Old English],” but before taking on the meaning we use today, the word was found in Old Norse language as jûl (pl.) and referred to “a heathen feast lasting twelve days (later Christmas).”
<p>Starting in A.D. 900, there are citations of its use as meaning “Christmas and the festivities connected therewith” from many documents such as the Laws of Alfred.
<p>As for the Yule log, Rosie visited the Internet and found a charming article for children by Janet Shotwell in The Karma Dzong Banner, which is published in Nova Scotia. Ms. Shotwell writes “In pagan Scandinavia the winter festival was the yule (or juul). Great yule jogs were burned, and people drank mead around the bonfires listening to minstrel-poets singing ancient legends. It was believed that the yule log had the magical effect of helping the sun to shine more brightly.” (See <a href="http://www.shambhala.org/arts/fest/unconquered.html">http://www.shambhala.org/arts/fest/unconquered.html</a>)
<p>At another site on the Web, the Department of Canadian Heritage has posted an explanation of the Yule log: “There is a custom that on Christmas Eve an enormous log of freshly cut wood called the Yule log would be fetched and carried to the house with great ceremony ... the master of the house would place it on the hearth, make libations by sprinkling the trunk with oil, salt and mulled wine and say suitable prayers.
<p>“The custom, which dates back to the XIIth century, was known in most European countries, notably in France and Italy. ... Today, the Yule log has become a traditional pastry, a delicious cake roll, smothered in coffee or chocolate-flavoured icing and decorated with sugared holly leaves and roses.” (<a href="http://www.chin.gc.ca/christmas/buche.htm">http://www.chin.gc.ca/christmas/buche.htm</a>)
<p>At our house, the log will definitely be a cake, but whether you have a real fire, a feast, whether you celebrate Yule or another special festival, Rosie wishes each of you happy holidays.
<p><b>Footnote:</b> <i>Yule</i> is another noun that, through the years has been “verbed.” In OED there are references dating from 1670 that use <i>yule</i> as a verb meaning <i>celebrate</i>. Most of the references are perfectly respectable, but Rosie is too much the lady to repeat the one from 1670.

<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>December 17, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>In the Penalty Box</i></b></font>
<p>We have heard from several readers about some silly errors in our past few issues:
<p>Jim Ricketson wrote that a headline in Home Style was seriously at fault in calling two transplanted Britishers “ex-patriots.” This is clearly a case of a homonym run amok. The word we intended to use was <b>expatriates</b>, and perhaps even this was careless, for according to Webster’s New World Dictionary, one of the meanings of <i>expatriate</i> (in its primary use as a verb) is “to withdraw [oneself] from his or her native land or from allegiance to it.”
<p>It might have been better if we had written an entirely different headline. This is especially true since Mr. Ricketson called our attention to our use of the word <b>wee</b> in the same heading: “A Wee Bit English — Two ex-patriots recall their very British holidays.” Ricketson said: “Incidentally, too, I find myself wondering whether the headline writer’s choice of the word wee — though there’s nothing really wrong with it — might indicate some confusion of English with Scots.” Rosie agrees that there was apparently some confusion at the copy desk. Perhaps we will soon run a headline: “Expatriate copy editor takes more than wee cut in salary.”
<p>Several telephone calls from readers took us to task for the use of <b>whomever</b> on page 61 of the Dec. 10 issue. We printed: “Who could woo ‘the chef,’ whomever that may be...” Uh-Oh! As one caller complained we used the “omnipotent whom.” Correct — and we’re mortified. 
<p>Reader Chris Raymond reproved Rosie for falling “into the trap of the disappearing <b>that</b>.” Rosie wrote (Dec. 3), “A look into ‘The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage’ was rewarded by a fascinating entry which tells us ... ”  Ms. Raymond reminds us that <i>which</i>, in this case, should have been <i>that</i> because the sentence’s meaning would have been incomplete without the phrase that follows “fascinating entry.” Rosie agrees; she wishes she had used <i>that</i>. The rule that use of <i>which</i> should be restricted to clauses that could be omitted without ruining the meaning of the sentence is a good rule and relatively simple to follow in most cases. But there are complications, and a look at the new Fowler’s is rewarded by a fascinating entry that says, “The division between the two types [of clauses] is not an absolute one.”  
<p>Thanks to all the readers who wrote and called and helped us remember to be careful in our word usage.

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>December 10, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>Ambiguous Meaning</i></b></font>
<p>A friend has asked Rosie to discuss the difference between <b>ambiguous</b> and <b>ambivalent</b>. Rosie thought at first she clearly understood the distinction. <i>Ambiguous</i>, according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary, Third Edition, means: “1. having two or more possible meanings 2. not clear; indefinite; uncertain; vague.” <i>Ambivalent</i>’s Webster meaning is having “conflicting feelings toward a person or thing, as love and hate.” Clear enough, so far.
<p>Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage has an entry for the distinction between the two words: “<i>Ambivalent</i> is a much newer word than <i>ambiguous</i>; while the latter has been in the language since the 16th century, <i>ambivalent</i> is not attested until 1916, and its earliest citations are from translations of Jung and Freud. Its first use in English ... was as a technical term in psychology, but it seems to have found itself a niche in popular usage ... as a descriptive word for a state in which one holds simultaneous contradictory feelings or in which one wavers between two polar opposites. <i>Ambiguous</i> had earlier been used for analogous situations, consequently the words sometimes are used in similar context. 
<p>“But they are seldom really confused because <i>ambiguous</i> tends to stress uncertainty and is usually applied to external things while <i>ambivalent</i> tends to stress duality and is usually applied to internal things.”
<p>Two examples : “‘... in the matter of Miss Thompson’s ambiguous femininity’ —Diana Trilling” and “‘His intensely ambivalent attitude to his father ...’ Anne Freemantle”

<p><font size=4><b><i>Scholars and Athletes</i></b></font>
<p>Rosie was bemused to read in the Oct. 23 New York Times about the <b>NCAA</b> and students who have taken honors courses with unusual names in high school. According to the NYT many of the athletes are being made to sit out while the brass at NCAA judge whether their classes are “core courses” or not. An admirable objective, but the fax the NCAA sent to one student disapproving his English courses read <i>exactly</i> as follows:
<p>“Thank you for you fax regarding ‘Essential Communications.’ Do to the vocational aspect of the course, we are unable to approve this course as a core course. Therefore, the decision remains unchange for student named above.”
<p>Perhaps we should declare the NCAA official ineligible.

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>December 3, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>Try and Read for Content</i></b></font>
<p>The New York Times on Oct. 23 ran an entertaining article about Dr. Oliver Sachs, the author of “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat” and “An Anthropologist on Mars.” Dr. Sachs was quoted as saying, “I try and listen, I try and imagine what’s it’s like, I try and put myself in their position and sometimes I don’t succeed.” 
<p>Rosie was interested in the <b>try and</b> construction. We all hear it in conversation, but is it correct? Or is it just sloppy usage?
<p>A look into “The New Fowler’s Modern English Usage” was rewarded by a fascinating entry which tells us, among other comments: “Arguments continue to rage about the validity of <i>try and</i> followed by an infinitive instead of <i>try to</i>. ... In 1983 a Scandinavian scholar, Age Lind, examined a group of 50 modern English novels of the period 1960-70 and found that <i>try to</i> was likely to occur in certain syntactic conditions, <i>try and</i> in others, and that in some circumstances the choice seemed not to be governed by any particular reason. ‘If a subtle semantic distinction exists it does not seem to be observed,’ he concluded.”
<p>So far, so good. But what to make of the whole column devoted to an attempt to explain “rules” to help select the proper usage? “<i>Try and</i> can occur idiomatically in the imperative in such sentences as “Don’t try and frighten me. ... It is only when one turns to other parts of the verb (tries, tried, trying) that a gulf between the two expressions opens up. Try to substitute tries (etc.) and for tries (etc.) to in the following. ... He tries to center his mind on the sound.” 
<p>For once, the earlier Fowler (1926) seemed simpler, telling us in a brief entry: “It is ... colloquial if that means specially appropriate to actual speech; but not if colloquial means below the proper standard of literary dignity. Though <i>t. to do</i> can always be substituted for <i>t. and do</i>, the latter has a shade of meaning that justifies its existence; in exhortations it implies encouragement — the effort will succeed — in promises it implies assurance — the effort shall succeed. It is an idiom that should be not discountenanced, but used when it comes natural [sic].”
<p>Rosie was a bit sorry she had begun to worry about Dr. Sach’s wording. It would, she believes, have made for a much happier day if she had enjoyed The New York Times’ story and thought more about what Dr. Sach’s does for the neurologically disabled and less about how he describes it.

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>November 26, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>The Whole Megillah</i></b></font>
<p>The New York Times (Nov. 6) quoted George Stephanopoulos as saying “The big, big <b>megillah’s</b> going to be his peacemaking stuff.” The megillah? The American Heritage says that <i>megillah</i> comes from Sephardic Hebrew: “1. slang a) a lengthy, detailed explanation or account: just give men the facts, not a whole megillah. b) a lengthy and tediously complicated situation or matter.”
<p>Perhaps that is all that Stephanopoulos meant, but a more interesting and scholarly explanation came from a friend in Oregon via e-mail. He wrote: <i>“Megillah</i> is Yiddish/Hebrew for ‘scroll.’ The expression, ‘the whole megillah’ derives from the custom of reading the entire book of Esther, with its huge detail, during the Purim service. In orthodox congregations, young people are supposed to use noisemakers to drown out the sound of Haman’s name whenever it is mentioned. As you can imagine, this reading takes a long time, hence the expression, ‘I don’t want the whole megillah, just a summary.’” 
<p>If George Stephanopoulos is using the word in a newspaper interview, Rosie suspects it is a trendy catch phrase we can expect to hear more often. 

<p><b>Stylish Language:</b> A column by Tom Oliphant in The Boston Globe described some of the voters in this past election thus: “Somewhere out in California, near Disneyland, there is a person [actually several thousand of them] who voted for Bill Clinton, for the ballot proposal to abolish affirmative action, for right-wing Republican Rep. Bob Dornan and for the initiative legalizing ‘medical marijuana.’
<p>“That voter, a <b>California Dreamer</b> ...” Oliphant explained to Rosie that “California Dreamin’” was a song by The Mamas & The Papas. The term refers to the surfing atmosphere which spawned some useful phrases. This one refers to a kind of mindless contemplation of the beautiful surroundings along the California coast. It is the feeling you might get riding a good wave.

<p><b>Heard on National Public Radio</b> — William Lutz, author of “The New Double-Speak: Why No One Knows What Anyone’s Saying Anymore”: “If there’s one product American business can produce in large amounts, it’s double-speak.” Dr. Lutz tells us that <b>double-speak</b> is language that makes “simple things appear complex, turns bad news into good news, or simply avoids saying anything at all.”
<p><b>Examples:</b>
<br><font color=#ffffff>___</font><i>Negative cash flow</i> or <i>deficit enhancement</i> —an operating loss
<br><font color=#ffffff>___</font><i>An orderly transition between career changes</i> —you’re unemployed
<br><font color=#ffffff>___</font><i>A work force adjustment</i> — laying off workers.

<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>November 19, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>Fowler — 1926 or 1996?</i></b></font>
<p>1996 has brought a significant event for word lovers: There’s a new edition of the 1926 <b>Fowler’s Modern English Usage</b> (MEU). R. W. Burchfield, who edited the new edition, must be a brave man because the original MEU has been a bible to many grammarians.
<p>Henry Watson Fowler and his brother were responsible for the early Fowler. The brothers believed in rules and wanted to help their readers use the language properly. Mr. Burchfield also likes proper English, but he has brought the original volume up to date with examples from the 20th century and the inclusion of the International Phonetic Alphabet. He has also shortened many of the entries and to this undisciplined reader has made them more intelligible. 
<p>The preface to the new edition says of the 1926 edition that many of its entries “were gems of conciseness (or concision) with the distinctions clearly brought out. Others were quirky, opinionated, and based on inadequate evidence.”
<p>The entries in this new MEU are definitely clearer. For example, the discussion of the word <i>very</i> in the old Fowler takes more than two columns of fine print and begins with “The legitimacy of this, or at least the line limiting its idiomatic use, is an old and not very easy puzzle.” Fowler then proceeds to prove the truth of this statement. 
<p>The new MEU, on the other hand, discusses the same topic in 1¼ columns, using modern examples and adding a use that has recently become common — “qualifying a noun or proper name used adjectivally for emphasis” as in: “It’s a band all dressed up in green-and-black — very art deco.”
<p>This clarity is good for those of us looking for a quick solution to a word problem. But for delight, the old Fowler is still the champ. The entry in the 1926 edition for laughter begins, “Homeric 1. is now [a] common phrase whose meaning must be vague to many readers. It is especially the laugh that runs round a circle of spectators when a ludicrous or otherwise pleasing incident surprises them. In Olympus, when Zeus and Hera ...” We are then treated to the story of the goings-on on Olympus which gave rise to Homeric laughter. The new edition, apparently, does not have time to educate us in Greek mythology. Burchfield explains the meaning and closes the entry in a few lines.
<p>Rosie intends to use the new Fowler and be grateful that she can better understand some of the entries, but she will hang onto the old one for sheer delight.

<font size=4><b><i>Upon Reflection</i></b></font>
<p>A letter from reader Johanna Brudvig says:
<p>“Of the many things that bug me, one is the ever increasingly common and incorrect use of <b>myself</b>: ‘If you have any questions, contact Jane or myself.’
<p>“More and more often I hear people using the reflexive when they should be using the objective. ... Of course, many people also hyper-correct and say things like <i>between you and I</i>. It really grates!
<p>“As far as the reflexive goes, our ‘bible’ at work, the Gregg Reference Manual, notes, ‘DO NOT use a [reflexive] pronoun unless the noun or pronoun to which it refers is in the same sentence.’”
<p>Rosie is relieved when she reads a clear rule governing the “correct” use of words — a rule like the one in Gregg or in The Oxford Dictionary of English Grammar. The Oxford Dictionary tells us: “A reflexive pronoun is not usually considered acceptable as a subject in standard English.” 
<p>As usual, Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage is more permissive than our prescriptive manuals. Webster’s tells us that <i>myself</i> is often used to replace <i>I</i> as the subject of a verb, to replace <i>me</i> as the object of a preposition, and <i>me</i> as the object of a verb. Then, the editors proceed to give numerous examples of fine writers who have violated the “rules”:
<p><i>Myself hath often overheard them say </i>— Shakespeare
<p><i>...the Post & not yourself must have been unpunctual </i>— Jane Austen
<p><i>...it will find him here, as it will myself </i>— Thomas Jefferson
<p><i>...he judged her to be a year or so younger than himself </i>— Jane Austen
<p><i>Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bare you on eagles wings, and brought you unto myself </i>— Exodus
<p>When we use English, it is more graceful — and simpler — to follow the rules. But the more we read about usage, the dizzier we get. Perhaps the real rule should be that we should have a sensitive ear for what sounds right. As Webster’s tells us, “You will have to decide for yourself when such substitution is appropriate. ... You will note in the examples that the context in which each reflexive pronoun appears seems natural to the writer or speaker. Use it only when it seems natural to you.”
<p>Until Rosie can write as well as Austen and Jefferson, she is going to try to follow the rule she learned in grammar school. She joins Ms. Brudvig in believing that the “misuse” of the reflexive grates.

<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>November 5, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>Repetition of Meaning</i></b></font>
<p>Several readers have asked if two phrases aren’t redundancies.
<p>Stan Joynes is amused by the term <b>family heirloom</b>. What other kind is there? The Oxford English Dictionary tells us he has a point. The primary meanings of <i>heirloom</i> listed in OED are, “a chattel that, under a will, settlement, or local custom, follows the devolution of real estate. Hence, any piece of personal property that has been in a family for several generations. b) Anything inherited from a line of ancestors, or handed down, from generation to generation.”
<p>Perhaps the first meaning leaves room for a chattel or piece of real estate to pass to someone outside of the family. But in reality and in light of the second meaning, it seems that Mr. Joynes is correct.
<p>A second question about redundancies is more problematical. 
<p>A reader has suggested that Rosie look up the term <b>false pretenses</b>. A redundancy?
<p>Maybe not. It depends upon the intention of the user. Again, Rosie consulted the OED. The first meaning there would seem to indicate that the word itself implies falsity: “1. An allegation or assertion the truth of which is not proved or admitted; often with an implication that it is unfounded or false ... or put forth to deceive ...; hence, a pretext, pretence [sic].” But the second meaning is “the assertion of a claim as of right; a claim put forth, a demand ...” and “b) a rightful or justifiable claim, a title. “
<p>Meaning three: “the assertion or a claim that one is or has something; profession ...”b) the unwarranted assumption of a quality, esp. of merit or dignity; pretentiousness, ostentation .... 
<p>It looks to Rosie as if <i>false pretense</i> is perhaps a useful phrase in some cases and not a redundancy after all.

<p>Rosie liked the use of the word <b>winkle</b> in the US News & World Report (Oct. 11) article about Solicitor General Walter Dellinger: “Dellinger occupies the country’s most distinguished and embattled legal post, a job whose inhabitant is charged with winkling out issues of law from those of politics.
<p><i>Winkling</i>, according to OED, is a verb that comes from military slang and means “to extract or eject ... with a pin; to winkle out is to draw forth, find out, elicit.”
<p>Rosie wishes the best of luck to Mr. Dellinger as he tries to separate two highly charged issues.

<font size=4><b><i>More About Lady Mondegreen</i></b></font>
<p>Mondegreens about which Rosie wrote Oct. 8 are apparently not an unusual phenomenon. Readers have shared with us a few of their favorites.
<p>John Goode wrote: “If stenographic mistakes qualify, I nominate the following which I saw or heard in my years with Lawyers Title: <b>unjust in Richmond</b> for <i>unjust enrichment</i>. A claim denied as <b>holy and valid</b> <i>(wholly invalid)</i>, <b>Sovran immunity</b>.
<p>“Also, I recall an aunt telling me that as a child in church following the reading of the Commandments, she thought the congregation responded ... <b>incline our hearts to keep the slaw.</b>”
<p>From Neil Henry: “There are several that I know, but here’s one that we sometimes sing in our musical ensemble: A Creedence Clearwater Revival song has the lyric beginning ‘I see a pale moon rising ...’ which goes on to ‘Don’t go out tonight, you’re bound to lose your life. <b>There’s a bathroom on the right.</b>’ 
<p>“Well, not quite, but that’s what it sounds like to more than one listener. It’s supposed to be (I think, who can tell with Southern Rock!) <i>There’s a bad moon on the rise.</i>”  
<p>From Kathryn Fessler: “From a really insidious pop song of the early ’80s, ‘Angel of the Morning,’ lines in the chorus thus: ‘Just call me angel of the morning, baby. <b>Just wash my feet before you leave me.</b> (<i>‘Just touch my cheek,’</i> as it should read.)
<p>“...And from Glenn Campbell’s memorable gem ‘Rhinestone Cowboy,’ this enigmatic closer: ‘Like a rhinestone cowboy, Gettin’ cards and letters from people I don’t even know, <b>And waffles comin’ over the phone</b>.’ (That’s <i>offers</i>, not <i>waffles</i>.)”
<p>Jon Carroll on his Web page about Mondegreens reports on his informal poll of the most frequent Mondegreens. Two of the top ones: <b>Gladly the cross-eyed bear</b> (known in the real world as that fine old hymn <i>“Gladly The Cross I’d Bear”</i>). Also, “<b>‘Excuse me while I kiss this guy’</b> — actually <i>‘Excuse me while I kiss the sky’</i> from the Jimi Hendrix song ‘Purple Haze.’ Mr. Hendrix was himself aware that he had been Mondegreened, and would occasionally, in performance, actually kiss a guy after saying that line.”

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>October 15, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<p>A friend has asked Rosie to write about the constant misuse of the phrase <b>gilding the lily</b>. Just the other day, (Oct. 6) it appeared in David Broder’s column.
<p>Broder wrote, “Gore signals that he knows he’s gilding the lily.”
<p>Our friend cringes because the phrase comes, supposedly, from Shakespeare. But what Shakespeare actually wrote in “King John” Act III was 
<p><b><i>“To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
<br>To throw a perfume on the violet,
<br>To smooth the ice, or add another hue
<br>Unto the rainbow...”</i></b>
<p>Gilding gold — meaning to add excess — makes some sense, but gilding the lily does not. 
<p>Still, we hear it wrong so often that Rosie is afraid her friend’s campaign against the misuse is apt to be about as successful as Don Quixote’s against the windmills.

<p>A letter to the editor from Brett Busang and our response to it (Sept. 17) inspired Jim Ricketson to write. The controversy is over the words <b>rile</b> and <b>roil</b>. A writer in STYLE (Aug.20) used the word <i>roil</i> in “Missing Velvet Elvis Roils Saloon Owner.” The usual word would probably be <i>rile</i>. Our writer defended his usage, saying that most dictionaries prefer <i>roiled</i> over <i>riled</i>.
<p>Ricketson responded: “It does not appear to be true ... that most dictionaries prefer roil.” Ricketson’s dictionaries Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate (10th edition, 1994) and The Concise Oxford (9th ed. 1995) say that “while the words may indeed by used interchangeably, they tend to be differentiated: <i>rile</i> is the more common and preferred in the sense of angering, irritating...and <i>roil</i> is usual in the literal sense of agitating a liquid and stirring up sediment.”  
<p>In Rosie’s New World Collegiate Dictionary (1996) “to make angry” is only the third meaning. In The American Heritage Dictionary (1992) “to displease or disturb “ is the second meaning. In both dictionaries <i>rile</i> is listed as a variant of <i>roil</i>.
<p>This is an example of how hard good usage is. The difficulty of writing well is such that Rosie is again reminded of Mrs. Edward Craster’s centipede:
<p><b><i>“The centipede was happy quite
<br>Until a toad in fun
<br>Said, ‘Pray, which leg goes after which?’
<br>That worked her mind to such a pitch,
<br>She lay distracted in a ditch,
<br>Considering how to run.”</i></b>  (1871)

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>October 8, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<font size=4><b><i>Lady Mondegreen’s Legacy</i></b></font>
<br>A reader has sent Rosie excerpts from an interesting discussion on the copy editors’ Internet group. The wordsmiths have posted a lengthy series of messages about word groups they call <b>Mondegreens</b>.
<p>The interest in the word is credited to Jon Carroll who writes a daily column for the San Francisco Chronicle. He included the definition of the word <i>Mondegreen</i> in his book “Near Life Experiences”: “...the word <i>Mondegreen</i>, meaning a mishearing of a popular phrase or song lyric, was coined by the writer Sylvia Wright.
<p>“As a child, she had heard the Scottish ballad ‘The Bonny Earl of Murray’ and had believed that one stanza went like this:
<ul>‘Ye Highlands and ye Lowlands
<br>Oh where hae you been?
<br>They hae slay the Earl of Murray,
<br>And Lady Mondegreen.’
</ul>
<br>“Poor Lady Mondegreen, thought Sylvia Wright. ...when it turned out some years later, that what they had actually done was slay the Earl of Murray and lay him on the green, Wright was so distraught by the sudden disappearance of her heroine that she memorialized her with a neologism.
<p>“...The Oxford English Dictionary has not yet seen the light, but it will, it will.”
<p>Some Mondegreens are the misunderstanding of the lyrics of the Rascals’ 1967 song “Groovin’,” which a listener heard as “Life would be ecstasy, you and me and Leslie.” Actually the lyrics are “Life would be ecstasy, you and me endlessly.” 
<p>A friend at the Virginia Museum told us of his misunderstanding of the title of the song, “She’s a Must to Avoid” by Herman’s Hermits. For a long time, he thought it was “She’s a Muscular Boy.”
<p>The word <i>Mondegreen</i> has spread far beyond song lyrics. The copy editors tell us there is something called a Mondegreen idiom. This is: 1) a change on an idiom, cliche, or standard metaphor; 2) propagated by adults; 3) used by more than one person in the belief it is ‘correct’; not simply a homophone misspelling of a compound word; not a song lyric unless it became generally quoted in written or spoken English. One of these idioms we hear all the time is, “You’ve got another thing coming.”   
<p>If we believe this last one is correct, we have another <i>think</i> coming.
<p>If you are interested in other Mondegreens, you can go to Mr. Carroll’s  page on the Web at this address: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/columnists/carroll">www.sfgate.com/columnists/carroll</a>
<p>If you have a favorite Mondegreen, Rosie would love to have you tell her about it.

<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>October 1, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>It’s in the Genes</i></h3>
<p>With the increase of biological knowledge, more and more faults and talents are beginning to be blamed on our families. But there is a new one. Rosie has discussed this occupational hazard before: Those of us who care about words and their graceful and proper use find ourselves inadvertently focusing on errors. Indeed, even tiny errors, such as obvious typos, often interfere with our enjoyment of what we are reading.
<p>In the August/September issue of Civilization, the magazine of The Library of Congress, Editor at large Anne Fadiman has included her wonderful little essay “Inse^rt a Car<s>ro</s>t ^e.” In it, she describes the affliction of compulsive proofreading and lightheartedly attributes it to one’s genetic makeup. Her father, she reports, had even been known to correct menus at posh Manhattan restaurants and hand them to the maitre d’ on his way out. Her mother collected clippings with errors and kept them in an envelope for her enjoyment(?).
<p>This essay should be especially enjoyable to those of us who are responsible for copy editing or those who read carefully and have those proofreader genes.

<p>A reader has asked about the use of the word <b>deployed</b> in the following sentence from a recent newspaper article about Gulf War nerve gas injuries to the troops: “At 6 feet 7 inches tall and 230 pounds, Steve Robertson was a strapping, athletic National Guard soldier when he deployed to the Persian Gulf in February 1991——”
<p>Can a person deploy? the questioner wanted to know. Apparently not, according to the dictionaries Rosie consulted. (Oxford English Dictionary, The American Heritage Dictionary and Webster’s New Collegiate Dictionary) Deploy which means “to spread out ... so as to form a wider front” is usually a transitive verb or when it is used in an intransitive sense it is “to be or become deployed.” Does an individual spread out or can he/she be spread?  The use in question is at the worst incorrect and at best a distraction to those who want the language used precisely.

<p>From Horace McCowan: Three especially overworked political words, <b>mainstream</b>, <b>resonate</b>, and <b>about</b> as in <i>that’s what it’s all about</i>. Let’s hope they drop out of sight and sound.

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>September 24, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Ancient History</i></h3>
<p>In her Sept. 10 column Rosie discussed the origin of the use of <b>Democrat</b> as an adjective without the <b>ic</b>. She attempted to trace it back to the Nixon era, but didn’t even dream of how long ago it really started.
<p>Rosie is elated that since that column she has been able to find the story of its beginning in William Safire’s “The New Language of Politics, a Dictionary of Catchwords, Slogans & Political Usage,” published as long ago as 1968. Safire explains the beginning of this subtle insult, telling us that “In 1955 Leonard Hall, a former Republican National Chairman, began referring to the ‘Democrat’ rather than the ‘Democratic’ party, a habit begun by Thomas E. Dewey. Hall dropped the <i>ic</i>, he said, because ‘I think their claims that they represent the great mass of the people, and we don’t is just a lot of bunk.’ The University of Virginia’s Atcheson L. Hench said of this usage in American Speech: ‘Whether they have meant to imply that the party was no longer democratic, or whether they banked on the harsher sound pattern
 of the new name; whether they wanted to strengthen the impression that they were speaking for a new Republican party by using a new name for the opposition, or whether they had other reasons, the fact remains that...highly influential speakers...used the shorter adjective.’
<p>“Some Democrats suggested retaliation by shortening Republican (q.v.) to <i>Publican</i>, but the National Committee overruled them, explaining that Republican ‘is the name by which our opponents’ product is known and mistrusted.’”
<p>Apparently a good insult has a lasting quality.

<h3><i>Typo of the Week:</i></h3>
<p>found in the program for the U.Va. football game against Maryland on Sept. 13: “Frank Quayle had a big game against Maryland in 1996.” Mr. Quayle, who played halfback for U.Va. in 1966-68, is today one of the play-by-play radio announcers for the university’s football games. He must have been bemused by the typo and also grateful that, at his age, he was not required to suit up for the 1996 Maryland game. 

<h3><i>Talk the Talk:</i></h3>
<p><b>Corporate Whitewater</b> — heard on NPR’s “Marketplace” this term describes the atmosphere in corporations that have been downsized and the work load spread out to fewer people.
<p><b>Chinese Market</b> — term used by Nasdaq traders to mean “a disorderly market in which brokers competed on the basis of price.” Source: The New York Times. 

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>September 17, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Let’s Calm Down</i></h3>
<p>It’s interesting to watch fashion in words. As in everything else in life, we seem to latch on to certain habits and give in to them until they wear themselves out — or we wear ourselves out. A reader has called Rosie’s attention to the current fashion of describing everyone as <b>excited</b>. No matter how small the incident or the feeling, it seems to excite people. Our friend has sent two examples: One from a Richmond-Times Dispatch article about Capital One in which a spokeswoman for the company said, “We are excited about taking the first step...” Another came from a news release from a Chicago company in which the CEO reported, “We are very excited about the pending acquisition...” Rosie, also, seems to meet this hyperbole — the last time on the TV news when a newsman told us that the Democrats were “very excited” about their new Web site.
<p>The primary meaning of excited in the Oxford Dictionary is “stirred by strong emotion, disturbed, agitated.” If words are a reflection of emotion, then the fact that we are all going around excited by even the most minor aspects of life is probably not a healthy sign. If we could calm down a bit, perhaps life would be more agreeable — certainly our language would be more interesting.

<h3><i>Uh-Oh and Not so Uh-Oh</i></h3>
<p>Another reader has marked some clippings from Style that show us again that we should be eternally vigilant. In several of her excerpts, she caught us fair and square: We used <b>complement</b> where we clearly meant <i>compliment</i>; we used the nominative case of the pronoun <i>she</i> when it should have been the accusative; and our copy editor, in an excess of permissiveness, let the slangy expression “There’s some funny songs on there” slide by.
<p>In two clips, however, Rosie will battle for our writers: The first is the use of <b>safety deposit box</b> instead of <b>safe deposit box</b>. In Webster’s New World Dictionary both these terms are acceptable.
<p>The second is the use of the singular form of <b>worry</b> in the following sentence: “Parents and anybody else who worries about a lack of TV programs ... will be delighted.” Our reader thought the verb <i>worries</i> should have been plural, but, in this case, the clause <i>who worries</i> modifies <i>anybody</i>, which was used in the singular sense.
<p>Believe it or not, it’s great to have readers who read us so carefully and who care about the language. 

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>September 10, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Fantasy Land</i></h3>
Readers Charles Young and Rob Harris have both taught Rosie to be very careful about analyzing the writing of others — namely Maureen Dowd. They also explained the meaning of <i>empath</i>. The word may not be in many dictionaries, but it is well known to many readers. Mr. Harris sent Rosie the following e-mail message: “The word empath is fairly common in science fiction and fantasy stories, where it refers to someone who can sense the pain or emotions of others. 
<p>“For example, Counselor Troi on ‘Star Trek: The Next Generation’ is an empath.”
<p>Mr. Young and reader Guy Nelson further enlightened us with the observation that we have long spoken about people who are psychopaths because they are mentally ill, and about telepaths because they can read others’ thoughts. Empaths follow in this tradition because they can read others’ emotions.
<p>Rosie congratulates Ms. Dowd on her stylish writing.
<hr size=1 noshade width=20% align=left>
<p>In Francis X. Clines’ New York Times reports about the Democratic convention, he chided Sarah Brady for dropping the <i>-ic</i> suffix from <i>Democratic</i> when it’s used as an adjective and refers to the political party: “This was just as Republican zealots first decreed in the Reagan era in claiming only a lowercase form of <i>democratic</i> should be acceptable in America.”
<p>Rosie has always cringed at <i>Democrat</i> used as an adjective in such expressions as <i>Democrat Party</i>, or <i>Democrat candidates</i>. She believed that this subtle way of insulting Democrats began in the Nixon era. She believed it so firmly that she searched H. R. Haldeman’s book “The Haldeman Diaries” to find that usage. She could, however, find it only once when he spoke of “Democrat candidates.” In Ehrlichman’s memoirs, “Witness to Power,” also, the proper adjectival form is used.
<p>Regardless of ideology, the proper name of the party is <i>Democratic</i>. In a campaign so marked by incivility it would be nice if the title were used properly.

<h3><i>Not separated at birth? </i></h3>
From wire services reports in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Sept. 3: “Sen. John Warner, R-Va., a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, commended Clinton Dole for keeping his cool in the face of Saddam’s latest provocation.”
<p>Now, there’s a solution to this election!


<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>September 3, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Politics Still</i></h3>
Overused Political Words of the Week:
<br>• <i>diversity</i>
<br>• <i>all-inclusive</i>
<br>• <i>family</i>
<br>• <i>children</i>
<br>• <i>ordinary people</i> (I don’t know anyone who will admit to being ordinary)
<br>• <i>working families</i>
<br>• <i>extremism</i>
<br>• <i>compassion</i>
<br>• <i>paper over</i> — as in papering over differences
<br>• <i>triangulation</i> — noun describing how Clinton has positioned himself at the top of a triangle with the conservatives and liberals at the bottom corners. 
<br>• <i>scripted</i> — as in both conventions	
<h3><i>Invented Word?</i></h3>
Columnist Maureen Dowd this week called Clinton an <b>empath</b>. From the context, Rosie gathered that she meant that “he felt our pain.” But there is no such word in Rosie’s dictionaries. We often see nouns “verbed,” but it is not so often that we see a word like empathize made into a noun.  

<h3><i>The Dangers of Phonetic Spelling:</i></h3>
New York Times reporter Francis X. Clines, writing from the Democratic convention in Chicago on Aug. 28, noted: “Linguists had a harder time fathoming some of the printed text scrawling at the bottom of the hall’s giant TV screens in near-simultaneous tandem with the orators’ spoken words. One spellbinder’s reference to jack-booted thugs came out in the phonetics-driven device as ‘Jack Buddhist thugs. ...’
<p>“Delegates began nudging each other and leering. ... Mario Cuomo had been dubbed ‘Marry Oh Quem Oes.’ Another speaker’s dismissal of ideologues took on a darker meaning when the scrawl said they were ‘ideal logs.’” 
<p>Rosie hopes no one is planning a bonfire.

<h3><i>Redundancy:</i></h3>
Charlie Larus has sent a fax to Rosie asking: “Computers sometimes are advertised as being <b>preprogrammed</b>. Isn’t <i>preprogrammed</i> redundant?”
<p>Common sense tells us this is so. A computer is either programmed or not, If it is preprogrammed, to what does the <i>pre</i> refer? But, strangely, several of the dictionaries Rosie consulted all list preprogrammed without a hint of disapproval. The American Heritage Dictionary, for example, defines <i>preprogram</i> as “To program in advance; preset.” Even The Oxford English Dictionary includes the word. I’m afraid that Mr. Larus and Rosie are complaining about <i>preprogrammed</i> too late.

<h3><i>Breaking the ‘Rules’</i></h3>
<p>As Rosie watches the students return to college at Style’s neighbor VCU, she is reminded of an article she read last year in American Linguistics. In “Linguistics in Textbooks,” Walter E. Meyers of North Carolina State University discusses the rules students find in their English textbooks and the tenuous relationship, if any, those rules bear to actual usage. Meyers quotes a lecture by Harold B. Allen in which he explained a study he had made of textbooks in 1935 and in 1953 — a study that led him to conclude that “the books to which thousands of freshmen are referred are still all too frequently at variance with the established facts of linguistic usage.”
<p>Meyers carried the study forward through the early ’90s and in his conclusion tells us: “During a study of handbooks of composition that began eight years ago, I have come to believe that their authors know less about English — its history, its grammar, its usage — than those of forty years ago, whose linguistic awareness was nothing to celebrate.”
<p>Apparently many of the prescriptive rules about usage date to the 18th century when the prospering middle class began to try earnestly to talk like the upper class and seized upon a system of rules to help them do so. Some of these rules were lifted from British English and didn’t reflect the way any Americans talked. The distinction between <b>shall</b> and <b>will</b> in talking about the future, for example, was put into our canon in 1874 by the Harvard faculty, whose attitude, Meyers claims, was that “when American dialects differ from the most prestigious British dialect, Americans are simply wrong.”
<P>Some other “rules” that remain in the handbooks but which Meyers takes exception to are:
<br>• Don’t use the word <b>contact</b> as a verb.
<br>• <b>Data</b> is a plural noun, never singular.
<br>• Use <b>between</b> with two, <b>among</b> with more than two.
<p>To Meyers, the textbooks “come to exist in a never-never land, repeating their prescriptions ritualistically and ignoring what goes on all around them. ... [They exist in] an absolute isolation from actual language use....”
<p>Had she not long ago departed this life, Rosie’s elementary school teacher would have a stroke.

<h3><i>From the In Box
<br>Whom Again
</i></h3>
<p>Rosie received a letter from a reader in Oregon who saw STYLE on the World Wide Web. The note seemed to neatly sum up some of the problems we have had with <b>who</b> and <b>whom</b>:
<p>“‘Who’s Stumping Who’ is also a pop culture reference to Aretha Franklin’s album ‘Who’s Zooming Who?’(Rosie wrote that our headline “Who’s Stumping Who” was clearly an error. She stands corrected.)
<p>Alas, if only <i>whom</i> were an endangered species! It is becoming mandatory in one place in which it is clearly incorrect: ‘The police are watching local extremist groups whom they think were involved in the bombing.’ This is a corruption of a correct phrase: ‘The police are watching local extremist groups whom they believe to be involved in the bombing.’ The subject of an infinitive always takes the objective case.
<p>“Soon we will have the worst of all worlds — the pretentiousness of <i>whom</i> without the clarity of meaning it can give to complex sentences when properly used.”   
<p>Let’s hope our correspondent is too pessimistic, but Rosie is afraid that if you start looking for the incorrect usage you will join him in his discouragement.

<h3><i>More Tired Political Language</i></h3>
<p>Richard Bastow at the Black History Museum writes; “These days when politicians seem less and less willing to take a controversial stand, there is one statement you are likely to hear time and again, made with firm conviction. They want to <b>move this country forward</b>. Gosh, it takes a lot of guts to say something like that. ... I’m not sure how long this expression has been around, but I seem to remember Chuck Robb wanting to move Virginia forward when he was running for governor.  
<p>“Also amusing to me are these people who want to <b>bring this country into the 21st century</b> ... like if we elect the opponent, the clocks will start running backwards, and we’ll wake up one day and find ourselves back in the Roaring Twenties.”  

<h3><i>Redundancy of the Week</i></h3>
<p>A friend from the internet discussion group called COPYEDITING-L has called Rosie’s attention to the recipe for Apple Crisp on the boxes of Kellogg’s Cracklin’ Oat Bran. The main ingredient is described as “4 cups sliced, <b>peeled and pared</b> apples.” How does one pare an apple after it has been peeled?  


<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>August 14, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>A Couple Ideas</i></h3>
<p>If you do much reading you’ve probably noticed that many writers have difficulty with <b>prepositions</b> — or at least in selecting the preposition that flows smoothly from the previous word. When an unfamiliar or inappropriate pre-position is used in a piece of writing, the reader stops and ponders the usage and often unfortunately loses the train of thought.  The last such a preposition Rosie came upon is a <i>to</i> in <i>comply to</i>. Surely the writer should have used “with” after comply? In The New York Times (July 29) this phrase appeared: “in part out of concern of the political fallout.” Surely, <i>concern for</i> would have been better.
<p>Sometimes there is an extra preposition or the lack of one. A case in point is the <b>of</b> in <b>couple of</b>. It has always sounds awkward to Rosie when she hears or reads a sentence such as, “I will have a couple cups of coffee.” She is tempted to speak up and say, “Put in an <i>of</i> after ‘couple.’” But she was brought up short by the discussion of this in Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage. Although the editors say that using <i>couple</i> without <i>of</i> is “well established in American English,” they admonish that it is “seldom found ... in prose that aspires to formality and elegance.” So far, so good, but included in the discussion is an example from, of all people, E.B. White. In an October 1959 letter he wrote, “The first couple chapters are pretty good.”
<p>How are the might fallen!
<h3><i>Overused Political Words:</i></h3>
<p>Stan Joynes has contributed this week’s most tiresome political words. He is correct that <b>liberal</b> and <b>conservative</b> should be “eliminated from our civic discussions. ... That trimming would result in a substantial reduction of volume at the very least.” Another reason for care in their use is that the meaning of liberal and conservative is in the eye of the beholder, and the meaning depends on the context. The American Heritage Dictionary says the primary meaning of <i>liberal</i> is “not limited to or by established, traditional, orthodox, or authoritarian attitudes, views of dogmas; free from bigotry.” <i>Conservative</i> means “Favoring traditional views and values, tending to oppose change.” When we use liberal and conservative we should think about what issue we are discussing — or, as Mr. Joynes suggests, eliminate them from political talk for a while.  
<h3><i>Site-seeing</i></h3>
<p>If you have time to waste and want to smile try taking a trip on the web to <a href="http://www.amused.com">www.amused.com</a>. This is the Centre for the Easily Amused. You’ll find silly interactive diversions, headlines from The National Enquirer and many other time-wasters.  



<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>July 30, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Uh-Ohs:</i></h3>
<p>The increasingly prevalent problem of <b>who</b> and <b>whom</b> tripped us up in our July 23 issue. There, big as life, were two ungrammatical headlines that bothered readers enough for several of them to call us about them. In the lead article of News & Features we wrote “Who Can You Trust?” and in the headline for the lead Arts & Leisure piece, we wrote “Who’s Stumping Who.”
<p>Rosie has given both these heads considerable thought, and she has eliminated the first one from the error column because “Who Can You Trust?” was clearly a reference to Johnny Carson’s old 1957 daytime TV show “Who Do You Trust?”— even though later this show became “Whom Do You Trust?” 
<p>But the “Who’s Stumping Who” (without a question mark) was clearly an error, although, to Rosie’s sorrow, <i>whom</i> seems to be an endangered species. As “Webster’s Dictionary of English Usage” tells us, Anthony Burgess has written in the New York Times Book Review: “<i>Whom</i> is dying out in England, where ‘Whom did you see?’ sounds affected.” But Webster’s then opines at the end of its two-page discussion of the subject, “In speech you rarely need to worry about either one [<i>who</i> and <i>whom</i>]. In writing, however, you may choose to be a bit more punctilious, unless you are writing loose and easy, speechlike prose.” Rosie could defend the questionable usage in our headline by saying that we were “writing speechlike prose,” but, in truth, what we should have done is to rewrite the headline removing the offending <i>whos</i>.
<p>A fax from Bruce Goldman criticizes Rosie’s telling her “While you <b>watch vigilantly</b> for superfluous colons, (Rosie, July 16) you might also want to keep an eye out for redundancies.
<p>“<i>Vigilantly</i> comes from the Latin infinitive <i>vigilare</i>, to watch, and is a synonym for <i>watchfully</i>.
<p>“Please — watch carefully ...  alertly, intently, meticulously, scrupulously, or however you want, so long as you don’t watch watchfully.”
<p>Mr. Goldman caught me fair and square (another redundancy?). Rosie will be careful. 
<h3><i>Tired Political Language:</i></h3> 
<i>End something as we know it</i> — as in Clinton’s “End welfare as we know it,” and Dole’s “End the IRS as we know it.”

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>July 23, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Our rate of speed</i></h3>

<p>A letter from Bill Busby takes us to task for using the words “rate of speed” in the June 26 Street Talk “Roadside Memorials Becoming Common.”   
<p>Mr. Busby says <b>Speed is a ‘rate,’</b> (of motion, or distance divided by time), usually measured in this country in miles per hour, and ‘rate of speed’ has to be the rate at which speed changes, i.e. speed divided by time. When this is positive, it is ‘acceleration,’ one of the ways of measuring a car’s performance, and in matters automotive is expressed in terms of time taken to change from zero speed to a (generally speaking illegal) speed of 60 mph.”
<p>The correction is well taken. Rosie called a mathematician at VCU and he told her that Busby is on the mark. The next time Rosie comes across the phrase rate of speed she is going to feel very knowledgeable (and maybe a little bit superior?)

<h3><i>The Power of Words</i></h3>
<p>The new issue of <b><a href="http://www.slate.com">Slate</a></b> — the much ballyhooed web magazine funded by Bill Gates’ Microsoft and edited by Michael Kinsley — has an essay about words, an essay that resonates. The subject is one that, perhaps, our mothers discussed with us but that has not been much written or talked about lately. Titled “Maledictoratory, The high cost of low language,”  the article says that profanity has become commonplace, and “profanity served a variety of purposes for a long time in Western culture. It does not serve those purposes any more.” These purposes were emotional release and a safety valve for an impulse toward physical aggression. 
<p>Author Alan Ehrenhalt thinks that “The cheapening of profanity in modern America represents, more than anything else, the crumbling of belief. There are very few ideas left at this point that are awesome or frightening enough for us to enforce a taboo against them.”
<p>We are, he says, going to have to reinvent the taboo against dirty words.
<p>An interesting idea, and one that Rosie would welcome.
<p>If you have access to the web you can see the whole essay at <a href="http://www.slate.com/Feature1/96-07-11/Feature1.asp">http://www.slate.com/Feature1/96-07-11/Feature1.asp</a>. If you want to subscribe to the paper version call                 1-(800) 555-4995. The price is $29 for a year.

<h3><i>Overused Political Words of the Week:</i></h3>
<p><b>Leadership</b> — Both Clinton and Dole seem to find it hard to let this one rest for a while.
<p><b>Liberal</b> — as in liberal media 

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>July 16, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Mail Call</i></h3>
<p>A reader has sent Rosie a clipping from STYLE (June 18) in which we tell of a policeman who responds to a domestic dispute. Our writer reports that “It is easily <b>diffused</b> with some stern words ...” Our correspondent says, “[I]t would appear almost certain that in fact the word has been confused with defused.” 
<p>Rosie has discussed the word with our writer who told her that she meant <i>dissipate</i>. Unfortunately, The American Heritage Dictionary does not include <i>dissipate</i> in its series of definitions of diffuse. Indeed, its first definition of <i>diffuse</i> is “To pour out and cause to spread freely.” OED under its second meaning says that <i>diffuse</i> can (figuratively) mean “the reverse of collect or concentrate: to dissipate.” 
<p>But <i>defuse</i> does seem to be a much better word in our writer’s context to describe the policeman’s action. The second definition of <i>defuse</i> in American Heritage is “To make less dangerous, tense or hostile: <i>a diplomatic move that defused the international crisis</i>. “
<p>Our thanks to our reader who has helped keep us on our toes.
<p>A caller who didn’t leave her name phoned about Rosie’s use of a colon after a verb. Theodore Bernstein tells us in “The Careful Writer,” “[W]hen a sentence is not intended to be interrupted the colon is not used — more specifically it is not inserted between a verb and its object or a preposition and its object: <i>Two things essential to success are [no colon] ambition and hard work.</i>” Providentially, the call came as Rosie was hovering on the brink of making that error again. Thanks to this reader. Rosie will watch vigilantly for this in the future.

<p>The Internet seems to be a crazy place. You can find almost anything there — witness the web site at which you can arm yourself with insults couched in Shakespearian language. You type in your name and masochistically ask for an insult. Being adventurous and having a degree of self-esteem, Rosie wrote a request and back came, “Thou art a frothy swag-bellied pumpion, Rosie Right.”  “Thou art a pottle-deep warped bugbear, Rosie Right.” Fortunately, Rosie doesn’t know what these terrible creatures are. Should you wish to be insulted call up <a href="http://kite.preferred.com/insults/">http://kite.preferred.com/insults/</a>

<h3><i>Defending the English Language</i></h3>
<p>The high political season is hard upon us, and it brings a terrible strain on the language and, indeed, upon our endurance. It is a good time to remember George Orwell’s discussion of <b>“Politics and the English Language.”</b> Written in 1946, Orwell’s essay can still help rescue us from the political manipulators who would take advantage of us and fool us into thinking they are talking sense. But we have to make an effort.
<p>As Orwell says, the English language “becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.”
<p>As for the writing and talk we see and hear when we turn to politics, he writes: “In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible. ... Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. ... The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink. ... All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia. When the general atmosphere is bad, language must suffer.”
<p>One of the remedies Orwell recommends is calling attention to and ridiculing worn-out phrases. Their use really is an “invasion of one’s mind by ready-made phrases <i>(lay the foundations, achieve a radical transformation)</i> can only be prevented if one is constantly on guard against them.”
<p>Some of the examples he gives have, happily, disappeared from use. But Rosie is going to watch carefully the use of <i>values, values agenda, family, pro-family, family friendly, competitive, progressive, elite, individual freedom, patriotic</i> and the <i>saving</i> of any program. From time to time this column will add to this list of deceptively used political words. Send us the ones you nominate to eliminate from our civic discussions.
<h3><i>Uh-Oh</i></h3>
<p>Several readers have called us on a silly homonym we ran in our review of “The Runaway Jury.” The sentence in question read, “... this is the book both sides of the tobacco issue will be <i>pouring</i> through this summer.” It is hard to think of our readers treating their summer — or any — books so badly.

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>June 25, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>Followers of Islam</i></h3>
<p>One of the topics of discussion an Internet copy editing chat group is the use of the word <b>Muslim</b> to designate a follower of Islam. Shouldn’t we write <i>Moslem</i>? The simple response is: not any more. For many years, we used <i>Moslem</i>, which is, in fact, an Anglicization of <i>Muslim</i>. Usage has been undergoing a change that has not yet been completed. In a textbook “Man’s Religions,” published in 1949, the Muslims are called Moslems. Today, Rosie looked up <i>Moslem</i> in the  “Oxford English Dictionary” (1989) and found the following: “See Muslim.” “The American Heritage Dictionary” (1987) straddles the issue by telling us that “<i>Moslem</i> is the form predominantly preferred in journalism and popular usage. <i>Muslim</i> is preferred by scholars and by English-speaking adherents of Islam.”
<p>Rosie talked to Cliff Edwards, professor of philosophy and religious studies at VCU, and he told her that “<i>Muslim</i> is closer to what modern scholars think would be a transliteration of the Arabic into our alphabet.”
<p>He also said that there still are many textbooks and speakers who refer to Muslims as Mohammedans. This usage is based on the Christian belief that Muslims are like Christians. On the Christian model, the word Mohammedan would imply that Muslims are worshipers of Mohammed. They are not. They worship Allah, and Mohammed is the prophet of Allah.
<p>Fortunately, writers and copy editors who use “The Associated Press Stylebook” don’t have to wander from dictionary to dictionary. The entry under <i>Moslem</i> tells writers “The preferred term to describe adherents of Islam is <i>Muslim(s)</i>.” No ambiguity there.

<h3><i>Talk the Talk</i></h3>
<b>Balkanology —</b> Rosie found this word on the pages for the World Wide Web Bosnia project of The New York Times. The first time Rosie looked at the paper’s list of experts who are discussing the war on the Internet, the list included a professor of Balkanology at the City University of New York. The next day, the offending word had disappeared. Perhaps someone at the Times discovered that “The Oxford English Dictionary” has no listing for <i>Balkanology</i> — though Betty Holmes of the Richmond Public Library found <i>Balkanic</i> and <i>Balkanoid</i>.   

<hr size=1>
<h2><tt><font color=#004a4a>June 18, 1996</font></tt></h2>
<h3><i>When It Comes To Questions</i></h3>
<p>Rosie’s readers have asked several interesting questions this week. One from James Davis inquired, “Is it just me, or are more people using the innocuous phrase, <b>‘When it comes to...’</b> these days? For example, newscasters say, ‘When it comes to restaurants, Richmond has the best.’ When WHAT comes to restaurants? ...Isn’t this just an unnecessary, overused phrase that everybody uses because everybody else uses it?”
<p>The answer to this is that no one knows <i>what</i> comes to restaurants. The phrase <i>when it comes to</i> is an idiom — a figure of speech that can’t be understood from the individual meaning of its elements.
<p>There is, though, a technical description of the <i>it</i> in the <i>comes to</i> idiom. Dr. Nicholas Sharp, associate chairman of the VCU English department, tells Rosie that “<i>it</i> is one of a whole group of expletives that we use when we need a subject but there is no subject. We say <i>it’s raining</i>, or <i>it’s cold</i>. What’s cold? The nature of expletive construction is that you put in a vague pronoun when grammar requires a noun.” 
<p>So, when it comes to the phrase Mr. Davis complains about, Rosie can’t find fault with it technically. But his complaint that it is overused is probably correct. Sometimes it seems that language is as catching as a disease. We hear a phrase, and when we next write or speak, it seems to pop into our minds.
<p>Ralph Shupe called to tell of his despair at the increasing use of <b>at</b> as the last word in a sentence such as <i>This is where we’re at.</i> He has heard it on TV and cringed each time. He’s right to cringe.  
<p>Also, he asks Rosie to frown on the use of return back. This is a redundancy, complains Shupe. He is correct, and it would be the better if we dispensed with both of these usages.

<h3><i>Expect the Unexpected</i></h3>

Those who follow pop music can’t escape Alanis Morissette’s record <b>Ironic</b>. Billboard magazine’s June 6 issue reports that it is No. 7 on its list of the Hot 100 Singles. Popular or not, there is controversy about the lyrics which include:
<p><quote>
“An old man turned 98
<br>He won the lottery and died the next day
<br>It’s a black fly in your chardonnay
<br>It’s a death row pardon two minutes too late
<br>Isn’t it ironic don’t you think?
<br>It’s like rain on your wedding day
<br>It’s a free ride when you’ve already paid
<br>It’s the good advice that you just didn’t take
<br>Who would’ve thought ... it figures”</quote>

<p>Rosie has been asked if the title really fits those lyrics. What is the meaning of <i>irony</i>? Aren’t the things Morissette describes just plain unfortunate instead of ironic?
<p>Tough question. Rolling Stone agrees with that criticism and reported in its June 13 issue that semanticists across the country were critical of the song’s use of <i>ironic</i>. Indeed, the magazine asks rhetorically: “...given our school system, what would you prefer: a teen populace with the wrong idea of the word’s meaning or one with no idea at all?”  But Morissette’s use of the word can be defended. “The American Heritage Dictionary” gives as its definition of <i>ironic</i>: “poignantly contrary to what was expected or intended.”
<p>Rosie consulted a friend who is a professor of English at VCU.  He agrees with American Heritage and says that the word is probably used correctly in a technical sense. But, he says, some of Morissette’s expectations “seem extraordinarily egocentric.”
<p>We may not admire her for this, but like Rosie’s friend we have to admit that “The ability to appreciate irony is not reserved for the selfless.” And, just maybe, the musician meant us to appreciate the juxtaposition of death with a fly in a glass of wine.

<h3><i>Regardless of Dictionaries</i></h3>
One of STYLE's writers came in the other day bearing bad news. She said that she had been told that "The Oxford English Dictionary" has included the atrocious word <b>irregardless</b> in the lexicon. The OED has been one of Rosie's bibles and she was shocked.<p>
Our informant was correct, although OED can't be reported to completely approve of the word. The editors describe it as: "Chiefly N. Ameri.(Prob. blend of <i>irrespective</i> and <i>regardless</i>.) In non-standard or humorous use; regardless."<p>
The first instance OED gives dates from 1912 &#151; not from Eisenhower as Rosie had always secretly thought.<p>
OED is not the only dictionary to capitulate &#151; if only partially &#151; to <B>irregardless</B>. "The Random House Dictionary of the English Language" also includes it with the following explanation: "Those who use it including on occasion educated speakers, may do so from a desire to add emphasis."<p> 
And "The American Heritage Dictionary" discusses it with one of its amusing usage notes telling us "...it is a form that many people mistakenly believe to be a correct usage in formal style but that in fact has no legitimate antecedents in with standard or nonstandard varieties."<p>
For once, "Webster's Dictionary of English Usage," which Rosie has found to be generally permissive, is more prescriptive than the other reference books. The editors come down firmly with the instruction: "Use <i>regardless</i> instead."<p>
Style's computer grammar-checker agrees because it stops each time it comes to the word and insists "<i>Irregardless</i>¯ is not a word. Try <i>regardless</i>." Rosie's sentiments exactly.<br>
<h3><i>Talk the Talk</i></h3>
<B>Sippy</B> &#151; "A financially secure consumer, aged fifty-five to eighty, having been married at least once and in good health who is a member of a large segment of the senior population commanding 30 percent of the discretionary funds in the marketplace." Source: "Word Watch" by Anne H. Soukhanov.<br>
<h3><i>Don’t Talk This Talk</i></h3>
A fashion article in The New York Times on Tuesday, May 7, refers to what fashion commentators are calling <b> the heroin look</b> &#151; a description of current hip styles that emphasize the messy knotted hair and clammy skin we see on some of the New York fashion runways and in British magazines. We can only hope this look and this term both are ephemeral. <br>

<p><font size=6><b>W</b></font>hite Virginians in general, and Richmonders in particular, have for many years assumed and acted as if issues of race and racism were not pressing and were other peoples’ problems.
<p>Lynching was never the sport in Virginia that it was in the Deep South. Since the turn of the century, the KKK was never the force here that it was even in states like Indiana. Federal troops weren’t needed to integrate Virginia schools after Brown v. Kansas, as was the case in Little Rock. And during the turbulent 1960s, especially in the wake of Martin Luther King’s assassination, much was made of the fact that Virginia experienced none of the racial violence which tormented other cities, both North and South.
<p>People like Bob Crumpler, the Newport News Nissan dealer who was recently videotaped using racial slurs, are dismissed as “tacky,” or as “white trash,” the exceptions to the rule of Virginia gentility in race relations.
<p>But while whites may try to dismiss Crumpler as an aberration, African Americans may not feel so sanguine. Too many of the headlines these days argue that racism is again a growing problem in Virginia and in Richmond itself. The physical violence of church burnings and the verbal violence of the Bob Crumplers of Virginia are just the most visible manifestations of Virginia’s and Richmond’s continuing struggle with issues of race. Black Virginia farmers are denied loans; Richmond blacks are denied equal housing opportunity; African Americans here and elsewhere applying for mortgages or insurance are “red-lined”; blacks are denied car rentals; black patrons are denied food at restaurants; an uproar occurs over an African-American figure on Monument Avenue. These events all occurred within the past year or two. They are not from the South’s deep, dark past. The litany could go on.
<p>But when black voices are raised to protest these injustices, whites in the press and positions of political power often either downplay their significance or suggest that the status quo is just fine. After all, Doug Wilder was elected Governor. And doesn’t Richmond have a black mayor, a majority-black city council, a black city manager and police chief, an excellent black university? What is the problem? Isn’t equal opportunity here? Why are black folk worried?
<p>The problem may well be one of historical perspective. White Virginians are often selectively proud of their history and either ignore or are ignorant of that history which doesn’t mesh with their image of Virginia’s greatness. The same history which some Virginians venerate often holds little but painful memories for many blacks. And African Americans are as aware as whites that the past informs the present.
<p>In the continental United States, slavery began in Virginia. It matters not whether one argues that the Civil War was fought not over slavery but states’ rights. The fact is that at the base of the states’ rights argument was the desire of Southerners to hold slaves at a time when the rest of the Western World had abandoned the practice. Virginians chose to fight on the side of the South. Rightly or wrongly, that fact resonates for African Americans today.
<p>And it is true that the schools in Virginia were integrated with relative peace. But that ignores the fact that Prince Edward County was one of the defendants in the case, that Prince Edward County shut down its schools entirely rather than admit blacks, and that the editor of The Richmond News Leader dredged up the discredited 19th-century concept of “interposition” to lead the fight for Massive Resistance to school integration.
<p>Yes, Doug Wilder was elected governor, and Richmond does have a black majority council, but it was only 30 years ago that African Americans really got the vote in Virginia. It took 100 years and “meddling by the federal government,” anathema to most Virginia editors and politicians, in the form of the Voting Rights Act to secure black Richmonders and Virginians the rights promised by the 14th Amendment. The Byrd machine and the Richmond Forwarders of the 1950s and 60s did not yield power or rights gracefully.
<p>People of a certain age (mine) remember when Richmond was as segregated as any South African city under apartheid. The “Whites Only” and “Colored” signs have been gone only a little more than 30 years.
<p>When I told a class of college students that I remembered parades when the north side of Broad Street was black and the south side was white, they looked at me as if I were from another planet. When I told them that interracial marriage was illegal in Virginia until 1967, they were incredulous.
<p>Along with Washington, Jefferson and Lee, as well as Carter Woodson, Maggie Walker and John Jasper, this is part of Virginia’s past, and it is one prism through which all might do well to view the present. Seen in the light of distant and recent history, is there any real wonder why African Americans are not as optimistic about the future as whites?

<font size=6><b>Recycling a Bad Idea</b></font>

<p><font size=6><b>W</b></font>e’ve been through this before.
<p>About 100 years ago, people justified the huge and growing gap between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, through Herbert Spencer’s idea of applying the principles of evolution to everything. According to Spencer’s theory, which came to be called social Darwinism, the rich and mighty got that way through natural selection — survival of the fittest.
<p>Taking Thomas Jefferson’s idea of “a natural aristocracy among men” and turning it on its ear, sociologist and economist William Graham Sumner argued, “The men who are competent to organize great enterprises and to handle great amounts of capital must be found by natural selection, not by political election.”
<p>A cadre of modern social Darwinists are dusting off the old arguments. A Greek chorus — of politicians, bankers, stock brokers, economists and professional opinion-holders — is singing snippets of a song that would be familiar to Andrew Carnegie. The Wise Use Movement and others who preach property rights uber alles echo what Carnegie wrote in “Wealth,” published 107 years ago. Carnegie asserted that “upon the sacredness of property civilization itself depends — the right of the laborer to his hundred dollars in the savings bank, and equally the right of the millionaire to his millions. Not evil, but good, has come to the race from the accumulation of wealth by those who have the ability and energy to produce it.”
<p>Sumner went further. He not only argued that democracy is “a consequence” of capitalism but also that democracy “has never done anything, either in politics, social affairs, or industry, to prove its power to bless mankind.”
<p>Sumner admitted that, “It is at any rate a tough old world” and that poverty and want are byproducts of a changing society. Sumner said he was willing to pay that price. But he wasn’t paying the price. As a professor at Yale, he was not likely to feel the harshest effects of social Darwinism. Neither are the people making the loudest noises about what they see as the fetters government and society have put on the great capitalist engine.
<p>Speaking at a business forum sponsored by Emory & Henry College, Robert Genetski, senior managing director of Chicago Capital, spoke confidently of the changes to come because of computer chips, the telecommunications revolution and the spread of democracy they will cause. “These powerful forces,” he said, “are going to overwhelm the political opposition that’s out there trying to preserve the status quo.” Once the status quo is swept away, Genetski preaches, these powerful forces will “move us back” to a time of increased power for individuals.
<p>When was that time?
<p>In testimony before the United States Joint Economic Committee, Genetski said, “Throughout most of its history, U.S. economic policies placed maximum power and responsibility in the hands of individuals. Policies began to shift away from these pro-growth, classical principles in three waves. The first wave came in response to the Great Depression. ...By the late 1960s, policies allowing for government control over the lives of individuals entered a second wave. ... The final wave of government control occurred during President Carter’s administration.”
<p>Contrary to Genetski’s new social Darwinist mythology, the federal government has meddled in economics from the beginning. The first rebellion the republic faced came from folks who didn’t want to pay a tax on the whiskey they manufactured. Tariffs were one of two political subjects certain to generate an argument before the Civil War. The supremacy of the federal government was established in the Lincoln administration, not the Carter administration. America was 100 years old before the laissez faire doctrine Genetski advocates held any capital.
<p>The new social Darwinists are pushing a theory even harsher in some ways than the original. While the new breed advocates the reduction of every tax imaginable — one of the changes that will bring power to the people, they say — at least some of the originals had a different idea. Carnegie, for example, was very much in favor of high estate taxes. “The growing disposition to tax more and more heavily large estates left at death is a cheering indication of the growth of a salutary change in public opinion,” he wrote. “... It is desirable that nations go much further in this direction.”
<p>Carnegie’s idea was that “accumulation of wealth” brought an accumulation of responsibility, a notion that seems foreign to the new social Darwinists.
<p>When social Darwinism imposed the model of natural selection on society, some people argued that cooperation is at least as common in nature as competition and that unnatural practices such as selective breeding often produce more beneficial results than uncontrolled competition. The anti-Darwinists’ argument didn’t get very far. Maybe their heirs will fare better if they can make people understand what the Spencerian-Darwinian catch phrase really means.
<p>“Survival of the fittest” doesn’t mean survival of the best, strongest, smartest or most creative. It means survival of the fittest to survive. By that measure, fruit flies, rats and cockroaches are much fitter than human beings.

<font size=6><b>Everything Old is New Again</b></font>

<p><font size=6><b>T</b></font>he old joke is that women my age are more likely to be kidnapped by terrorists than meet an eligible man. This is more truth than joke.
<p>When magazines did articles about “sex in the ’90’s,” I didn’t know what they were talking about. I had closed out my last relationship right at the end of the ’80s, when I was approaching 40. Perhaps it was my midlife crisis to do something utterly foolish, to make a break for it and go out on my own when I had nothing new to offer.
<p>My last relationship had been with an older man, and most of that time I had spent with my son, a much younger man, obviously. What I wanted now was to be with a man my age, someone who hit puberty with the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show, who was also in gym class during the Kennedy assassination, who had embarrassing photos of himself at the dawning of the Age of Aquarius.
<p>But what I found instead was most men who are over 40 and single are single for a very good reason, and soon into the acquaintance, you will discover what that reason is. And you will agree with it.
<p>There’s the closet homosexuals who are in denial. They look straight, talk straight, but are into long, teasing courtships and sudden, irrevocable, unexplained breakups at the crucial moment.
<p>Another type is still waiting for the perfect woman who will instantly restore his missing vitality. In the meantime, they say “let’s just be friends,” the true meaning hidden. To their other friends, they put out the cover story that they just don’t find you attractive, despite all the time they spend with you.
<p>The jugglers are the most annoying. They are making a lifelong career of short, intense relationships, buzzing from woman to woman, and the over-40 female field is particularly exploitable. They have no time to develop a relationship or waste more than one date trying to win you over (read “into bed”). There is so little time and so many desperate women. Many of these men even have wives and girlfriends already, but are volunteering to love the lonely anyway, humanitarians that they are.
<p>Finally, there’s the burned-at-the-stake victims, men who have survived at least one horrific and intense relationship with a woman that left them emotionally crippled. They will talk to you warily, ready to jump back at the first sign of attraction, then growl fiercely and say something guaranteed to blow you away, thus getting back at whoever hurt them in their murky past. You become the universal stand-in for the Evil That Is Woman.
<p>The seminormal, truly available men, accordingly, are in high demand. They can pick and choose from the vast field of available women, from older to younger. They have a 25-year span of types to mull over, like melons in a patch. And it was a source of annoyance to me that they have a propensity to pick women who are literally half their arm. When it comes to romance, they want something dazzling, flashy, perky and very young on their arm. How disgusting!
<p>And how I belittled them. What do you think, that you can deny your own mortality? That her youthfulness will rub off on you? That you can mold her unformed brain into what you want her to be while reveling in her youthful body? How disgusting! You think she’s going to take care of you when you’re old, or will she run off with someone her own age then? Then ha ha on you.
<p>So why don’t you date younger, too, people would suggest. How disgusting! The very idea. Who would want some hatchling boy? Not me. What would we talk about?
<p>“So, what is your favorite episode of Sesame Street? Do Weebles really wobble but not fall down?” I don’t want to be anyone’s pathetic Mrs. Robinson, soon to be left for real life with a more appropriately aged girl.
<p>So that’s settled, except there’s no accounting for chemistry, and when chemistry erupts, good sense goes out the window. The difference in our ages is a lot, and in the early morning light, I realize the truth about loving someone younger. Oh, yes, it is a denial of one’s own mortality. I feel like a vampire refueling my own dying youth by feeding voraciously off his. Any more explanation would explode into a Harlequin romance right here on the page.
<p>His enthusiasm for things with which I’ve long since become jaded forces me to look again with new eyes. I have to make myself travel back to that mental place I once lived where I didn’t worry about growing old, or saving money, or getting sick, where I indulged every dream and let tomorrow take the consequences. It becomes a parallel universe. Instead of no time-no time, there is endless time, a whole other lifetime. Life is full of possibilities again, or the illusion of them.
<p>But, you know, there’s an end of the line for this trolley. I mean, where can it go? About the time his head finally grows to fit his ears, I will look like a birthday balloon the day after the party, flaccid and starting to crinkle. But for right now, I can’t think about this.
<p>Now I reluctantly understand why men are enamored of younger women, what magical spell wraps over them. Despite the popularity and new-found sympathy for the First Wives Club, there’s no denying the primal urge that causes men to risk everything to be swallowed up by a second chance to run with the young. It is a siren song that alters the brain and boils the blood.
<p>And maybe the age difference doesn’t matter. Maybe in the end, it is all chemistry and no practicality. Maybe things have changed in this day and age. The rapidity of electronic communications, which spray cultural influences over us all simultaneously like insecticide, has evened out the generations into one seamless blob.
<p>My ex-husband, 13 years older, watched Star Trek all the time. The men I dated who were my age watched Star Trek all the time. My current boyfriend, 15 years younger, watches Star Trek all the time.
<p>Maybe age really doesn’t matter.
<p>Love long and prosper.

<font size=6><b>Sharing Growth Will Strengthen the Entire Community</b></font>

<tr><td valign=top>
<p><font size=6><b>A</b></font>s our local government structure as up-to-date as the new technologies that the Richmond area is attracting? The decisions of Motorola and Siemens to locate major microprocessor plants in the Richmond area have focused national attention on the tremendous opportunities in Central Virginia in the coming years. Recently, in recognition of these prospects, Entrepreneur magazine named our area one of the top 30 cities in the country for start-up businesses. We have much to be excited about as we move into the years ahead.
<p>The question for our governmental leadership is whether we can fully capitalize on the chance to make our community a  model for other regions, a livable and pleasant place with cutting-edge opportunity for all our citizens. A simple, but fundamental, change in the way we view the relations of our local governments and their roles in economic development would help make our public sector as forward-focused as the business climate we are creating.
<p>When a Motorola/Siemens moves to Henrico, or a Whitehall-Robins moves to Richmond, they move because of positive features of the entire region. They survey cultural opportunities, transportation, school quality, housing options and a myriad of other factors that make this area a great region in which to live and do business. Economic success is inspired by all the area jurisdictions, not just the particular jurisdiction that becomes the address for the new employer.
<p>And just as all the major localities participate in setting the regional climate that attracts business, we all bear the consequences of that development. Motorola’s employees will live throughout the region, causing increased need for municipal services of all kinds. Chesterfield voters recently approved a bond referendum so that the county can keep building new schools for its residents, many of whom work in other parts of the regions. Success does have its costs.
<p>But while we all share credit for attracting businesses and all bear the costs that development brings, our system of independent cities and counties means that we do not share equally in the benefits of growth. The taxes from a desirable new business stay with the address jurisdiction and are not shared with the other partners who help make the development possible and who absorb its costs. The fiscal isolation even leads to intense bidding between jurisdictions, bidding that wastes tax dollars to move companies back or forth across arbitrary lines simply to capture the stream of future tax revenue. This zero-sum game is a fundamental flaw in our system, which was designed when the local jurisdictions were truly independent communities. Today, we will reach the highest levels of success not by competing with one another, but by jointly focusing on competing with other regions around the country and throughout the world.
<p>Can our localities maintain their independent character but better align our incentives so as to maximize our competitiveness? Without a doubt, and we have already started doing so. In 1994, the private sector and the governments of Richmond, Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield formed the Greater Richmond Partnership, a regional economic development engine designed to capture all the opportunities we can for our citizens. The Partnership is funded 50 percent by the private sector and 50 percent by the four jurisdictions. Each jurisdiction pays an equal share to fund the effort out of a recognition of our common fate. The success of the effort has been notable — in its first year of operation the Partnership helped obtain commitments on projects totaling $625 million in new capital investment and 4,700 new jobs for our region.
<p>But, once again, the old tradition of fiscal isolation gets in the way. While each of the four localities contributes equally, there is no provision that each will benefit equally. Indeed, the Partnership’s first year experience demonstrated that the benefits of these projects were scattered disproportionately between the participating communities. In a business deal, investors with equal contributions expect roughly equal returns. That principle is fair, and it should apply in regional economic development efforts as well.
<p>How can we break the fiscal isolation that makes us competitors for new economic growth rather than partners working in harmony? We can do it if we have the foresight to recognize that the benefits of growth should be shared. Imagine a system, for example, in which the local tax revenues from new businesses in Richmond, Hanover, Chesterfield and Henrico were calculated and accounted for on an annual basis. Forty percent of the local tax revenue on any new business would stay with the address jurisdiction, and the remaining 60 percent would be placed in a fund that would be divided equally among the four communities. Under this system, the bulk of tax revenues would stay with the host jurisdiction to support its needs. But because each community would benefit from development anywhere in the region, the incentives toward isolation would be replaced by incentives to cooperate. We would work together to increase growth in the region, knowing that any growth would reward us for our contributions and compensate us for the costs that development inevitably brings.
<p>This concept is simple. Is it possible? Other regions have adopted growth-sharing techniques, but usually through legislative imposition or in settlement of a contentious annexation battle. If we could do it in voluntary recognition of our interdependence, it would set the stage for other breakthroughs here and elsewhere. Virginia has been the birthplace of key developments in American government — from the Bill of Rights to the initiation of the council/manager form of local government in the early 1900s. The next century will demand further innovations. Will we have the courage to set the standard?

<font size=6><b>Growth Through Cooperation, Not Direct Sharing</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>Cooperation of separate jurisdictions is  the catalyst for metropolitan development.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Richard W. Glover</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>T</b></font>he past 18 months have been remarkably good ones for our metropolitan region. I have been privileged to serve as chairman of the Henrico County Board of Supervisors during much of that time. This unprecedented period will be remembered as a historic turning point in our region’s history. It will shape the future of our community for decades to come.
<p>In September 1995, Motorola exercised its option to purchase a 230-acre site at West Creek in Goochland County. The microprocessor manufacturing facility envisioned for the site will occupy about 850,000 square feet and employ as many as 5,000 people. Despite delays in launching the project, we can be confident that it will come in due course.
<p>In May 1996, Motorola and its partner Siemens announced their plans to build White Oak semiconductor plant which is now under construction in eastern Henrico’s Elko Tract. This $1.5 billion facility will ultimately employ as many as 1,500 people when it is in full production.
<p>What does this tell us about our region? I will answer that by first looking at the part I know best — Henrico County. For generations, Henrico has been known for its quality of life. That quality is derived from our excellent and nationally recognized public services. It is also tied to our tax-rate structure which, in every major tax category from real estate and personal property, to business, professional and occupational licensing, has been dramatically reduced in recent years and will continues to decline. Our quality of life is also enhanced by the attractive and affordable housing in safe neighborhoods, a moderate cost of living and a vigorous local economy. Our elected Board of Supervisors, our professional county employees and thousands of citizen volunteers who help them, form a dynamic partnership whose main characteristic is cooperation. It is a partnership that works effectively to serve the community and has done so for years.
<p>Our current successes are the product of decades of effort and planning. We have guided and controlled change rather than been driven by it. The planning skills and tools vital to competently dealing with change date back to the formation of the County Manager form of government. Our emphasis on planning and land use, combined with our efforts on infrastructure construction, economic development and continued growth, produced impressive results.
<p>White Oak Semiconductor, Pittston and the Capital One expansion are some of the most recent and dramatic examples. Like others that came before, these enterprises will produce thousands of jobs, directly and indirectly within the many businesses that will support them. The total number of jobs created promises to be substantial and long lasting. As our regional community changes because of the magnitude of economic development and infrastructure improvements, these jobs will be shared by all localities and residents of the region. Earnings will be spent throughout the metropolitan area, whether it is in the city of Richmond or Hanover, Chesterfield or elsewhere. Henrico has been fueling the regional economy for years, and in so doing has not only helped itself but also those around it.
<p>Henrico’s successes, particularly in the past year or so, have had enormous positive impact on the entire region. Henrico’s contribution to dozens of important regional programs, including regional economic development, is continuous and longstanding, as is the investment of its own capital in the infrastructure vital to successful economic development 
<p>The present list of regionally cooperative programs includes economic development, all levels of education, law enforcement, criminal justice, fire and emergency medical services, health, human services, planning, transportation, utilities, solid waste disposal, libraries, leisure services, tourism and more. The successes of the Henrico-Richmond Water Agreement, regional participation in the Virginia Biotechnology Research Park and Richmond International Airport expansion remind us that regional cooperation is alive and well.
<p>Here is a recent example. In September 1996, we dedicated the Henrico Regional Jail East in New Kent County, a $44 million, 256,300-square-foot statement that regional cooperation is alive and well in our area. Like White Oak Semiconductor and Motorola at West Creek, it is the product of a partnership, this one between three localities, Henrico, Goochland and New Kent in addition to the commonwealth of Virginia. Regional Jail East stands as proof-positive that our broad and diverse community, stretching from Goochland in the west to New Kent in the east, is well able to come together to meet its collective needs.
<p>We do this through independent but cooperative efforts. When success arrives, as it has recently with significant fanfare, each locality should not ask how to obtain direct financial benefit but define how to capitalize on success for all our constituents. Henrico has not and does not object to our own course of planned, costly expenditures to improve not only our locality, but also the region. Through the competitive efforts of each jurisdiction, our entire metropolitan area benefits. The competitive spirit enhances the quality of life for all and causes new development to be attracted to the area.
<p>While the region may be diverse, we share a mutual interest in maintaining the physical and economic security of our communities and the families, homes and businesses that lie within them. We may be different in many ways, but we share a common respect for the rule of law and the need for good order in our lives.
<p>In short, our local jurisdictions in the metro area do work together as a region. There is nothing new in this; some of our most important programs were developed 10 or 15 years ago. Our experience tells us that many more local issues can and will be resolved in a cooperative, regional manner. As we approach the next century, we intend to address issues of mutual concern through effective regional programs. At the same time, we will continue to build strong local governments that are responsive to our unique community needs. In doing so, we will enjoy the best of both worlds — strong local government and effective regional cooperation.

<font size=6><b>Techno-Junkies in the Dark</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>We have become creatures who can’t live without power.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Christopher O’Kennon</i><font>
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>
<p><font size=6><b>W</b></font>hen Hurricane Fran knocked thousands of Richmonders off the power grid and into the stone age, I learned something frightening about myself. I’m a techno addict, and I can’t go very long without my fix.
<p>My life, as with the lives of so many others in this modern age, has become intertwined with technology so thoroughly that it’s sometimes difficult to tell where the flesh ends and the machine begins. We rely on so many devices and contraptions for our day-to-day existence that they become effectively invisible to us; we can’t see the forest for the trees. But cut the juice and we come skidding to a halt, our eyes blinking against the darkness that had always been there. With forecasts of a snowy winter ahead, low-tech waits just beyond the wall socket to embrace us as long lost friends. But to me, low-tech is more like the friends you had in high school but avoid now that you’ve grown up.
<p>My world consists of computers and modems, television and electric lights. My first action upon waking is to check my e-mail, and my last is to make sure the thermostat is set right. When given a choice between appliances, I will always opt for the one with the most buttons and lights.
<p>If I’d wanted to be Amish, I’d have moved to Pennsylvania.
<p>Last winter it got so bad during one storm that my roommate and I even considered going out and buying a Yamaha generator solely for the purpose of playing “Duke Nukem 3D” on our computers (networked, of course). We found ourselves becoming more and more agitated as the things we did out of habit mocked us with their silence. Can’t check e-mail? Then play Windows solitaire. Can’t. Computer’s down. So watch television. Oh, that takes electricity, too. Then I guess I’ll just have to sit and read a book of all things. But no, it’s dark and the lights don’t work. Even the food slowly going bad in the refrigerator taunted us.
<p>I started calling up people I knew, hoping they had power. I need my e-mail in a way that only other people who need their e-mail can understand (although serious heroin addicts might possibly know the feeling. Almost). It is my link to the world. Due to e-mail and voice mail, I rarely ever talk to an entity that can pass the Turing Test (computer joke, don’t be alarmed). But when I called up friends, what I found were other people desperately looking for electricity in a way that reminded me of scavengers in a Mad Max movie: buying batteries from Wal-Mart in cases so they could huddle around a lone clock-radio and listen to NPR.
<p>When did this horrible dependency get so strong? Is Ted Kaczynski now the only person who doesn’t mind a blackout?
<p>I’m pretty sure it crept up during my lifetime, although a faint shadow of it has always been around. When Oog the Gatherer realized he could light a fire and stay awake, avoiding the woolly mammoths trampling through his verandah, I’m sure he quickly became used to it. And when nature dumped water on his fire, he probably became equally agitated.
<p>But I get more worked up when the power goes out than my dad does (he’ll still sit in front of the television with the remote control, clicking away at a blank screen. It’s a ritual, not an actual act of viewing). The difference is obvious. From the moment I slid into the world, I was surrounded by electronics. I grew up playing games on computers and in video arcades, watching movies on the VCR and doing homework on word processors. There was only a brief period in my life where cable didn’t bring a hundred channels of garbage to my home.
<p>Sure, I could probably live without all that, just as I could probably cook a hot dog in something other than a microwave. But it’s a hell I don’t relish.
<p>It’s sometimes hard to realize exactly how much technology has changed our lives. As advances allow us to travel and communicate over great distances, it also somehow manages to keep us even farther apart. True, we can now have friends separated by entire continents, but how often do you end up meeting them in person? 
<p>Many of us are so used to the high-tech boundaries imposed on our social interaction, that we find ourselves at a loss for words when we call someone and actually reach a person instead of an answering machine or voice mail message. 
<p>Often we even prefer getting the machines, because it allows us to remain at a comfortable distance.
<p>You never quite realize what you’re addicted to until it disappears. How many people go a little bonkers when the cable goes out, even when it happens at 3 a.m. when nothing’s on but Ab-Blaster infomercials and the special townhouse episode of the Real Estate Channel? You know who you are, and you also know you can’t get to sleep knowing your television is only pulling in five channels of garbage when it could be pulling in 100.
<p>Technology is wonderful when it does what you want it to, and a royal kick in the pants when it doesn’t. Like a dysfunctional love affair, we need it so much we’ll forgive it when it fails us just to ensure that it comes back.
<p>But, knowing all this about myself and others, would I change it? Could I change it? Maybe. 
<p>If I could change it with a remote control while reading my e-mail.

<font size=6><b>Behind the Eight Ball</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>Going to college puts many in Generation X in debt forever.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Ted Rall</i><font>
</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top>
<p><font size=6><b>F</b></font>orget tongue-piercing and Kurt Cobain — nothing defines Generation X like student loan debt. Before Ronald Reagan took office, 17-year-olds who qualified for financial aid to attend college got most of that money in the form of grants. Grants, by definition, do not have to be paid back. Ever since the United States sent returning World War II vets to college at taxpayer expense, an implicit clause of the social contract told poor and middle-class Americans that they could afford to attend any university for which they proved academically qualified. Millions of baby boomers finished school with little to no debt — the maximum student loan in 1980 was $2,500 per year, for a total of $10,000 over four years. This freed students to choose rewarding low-pay jobs, launch businesses or buy their first homes.
<p>That all changed in 1981. Overnight, it became common for teen-agers still too young to vote or get credit cards to sign promissory notes borrowing the entire cost of their annual tuition, housing, books and other college expenses.
<p>For nearly two decades college-bound Americans have been told over and over that, in an age of advancing technology, a bachelor’s degree is the ticket to the middle class. So they beg, steal and mostly borrow to get that parchment. While the home mortgages that baby boomers are paying off yield concrete financial benefits like tax deductibility and equity, borrowing to pay for a college degree is a risky investment that may or may not eventually yield a higher income. The pressure of crushing college debt leads many students to enter fields they don’t even like in search of high salaries. Moreover, students who drop out of college still have to repay student loans. The average new American college graduate faces a brutal monthly student loan bill of about $800 for 10 years — more than most older people’s combined car payment and mortgage.
<p>Perhaps because nobody was paying much attention at the time, the devastation caused by replacing grants with student loans has been completely ignored during every discussion of higher education since the ’80s. George Bush even abandoned government guarantees for student loans — interest rates rose from 9 to 14 percent during his term — while virtual Democrat Bill Clinton’s financial aid policy consisted entirely of “direct lending,” allowing the government to replace banks as creditors to the young.
<p>Clinton, maybe because he’s never had to repay one himself, sees student loans as a benevolent form of financial aid. As he asked this fall: “Would we be better off if we cut student loans instead of increasing them?” Ask anyone who spends half of their $30,000-a-year salary on student loan coupons.
<p>Americans now take out $19 billion a year in student loans. CEOs and pundits howl about the need for education to make Americans competitive in the global marketplace, but no other industrialized nation asks its students to assume such an astonishingly high portion of their education costs. We’ve created a generation of debtors, unable to save or buy first cars or homes. Many companies can’t qualify for 401(k) retirement plans because their younger employees are too broke to participate. The average age of first home ownership has now increased to 32, up from 24 in 1981, thanks to the lethal combination of runaway student loans and flat entry-level wages.
<p>The feds’ growing willingness to issue student loans has allowed colleges and universities to increase tuition much faster than the inflation rate, impacting borrowers and nonborrowers alike. During the ’80s, the cost of medical services went up 110 percent, an increase that sparked the current fracas over health care costs. Meanwhile, the average cost of attending college rose 109 percent for a public college and 146 percent for private one, but neither the media nor the politicians saw a crisis.
<p>As Americans prepared to vote this fall, neither Bob Dole nor Bill Clinton nor Ralph Nader nor Ross Perot had promised to return to the old grant system, forgive old debt or even reduce the interest rates on new loans. Both Clinton and Dole offer a Depression-era $500-per-child tax deduction. In a country where average public university tuition, housing and other expenses total $15,000 a year, private colleges average $25,000 and the Ivies cost as much as $35,000, the tax credit promise means less than nothing.
<p>The slightly more generous Bill Clinton promised tax deductibility on college tuition up to $10,000 per annum. At most, you could save less than $3,000 a year under the Clinton plan. But the Man from Hope offers nothing for those of us already paying off student loans.
<p>Neither third-party candidate weighed in on the financial aid issue.
<p>Eliminating the loan bureaucracy would save millions of taxpayer dollars. So would writing off the double-digit default rate on student loans, mostly by poor graduates and dropouts. Most importantly, it would rescue more than 30 million people from financial oblivion and allow them to begin participating in the American Dream as investors and consumers.
<p>Nonetheless, returning to the old grant system would be expensive. College tuition now costs the 8 million full-time students in the country $152 billion a year, an amount 50 percent higher than next year’s projected federal budget deficit. As a nation, we would have to decide that educating our young adults is as much of a national priority as dispatching troops to prop up low-rent dictators in Kuwait. Alternatively, we could admit the obvious: Education is for young people in other countries (such as the sons of the Kuwaitis, many of whom study here), and we should limit our intellectual pursuits to running the deep fryer.
<p>The lack of attention to the stealth student loan crisis is especially baffling considering that the 1992 election was decided by thirtysomethings, who voted in higher numbers than any other age group besides the elderly. Why doesn’t anyone pander to Xers the way they do to AARPers?
<p>Maybe it’s the fault of us young people — our weird libertarian tendencies convince us that we don’t have the right to expect anything from society. In the meantime, baby boomers and the elderly still subscribe to old-fashioned special-interest politics. They taught us a lot of things back in those overpriced college classes, but they forgot one thing: Americans eat their young.

<p><font size=6><b>P</b></font>eople often ask me, “Who died and made you king?” Well, I don’t know who, but I know somebody did because one morning I woke up and I was king. That’s all.
<p>Being king is an awesome responsibility. The last king apparently did not do a very good job because things have gotten completely out of control. Now that I’m in charge, things are going to change. I will be periodically issuing bulletins and commandments with all the new laws and rules. Failure to comply means instant dismissal. There are no grounds of appeal, simply because there are too many people on this planet as it is. If I make a mistake, which is impossible since I am king, and you are innocent even though I found you guilty, you’re leaving anyway because, frankly, no one will miss you. There’re plenty more people where you came from.
<p>There are also way too many cars on this planet, so the means of execution will be to put you in a car and drive you off the edge of the Earth, thus eliminating one offender and one car, a double good deal. If you land on Mars or something, well, that’s Mars’ problem, not mine.
<p>I realize that just to get started, I have twice as many commandments as Moses, but look at the mess I have to clean up.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>1.</font></b></tt> Who came up with the theory that the best way to stop a child from crying was to hit him? People whacking crying kids in grocery store aisles will be eliminated and the children sent away for to one of those test tube clinics for recycling.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>2.</font></b></tt> Fast food chain workers, when you’re waiting on me, can you give me my change first before you start talking to one of your co-workers? I’m only interacting with you for a minute. Your co-worker is going to be there all day. Can’t it wait until we’re done? If not, you’re off the planet.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>3.</font></b></tt> Don’t call me and then talk to other people who are in your house while you’ve got me on the phone. You want to talk to me or them? Make up your mind.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>4.</font></b></tt> People with children are always making phone calls when their children are screaming. They put you on hold repeatedly while they yell at their kids, “Can’t you see I’m on the phone?!!!” Of course they can, you idiot. That’s why they’re screaming.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>5.</font></b></tt> Immediate dismissal: People with cordless phones who go to the bathroom while they’re talking to you.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>6.</font></b></tt> No more fat free food. It tastes bad. That’s all there is to it. All skinny supermodels whose images have driven us to eating this tasteless food will be executed. They’ve got 60 days to fatten up and pass for normal. Designers must now design clothes that fit actual women’s bodies, not planks.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>7.</font></b></tt> No more spitting out car windows. And guys in cars in front of me who pull up to a red light, open their car door and let loose a big wad of phlegm on the pavement while I’m watching, a laser beam will be immediately dispatched to decapitate you. Women caught sitting on the passenger side with these Rico Suavo guys will be sent to rehabilitation camps where they will learn how to pick men with better manners.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>8.</font></b></tt> Infomercial channels are hereby prohibited by law. Ab machines will be rounded up, melted down and made into plowshares.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>9.</font></b></tt> For what a movie costs to attend these days, they ought to be big screen special events. How come we’re getting so many releases starring television personalities in scripts no more sophisticated than the Tuesday night movie of the week?! Anyone who has ever been a cast member of “Saturday Night Live” can never make a theatrical release.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>10.</font></b></tt> A rigid Dinner Commandment. If someone is paying for your dinner, then you are obligated by law to listen to their problems and be sympathetic and supportive while you are eating the food they paid for. The exception to this is the Sex Corollary. If you are providing sex to the person paying for your dinner, then they are obligated by law to listen to your problems and be sympathetic and supportive, even though they’re buying you food. Violators will choke on their meat.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>11.</font></b></tt> Any laws passed whose underlying purpose is to enforce “morality and values” of the Christian Coalition on the rest of the population are hereby invalidated.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>12.</font></b></tt> Children cannot answer the phone and take messages. Under my reign, electrical current will shoot through the phone and jolt them back to their rooms until an adult arrives or an answering machine intervenes. Electric fences work on dogs, electric phones will work on kids.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>13.</font></b></tt> What is this style of wearing the longest, baggiest boxer shorts possible with the shortest, baggiest khaki shorts so your underpants peek out under your pants? This outfit is not prohibited since it is an excellent personality detector, and when you are detected, you will be rounded up and put in a camp to do cost accounting for my administration. You will not be permitted to breed. Without you guys, we’ll soon be able to put an end to debutante balls forever.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>14.</font></b></tt> On the flip side, we’re also rounding up guys whose jockeys are visible above their pants. You, too, can no longer breed. Underwear is under wear.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>15.</font></b></tt> All prime time television programming will repeat throughout the night. People who can’t sleep should not be forced to watch commercials for stomach flatteners and Flowbie machines from midnight to dawn. The suicide rate will drop dramatically when my administration installs the all-night Seinfeld channel.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>16.</font></b></tt> No more cartoons on Saturday morning or religious programs on Sunday morning. Come up with a new idea for the weekend. Fifty years of programming people to expect the same thing is enough.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>17.</font></b></tt> All restaurants will be closed on Mother’s Day. That’s right, you’re not taking the easy way out of this one! She cooked for years. Now you cook.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>18.</font></b></tt> Christmas will be conducted in alphabetical order to cut down on the crowds in malls. Everyone whose name ends in A or B will celebrate it on Jan. 25, C or D, Feb. 25 and so on.
<p><tt><b><font color=#330099>19.</font></b></tt> Fifteen items or less means exactly that. All the items over that will drop through a hole under the checkout aisle, as will you.

<font size=6><b>Bless our Bleeding Hearts</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>Now the Right is blaming women for being compassionate.</b></font>

<p><font size=6><b>T</b></font>he “L” word, while still a dandy political epithet, is apparently fading in potency. During the recent presidential campaign Bob Dole resorted to crying “liberal! liberal! liberal!” in hopes of making it stick to Bill Clinton. Even so, the venerable tar brush failed to adhere to any damaging effect. Perhaps “liberal” will soon join such pejoratives as “Fellow Traveler” and “Freemason” in the lexicon of dated political put-downs.
<p>The various takes on “liberal” in this last third of our century make for some startling curiosities. Beginning with Richard Nixon’s oddly liberal presidency and proceeding through Ronald Reagan, “liberal” has been associated with evils from taxation to pot smoking. Most recently, feminism has been introduced and denounced as the motive force behind a new form of liberalism that has purportedly captured the Democratic Party.
<p>Republican commentator Irving Kristol complained last October about the “feminization of the party.” Along with The Atlantic Monthly’s Steven Stark and other critics, Kristol blames women for both the earliest germination of the American welfare state and its continued expansion via liberal Democrats.
<p>Women, Kristol charges, breed a politics of “‘compassion,’ which contemporary liberalism has elevated into the most important civic virtue. Women tend to be more sentimental than men ... less inclined to be appreciative of free market economics, in which there are losers as well as winners ... more ‘permissive’ and less ’judgmental on such issues as homosexuality, capital punishment, even pornography.”
<p>Kristol asserts that women are responsible for “the amazing degree to which the Democratic convention was bathed in pathos and sob stories,” feeding the flames of the true party agenda: “If terrible things happen to innocent people, government is morally obliged to come to their rescue. Forget prayer, forget stoicism; hope is incarnated in the welfare state.”
<p>It is beyond irony that today’s conservatism, wedded as it so noisily is to evangelical, “born again” Christianity, should be so relentlessly hostile to the New Testament. Such stuff as “compassion,” particularly compassion for the poor, the stranger, the sinner, is the warp and woof of Christ’s teachings. The “bleeding heart” alluded to in “bleeding heart liberal” belonged to the crucified Jesus. And if the New Testament has anything good to say about Kristol’s free market “winners,” I should like to be reminded of it. To wildly understate the matter, wealthy folk do not fare well, enduring one reproach after another from Jesus Himself and finally suffering the apostles’ establishment of flat-out communism by the time we get to Acts 4, 34-35.
<p>These Biblical persecutors of the rich were almost exclusively male, and they are boisterously worshiped by the American Right today. So why are conservatives rebuking women for “compassion?” Kristol insists on placing the word in quotes as though it were a euphemism for something sinister. Some on the Right are just plain desperate to keep the sting in ‘liberal,’ stereotyping and attacking half the human race and lacing their cultural critique with anti-feminism. As with racism or homophobia, if there is a backlash to be exploited, these folks will exploit it.
<p>Unfortunately for them, the inconvenient truth seems to be that the American people like their welfare state, feminized or otherwise. We almost like it enough to be willing to pay for it. For sheer efficacy we prefer the welfare state to prayer when we are afflicted, and welfare wins hands-down over stoicism when we are innocently, or even not-so-innocently, stricken by life’s little disasters: fire, flood, famine, war and plague; unemployment, rotten schools, toxic waste in the basement.
<p>Whether we pray or not, Americans historically are simply not the “suffer in silence,” stoical types. Our noisiness in the face of adversity has brought us, time and again, to act in community to solve common problems. 
<p>Further, the average American lying in the road waylaid and wounded prefers to see a compassion-crazed female not some testosterone-pumped male. The assertion that our government in general and the Republican Party in particular have too long been captive to anachronistic masculine and patriarchal values and interests has more certain ring of truth to it than Mr. Kristol’s feminist conspiracy.
<p>The American Right entered the Industrial Age with an Old Testament mythology transplanted from the deserts of the ancient Middle East to the deserts of the modern American West. Insulated from the storms of industrial-strength change by industrial-strength wealth, conservative capital battled Roosevelt as he laid the foundations of a welfare state that would nurture and protect Industrialism’s casualties. “The American welfare state has had a feminine coloration from the very beginning,” Kristol charges.
<p>Opposing such effeminate claptrap, conservatives have offered the John Wayne motif and a seamless edit to Ronald Reagan. To this day their “traditional family values” remain Old Testament, male and patriarchal, with a drowsy nod to the New Testament. Their work-week Bibles, so loudly thumped at policy making sessions, apparently say nothing about the poor, but tell all that needs telling about abortion, prayer in public schools, which intoxicants are proper, and which forms of lovemaking are correct between which genders.
<p>Compassion is for women and wimps.
<p>This caveman take on masculinity has helped make the larger portion of human history a grisly tale of hunger, violence and greed, hardly the stuff required to navigate a new millennium. On the contrary. Our best hope for managing the continued era of change that surely awaits us is a compassionate and responsive political sensibility. Call it feminized, or, if you prefer Christian metaphors, “bleeding heart.” It’s better than no heart at all.

<font size=6><b>The Price of Gasoline Is Higher Than You  Think</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>If we paid the real cost of our gasoline, we would be shocked and surprised.

<p><font size=6><b>O</b></font>il companies are among our most vocal advocates of the free enterprise system. Witness Mobil’s New York Times ads. Yet when all is said and done the oil industry itself may be the nation’s single largest recipient of welfare.
<p>I was reminded of this while watching our latest cruise missile attack on Iraq. Everyone knows the half billion dollars or so we’ve expended in this latest confrontation with Saddam Hussein wasn’t spent to protect democracy in the Middle East or to protect the Kurds’ human rights. It was spent to protect our access to oil. In all fairness, we should be paying the cost of these military adventures at the pump. We don’t. This is just one in a number of ways that we subsidize oil.
<p>Oil receives three forms of welfare. One is through preferential tax treatment. Oil companies pay lower taxes which forces other taxpayers to pay higher taxes. The second is by giving the oil industry free protection.
<p>The Pentagon budget largely comes from income taxes. Not a penny of it comes from gas taxes. The third type of subsidy to oil comes from giving it a free ride on pollution. Higher medical bills, crop damage, cleanup costs are rarely paid for at the pump.
<p>Economists call these hidden costs “externalities.” A study by the Minneapolis and Washington, D.C.-based Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an organization with which I am associated, put real numbers on oil’s externalities. The study, “Oil Slickers: How Petroleum Benefits At the Taxpayer’s Expense,” was done by Dr. Jenny Wahl, associate professor of economics at St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn. A Ph.D. economist from the University of Chicago and one of the nation’s preeminent tax analysts, Dr. Wahl was clearly qualified to tackle this issue.
<p>The study concluded that oil receives an annual subsidy of $84 billion a year. That translates into 32 cents a gallon or about $210 per year per motorist. The bottom line is that if we were paying the real costs of oil, gasoline would cost over $1.60 per gallon in Minnesota and over $2 per gallon in New York City.
<p>The biggest subsidy of all is military. Back in 1980, Jimmy Carter declared that we would go to war to protect our access to oil. In 1991, George Bush did exactly that. Today, we spend about $50 billion a year to protect our access to Middle Eastern oil. We don’t have to pay protection money to maintain access to alternative fuels like electricity or natural gas or hydrogen. We’ll never have to send in cruise missiles to force lowa farmers to provide us with ethanol.
<p>The second biggest subsidy to oil is in environmental damages. Crop losses alone from motor vehicle pollutants may be as much as $9 billion a year. The health and environmental effects of leaking motor vehicle storage tanks could be over $1 billion a year. The ILSR study concluded that this subsidy comes to $30 billion a year.
<p>None of these costs are reflected in the pump price. The result is that we pay an artificially low price for gasoline. That encourages driving and pollution. And it discourages alternatives like mass transit or efficient vehicles or alternative fuels, many of which would be more competitive if oil had to pay its true costs.
<p>What should be done? One strategy would be to restructure our tax system. Shift the costs of oil from the general taxpayer to the motorist. Raise taxes on gasoline while lowering other taxes by an equivalent amount. A proposal that would have done just that was debated last year in the Minnesota legislature. On the national level, Congress should ask motorists to pay their fair share of the Pentagon budget while reducing taxes on income, the current source of most of our military funding, by an equivalent amount.
<p>A second strategy would be for policymakers to take the real costs of oil into account when they design programs to encourage alternatives. Subsidies to mass transit or alternative fuels tend to be visible and thus tend to be more politically vulnerable. Subsidies to oil are hidden. Yet the latter dwarfs the former. For example, federal and state tax subsidies to ethanol total about $900 million. Tax subsidies for gasoline are $3.8 billion. Yet ethanol incentives are under vigorous attack in Congress while incentives for oil have been increased.
<p>Forcing oil to pay its real costs is a very conservative notion. Market economies work best when they rely on accurate prices. But the price we pay at the pump woefully understates the cost of protecting, extracting, delivering and burning oil. We should and can remedy that. Motorists and oil companies no longer should be given a free ride at the general taxpayer’s expense.

<font size=6><b>Fair Game?</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>Catapulted by a truck, lashed to a board, then the scary part happened.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Mariane Matera</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>N</b></font>ot long after it happened, I went into a neighborhood pizza parlor to get a slice and caught the eye of a gaggle of skateboarders in the corner. Something about the way I moved attracted them like no other lover — my knees, elbows and face a crusty mass of new pavement burn scabs.
<p>Their excitement and curiosity were apparent. Here was a good story, and they knew it. Since I am far from being in a skateboarder peer group, they hesitated about approaching me, but the need to know became overwhelming.
<p>“What happened to you?”
<p>Well, listen my children, and you shall hear how I took an automobile in the rear. It tossed me up like a breakfast flapjack and hurled me to the pavement with a terrible smack.
<p>Their pupils pinned immediately with pleasure and fear. To do battle with the metal monsters of the highway is a skateboarder’s dream (or nightmare), to skid along the hot asphalt and have the upper layer of the epidermis shaved off, leaving you the color and texture of dog food, is their red badge of courage.
<p>I’ve told the story of being hit by a car many times since. Having a cast on your arm invites questions. Indeed, it has been a boon to my party small talk. It has also been an educational experience for everyone since the common assumption is, if you’ve been hit by a car, you’ve got a hot and prosperous date with a personal injury attorney.
<p>As one television ad goes, come on down and watch our free video on how to maximize the compensation for your pain and suffering. Insurance was established to benefit the truly hurt and injured, but with the help of many, many lawyers specializing in personal injury, the barely hurt and the not-hurt-at-all can make a few bucks, as long as you’re clearly in the right. In fact, the more something is not your fault, the more pain and suffering you should manufacture because you’ve got yourself a blank check.
<p>Unless, that is, you were hit by a car. Pedestrians in Virginia better damn well be in the crosswalk, crossing with the light, otherwise you’re inviting a fair and square hit. One business associate proudly told me he’s hit three pedestrians — he’s got little pedestrian icons stenciled on the side of his car — and has never been charged.
<p>So I was crossing in the middle of a block, in Carytown, where cars are parked to the corners on both sides of the street and shoppers are everywhere. Delivery cars and UPS trucks are liable to be stopped dead in the street, as well as cars waiting for other cars to pull out of parking spaces. It is not a street to enter flying.
<p>But I saw a break in the traffic, and so did the delivery driver on the side street, who shot out from around the corner and scooped me up on the hood of his car, just like in the movies, lifting me right out of my shoes. Then he stopped, firing me off the hood like a medieval catapult. I made a knees, elbow and nose landing on the pavement, finishing up in a sitting position where I immediately assessed how this was going to ruin my day and whether my skirt was modestly covering my behind since I had suddenly become the center of attention of everyone on the block.
<p>I would have been a happier camper to just gather up my shoes, clutch my broken wrist to my chest and go to an ER in a cab. As it was, the bystanders decided that, despite my protests that I felt relatively OK, they needed to hold me rigidly in position until the city of Richmond’s Very Expensive Ambulance Service arrived.
<p>Now, a sure sign that you are not seriously injured is when the police are primarily interested in getting your driver’s license and the ambulance crew wants you to sign agreements that you’ll pay them before they turn the ignition. If it hadn’t been for the bystanders holding me down like I had the football, I would have fled. Instead, I was encased in plastic braces, tied to a board and loaded onto the truck.
<p>And if you don’t insist very firmly, they’ll take you to the farthest ER because they charge by the mile. I insisted on the nearest, and once there, I received more assurances that my injuries were minor when the ER crew promptly ignored me for an hour, leaving me tied and braced to a table as if awaiting death by lethal injection. My priority status was somewhere below coffee and donut break.
<p>Like an apprentice Houdini, I wiggled out of the bindings and took a chair. We went through the X-ray process. I was wheeled to other places, left to wait in drafty hallways, wheeled here, wheeled there, finally back at the ER to wait for a doctor to break the bad news that my wrist was broken. Nurse Ratchet, mad that I untied myself, put a cast on me that completely immobilized my fingers even after the doctor assured me it’d only go past the knuckles so I could drive. I walked home in the rain.
<p>Now the bills lazily drift in like vultures circling the house. Four hundred and five dollars for the ambulance. Eight hundred and twenty-six dollars for under two hours of little attention in the ER.
<p>Thirty dollars additional for someone to read the X-ray behind the doctor. Three hundred and ninety-nine dollars for the orthopedic doctor to read the X-ray behind the ER doctor and the radiologist and confirm the break, hand me a wrist brace and say come back in two weeks. Every two weeks there’d be another X-ray, another “still broken” pronouncement, and another bill for $42. Hand therapy clocks in at $205 an hour for a woman to measure my wrist and then watch me squeeze some putty. I think this was the part that scared the skateboarders the most.

<font size=6><b>The ‘NEW’ Welfare</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>Virginia has a long, mixed tradition in handling public welfare.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Jim Watkinson</i><font>
</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>
<p><font size=6><b>L</b></font>istening to and reading about the debate over welfare, who should receive it, and how and by whom it should be administered might well lead you to believe that these are new issues or, at the very least, have arisen since the New Deal. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In the commonwealth, the poor, as Jesus noted, have always been with us; so have laws and debates about them.
<p>In 1642, a mere 36 years after the first ships landed at Jamestown, Colonial lawmakers felt compelled to pass a law “for the relief of diverse poore people that ... are disabled to labor by reason of sickness, lameness or age.” To be sure, the “relief” was small: Those who obtained a certificate “to testifie to their poverty,” were relieved of paying some of their taxes. They were, however, still expected to contribute to ministers’ salaries. But no real controversy accompanied the Act, for Virginians were merely following established English law and applying it to their own circumstances.
<p>Four years later, however, Virginia’s lawmakers knowingly ventured into controversial territory when they ordered “the commissioners of the several countyes [sic] ... make choice of two children in each county of the age of eight or seaven [sic] years at the least which are to be ... employed in the public flax houses.” In short, the First Fathers of Virginia decided in 1646 to establish the first workhouse for poor children. In an effort to allay public fears and outcry, county commissioners were warned to “take up” only those children whose “parents are by reason of their poverty ... disabled to maintain and educate them.”
<p>Just as the leaders of today insist that they act in the best interests of the public and welfare recipients, perhaps Colonial leaders acted out of genuine concern for the children. However, it is doubtful if the parents of such children and the children themselves appreciated the thought; it’s equally doubtful today.
<p>By 1727, the House of Burgesses attacked the “idle” in words which have a modern ring to them: “divers[e] and disorderly people having no visible estates or emploiments [sic] ... frequently strole [sic] from one county to another, neglecting to labour, and either failing altogether to list themselves as tithables [taxable people], or by their idle and disorderly life, render themselves incapable of paying their levies [taxes again] when listed.” These people, the Burgesses ruled, “shall be adjudged and deemed rogues and vagabonds.” Those whom no county would take on their poor lists and whom no one would hire by virtue of their “ill repute” were to receive 30 lashes.
<p>While no one today suggests 30 lashes for unemployment (although Newt probably wouldn’t mind the workhouse/orphanage for children), the anger at and fear of the chronically unemployed, at those with “no visible estates,” still permeates Virginia society and politics.
<p>That fear especially manifested itself in the 1755 law which noted that “the number of poor hath of late years much increased throughout this colony.” The solution? The establishment of poor- and workhouses in the colony’s cities and parishes. Furthermore, the law required that “every person who shall receive relief from the parish ... shall, upon the shoulder ... in an open and visible manner wear a badge, cut either in blue, red, or green cloth.” The burgesses further insisted that “if any poor person neglect or refuse to wear such badge” he or she could receive five lashes.
<p>While some counties and cities did not build poorhouses, many did. Generally, the decision to build was based upon two factors: How great was the fear of the poor and how expensive it was to maintain the poor, the same concerns which drive policy today. Hence, Lancaster County with little fear of its poor and few complaints about their costs never built a poor house; indeed, the county continued to make cash payments to their poor and in the 1850s went so far as to build houses for individual paupers themselves. Norfolk, on the other hand, established a poor house in the 1830s with rules, regulations and punishments that Charles Dickens would have had a hard time conceiving. So much for local option to achieve equal treatment of the poor.
<p>During the recent uproar which ensued when the commonwealth insisted that unwed mothers name the fathers of their children, state officials might well have pointed to their Colonial forebears for justification of their actions. The public naming of fathers before magistrates in “bastard certificates” was standard practice in Virginia. For instance, on the day after Christmas in 1770, Abraham Smith, a justice of the peace for Augusta County, wrote, “This day Agnes McCaumis came before me ... and made oathe that John Clark ... has begot a bastard Child on her Body.” The reason for the certificate was the same then as it is today: to get deadbeat dads to meet their obligations. Thus, in 1806, when Betsey Ricket of Rockbridge County had a child by Thomas Fulton of Augusta County, Rockbridge’s officials “entertained expectations from ... Fulton that he would come forward” and support the child. When he did not, they asked Augusta officials to apprehend Fulton and make him support his child.
<p>No, the welfare debate is nothing new in Virginia. With the exception of race relations, no problem has as long or as intractable a history in our state. Gov. Allen and other state governors have long argued that the states and localities are in a better position to know what to do for the poor; to a degree, Virginia’s history would seem to bear them out. And the “new” welfare law signed by President Clinton gives the state and localities their opportunity. Now the question in Virginia becomes do we react to the poor with the fear and loathing exhibited by lawmakers in the past and by cities like Norfolk, or do we recognize the humanity and dignity of the poor and treat them as neighbors, as did the citizens of 19th-century Lancaster County? As in the past, much may be riding on the answer.

<p><font size=6><b>I</b></font> n this time when we seem to be trying to discipline the poor — to make them take responsibility for themselves — the bugs may be sending us a wake-up call. Society’s governmental safety net is being rolled up and the homeless, the hungry and the children will in many cases have to fend for themselves.
<p>At the same time, planes are flying into and out of our country; we are eating vegetables, fruits and other foods that have been grown heaven knows where and imported to our supermarkets. And we are having increasing trouble with disease-causing parasites in our water.
<p>If the connection between the two paragraphs above seems farfetched, we have only to think about the panic over the imported raspberries that affluent consumers in the United States ate — to their sorrow when they developed Cyclospora diarrhea. Or about the increasingly frequent outbreaks of hemorrhagic E. coli that have been traced to insufficiently cooked hamburgers, or the Cryptosporidium outbreak in Milwaukee water.
<p>These events were, as reported by Dr. Richard L. Guerrant of the University of Virginia School of Medicine, “foreshadowed by the return of cholera to the Western Hemisphere after a century of absence and the emergence of new microbial strains that evade prior vaccines or antibiotics.” And they “remind us as never before of our vulnerability and interdependence with the growing majority of the world’s population living in tropical developing areas.” 
<p>When the poor anywhere live in unsantiary conditions and have no plumbing they become ill over and over, and they spread their sicknesses not just among themselves but to the more fortunate all over this one world.  
<p>The raspberries came from Guatemala, where the people live in Third-World conditions. When the berries were sold in the United States, they caused 1,400 cases of enteric disease in 14 states. The raspberry, hamburger and polluted water diseases are, according to Dr. Guerrant, “but the tip of the iceberg.” Diarrheal illnesses still constitute leading causes of death and malnutrition among the three-fourths of the world’s population who live in tropical developing areas. “Measured as years of potential life lost, diarrheal diseases, which are particularly severe in young children, may result in more life lost than seen with all other causes combined in some highly populous developing tropical areas,” Dr. Guerrant writes. 
<p>Even worse, perhaps, is that in unsanitary areas children can sometimes be cured of one illness only to fall prey to a second and a third. This demonstrably stunts their growth and their capacity to deal intelligently with the world around them.
<p>We are learning about the causes of the various tropical diseases. Often the treatment for a diarrheal disease is very simple, but when the patient lives in unsanitary conditions without flush toilets and running water, he or she is very likely to — and often does — come down with another such ailment or the same one again — this time in perhaps another incarnation that we have not yet learned how to treat.
<p>Even in the 19th century when we felt safely insulated from countries where the population lived in squalid conditions, diseases came across oceans to infect us. Cholera crossed the Atlantic in 1832 to spread throughout our continent, starting in Canada and continuing into New York, California, Mexico and the Caribbean. We defeated this epidemic, and, for a while, it appeared that we had eliminated its threat from our hemisphere.
<p>But in 1991 cholera arrived again in Peru and spread throughout Latin America. There were 400,000 cases and 4,000 deaths. It now exists in almost every country in the Western Hemisphere. On Feb. 14, 1992, a plane from South America landed in Los Angeles with 31 documented cholera cases aboard. Over the next 10 days 75 people who had been on board became ill. 
<p>Perhaps if we wished to separate ourselves from the world and could conceivably do so, we might hide from the diseases that threaten us — the way we hope to use walls to insulate ourselves from illegal immigrants. We could conceivably refuse to import food from countries where the poor live without benefit of sanitation. But the bugs that threaten us don’t thrive only among the foreign poor. They live in our hospitals, in our day care centers and in the conditions surrounding our homeless who sleep on our streets and under our bridges. There’s no way we can fence them out of our lives.
<p>As Dr. Guerrant pointed out in a recent talk here in Richmond, in a strange way, our survival may today be dependent upon a sanitary revolution for all —not for the sake of the comfort of the affluent but for their very survival. Instead of trying to discipline the poor, it would behoove us to provide them with a way to keep clean and live in reasonable health. 
<p>John Donne was right: We had best not send to ask for whom the bell tolls, it is tolling for us. Best we listen.

<font size=6><b>Smoking Pot, Honestly</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>Prohibiting marijuana is hopeless and illogical.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Mariane Matera</i><font>

<td valign=top>
<p><font size=6><b>A</b></font> few weeks back, I saw a brief exchange of political campaign fire which involved a Dole ad trying to embarrass President Clinton with a clip of him making light of his “I didn’t inhale” story by saying he tried to inhale. What the Dole campaign was trying to say is Clinton would smoke pot if he could.
<p>A few weeks earlier, the papers ran headlines with the shocking news that polls show the majority of baby boomer-era parents assume their children have or will experiment with drugs, and they are not particularly concerned about it.
<p>What the media was trying to say is baby boomers are irresponsible.
<p>What baby boomers are saying is that they’re honest and realistic. What Clinton is hinting at is, look, I was in college during the ’60s. Of course I smoked pot. This is not a big thing.
<p>When New York Rep. Susan Molinari was invited to be a keynote speaker at the Republican convention, there was a brief media flurry regarding whether she had ever smoked pot in college. I can’t even remember now what the upshot of that was, it was so unimportant to me. I think she denied it. And in so doing, she probably lied. Lying is OK. Smoking pot in your past is not. So what we end up with is lying pot-smokers. Personally, I’d rather elect some honest pot-smokers.
<p>This all must have been important to someone in the media or politics who thought they could influence a sector of the voters by presenting this damning, unforgivable idea that a person had once smoked pot.
<p>Dole’s generation, for however long they continue to control the media and politics, want to make it a big thing. It’s the maintenance of the generation gap which continues to separate the boomers and everyone behind us with the last remnants of the World War II generation and everyone before them.
<p>This makes the defining trait of the Dole generation hypocrisy. They zealously guard their own drugs — alcohol and tobacco — and declare everybody else’s different and dangerous. Pot is addictive? To some. And so is tobacco. Pot leads to harder drugs? For some. And tobacco can lead to pot. Alcohol leads to more alcohol? For some. And alcohol can lead to drugs. No matter what condemnation you put on the table against marijuana, I can put as much or more about cigarettes and alcohol. Marijuana is actually medically beneficial for some. It decreases nausea and helps with side effects for people receiving chemotherapy treatment. Except for a mild calming effect, tobacco can’t claim any medical benefits. Except as the mild digestive aid that wine purports to be, alcohol can’t claim any medical benefits.
<p>Doles’ generation, about the time they reached adulthood and could exercise some power and influence, repealed the Prohibition they had grown up under. Prohibition, which made the sale of alcohol illegal, ran from 1919 to 1933. They couldn’t hack it. They couldn’t live with the chaos and crime a ban on alcohol created. Nor, as adults, did they see any sense in continuing to criminalize an enjoyment they no doubt experienced illegally as teens and young adults. Somebody ask Strom Thurmond if he ever walked into a speakeasy or gulped a slug of moonshine, just a little inhale, even.
<p>It was a-look-the-other-way enforcement law which provided a huge business for organized crime. It made no sense. The fact is people are going to drink, some responsibly, some irresponsibly, no matter what you do. The three-martini lunch is the Washington, D.C., power meal. The religious right can protest all they want. They can make whatever they want illegal, but they can’t stop people from doing things. That is the bottom line. And some practices become so widespread, they become as unenforceable as laws against littering, jaywalking and public urinating. The occasional fine hasn’t put a dent in it.
<p>I can hear you now. Widespread vice doesn’t mean we should look the other way. Oh, yes, it does. Get out of here with that fairyland thinking. If it’s something that isn’t depriving another person of their rights, and it’s enforced sporadically, then it’s unenforceable. It’s like jaywalking, littering and parking in tow-away zones. You can fine people, but they’re not going to stop doing it. So just regulate it now. Dole’s generation made peace with their vice. Why can’t they make peace with ours? Or when will we be in a position to repeal our prohibition? What is it going to take?
<p>In my age group, it’s not uncommon to associate with people who have used marijuana regularly for 25 years or more and are now ripe for scientific study. Does it make you stupid? Yep. The ones who were stupid to begin with have stayed in a stupid mode. They’re seldom motivated to do any intelligence-enhancing activity during their leisure time. A lot of stupid people, even without pot, don’t do much to improve their minds over the course of their lifetimes. I’d like to see a study measuring the impact of 25 years of beer and televised football on the brain cells.
<p>People I know who were intelligent, alert and active when they first started smoking pot, seem to be still that way 25 years later. So you can’t say it turns people into slugs when a portion of the population is predisposed to being slugs anyway. Marijuana supports passive behavior as much as television remote controls, which are legal.
<p>Excessive pot-smokers may be annoying with their insufferable affability, but at least they’re not likely to become as violent as a room full of frat boys with a wall lined with kegs. Given the choice between being some place with people doing too much pot and people doing too much alcohol, I feel safer with the dopers. If I had to live with an argumentative roommate or spouse who was either a) a pistol-packing member of the NRA, 2) a drinker, or 3) a pot-smoker, I’d live with the pot smoker. They’re less trigger-happy and usually make it to the toilet in time.
<p>The alcohol position is it’s fine and good because you are not supposed to drink excessively. The assumption is everybody is practicing moderation. That’s the assumption. Well, you can legalize pot under that same criterion. You’re not supposed to bong yourself into oblivion. Some people will anyway, but does that mean people who can do things in moderation are criminals?
<p>You’re not going to expose the kiddies to corruption, either, because pot, being a leaf-burning product, would probably be banned under the same clean air regulations that keep tobacco out of restaurants and office buildings. Like alcohol, it would be limited for use in private homes or bars. It’s already used at open-air concerts. Tell me one you’ve gone to lately where you didn’t smell it.
<p>Marijuana is not a big thing. It is not a unique and irrefutable gateway to hell. There’s no evidence it leads to stronger drugs in people not inclined to go that route. It’s less addicting than tobacco. And if it is the root of all evil, well, you’ve got to take a long, hard look at alcohol and tobacco too, because you can’t have your toys and not give us ours. Not for much longer, anyway, because the way things are going, if you want to save tobacco from the FDA, you’re going to have to legalize pot. It’ll ignite the medical community as they look for beneficial uses, it’ll save the tobacco industry, and it’ll actually create more legal jobs in farming, manufacturing and distribution. What more can you ask for?

<font size=6><b>Allegiance: Freely Given or Coerced?</b></font>
<br><font size=4><b>If we love our country, we will freely give it a loyalty that can’t be created by making us recite the Pledge of Allegiance.</b></font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Lee Carleton</i><font>

<td valign=top>
<p><font size=6><b>T</b></font>he pressure to make The Pledge of Allegiance mandatory for children in Virginia schools is very strong. The government may mandate this pledge in places, but it cannot mandate allegiance — it is etymologically impossible. This may seem like a fine rhetorical point, but it is much more than that. It is an expression of my deep concern for the country I love and the direction in which it is headed. I love America. That is why I write and that is why I question: It is my job as a citizen. In light of this apparently patriotic requirement I must ask: Can allegiance be mandated? If so, is obligatory allegiance genuine?  
<p>The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that the word <i>allegiance</i> comes from the old word <i>liege</i> which is derived from an Old High German word for <i>free</i>.
<p>Sadly the word <i>free</i> is losing its popularity these days as we drift further and further from our libertarian roots. You may think that this pressure to pledge is a good idea. But true allegiance can only be freely given, and so the pledge becomes an empty exercise designed chiefly to comfort those who are insecure about America’s growing pains. The problem with this is that compulsory patriotic acts often have the opposite effect they are intended to have. Who wants to be forced to do <i>anything</i>? Often obligatory observances dampen the people’s affection for their country. Soviet citizens didn’t exactly dance their mandatory May Day parades.
<p>The other danger of pushy patriotism is the possibility of creating a mass of dangerous fanatics. If we take a look at history, Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany both made a big deal of symbol worship yet neither serves as an appropriate model for America. This is no coincidence. A flag or other non-language symbol can mean anything the government says it does — there is no defined boundary, no specific content. History would remind us that governments sometimes take disastrously wrong turns.
<p>At least the Pledge of Allegiance is in language and so subject to a certain amount of definition — yet it is still pledging to a nonspecific symbol and that can be dangerous.
<p>It seems to me that if we were really interested in freedom and allegiance there would be an optional pledge, and it would be to the Constitution rather than the flag. What does the flag mean anyway? Different things to different people. I guarantee that Ollie North and I disagree on what our flag means, so who is right? The one with the most guns? Is that freedom? Should each American pledge allegiance whether or not they experience liberty and justice? Core issues. Important questions
<p>An optional Pledge of Allegiance to the Constitution (and our much ignored Bill of Rights) would be a demonstration as well as a definition of freedom. Americans would be encouraged to study the truly radical ideas that this nation was founded upon, and reflect accordingly. A pledge to a nonspecific symbol can mean little in terms of true freedom and patriotism. A mandatory pledge would mean even less. America is going through some difficult growing pains now. What we need most is a voluntary and thoughtful dedication to our founding principles of liberty and justice — not mandatory rote recitations.
<p>There are some difficulties with the Pledge of Allegiance, such as that unconstitutional phrase “under God.” Which God? The God of the Christian, the Muslim, the Hindu or the Jew? What about the galaxy of other faiths that make up America? What about people who don’t believe in God or those who aren’t sure? Should they pledge allegiance to a symbol that does not include them?  I know it’s not popular in this heyday of New Puritanism, but the absolute separation of church and state is more relevant today than at the founding of our country. The movement to include the mention of God in public ritual and on currency is a fairly recent one, not a deep and clear tradition started by our founding fathers. A brief look around the globe will reveal that where religion is state supported, it is anemic and bloated. Politics overshadow piety. Franklin spoke wisely when he said that a good religion would not need state support, for its truths would be self-evident and worthy of <i>voluntary</i> popular support. So it would stand to reason that good patriotism would not need to be state mandated, but would flow naturally from a people grateful for genuine, practical freedoms.
<p>We can’t afford to dismiss our memories of patriotism gone wrong — of coerced conformity. We cannot escape the adage of remember or repeat. Nor can we mandate allegiance. Allegiance must be freely given. Allegiance must be deserved. We have some serious choices to make and we need to muster the courage to make them carefully and thoughtfully. It’s easy to fall prey to manipulative rhetoric about patriotism, but it doesn’t do much for the health of our country or the strength of our intellect. America is a changing, diversifying tribe whose greatest strengths have always been freedom and variety. It is more important than ever that we come together around genuine liberty and justice  — for <i>all</i> — before we are lured apart by the false promise of mandatory patriotic mantras.

<font size=6><b>Chemical Stew</b></font>
<br><font size=4>The hormone-mimicking chemicals pouring out into our environment may be destroying sperm and also disrupting other bodily functions.</font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Donella H. Meadows</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>T</b></font>t’s fascinating to watch the reaction to “Our Stolen Future,” the book about endocrine disruptors, which has come to be known as the book about sperm.
<p>If you’ve heard of “Our Stolen Future” at all, you’ve likely heard that it blames modern chemicals for the declining sperm count of human males. You may have heard denials too, especially from The New York Times, which has heralded a new study showing that the sperm counts of New York men not only are undiminished, but are twice as high as the sperm counts of Los Angeles men.
<p>So there!
<p>I guess it was predictable that the complex message of “Our Stolen Future” would be reduced to simple masculine one-upmanship. The book is only marginally about sperm. It is mainly about the many ways in which some human-made chemicals act like hormones. Within the bodies of all higher forms of life, these chemicals mess up subtle signals that control sexual behavior, sperm and egg production, fertilization, cell division, the unfolding of embryos, and immune system function. The possible effects include reproductive failures of birds, birth defects in whales, die-offs of seals, breast cancer in women and — maybe — declining sperm production in men.
<p>Public discussion has zoomed right in on the sperm. The book’s authors, seriously worried people, two of them scientists, have gone along to a certain extent, because they know that sperm are the key to media attention. So a profound issue is trivialized and swept away. Don’t worry about chemicals, folks, especially if you live in New York. (In L.A. maybe the low sperm count is connected to smog or O.J. or immigrants.) We have many ways to fend off ideas we don’t like. We can pretend we’ve dismissed the evidence by dismissing the messengers. (According to various reviewers, the authors of “Our Stolen Future” aren’t “regular scientists.” One is a “grandmotherly zoologist” and a “technophobe.” Another is a “crusading journalist” and the third a mere “philanthropist.”) We can deride them for writing a popular book. (“It’s a very unscientific presentation.” Of course it was intended to be, in the belief that the public ought to know what scientists are talking about. For those who want the science there are footnotes to hundreds of journal articles.)
<p>We can sneer at the fact that the publisher hired a publicity firm — “Fenton Communications, the same PR firm that brought us Meryl Streep and the Alar scare.” (By this criterion we should never listen to a politician or corporation, all of whom speak to us through publicists. This accusation also assumes that the Alar scare was false, which is by no means a certainty.)
<p>We can call into question one small corner of the argument and then claim to have disproved the whole thing. That’s what the sperm business is about. The book quotes 61 studies of falling sperm counts in 20 countries. The New York Times cites two studies showing stable sperm counts in Seattle, New York, Minnesota, and Los Angeles. (The men in these studies were volunteers for vasectomy, not typical of the whole population.) So we veer off to argue about sperm, forgetting the larger issue of endocrine disruptors, which would not be disproved even if human virility were booming everywhere. Some reviewers dismiss the endocrine disruptor hypothesis because there are natural hormone-mimicking chemicals in soybeans and broccoli. “Our Stolen Future” discusses the difference — vegetable hormones are not fat-soluble, not stored in the body or concentrated up the food chain. And of course the presence of toxins in nature is no license to release still more toxins. They have said the book is obsolete because levels of two of the worst chemicals, DDT and PCBs, are dropping. (They are dropping because these chemicals have been banned. Many other suspect chemicals are still in use.)
<p>They have put ridiculous arguments into the mouths of the authors, accusing them of wanting to ban chlorine, to stop treating drinking water and thereby to expose the world to a cholera epidemic. It’s impossible to stomp out false accusations like these. As Mark Twain said, a rumor can go three times around the world while the truth is still getting its boots on.
<p>Most maddening is the old tobacco company ploy: “it’s not proven.” A half dozen scientists are found to express doubts. Those doubts allow us, somehow, to ignore the dozens of scientists quoted in the book, who also have doubts (doubts are intrinsic to science), but who are saying, “Hey, we’re seeing something here. Of course it’s not proven, nothing in science is ever proven, but this is troubling evidence.”
<p>Ask any scientist “Is it proved that some chemicals cause endocrine disruption?” and the only possible answer is “No.” Ask “Is it proved that the quantities and mixes of chemicals we release into the environment are harmless?” and again there’s only one answer: “No.” Ask “Which is more likely on scientific grounds, that the tens of thousands of chemicals dumped into nature in enormous quantities are, or are not, harmful to life, including human life?”
<p>It would be amazing if those chemicals, individually or acting together, do no harm. Therefore the important questions are not about scientific doubt but about risk and ethics. Given some sobering evidence here, while we do more studies, while we argue about sperm, while we malign the author of “Our Stolen Future,” should we, or should we not, go on releasing hormone-mimicking chemicals with abandon into our environment? How many of these chemicals are actually needed? Who profits from them? Who bears the risk? Who should decide?

<font size=6><b>It’s the Process Stupid</b></font>
<br><font size=4>As Trigon becomes a for-profit business, who is looking after the interests of Virginia’s citizens?</font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Julie Lapham</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>T</b></font>he process of government is a complicated, yet vital process. Its survival depends on its citizens and public officials asking questions and getting answers. How we do our public business is what gives us a vibrant system of government that has lasted since the first days of Jamestown. In Virginia, we are faced with a proposal that illustrates how this system works — or rather, should work.
<p>It starts with a few basic questions: How does a nonprofit non-stock company convert into a for-profit stock company? What are the considerations? Who is responsible for the oversight? Where is the public forum that allows citizens to ask questions and raise concerns? Is this a good idea? Will health care in Virginia suffer or benefit? And what are the consequences? These are just a few of many questions that are being raised and have not begun to be answered. The Code of Virginia is practically void of guidance in this particular matter. After all, who would have suspected that a nonprofit nonstock organization would ever want to convert? Now, after 60 years of operation, Trigon Blue Cross Blue Shield wants to do just that.
<p>Is the system of state government impotent in this case? Maybe. The State Corporation Commission (SCC) has the responsibility to authorize this conversion. This regulatory commission provides oversight and guidance to corporations throughout Virginia. But its scope is limited by the laws and regulations already on the books. The Bureau of Insurance, an entity within the Commission, is also guided by law and regulation. The question of, “Is this good for Virginia?” will not be raised here.
<p>The office of the attorney general is, by law, charged with representing the interests of the people. The attorney general settled with Trigon for $159 million in return for support of the application. Initially designed to be set aside in the form of a foundation to support medical research and education, this money was increased to $175 million and diverted into the state treasury during the last General Assembly session. The question  “Is this good for Virginia?” will not be raised by this attorney general.
<p>The House majority leader led the fight for Trigon’s legislation that narrowed public participation while he was employed as one of Trigon’s attorneys. His law firm accepted thousands of dollars and contributions came to his own campaign from Trigon. When he eventually bowed to public pressure and resigned from Trigon’s payroll, his fellow lawmakers voted to narrow legislation which eventually forced the Virginia Citizen’s Consumer Council to withdraw from the case. Lawmakers listened to lavish lobbying by Trigon and saw an opportunity to stop-gap the state budget short fall with the $175 million. They also knew that nearly two million shares from the state employees’ health care program would be given to them for distribution. Some of these same lawmakers also received campaign contributions from Trigon — some of those funds distributed during the legislative session. The question of, “Is this good for Virginia?” will not be raised by members of the General Assembly.
<p>Main Street will certainly not speak out. Stockbrokers stand to make hundreds of thousands of dollars trading stock on this venture. Big and small businesses are silenced — they are receiving shares of stock and cash.
<p>Traditional voices have been silenced. Doctors are torn between those already affiliated with HMOs and those who are not. They are faced with choosing between employers and what is best for their patients.
<p>The churches, a traditional voice for the poor, have been receiving Trigon’s charitable gifts for years. Some churches are policyholders. Their voice has been silent. Organized groups such as labor, public employees and the elderly are the recipients of either stock, cash or charitable grants. Their voices, too, are silent.
<p>Soon the SCC will render its decision on Trigon’s application and public policy will have had no adequate forum. The thorough process that would give the public answers and an opportunity to raise their voices and understand the intricate details in this matter will have been silenced by the numerous conflicting interests that have a hand in this unique configuration.
<p>We can’t expect Trigon to raise the question; their goal, stated publicly and on the record, is to get bigger.
<p>So who is left to raise the question, “Is this conversion good for Virginia?”
<p>The silence is more than deafening; it’s stifling.
<p>Trigon’s application raises many legal issues regarding the issuance of stock, lock-up times, when to hold annual meetings, directors stock option packages, that are simple only to lawyers. Other issues: fairness to policyholders, what happens to the insurer of last resort program, and whether this plan in the public interest, seem easier to discuss.
<p>The doctrine of cy pres, for example, is a familiar one to nonprofit charitable trust organizations. In essence, the doctrine requires that the value of nonprofit organizations be held in trust for a purpose similar to that for which the nonprofit was founded. Because Trigon is currently incorporated as a nonprofit corporation, it continues to hold through Blue Cross Blue Shield assets and net income therefrom in trust for the public. If the corporate
status changes to for-profit, Trigon must continue to use the assets earned as a nonprofit for charitable purposes. Trigon’s Blue Cross Blue Shield’s articles of incorporation state that it is, “not organized for profit but is organized and shall be operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare within the meaning of section 501(c)4 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.” At issue are the Blue Cross Blue Shield assets. Should they be subject to a constructive charitable trust dedicated to serving the health care needs of the communities in which it has operated for its 60 years?
<p>In California, for example, Blue Cross was required to transfer an amount equal to the fair market value of their assets - more than $3 billion - to foundations that will continue to meet the health care needs of California’s residents.
<p>Virginia has about one million residents either without health insurance or inadequate insurance. That is about 17 percent of our population.
<p>Although Trigon has an excess of $740 million, discovering the true value of assets is more difficult. Just how do we value a company whose logo, the blue cross and shield, is recognized worldwide, second only to Coca-Cola.
<p>What is perhaps more important is not which agency will determine the value of the company: Trigon? The General Assembly? The attorney general? The State Corporation Commission? but will any agency!
<p>And what if this conversion is not unique? What if there are other nonprofits considering a conversion? Hospitals for example. As we enter newly created frameworks with new and different ground rules, how do we raise the question, “Is this good for Virginia?”
<p>That silence is still deafening!

<font size=6><b>Choosing Money over Hope</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Paying dying patients not to try unproven treatments can destroy hope and the final quality of life.</font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Dr. William Regelson</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>R</b></font>ecently, a major insurance company authorized a study at MCV to determine if cancer patients can be offered a choice after a prognosis establishes that treatment would not contribute to “quality” survival. 
<p>If you have this catastrophic disease for which little can be done, you would be able to elect to receive an $18,000 package to do with as you see fit. The choice would be to “gather your rosebuds while you may” or choose an “unsatisfactory” or “experimental” program. This would mean that your physician would have to lay it on the line: “I’m sorry friend, there is nothing that has proven to be really effective for your condition. Here is an insurance opportunity to save you and your family discomfort and money.”
<p>There is precedence for this: Some AIDS victims have been given the chance to cash their insurance policies to pay for treatment or support, or to enjoy a last fling. On the surface, this approach to “honest appraisal” has been anticipated by Hospice (an organization that helps provide a supportive environment for the dying), but the apparent difference between Hospice and an insurance company-supported program is based on how much money the insurer can save by convincing patients to accept death rather than holding onto hope of effective treatment.
<p>When we think about this, two very serious drawbacks become apparent. The patient loses hope — even the placebo effect that trying an unproved treatment can have — and treatments waiting in the wings to be proven are delayed or maybe even discouraged forever.
<p>HMOs, prepaid insurance programs, have already created problems with the treatment of advanced cancer patients. In New York City’s Memorial Center, the “mother church” of cancer research is jeopardized because other less research-oriented centers can treat patients at a lower price.
<p>What is the price for “honest appraisal” and the opportunity to cash in by giving up your try at therapy? The bottom line is that it would turn your oncologist into the angel of death. You would now be under the care of a physician who would be compelled to say: “I give you six months on the outside.” Where, in that statement, is the element of hope or encouragement? The job of your hematologist or medical oncologist is not only to provide treatment options, but most importantly, to provide the element of hope — hope that transcends statistically developed lethal datelines.
<p>I once had a tobacco farmer for a patient. He was dying of lung cancer, and he asked me if he should put in the coming season’s tobacco crop. It was his way of asking if he could live until spring. I called the family in, and because of their cooperation, told my patient to look forward to planting. Despite a poor prognosis, he had six months of hopeful life. What would his life have been if I had told him the dismal truth?
<p>For life to have quality you have to be able to look forward to pleasant events: birthdays, holidays, graduations and the beauty of spring.
<p>Not long ago, a friend found she had advanced bladder cancer. Following radiotherapy, she suffered such serious side effects that her treatment had to be interrupted. A physician told her nothing could be done to help her — she was too old and sick for further treatment. Depressed, she was ready to sell her business, which was an expression of her vital force. We, fortunately, found another physician who gave her treatment and hope. She had another year of decent life.
<p>I’ve been dealing with cancer patients for 46 years. Without the element of hope, it can be a dismal business for physician and patient.
<p>In contrast, I had the privilege of being among the first to develop the vinca alkaloids (derived from the periwinkle vine) that have led to cures in Hodgkin’s disease and leukemias. I’ve seen stricken patients come back from near death.
<p>During the time of this chemotheraputic breakthrough, I was running pediatric oncology because, at that time, we couldn’t get pediatricians to specialize in the field. It was too depressing. I’ll never forget seven dying leukemic children responding to our first successful drug. We didn’t need a mass of statistics. Our treatment success was obvious.
<p>Even when we often could contribute little, it was my faith and the patient’s belief in my optimism that sustained the quality of their survival. We pioneers in the cancer treatment business, like my beloved MCV colleague Susan Mellette and others, all had patients who lived longer and significantly better because we provided hope.
<p>Fortunately, there are new treatments developing. Even a treatment that doesn’t guarantee prolongation of life has a bell-curve distribution that permits an occasional long-term cure. I have one long-term bowel cancer patient, with disease metastatic to the liver, who should be dead, but who for the past 25 years has dedicated her life to providing the element of hope to other victims.
<p>I’m not for sham, and I am disturbed when I see medical oncology used as a big business, a business that can see life extension as a profit center. But the public should be aware that when we physicians become minions of the insurance companies, they will call the tune. We become part of a profit-making machine.
<p>There are moralists who insist that for the sake of society’s emotional maturity we need to accept the reality of death. I agree with this when it comes to most cases of cardiac resuscitation. But emergency procedures present a different program than do patients who have a year, six months, or even several months of life.
<p>Stripping viable people of treatment options sends them to alternative medicine or adds to their depression and the loss of quality in their remaining life.
<p>For legalists, we now have a list of options in a document — called “Informed Consent” — that is given before any clinical procedures.
<p>This document has always been misnamed because when a patient agrees to a therapy, he or she usually looks into the doctor’s eyes and asks: “Doc, do you believe I should do this?” In the final analysis, it should be the human contact between the doctor and the patient that makes the difference in a patient’s or a family’s decision-making — not the insurance contract.
<p>We should not forget that such decision-making has chased women out of maternity hospitals before they were ready, and we can expect the same thing to happen to our cancer patients in the name of cost-saving and efficiency.
<p>If you are a cancer patient, before you take the $18,000 as a benign alternative and run away from toxicity and treatment, be sure you know what your treatment options are — particularly if there is an experimental program out there that could possibly change your fate. 
<p>As HMO prepaid programs grow, we must insist that they make a contribution to the research effort so essential to our survival and to keeping hope alive.

<font size=6><b>Hiding Our Shame</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Instead of hiding the mentally ill, why not try some proven community-based treatment?</font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Valerie L. Marsh</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>F</b></font>or several reasons, the question of trust is becoming a focal point in this year’s presidential election. As candidates Dole and Clinton hit the hustings with a new batch of political promises every day, I hope that their campaign messages will be held to strict tests of veracity by the news media, nonprofit “watchdog” groups and individual voters.
<p>If I had to conjecture right now, based upon millions of Clinton and Dole words read and listened to since the preprimary maneuvering began after the 1994 elections, I would say this:  They are both men of substance, “qualified” to handle the job they seek.
<p>The president will be re-elected because the economy has generally improved since ’92 and the American people, who clearly neither love nor trust Bill Clinton, have found a certain comfort level with this Arkansan’s performance.
<p>But I also believe that the trust issue may keep this year’s presidential election in play. Just as in the recent Dick Morris episode, you never know what might happen.
<p>My bottom line: No matter which of these men wins, we the people lose to Machiavellian principals and their surrounding schemers who will control the U.S. presidency.
<p>The empirical evidence remains that trust between Americans and their national government is said to be at a historical low and still deteriorating. Citizens sense that the failures and the arrogance of our elected officials, our own inability to have an impact on public policy, and the void of real conversation between people and politicians constitute a danger to our society. Unaddressed, this national divide may have disastrous consequences within the not-too-distant future. For example, another few years of demagoguery and inaction on Medicare and Social Security spending may bankrupt these systems leaving our 70-year-olds with no health insurance and our thirtysomethings with no retirement savings.
<p>Today politicians at all levels routinely mislead the public about such important public business.
<p>Remember last spring in New Hampshire when Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton made the famous handshake, on live TV, saying they promised a bipartisan campaign practices reform bill in the current session of Congress? Well, we never saw the cooperation, we never saw the bill, we didn’t even see more rhetoric!  We rarely saw mention of it in the media. We rarely heard complaints from all those “good government” types. And where was the outcry from the abused public?
<p>This was simply one more example of how our elected officials pander to the monied special interests. They hedge, obfuscate, withhold information and tell big, fat lies.
<p>Comedienne Lilly Tomlin put it well: “No matter how cynical you become, it’s never enough to keep up.”
<p>By their behavior, these well-compensated, often-honored “servants of the people” do more to destroy American values and disillusion our young people than all other community miscreants combined. After all, it is these officials who make the rules that govern us all. They set examples. 
<p>The size and nature of politicians’ deceptions vary. After a while in Washington, our leaders may not even recognize the difference between fact and fiction. Sometimes they fail to speak the truth (they rationalize) for “the larger good” which they are intent on accomplishing; sometimes it’s simply to further their personal ambitions. It seems that the higher the office, with more at stake and more power to wield, the greater the compulsion to evade tough questions and grossly mislead the electorate. Sometimes, as we have witnessed this year, candidates for their party’s nomination or even new vice-presidential candidates will radically alter their views — then proceed to spread a new set of tall tales.
<p>Those voters who have not become alienated from politics altogether have at least lowered their standards to accommodate the mediocre candidates who run for office. Witness Bill Clinton leading in all the polls. How can any American’s conscience rest easy when the incumbent president of the United States finds it necessary to establish a personal legal defense fund?
<p>Bill Clinton is one slick rascal. His recent move to the political right — such as his decision to roll the dice with welfare recipients and their children — reeks of cynical opportunism.
<p>Bob Dole is no better. 
<p>Dole’s “new” economic plan, currently the backbone of his appeal for votes, is not at all honest. Despite his attempts to wrap the plan in trickle-down economic theory, old-fashioned American optimism and even a small dose of compassion, it remains — and has been widely recognized as — blatant election year vote-grabbing.
<p>The U.S. spends one-sixth of its annual income on interest on our national debt — and Dole wants to lose $548 billion in revenues without any specified budget cuts and with only the hope that part of the loss would be made up by extra economic growth?  Give me a break!  
<p>Bob Dole’s agenda for America is replete with such hypocrisy.
<p>Dole and Clinton are two of a kind, captives of a political system which rewards the right image, big money connections and vicious partisan politics over more authentic qualifications for public office.
<p>They are addicted to their highly-paid consultants, the opinion polls and the 30-second TV ad, consequently allowing the fund-raisers, special political “strategists” and candidate “handlers” to control their campaigns. Like virtually every other candidate today they further diminish the role of their political parties and volunteers, and further squeeze democracy out of the candidate selection process.
<p>Both Clinton and Dole are wedded to duplicity whenever it might help.  The high-minded campaign rhetoric we now hear from them baldly contradicts their public records. They can see no further than the next election. These men (and most of the political leaders who surround them and support them) will not change.
<p>Bob Dole and Bill Clinton have done what they considered necessary to become their parties’ foremost leaders in 1996 and contest the big enchilada. There is not a snowball’s chance in hell that either one will do what is necessary and right for our country.

<font size=6><b>Hiding Our Shame</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Instead of hiding the mentally ill, why not try some proven community-based treatment?</font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Valerie L. Marsh</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>R</b></font>ichmond, like countless cities across the country, has been struggling with locating agencies for the homeless. It is a painful struggle. Homelessness is not new. So, instead of reinventing the wheel, it is possible to learn from the past.
<p>The current wave of homelessness in the United States has been likened to the Great Depression. Researchers from the University of Chicago published a 1939 study of that city’s shelters. They were interested in what helped homeless men become successfully integrated back into the community. They found that reintegration was least likely for people who stayed in shelters that were warehouses stuck off in industrial areas, far from the rest of the community.
<p>It is commonplace for the average person to say homeless people should just get a job like the rest of us. But banishing homeless people to remote areas is really a terribly mixed message — “We wish you were more like us, but stay away from us because you are not like us.”
<p>There have been strong reactions in Richmond recently to a request made to the Department of Justice to investigate possible civil rights violations during the six-year struggle to relocate the Daily Planet. The request was made by several homeless individuals, as well as two state advocacy organizations, the Virginia Unit of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Virginia Alliance for the Mentally Ill. These groups contend that homeless people are being discriminated against because of race and psychiatric disability.
<p>Clearly many do not agree. 
<p>Responses to the DOJ investigation request have included allegations of how unpleasant the homeless appear to be — accusations of loitering, littering, dangerousness and criminal activity. By focusing on these stereotypes, we miss the broader issues that our community must face.
<p>Why do we have thousands of homeless people each year who need the services of the Daily Planet? Rather than institutionalizing homeless services, how can we reduce or eliminate the need for them at all?
<p>There is no one answer, because there are so many facets to the problem. Let’s take the homeless who are mentally ill. It is no coincidence that at least a third of the homeless have a serious mental illness. The public has been led to believe that “deinstitutionalization” has caused homelessness — this being the dramatic policy shift decades ago to move care for the mentally ill out of state hospitals into the communities. 
<p>Deinstitutionalization has not failed because it has never been truly implemented. We managed to move people out of the hospitals, but we never transferred the hospital resources into the communities to provide adequate care. Today in Virginia, 70 percent of the state’s public mental health resources still support our state hospitals. This is despite the fact that each year, these facilities are only able to serve approximately 10,000 of Virginia’s estimated 240,000 mentally ill citizens. 
<p>Mental illness alone does not cause homelessness. Lack of available treatment and support certainly exacerbate symptoms of brain disorders that decrease the chances for stability. Beyond that, having a mental illness increases the number of obstacles an individual must face when trying to access the same quality of life that all of us dream of. Obstacles take many shapes, but for people with these terribly misunderstood brain disorders, obstacles are partially rooted in discrimination, in which one person is deemed not to deserve what another has because of some characteristic they possess. 
<p>Our values and this discrimination are played out in how we allocate our dollars. Homelessness among the mentally ill is the end result of collective decisions to put our resources elsewhere. Virginia ranks 14th in the nation in per-capita income. However, according to a 1993 national survey of all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Virginia ranks 50 out of 51 in per-capita spending for community based public mental health services. Further, the city of Richmond recently decided to allow our local public mental health system to have more autonomy in order to reduce the city’s budget by $1.8 million. 
<p>Yet citizens are unhappy when they drive by the Daily Planet and see behaviors associated with untreated mental illnesses. And now, some of us wish to hide the very evidence of our neglect. The tragedy is that it is all so unnecessary. Treatment works for mental illnesses. There are community-based treatments now available that have remarkable success rates, if only Virginia and the city of Richmond would try them. 
<p>Most people have been raised to believe that we must all be the same, especially when it comes to behavior. Differences are not well tolerated in our current culture. We are not all the same, especially those with a biologically based imbalance in brain chemistry. But when this uncontested drive for sameness has consequences of facilitating serious inequities, deprivation and suffering, it is time to reexamine. If we as a community are uncomfortable with mentally ill people who need the Daily Planet, it would be more effective to help them not need the Daily Planet, instead of hiding them away. That requires us to embrace, not blame. Homelessness is really our own collective shame. We can and should do better.

<font size=6><b>Pogo’s Prophecy</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Those who want to give powers back to the states are living in an imaginary world.</font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Rozanne Epps</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>I</b></font>n 1990 when George Bush announced that the Cold War was over, that we had “clearly outgrown” the post World War II “clash,” most of us rejoiced. Then a strange thing happened. We had lived so long with an implacable enemy that it almost seemed a hole had opened in our collective psyche. If Russia was a friend, who then was our enemy? We needed one.
<p>In a weird psychological twist, it seems that many of us have satisfactorily filled that hole by turning on ourselves like the mythological scorpions who sting themselves to death.
<p>In some ways this is a natural reaction. The world feels as if it is spinning out of control, and there is nothing we individually can do about it. Our national government exercises control of parts of our lives; it takes a chunk of our income in taxes; it tells us we can’t carry assault weapons; we can’t fill in wetlands even if we have a legal title of ownership.
<p>How nice if the government would let us alone to pursue our own interests, or if it won’t, how nice it would be to rid ourselves of the tyranny of the federal government and as the reasoning goes, “turn things over to the states.” After all, this country was founded for individual freedom; the states are closer to the people and can better look after their interests.
<p>But there are problems with this comforting idea. First some elementary-school history: Once upon a time the states, which numbered 13, had control of many more things within their borders. And guess what? It didn’t work. Trade between the states was an obstacle course. The money of one state was not necessarily legal tender in the others. Some states allowed white male citizens to own slaves, and it took a war to enable the central government to free these slaves. As Jefferson (himself benefiting from states’ rights by owning slaves) wrote: “the good sense and good dispositions of the people, as soon as they perceived the incompetence of their first compact, instead of leaving its correction to insurrection and civil war, agreed with one voice to elect deputies to a general convention, who should peaceably meet and agree on such a constitution as ‘would ensure peace, justice, liberty, the common defence & general welfare.’”
<p>At one time, most school children knew the preamble to the resulting document: “We the People of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”
<p>Today, whether we like it or not, we live in a complex mass society in which only a centralized government can deal effectively with certain issues. It’s interesting that those who spend so much time complaining about the tyranny of the federal government and want to turn the powers over to the states make plenty of demands on the central government. They are often at the front of those demanding air safety, a national ban on child pornography, federal control of our borders, disaster relief — not to mention veterans’ benefits and federal laws to ban abortion and outlaw gays, and protection against terrorists. The presence of E. coli and other bacteria in our food supply brings calls for better inspection of meat and poultry which are, of course, shipped across many state lines. The federal government then becomes a protector not the enemy.
<p>The world of the “government is our enemy” true believer is a schizophrenic one.
<p>We can’t have it both ways, but we can try to have it in better ways. We don’t need to have an FBI that gives our files to anyone who asks for them — or indeed keeps a file on us because of the groups we support. We don’t need a government that is bought by special interests like the NRA or the large health maintenance organizations. Nor do we need a central government that leases mineral rights on public lands to private companies for little or nothing.
<p>Those whom we elect to run the government become very powerful. Power breeds arrogance, and there is plenty of the arrogance of power in Washington. But we still own the U.S. government, In this day of continuous polls, the Internet, e-mail, faxes, even snail mail, the people to whom the government belongs can more easily than ever protest and have an effect on impending legislation.
<p>Try writing a note to your representative in Congress and see if you don’t get a response. And make sure it is not one of those “believe me I value your opinion” generic answers. If you do get such an answer write again. It takes a little persistence but insist on a response. I’ve tried it, and you’ll eventually get one. Meanwhile, there is someone in the representative’s office counting the pros and cons.
<p>Owning our government is hard work. We have to keep informed — even if it means spending some time watching C-SPAN and volunteering with groups that are working for the things we believe in.
<p>It’s easier to call the government the enemy, to echo Pogo when he said, “We have met the enemy and he is us.” But it’s getting tiresome to listen to those calls for turning things back to the states from people who are afraid of change and sharing, and who don’t remember our history.

<font size=6><b>Watch Whatever You Say</b></font>
<br><font size=5>Careless language is the latest development in the trend toward careless thought.</font>
<br><font size=4><i>by Caroline Knapp</i><font>

<p><font size=6><b>I</b></font> was going to write a column about the increasing tendency toward imprecision and intellectual laziness in modern speech patterns, but, well  ... whatever.
<p>I mean, this is complicated subject matter — at heart, it’s about how people seem increasingly unwilling even to try to make themselves understood these days. In order to address it thoroughly, I’d have to think hard about what I wanted to say, and then I’d have to form logical arguments, and then I’d have to consider what the counter-arguments might be, and, well ... whatever.
<p>Do you get what I’m saying? Have you noticed how the word <i>whatever</i> has crept into the lexicon, taken its place alongside <i>like</i> and <i>y’know</i> as one of those automatic sentence-fillers that prevent people from having to complete a thought? Is this driving you crazy, too? Does it make you throw up your hands in despair and wonder what’s happened to the art of normal human conversation? I mean, it’s ... I mean ... well, whatever.
<p>I don’t know who’s responsible for this latest step in the dumbing-down of the English language, although I suspect it was one of those boy dolts on “Friends.” Sample “Friends” dialogue:
<p>Chandler: “You’re a jerk.” 
<p>Joey: “Yeah, right, whatever.”
<p>What can we glean from this bit of perky repartee? What statement does the word <i>whatever</i> actually make?
<p>Oh, we all know what it’s supposed to communicate. One is supposed to toss off the word <i>whatever</i> in an off-handed, cynical, slightly arrogant way, as if to suggest that the other speaker’s words or ideas are so woefully unimportant that they don’t require a dignified response.
<p>“Whatever” is supposed to signal that the speaker is cool and vaguely superior, that the listener is hopelessly out of it and easily dismissed. Billy used the word constantly when he bitched and moaned at his idiot wife, Brooke, on “Melrose Place.” Brooke would go off on one of her pseudo-psycho tirades, accusing Billy of all manner of injustices and betrayals, and Billy would just gape at her stupidly and say, “Sure, Brooke. Whatever.”
<p>But aren’t there better ways of communicating that brand of cool cynicism and detached superiority? Can’t someone come up with something even a shade more provocative?
<p>Much has been written about how television has contributed to the deterioration of communication skills in recent decades, but I’d argue that this has only been true within the past few years. I’d also argue that 10 or 20 years ago, right around the time critics began complaining that TV was producing a generation of bleary-eyed, unimaginative, inarticulate zombies, dialogue on TV was actually far more evocative and inspiring than it is today.
<p>Think about Alan Alda’s Hawkeye Pierce on “*M*A*S*H*”, or Bea Arthur on “Maude.” Those characters managed to convey a wealth of arrogance and intellectual superiority while speaking in full sentences.
<p>Likewise, you never heard Mary Richards turn to Lou Grant on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” and say, “Right, Mr. Grant. Whatever.” 
<p>In the past, even the most oafish thinkers on TV managed to communicate witty and coherent thoughts — Archie Bunker may not have been a grammarian’s dream, but at least his language was rich.
<p>Today, word-rich dialogue — particularly the kind that communicates complex thoughts — is the exception rather than the rule in television. You hear it on shows like “Seinfeld,” and on better dramas like “Chicago Hope,” but far more often, you’ll find two characters staring dumbly at one another and saying  ... well, you know, whatever.
<p>(An interesting anomaly is The “X-Files”: Moulder and Scully say <i>whatever</i> to each other, but they’ve co-opted the word. They utter it with a kind of half-wink, suggesting that they understand how stupid and meaningless it really is. In other words, they have out-whatevered <i>whatever</i>, thereby underscoring the show’s reputation as one of the most intellectually sharp and cutting-edge dramas on TV.)
<p><i>Whatever</i> is a twenty-something word, not because it’s used primarily by people in their 20s (although this may be the case), but because it speaks to the worst part of that generation’s ethic — its tradition of using something hip and arrogant to disguise deeper strains of intellectual laziness and insecurity. It’s a slacker word, the linguistic equivalent of a convenience store job, a way to be disengaged and lethargic but still come out sounding cool.
<p>This is why it’s so insidious. When a speaker lapses into a flood of <i>likes</i> and <i>you knows</i>, at least his or her inability to articulate a complete thought is clearly exposed. Likewise, when someone uses such bastardized terms as <i>impacted</i> and <i>utilized</i>, at least you can shake your head and pity the poor fool for not having a better handle on basic language.
<p>But the word <i>whatever</i> hides all this, cloaking an essential lack of intellectual rigor in arrogance and pretension. It’s obnoxious. It’s deceptive. It’s ... well, whatever.

<h1>Hate Speech is Hurtful</h1>
<h3>There are limits to free speech</h3>
<h3>by Donella Meadows </h3>

<p>The painters arrived, set their radio on the lawn, switched it on and went up their ladders to scrape the second floor.
<p>The program they were beaming through the beautiful summer day was Don Imus. I didn’t know that at first, because I’d never heard Don Imus. I’d heard OF him, but I thought you could only HEAR him in New York or Washington or some other urban den of iniquity.
<p>So, OK, I lead a sheltered life.
<p>Working in the yard, I was aware of radio chatter, background noise, easy to ignore. Then a song came on. Songs are catchy; they make you stop and listen.
<p>It was a folksy tune, a cheery-sounding male singer, and the most awful stream of anti-Semitism I had ever heard. My jaw dropped. They can’t really broadcast stuff like this, can they?
<p>Apparently they can. The ditty went on to assert that if there’s anything worse than a Jew, it’s a black. Up on their ladders the painters whistled along.
<p>I don’t get angry easily, but when I do, it’s as if white-hot magma starts rising from my toes and erupts through the top of my head. Before I knew what I was doing, I stomped over and snapped off the radio. I barely repressed an urge to heave it into the bushes.
<p>“Hey!” came a cry from the top of a ladder.
<p>“That’s hate talk,” I said through clenched teeth. “I will not have it anywhere near my house.”
<p>“It’s not hate talk. It’s comedy!”
<p>“It’s NOT FUNNY!” I shouted. “Six million people died because of talk like that! If you want to keep working here, the radio stays off!”
<p>Later, after I calmed down, I reminded myself that these are good guys, my neighbors, not haters, just looking for something to occupy their minds while they do a tedious job. Part of me felt guilty for cutting off their entertainment; another part felt guilty for not assembling them in a circle and delivering a stern lecture on the insidiousness of jokes made at the expense of other people.
<p>What I did instead was brood. What should I have done? What can we say to the easygoing folks who think it’s funny to demean others? What’s likely to happen to a nation that broadcasts that kind of talk every day?
<p>I’ve had this problem since the days when Dartmouth alumni thought it was cute to have fake Indian “mascots” strutting around doing foolish things at football games. I couldn’t get across to frat members why I was not amused by obscene jokes about women. I couldn’t convince the kids on the Dartmouth Review staff that it was beyond the bounds of journalistic ethics to taunt gay students and black professors in print.
<p>Lighten up, they said. Quit spoiling our fun.
<p>They developed a label for fussbudgets like me — PC, politically correct — which let them make a whole new round of jokes, not only against Jews, blacks, women, homosexuals, the poor and the handicapped, but also against anyone who defended them. People in power started doing that, too. Then owners of radio stations discovered they could make millions broadcasting sick humor to folks who would listen mindlessly.
<p>And mindlessly idle gangs burn black churches. Mindlessly urban punks beat up gays or Jews. Mindlessly, folks elect politicians who unfailingly distribute costs and benefits along racist lines. Mindlessly, the German people laughed at jokes about Jews, and the Serbian people listened as the regime of Slobodan Milosevic broadcast hate-talk against the Bosnian Muslims.
<p>Hey, lighten up. The painters in your yard aren’t going to commit genocide.
<p>Of course they aren’t. But even if the hate talk never gets that serious, it hurts people. If someone in my yard punched someone else, I would intervene. Shouldn’t I do the same if the punch is verbal? Shouldn’t politicians who, I am told, actually appear on the Don Imus show, be ashamed of themselves? Shouldn’t a society, even one that believes in the beautiful principle of free speech, forbid broadcasts of messages that deride certain subsets of people? Isn’t hate-talk as bad as, if not worse than, sex-talk, or treason-talk or falsely yelling fire in theaters? In all those cases we wisely insist that the right to free speech is linked to responsibility for the consequences.
<p>I suppose I didn’t have to forbid the radio to the painters entirely, but I was worried about other programs like that one. So we had a blessed silence. The painters did a good job, too, and on time. I hope they used the quiet to do a little thinking. With all the kinds of fun you can have in this world, why choose that kind?

<br clear=left><small>Henry Clay Wheless  
<br>Photo by Stephen Salpukas 
</small>

<p><font size=5 color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Part Four:</b></font>
<br><font size=4 color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>A Killer Deception</b></font>
<hr size=1>
By about 4:30 p.m. the day after Clay Wheless murdered his wife, he was down $300 at a craps table at Harrah’s. According to casino and phone records, he returned to his room after 5 p.m. and at 5:52 p.m. phoned USAir.
<p>The casino system that kept such detailed track of Wheless’ movements, from the gaming tables to his room, to restaurants and clubs, served as both his alibi and his downfall. Subpoenaed by the Atlantic County Prosecutor’s Office, which assisted Henrico County in the investigation, the records show that Wheless gambled steadily from Tuesday until Friday morning, except for a window of inactivity from 10:30 a.m. Wednesday morning March 16 to just after midnight March 17. Time enough to drive to Philadelphia International Airport, hop a flight to Richmond, land at 3:02 p.m., wait until dark, pick up his wife’s Volvo, make a bank deposit from a phony account opened in his daughter’s name and drive back to Philadelphia International Airport. There, he exchanged the Volvo for his own BMW, drove back to Atlantic City and continued to gamble until Friday morning.
<p>When he returned to Atlantic City he began laying the bricks in a fortress of lies. He told a bartender and a waitress at the hotel’s Harbor Club that he had tried to contact his wife and couldn’t get an answer. He was growing concerned. They encouraged him to call the police. He said he did but that the police instructed him not to drive back because he had been drinking. He had the waitress so worried that she called him in his hotel room from her home to check on him. When the phone rang, he picked it up frantically and answered, “Jean?” It was part of the plan.
<p>It was also part of the plan to ask a neighbor to come inside the house with him when he got home, an unwitting witness to Wheless’ “discovery” of his wife’s disappearance and the unusual evidence of the bottle of bourbon and the unlocked deadbolt. He called the police.

<hr size=1 width=10%>
<p>Just before 8 p.m. on March 11, Investigator Robert C. East interviewed Wheless and says that he did not suspect Wheless in his wife’s disappearance right away. But the following week, in a follow-up interview, Wheless made the mistake (or the misguided decision) of telling a half-truth instead of a lie. From East’s handwritten notes: “I then began to ask him more about his business trip, and he told me that it was not really a business trip. He said that a friend of his had given him a name of someone to see at DuPont in Wilmington, Del., about a job. When he arrived there, he found out that the person did not exist. He then decided to drive on to New Jersey and checked in at Harrah’s hotel and           casino ...”
<p>“That was the key that opened the door,” says East. It prompted him to do a financial check on Wheless in which he learned that Wheless was $400,000 in debt — more than $100,000 in credit cards alone — and carrying four mortgages on the house.
<p>In the meantime, Jean Wheless’ disappearance began making headlines. Wheless did interviews with the Richmond Times-Dispatch and the local TV stations retelling the same tale: He was away on a business trip, he returned to find his wife missing, it was unlike her to leave without so much as a note, he’s gone over every scrap of paper, everything he can think of to make sense of it, “Sweetheart,” he pleaded on Channel 12, “if you’re out there, for any reason at all, we all love you ...”
<p>That Sunday, Mary Kay Halterman came from McCormick, S.C., to be with her brother-in-law and to assist in the search for her sister. She had an idea that Wheless had no choice but to go along with: She called a psychic. “[Clay] never had believed in those sorts of things but said he’d go along with it,” Halterman recalls. She contacted Anne Gehman in Northern Virginia who asked that Halterman send a piece of Jean’s jewelry, an unwashed piece of clothing, pictures of Jean and her birth date. Gehman eventually told Halterman and Wheless that Jean would be found in a large body of water about 35 miles west of Richmond. The spot Wheless describes putting his wife’s body is approximately 40 miles west of Richmond. 
<p>Within weeks, East was focusing his investigation of Jean’s disappearance squarely on Wheless. Sensing he could trust Halterman, he confided in her after she returned to West Virginia that Wheless was his one and only suspect. “I was never suspicious of anything until Detective East told me that they suspected Clay. I really went to pieces after that.”
<p>After the discovery of Jean’s car at Philadelphia International Airport in April with blood stains in the trunk, police served search warrants at the Wheless home, for the car and the storage shed. They took blood and hair from Wheless.
<p>Forensic tests from the house revealed traces of an organic material that could have been blood in the Wheless’ upstairs bathroom and in the utility room next to the family room, but little else. A Luminol test, which shows flourescent traces of blood in a darkened room, showed drag marks across the utility room floor, which is next to the family room and leads out to the driveway.
<p>Police discovered all of Wheless’ phony bank statements, consulting records and thousands of losing lottery tickets at his officelike storage shed on Patterson Avenue.
<p>Police even followed Wheless on several occasions. Once in April, they followed him to Atlantic City and another time to the boat ramp where Wheless says he put his wife’s body. He drove very slowly across the bridge, stopped about halfway and looked into the James River. Then he got back into his car and drove speedily back toward Richmond.
<p>There are other puzzling pieces of evidence that remain unexplained. A chemical test on the wood floor of the Wheless’ master bedroom showed that one spot had been cleaned with bleach and a pillow was missing from the bed, which Wheless has never explained. “We speculated he smothered her,” East says. If that was the case, it would be much easier to prove premeditation, which is necessary for a first degree murder conviction.
<p>Wheless spent the next two years trying to dig out of the rubble of financial ruin. In November 1994, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Soon after, he lost his Pump Road house but continued to rent it from the new owner. He went to work for JC Penney as an accountant, but in April of this year, was arrested on felony check fraud charges stemming back to checks he wrote between August and October 1995. Wheless failed to show for his preliminary hearing and was considered a fugitive until an anonymous tip led police to Tucker Psychiatric Pavilion at Chippenham Medical Center, where he’d admitted himself.
<p>Despite the mess his old lies had spawned, Wheless continued to weave new lies. Police say two women he has dated since his wife’s death told them that Wheless said his wife had died of cancer. One of those women says he boasted constantly about the money he had and consulting jobs for Reynolds Metals, McGuire Woods Battle & Boothe and Richmond Newspapers Inc. He also apologized for the appearance of his car, saying he was waiting for his new Lexus or Infiniti from the dealership. One woman cut off her relationship with him, telling him, “Every time you open your mouth, you tell me a lie.” She thought it was odd, she says, that Wheless never showed any emotion over the loss of his wife.
<p>Finally, in July 1996, more than two years after the murder, Wheless was indicted for his wife’s murder. Commonwealth’s Attorney Toby Vick credits Henrico police’s dogged determination with pulling it all together. Investigator East says even as time went on and other homicides commanded his attention, he’d always make some time for the Wheless case. “It was something we never gave up on,” he says.
<p>With an indictment and a court date set for Oct. 28 to Nov. 1, Toby Vick and his prosecution team set about to do what only two prosecutors in the history of Virginia have ever been able to do: convict a person for murder without the most crucial piece of evidence. A body.

<br><font size=4 color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>The Final Bet</b></font>
<hr size=1>
By the time Clay Wheless was indicted for murder, he had no money to pay a lawyer. Judge Buford Parsons asked the flamboyant David E. Boone, lawyer/pilot/sometime pitchman for Nathan’s clothiers to take the case. After hearing the details of the case, Boone made an unusual request of the court: to pay for an investigator. The court said no, but Boone, determined to get former FBI agent Jack Davis on the case, made an arrangement with the court whereby the lawyer would take the case free so the court could pay Davis. He also brought on partner and former prosecutor Stacy Garrett and William Linka, an attorney experienced in DNA cases. With Linka attacking the sparse forensic evidence and Davis unearthing a credible witness who says she saw Jean Wheless on March 17 — at least a day after the prosecution would contend she was killed — Boone promises, “It was gonna be a hell of a trial.”
<p>Though there was some vacillation among the defense team members, Boone says they believed in Wheless’ innocence until the end. Their ace in the hole was the Powhatan woman who called police in March of 1994 after seeing Jean Wheless on the news. She said a woman matching Jean Wheless’ description was stopped at a light in front of her at Pump and Patterson in a blue Volvo sedan on March 17. She distinctly remembered the details because she herself was in a Volvo and noted at the time that the first three letters of the other Volvo’s license plate were her son’s initials. Instant reasonable doubt, especially considering that the prosecution’s burden to prove Mrs. Wheless was dead was at least as great as their burden to prove when she died.
<p>The prosecution had another big problem: venue. If they could not prove that Mrs. Wheless was murdered in Henrico County, the county had no jurisdiction in the case. With Mrs. Wheless’ car being retrieved in Philadelphia, it made Boone and team’s case stronger.
<p>Toby Vick, on the other hand, had a very strong circumstantial case. With the timeline supported by the casino records, Wheless had ample opportunity to kill his wife. The motive? “Here was a man who had a fictional life in which he was quite important, quite a high roller,” theorizes Vick. “When his wife confronted him, I think she told him she was leaving and his ego couldn’t take it.”
<p>He would have used the lack of forensic evidence as an indicator of premeditation. “The absence of forensic evidence might make you think it was premeditated,” he says. “There was no great explosion of anger that resulted in a great mess. It was almost a surgical killing from a forensic standpoint.”
<p>He would have chipped away at Wheless’ credibility and likability with a jury by showing just how far back and how deep Clay Wheless’ lies went. “This was a duplicitous person who had lied extensively to his wife, the police and his daughter,” he says.
<p>“We could have painted a picture that would have left the jury thinking he did it,” Vick says. “I think a jury would have wanted to convict him.” The problem was without solid physical evidence, they might have been forced by law to let him go.
<p>As the trial date closed in, police finally linked two crucial pieces of information. The call that Wheless had made at 5:52 p.m. from Harrah’s to USAir was linked to USAir subpoenaed documents that showed a reservation made by a Thomas Sullivan (a fictitious name Wheless used) for a one-way flight from Philadelphia to Richmond for Wednesday, March 16. The airline’s records show the reservation was completed at 5:57 p.m. The hotel’s phone records show that Wheless hung up at 5:57 and 42 seconds. That put Wheless in Richmond when the prosecution theorized he returned to Richmond to retrieve his wife’s car.
<p>“That one phone call was his downfall,” Boone says. “But for that phone call, I believe he would never have been convicted.”
<p>Wheless called Boone Friday, Oct. 18, and told him he wanted to plead guilty. 
<p>Vick calls Wheless’ decision to plead guilty to second degree murder “a business decision.” “He made a very rational decision about pleading guilty. ... It was not an emotional change of heart.”
<p>Wheless says it was a bit of both.
<p>“I reached a point I didn’t want to carry this around on my back anymore. I had to tell what happened. I felt like I owed that to my family and to society in general and to myself. To be able to look at myself for any time for the rest of my life, I had to tell what happened and be punished for it. But also I would be remiss, and I would be not telling the truth if I didn’t say that that last piece of information that they found out about the phone, that obviously had something to do with it too. That gave them a much better case than they had before. ... The night before I did this I thought, ‘What if they came back with a not guilty verdict and I’m let out and I live another 20 years. Can I walk around another 20 years with this on my back and think about it every time I look myself in the face? See my sister-in-law, my wife’s sister and know this?’”
<p>Vick says the plea agreement left a bad taste in his mouth. “In our professional opinion it was a plea we should accept. There was the substantial likelihood that we would lose the case.”
<p>“I knew he could have walked with a jury trial,” says sister-in-law Halterman. “I understand that but it’s very difficult for me to believe that 4½ years is the most he’ll serve.”
<p>Now Wheless spends his days in the immaculate new Henrico County Regional Jail, a medium-security jail that opened in September. At capacity, it will hold more than 500 inmates but now hums along quietly with only 36. At night, he is locked down in his 8-by-12 cell with a sink, a toilet and a 1½ inch thick plastic-covered mattress. The narrow window, no wider than a person’s face, lets in light but the textured glass doesn’t allow inmates to see out.
<p>Wheless will eventually be moved to a prison facility in the Department of Corrections system. It upsets him that members of the public think they know what he deserves for the crime he committed. He holds up a letter to the editor torn from the Times-Dispatch: “So Henry Clay Wheless will be in prison for 4½ years for murdering his wife,” he reads aloud. “Mrs. Wheless’ family has a lifetime of grieving with no grave to visit. Won’t they be happy when Wheless is out of prison leading a normal life?” 
That’ll never happen, he says, a normal life.
“If I survive these next four years and get out and live again, I’ll be able to get me a small place to live in, and I will just live a quiet life on what [retirement] I am getting, and I will be perfectly happy to do that.” He says he’d like to move west, maybe to Arizona.
<p>That last bet he placed, a guilty plea that assures his freedom at the age of 65, may be the best he ever made. <img src="../../images/closer_s.gif" width=17 height=18 align=texttop>

</a>
<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i><b>Dancing the role  of the Sugar Plum Fairy is a dream come true.</b></i></font>
<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i>by Susan Betts</i></font>
<p><font size=6 color=#990000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>S</b></font>he’s the ultimate, the diva, the belle, the trump card, the creme de la creme, the prima supreme. She’s the Sugar Plum Fairy, the principal female role in “The Nutcracker,” performed like clockwork every year by The Richmond Ballet. She must be more than just good, she must be outta-this-world great.
<p>Malcolm Burn, ballet master of The Richmond Ballet for the past 10 years, has seen them come and go, but the criteria remain the same. “The girl gets to do it when she’s an expert classical technician. She must be a really great dancer, well on top of her technique. She must have charm, without which, it would be awful. She can’t be vulgar. The Sugar Plum Fairy is the dream of all little girls, they all dream of that. She is the ideal of femininity, beauty, charm, strength.”
<p>Past Sugar Plum Fairies include Leslie Peck, Tristi Ann McMaster, Mary Maus, Marina Antonova, Maria Gisladottir and Kathleen Kairns. McMaster (who recently married Richmond ballet standout Norvell Robinson) is now a ballerina with The Washington Ballet, where she will perform the role in this year’s “Nutcracker.”
<p>“It’s one of those things that you never get tired of. You might get tired of the music during rehearsals,” she says, “but once onstage, while there is adrenalin, I’m able to relax and enjoy it. For me, it’s a traditional, seasonal, spiritual thing.” McMaster has been dancing since she was 5. She says the role helps her learn about herself. “You have to get along with your partner, you have to learn to compromise.”
<p>In other Sugar Plum Fairy news, Antonova now lives in Dusseldorf, Germany, with her husband Igor. Gisladottir runs a ballet school in Iceland. Kairns is a dance teacher in New York City. 
<p>Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker” is classical dance, so the Sugar Plum Fairy must be an excellent technician above all else. The Sugar Plum Fairy isn’t really a character in the typical sense of the term; she is, rather, <i>the</i> character. “The girl becomes the Sugar Plum Fairy, and the Sugar Plum Fairy becomes her.”
<p>The life of a dancer is tough, but it’s also a wonderful life, says Burn, who danced opposite the Sugar Plum Fairy in the role of the Cavalier for years. “Ballet is a life of physical and mental discipline.”
<p>Rehearsals began for “The Nutcracker” last week, and 16 performances are scheduled for this year. Since there are so many performances, more than one person performs the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy. Last year, four separate couples (Cavalier & Sugar Plum Fairy) were staged in the roles. For tickets to “The Nutcracker” (performances at the Carpenter Center Dec. 13-23), call 262-8100.

<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i><b>Belly-dancing through turkey day with plates of greasy duck</b></i></font>
<font size=3 color=#996633 face="Helvetica, Arial"><br><i>by Courteney Blum</i></font>
<p><font size=6 color=#990000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>M</b></font>y parents had decided it was time for my brother and me, ages 9 and 11 respectively, to visit the nation’s capital. We all piled into the decrepit, non-conversion van my parents had recently purchased for such trips. I remember the 12-hour drive down from our home outside Boston as one of the only times in my childhood that my brother and I were not actively trying to inflict bodily harm on one another. Instead, we tried to set the world record for playing WAR — eight hours straight before we finally fell asleep in the makeshift beds in the back of the van.
<p>We arrived in Washington just in time for Thanksgiving. My parents, naively, had assumed that reservations were not necessary — somehow they didn’t realize that half of Washington eats out on Thanksgiving. 
<p>We walked the area around our hotel, asking in one restaurant after another and receiving the same response — humor mixed with pity that anyone would even conceive of a walk-in Thanksgiving dinner. 
<p>Finally, we saw one last restaurant — a dimly-lit Middle-Eastern place set back from the sidewalk. We went in and, much to our relief, were seated immediately. After we sat down, we looked around absorbing our surroundings: A stage was to our right and, most noticeably of all, there were no other children in sight. 
<p>We ordered our dinner — duck. Apparently turkey was not available here, much to my brother’s and my horror. Soon after we received our food, we were informed that the show would be starting — and start it did!
<p>Out from behind the curtain came a gyrating gypsy, her belly undulating. She swished around the stage with little finger bells, while snake charmer music played.
<p>My brother’s and my immediate reaction was extreme mortification, mixed with titillation — this was NOT what I had imagined doing for Thanksgiving! I am sure my parents were having similar feelings, but they were determined to make this night special. 
<p>In typical form, my mom pulled things together saying, “It’s not where you are, or what you eat — it’s who you’re with and what you have to be thankful for.” Immediately, our moods changed and the bizarreness of the evening took on a mystical quality. We all laughed our way through the night, both in the restaurant and on the walk home. 
<p>We still laugh together just talking about it — the greasy duck, the pendulous belly dancer and the naivete that lead us there in the first place.

But sometimes it feels as if the books are pouring out of the publishing houses so fast that it’s impossible even to think about keeping up — much less trying to make a judgment on which ones are worth our time. We can read the best-seller lists, but often those selections are disappointing. Instead, we can ask serious readers, we can read ourselves, and we can ask writers what they liked. That is how this list was compiled. Each book was published in 1996 and was selected by someone who likes to read.

<font size=5 color=#003300 face="EngraversGothic BT, Helvetica, Arial"><b>Kwanzaa</b></font>
</a>
<br>Pronounced (KWAHN-zah), Kwanzaa is a seven-day holiday created by the scholar and philosopher Maulana Karengato in the late 1960s to strengthen African-American families and communities. It is based on traditional African harvest festivals, and the word itself — Kwanzaa — comes from the Swahili phrase “matunda ya kwanzaa” which means “first fruits of the harvest.”
<p>People are often confused about Kwanzaa, thinking that it has something to do with Christmas, but this is not the case. Kwanzaa is a completely separate festival celebrated at the end of December. 
<p>Kwanzaa (Dec. 26-Jan. 2) marks a time of thanksgiving for the accomplishments of the year that’s ending, while also projecting new growth for the year ahead. For African Americans who honor Kwanzaa, it’s a time to reaffirm the holistic value system of their African heritage, and to pay homage to their African ancestors and elders. In its totality, Kwanzaa celebrates self-determination, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith. 
<p>The Capital City Kwanzaa Festival is held at the Arthur Ashe Center on Dec. 28. The African Market opens at noon with the Kwanzaa program beginning at 1 p.m. The celebration includes African dance, music and the oral tradition with the Elegba Folklore Society, along with other performances, speakers and workshops. For information, call the Elegba Folklore Society at 644-3900.

<font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>At least three local places can claim ‘Washington slept here.’</b></font>
<br><font color=#002050><b><i>by Edwin Slipek Jr.</i></b> </font>
<p>
<img src="./images/drop-c.gif" width=28 height=69 align=left vspace=3>hances are slim you’ll ever catch a production of “George Washington Slept Here,” the Moss Hart comedy that was a Broadway hit in 1941. The title, however, is ingrained in East Coast vernacular — particularly with real estate brokers whenever certain historic properties are up for sale.
<p>Making so grandiose a claim inevitably begs the question: Did he really? 
<p>While Washington rarely visited Richmond, a review of his four documented stays here suggests he usually spent the night in homes just outside of town. And although a number of the buildings have been moved to different locations since he visited them, at least three can make the claim: “George Washington slept here.”
<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Spring 1775</b></font>
<br>In March 1775, George Washington visited Richmond as Fairfax County’s representative to a special convention responding to Virginians’ mounting dissatisfaction with another George (the Third). Richmond was then a piddling frontier village, but safely beyond the scrutiny of the royal governor in the colonial capital of Williamsburg. 
<p>Traveling on horseback from Mount Vernon, on the evening of March 19, the 43-year-old stayed at Hanover Tavern. This frame structure, currently undergoing a major renovation and located directly across from Hanover Courthouse, is the only local building still in the same location as when Washington slept there.
<p>Washington arrived in Richmond on the 20th for the convention at Henrico Parish Church (now St. John’s) on Richmond Hill (now called Church Hill). The church, although much altered from Washington’s time, and its graveyard still evoke a sense of the 18th-century town he knew.
<p>That evening, Washington rode seven miles south downriver to Ampthill, the estate of Col. Archibald Cary. Cary was a member of the House of Burgesses who would serve as a delegate to Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1776. Cary’s grandfather had built the imposing classical-styled, hipped-roof brick mansion earlier in the century. (In 1929, threatened by encroaching industrial development, the house and its impressive dependencies were moved to a West End residential site south of Cary Street on what is today Ampthill Road).
<p>The next day, after the meeting at the church, Washington had supper at Cooley’s Tavern. It was located near Main and 22nd streets in what is today Shockoe Slip. That night he returned to Col. Cary’s.
<p>The following day, he dined at Galt’s Tavern at the northwest corner of 19th and Main streets. Although both Galt’s and Cooley’s taverns have long been demolished, the Bottom, as in Washington’s day, is still a center of food and libations. On March 22, Washington again repaired to Ampthill.
<p>The next day, he dined at the home of Patrick Coutts, a Richmond merchant who lived on Shockoe Hill, near the site of the present day State Capitol. Washington spent another night at Col. Cary’s.
<p>On March 24, Washington dined again at Galt’s Tavern but stayed with Samuel Duval whose home was called Mount Comfort on upper Shockoe Creek, northwest of Richmond.
<p>March 25, 1775, loomed as a day that would help spark the Revolution, put Richmond on the map, and indirectly seal Washington’s revolutionary destiny as the new nation’s first president: That was the day that Patrick Henry would stir the convention with his cry: “Give me liberty, or give me death.”
<p>Although Washington made no mention in his diary of Henry’s stirring words, on the same day he wrote from Richmond to his brother John Augustine that he opposed the British and would accept command of his brother’s militia: “Dear Jack ... I shall cheerfully accept the honor ... as it is my full intention to devote my life and fortune in the cause we are engaged in, if need be.”
<p>That afternoon, Washington dined at Galt’s Tavern and rode to Wilton, the home of Ann Harrison Randolph, the widow of William Randolph. In 1776 Wilton was situated six miles downstream from Richmond on the north side of the James River in eastern Henrico County. Washington stayed at Wilton throughout the next day. (In 1933, Wilton was moved to its present West End location south of Cary Street when it was threatened by industrial development. It is considered a prime example of Colonial domestic architecture and is open to the public).
<p>On March 28, Washington headed north for Mount Vernon: This time he dined, but did not lodge, at Hanover Tavern.
<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Autumn 1784</b></font>
<br>Absorbed with the Revolution, it wouldn’t be until November 1784 that Washington returned to Richmond. By this time Richmond had become the capital of Virginia. Although Washington’s visit was for business purposes, it coincided with a visit by his dear friend Lafayette to Richmond.
<p>Washington owned considerable tracts of land west of the Alleghany Mountains, and after the war he focused his attentions on how he could profit from these holdings. He realized that a water route would be essential to realize the full potential of the region and his holdings. In early September 1784, he set out to inspect his lands — a trip of 680 miles. He returned to Mt. Vernon on Oct. 1.
<p>He cut short his trip by a few weeks, however: “The Indians, from accounts, were in too dissatisfied a mood for me to expose myself to their insults,” he wrote.
<p>On Nov. 15, 1784, Gov. Benjamin Harrison and the legislature welcomed Washington to Richmond. In his speech to the General Assembly (then meeting in temporary facilities at 14th and Cary streets) Gen. Washington said he wished for Richmond “a prosperous and great future.” But his chief concern was with “clearing and improving” — translated: “extending” — the James River.
<p>Washington’s appeal was effective: The next day the legislature voted to create a company to develop canal construction.
<p>That night a dinner was held at the Bowler’s Tavern for Washington and Lafayette. Both generals were escorted to the tavern, which was located on Main Street between 14th and 15th streets, by Richmonders who had fought in the Revolution.
<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Spring 1785</b></font>
<br>As a director of the Dismal Swamp Company, Washington was concerned that little commercial development had occurred during the Revolution. He summoned his fellow directors to Richmond in early May for a meeting.
<p>He arrived on May 1 at 5 p.m. and had dinner and stayed with the governor. He described the governor’s mansion as “very plain, but spacious. A very plain wooden building of two stories, with only two moderately sized rooms on a third floor.” That residence was replaced in 1813 with the current executive mansion.
<p>On the following afternoon at three, Washington was entertained at a dinner at the Anderson Tavern given by the Sons of Tammany, a social club which had been founded to oppose anarchy. (The building burned in 1787.)
<p>Washington left Richmond on May 4.
<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Spring 1791</b></font>
<br>Washington’s final visit to Richmond began on April 11, 1791, as part of his presidential southern tour to survey public opinion and survey the terrain of the new nation. Richmond’s population in 1791 was 3,761.
<p>Unlike present-day presidential trips, Washington’s party was small. He was accompanied by a single staff member, Maj. William Jackson, his senior secretary.
<p>“On my arrival I was saluted by the canon of the place,” wrote Washington in his diary and “and waited on by the governor [Beverley Randolph] and other gentlemen and saw the city illuminated at night.” He was the guest of Gov. Randolph. By this time, the state government had moved into the new State Capitol.
<p>The next day, on Tuesday, April 12, “In company with the governor, the directors of the James River Navigation Company and the Mayor, I viewed the canal, sluices, locks and other works between the City of Richmond and Westham.” He also recorded that each lock cost “about 300 pounds but I could see nothing in them to require such a sum to erect them.” He was told completion of the canal was still three years away.
<p>To view the canal’s progress the party traveled in two newly constructed batteaus. Watermen were outfitted in special red coats for the occasion.
<p>On April 13, Washington wrote in his diary: “The buildings in the place have increased a good deal since I was here last, but they are not of the best kind.”
<p>On Thursday, April 14, President Washington left Richmond for Petersburg after an early breakfast.
<p>Today, 205 years since his last visit, little is left of Washington’s Richmond — if buildings do exist, they have been substantially altered. Ampthill has been moved up river, its roofline changed and wings attached to the main structure. Wilton was reconstructed at a different location. The State Capitol has been significantly enlarged and reconfigured. Ironically, St. John’s Church and Hanover Tavern, both frame structures, have survived at their original locations. And of the two, only the old tavern on U.S. 301 can claim: “George Washington slept here.” <img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

<p>Not surpisingly, the regulars and the barbers, visible through the only remaining glass in the gutted building, weren’t surprised a bit when construction around them was peaking.

The place is an institution, a Richmond tradition, and after nearly 70 years of business, nothing outside could make the red, white and blue barber pole stop spinning — not jackhammers, holes in the wall or “DANGER” signs posted throughout the skeleton of a building.
<p>Inside, the shop is a world away from the gutted hotel and run-down condition of the Broad Street neighborhood. While the hotel and other buildings have deteriorated since their heyday in the 1950s, the William Byrd Barber Shop is frozen in time. 
<p>The shop is part 1950s kitchen with an abundance of counters and mustard colored chairs and part town-meeting place from a time when people were more friendly and in less of a hurry. The entire cast — barbers, those getting a trim and those waiting their turn — engage in one free-form conversation, often volleying comments from opposite sides of the shop.
<p>“She’s a spender. I don’t like spenders. She’s charge-happy,” says one man as his sideburns are lathered and shaved away.
<p>The man waiting puts aside his magazine and adds his own anecdote about wives and credit cards. The man in the next barber chair says nothing, perhaps afraid to move his lips too close to the scissors while the barber trims his nosehair. 
<p>John Lyell has heard this all before. The dashing 70-year-old barber in the bowtie has been cutting hair for 45 years. About the only thing that’s changed are the hair styles. He’s worked through the flattop, long hair, and the return of the short cut. 
<p>Some of the customers have walked out of the shop with all of those styles — many have been going there for decades. Some of the regulars have been there since Lyell started. Men who brought their sons to the shop now take their grandsons. Once, four generations came in together on a Saturday afternoon for a family trim.
<p>John Jay Schwartz is one of the long-time customers. This was his father’s barber shop and he remembers coming here with him when he was six or seven years old. He says he used to ride his bike to the shop. Today, Schwartz is a gray-haired businessman in suspenders getting a trim. No longer a bike ride away, Schwartz makes a special trip from his home in Goochland.
<p>Before this visit to the shop, Schwartz didn’t need to call to find out if the shop would stay open during construction. When someone asked him if the shop was still open, Schwartz replied, “I guarantee you it’s still here. This place is an institution.”
<p>The former William Byrd Hotel is being converted into affordable housing for the elderly.
<p>Schwartz waits while Lyell finishes his lunch. Lyell sits at a small table in the corner of the shop, carving his apple with a pocketknife. Three garden tomatoes and a shaker of salt will wait on the table for the next lull between customers.
<p>When Schwartz climbs into the chair and removes his shoes to have them shined, he sits next to a small boy whose father hovers over barber Pete Lindsey, giving him directions for his son’s haircut. 
<p>“Everybody gets their hair cut here,” says John Crow, nodding at the variety of people in the shop. “Businessmen, professionals, and a lot of kids come in here,” he says, nodding toward the young boy. “We go through quite a bunch a bubblegum and suckers in a day’s time.”
<p>Crow has seen more than a lot of bubblegum in his 18 years at the shop. With six former mayors, city councilman John Conrad and business owners such as Mack Buhrman as customers, this is a  meeting place of the power brokers of Richmond.
<p>“This is the place to go where you know everybody who knows everybody who goes,” Crow says.
<p>While the barbers will listen to the power players talk about business deals, President Clinton and the Arthur Ashe statue, they won’t join in on the discourse.
<p>“Barbers don’t talk about religion or politics,” says Crow. 
<p>Forming any opinion can lose a customer. Crow knows this for a fact — he once lost a customer for asking how anyone could believe the pro wrestling on TV. “He thought it was real,” Crow says, “and he never came back.” 
<p>Sports, politics, business and wife talk create a feeling of an old-boys backroom, a place where a female reporter talking to a businessman getting his hair cut can be mistaken for his secretary, or his “girl.”
<p>Jill Rollins, the sole female barber, doesn’t mind the guy talk. In her five years at the shop, she says she “just tunes out whatever I don’t want to hear.”
<p>The signs on the construction fence say, “DANGER. Keep out.”  
<p>But the signs on the shop’s wooden entryway say, “Come in. We’re open.” <img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

<font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>In a sophisticated world, Richmond’s Sally Bell’s Kitchen holds on to basic recipes.</b></font>
<br><font color=#002050><b><i>by Jenny Mead</i></b> </font>
<p>
<img src="./images/cupcakes.jpg" width=400 height=248 align=right border=3>
<img src="./images/drop-i.gif" width=8 height=64 align=left vspace=3 hspace=8> took a trip down Memory Lane recently. Paradoxically, I had never been there before ... and I had. Many times.
<p>As children in Charlottesville, my sister and I looked forward to my grandmother’s visits from Richmond. Among other gifts, she always brought two boxes of Sally Bell cupcakes or, as we simply called them, Sally Bells. My favorite was strawberry, but there were also nut, chocolate, lemon, and pineapple. What a thrill to cut the white string, tied twice around the box, lift the lid, and bite into one of the cakes.
<p>Sally Bells were unfailing accompaniments to my grandmother’s visits over the years. The white box, which featured on its cover a white-silhouetted antebellum lady with a sash, never changed, nor did the taste of those cakes, so delicious to a child.
<p>Recently I went, for the first time, to 708 W. Grace St., home of Sally Bell’s Kitchen. It was exactly as I had imagined. The entrance was inconspicuous, a faded “Sally Bell’s Kitchen” sign hanging over the door. Inside, in a decidedly old- fashioned and utilitarian shop, little white-aproned, hair-netted ladies, black and white, graciously prepared for me several boxes of the cupcakes. On the walls hung framed newspaper articles, written over the decades, about the kitchen. The ladies were busy preparing box lunches and other foods, but I only had eyes for the Sally Bells.
<p>No plastic packaging has found its way to 708 W. Grace St. There are still the white boxes, with the white-silhouetted, patterned-sashed, antebellum woman. Each box is still carefully tied with string. The box top remains simple, unchanged from my childhood. There’s no zip code after the “Richmond, Virginia,” and the box still exhorts one to “Dial 644-2838,” but mentions no area code. This provincial packaging is refreshing and environmentally conscious way before its time.
<p>In the days of Godiva Chocolates, triple chocolate mousse truffle concoctions and other astonishingly rich sweets, Sally Bell cupcakes might seem old-fashioned. They are simple cakes, covered by icing. There are no new flavors, triple latte mocha creme or the like. Tradition, as the antebellum woman on the box and the simple packaging reminds you, has its place.
<p>My grandmother has been dead for eleven years. Senility — I imagine they’d call it Alzheimer’s today — stopped her visits to us many years before she actually died. But one bite of a Sally Bell took me back thirtysome years, when I was a child at the dining room table, looking with awe at my white-haired, dignified grandmother sitting beside me, relishing the sweets and the presents and the fun this well-dressed, sometimes severe, but always loving woman brought with her.
<p>Later in my life, the Sally Bell Kitchen took on a new and sadder resonance. When my mother became terminally ill, her best friend Doris would drive from Richmond to Charlottesville every Tuesday, carrying with her box lunches from the Sally Bell kitchen. In the face of unpredictable illness, their predictability was reassuring. Each box — again, tied with string — contained a chicken salad sandwich, a round container of potato salad or, for my father, tomato aspic, a sweet pickle and, of course, a cupcake. Even when my mother was too sick to eat, too sick finally to talk, Doris would appear every Tuesday, boxes in hand, and sit and talk with my mother.
<p>It’s no wonder, then, that I equate the Sally Bell Kitchen and all its offerings with pure, unselfish love. I’m sure my grandmother had tired of the cupcakes; certainly, my parents would have loved a little dessert variety. But Grandma knew how much my sister and I loved those Sally Bells, and she kept making that trip to 708 W. Grace St. and bringing them to us in Charlottesville, trip after trip. Doris’s visits, those unfailing deliveries of box lunches and conversation and friendship in the face of sadness and loss, were nothing but true, unyielding love.
<p>Doris knew that the lunches brought us all comfort; Grandma knew the cupcakes made us happy. Nothing short of the Sally Bell kitchen closing could stop my grandmother and Doris from buying and bringing the lunches and the cupcakes.
<p>Let’s hope the “kitchen” never closes. <img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

<font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>WRVA’s morning show gives voices to the many personalities of Richmond. </b></font>
<br><font color=#002050><b><i>by Kathryn Masterson</i></b> </font>
<p>
<img src="./images/voice1.jpg" width=400 height=310 align=right border=3>
<img src="./images/drop-i.gif" width=8 height=64 align=left vspace=3 hspace=8>t’s 4:45 Friday morning and Richmond slumbers, dreaming of weekend trips and barbecues and ball games and whatever else the weekend will bring. 
<p>Tim Timberlake and John Harding have been awake for hours, preparing for their WRVA morning show that jump-starts the sleeping city 52 weeks a year.
<p>Armed with stacks of tapes, lottery numbers, the weather report, sports scores, the morning paper and a fan, they enter the studio. The tiny room is filled with all the predictable equipment and a soundboard of red, green and yellow controls and levers.
<p>Red lights blink on and off, signaling what’s on and what’s off. It’s showtime again.
<p>A microphone and one chair, which serves as Timberlake’s morning throne, sit on the side with the soundboard. Three chairs and three microphones sit on the other side of the board. Here, Harding props up the weather reports, scores and lottery numbers. Fishing and gardening experts and other guests sit on this side of the board with him. 
<p><img src="./images/voice2.jpg" width=187 height=213 align=left border=3>
Along one wall is a muted television showing scenes from last night’s Democratic convention in Chicago.
<p>“Look at that,” Timberlake remarks as the screen fills with thousands of red, white and blue balloons. “Have you ever seen that many balloons in your life?”
<p>This passing observation will turn up later on the show, broadcast to the thousands of listeners, who will conjure up the same picture in their minds when Timberlake brings the image to life during a brief political commentary. WRVA’s signal pulls breakfast tables together all over the state.
<p>The small studio — barely big enough to accommodate the television, equipment and guests — has a surprisingly loud voice. From its Church Hill location, the 50,000-watt AM station rules over the city with a presence no FM station in Richmond can come close to matching.
<p>Without the benefit of music, WRVA is a perennial ratings leader.
<p>Richmonders have been turning their radios to WRVA from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. for decades to get their daily dose of hometown news, commentary, humor, weather, helicopter-fed traffic reports, gardening tips and fishing updates. 
<p><img src="./images/voice3.jpg" width=200 height=229 align=right border=3>
For these four hours, Timberlake and Harding embrace the city — wishing happy birthday to a 7-year-old in Chesterfield, announcing the anniversary of a couple in the West End, helping to reunite a lost pet in the Fan and its owner, and reminding everyone throughout the city not to forget car inspections or the deadline for State Fair applications.
<p>Never mind that the station’s air conditioning is broken, and it’s 10 degrees warmer inside than it is outside.
<p>Casually shouldering the responsibility of being Richmond’s radio station of record, Timberlake and Harding face the challenge with humor and their much-needed fan.
<p>After a quiet preparation period, suddenly the big clocks on the walls hit 5:00, the inside thermometer hits 85, and the show is on the air.
<p>“Welcome to the WRVA sweatshop,” Timberlake begins. Harding laughs on the other side of the soundboard.
<p>“It’s a last gasp of summer weekend,” Timberlake says and Harding, appropriately on cue, launches into the first weather report of the show.
<p>The weather report, along with the traffic report, WRVA news done by a reporter in an adjacent room, news from CBS and the Wall Street Journal, and the commercials follow a tightly packed schedule.
<p>There is a notebook filled with colored wheels that divide each hour into red, green, blue and yellow minute segments that represent the order and timing of each hour of the show.
<p>Timberlake and Harding don’t need to consult the colored wheels during the show. They’ve been doing this for years, and to them, it’s beyond second nature. What Timberlake does consult attentively is a stack of papers listing the commercials that will be played that morning. Each commercial is numbered, and a stack of the numbered tapes lines the wall.
<p><img src="./images/voice4.jpg" width=239 height=261 align=right border=3>
He pushes levels, adjusts controls, cues tapes and talks — all at the same time. You would never know how much he’s doing from the broadcast. He makes it seem effortless, executing the show, cracking jokes and talking to whoever walks into the studio.
<p>Harding says “time goes faster” on Timberlake’s side.
<p>Harding is perfectly coordinated with his partner at the controls. He pulls the tapes Timberlake needs, arranges them in order and files them once they’ve played.
<p>Putting the tapes back on the shelves in numerical order, Harding jokes, “You have to know how to count for this job.”
<p>“Yeah, to succeed in this job you have to know how to count and tell time,” Timberlake says, gesturing to the large clocks that dictate the minutes when the news comes on and when the sports scores will be read.
<p>Occasionally, Harding makes a mad dash for the offices for “bumper music” tapes, which are played for filler between sections of the show. Today, Harding sprints down the hall to pick up a medley of summertime beach songs. The tennis shoes both he and Timberlake wear seem just as useful on the job as they are comfortable.
<p>Both hosts compare themselves to the bumper music, saying they are the glue that holds the show’s contents — set by program directors and media consultants — together.
<p>The show was less structured when Alden Aaroe was the host, Harding says. Aaroe, who ruled the Richmond airwaves for decades, was a one-man band, and his show topics ranged from suburban anecdotes to pet stories. In 1985, Timberlake joined Aaroe for the morning shows. 
<p>Aaroe continued to dominate Richmond radio until his death in 1993, when the team of Timberlake and Harding was created.
<p>Although the new team’s show is more structured than when Aaroe sat behind the controls, Timberlake and Harding are much more than model glue for what Harding calls a “show in a box.”
<p>They are a team of jokers, friends to loyal listeners throughout the city, and personalities who continue to carry on the WRVA legacy after the death of its greatest star.
<p>Timberlake, who had hosted the morning show for eight years before Aaroe died, was already a familiar voice when Aaroe’s fell silent. Richmond was familiar with his quick sense of humor.
<p>Years on the job haven’t aged him. His smile and the laugh lines around his eyes are genuine, and it’s obvious he loves his job. Timberlake looks like he’s having too much fun at the microphone to be working.
<p>Lacking the ego one expects of a person in the spotlight, Timberlake laughs at his own mistakes. Today, he is good-natured with a listener who points out a mistake on the air. During the balloon-drop commentary, Timberlake said the balloons looked like graffiti — when he meant to say confetti.
<p>When Timberlake and Harding read a commercial — for the air conditioning company that has yet to respond to WRVA’s broken system — Timberlake seizes the opportunity to poke a bit of fun. 
<p>As Harding announces the name of the company, Timberlake counters, “Well, I’ll be darned...”
<p>Harding mischievously grins.
<p>“That’s probably the most fun I’ve had all morning,” Timberlake says.
<p>Commenting on the subtle ribbing, Harding says “There’s nobody better at that than Timberlake.”
<p>Although Harding praises Timberlake’s sense of humor, he is no straight man, either. The James Carville look-alike (but with short grey hair) is a joker, too — although most of his jokes come when the red light blinks off. 
<p>Millard the Mallard’s appearance in the studio for the daily “WHAT’S DAT!!!” guessing game provides material for joking. Millard plays part of a song and a listener calls in with the correct name of the artist, winning bagels. After Harding talks to the winner and gets his name and address, he quips, “That guy’s all happy he talked to the duck. It probably made his weekend.”
<p>On-air, Harding peppers the show with strange bits of information he calls “mental munchies” from “the Snack Man.” Today’s snacks include advice for a long life. To add years to their lives, smokers and drinkers should just indulge in their vices and not worry about their effects.
<p>Harding also announces the day’s birthdays and anniversaries. During the winter, he announces school closings. During the hottest days of summer, he announces closings due to heat. He also announces school lunches and found pets.
<p>“It won’t be long before we’re announcing everybody’s dental appointment,” Harding says.
<p>Before Harding anchored the morning show, he served for 20 years as WRVA’s news director. He left the job after floods and other emergencies the station reported became almost commonplace to him. “It got to the point where it was ‘Oh, another flood...,’”  Harding says.
<p>One carry-over from his former life as conductor of reporters and news operations is his devotion to deadlines.
<p>“Your whole life becomes a deadline,” Harding says. “If your wife asks you to take the trash out, you ask when she wants it done. She says five. At ten till five, she’s asking you why you haven’t taken the trash out and you say, “I still have 10 more minutes before it has to be done.”
<p>Even with the job change, Harding’s life still revolves around time. He arrives at the studio at 2 a.m. every morning to collect satellite feeds that come from different news organizations to be used on that day’s shows. He writes a bit of copy from sports scores and other information beamed into the station from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m.
<p>Although Harding arrives at work at a time when most people are in bed, he doesn’t live his life opposite those who work nine to five. He sleeps in shifts, napping when he gets home in the afternoon for an hour or two, then joining the rest of the world for the remaining day. He goes back to sleep in the evening.
<p>“Otherwise, you’d have to live your whole life as a vampire on this schedule,” Harding says. 
<p>Timberlake keeps the same sleeping schedule. He catches a quick nap when he comes home in the afternoon, then stays up till 11 p.m., sleeping until 3 a.m., when he gets up so he can be at work at 4.
<p>“It’s a great shift,” Timberlake says. “In today’s world, people are always looking for more time to spend with family. This work schedule really extends your day.”
<p>Other perks of Timberlake’s and Harding’s schedule are a peaceful drive to work with no rush hour traffic, a quiet station to themselves.
<p>But the best parts of being the voices of WRVA’s morning show aren’t the side perks. It’s talking to and joking with the real people that make up the city of Richmond, like the caller who says he wants to rid his garden of slugs.
<p>On-air expert Charles Curry suggests putting a pie pan of beer in the garden for the slugs. “But don’t give them anything good,” Timberlake jokes. “No Corona or anything.”
<p>There’s a lighter side to everything with this crew. <img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

<font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>White gloves and long dresses, curtsies and waltzes — society’s annual debutante pageants
 </b></font>
<br><font color=#002050><b><i>by Kathryn Masterson</i></b> </font>
<p>
<img src="./images/drop-w.gif" width=39 height=72 align=left vspace=3 hspace=8>hile the old fashioned auction-block air of the debutante season is long gone, there continues to be a thriving tandem of high-profile debutante events that old Richmond cherishes.
<p>The idea of young women being presented into proper society on the arms of their fathers through a whirlwind of garden parties and black-tie events may seem outdated. But in a city as steeped in tradition as Richmond, it’s no surprise that the legacy of debutantes — white gowns and gloves, waltzing at country club parties — lives on with gusto.
<p>Participants in the annual cycle of parties say it’s all in fun.
<p>If a proper young woman is going to make her debut in this city, there are two ways to go about it. One is the social splash of the Bal du Bois, a longstanding benefit for Sheltering Arms Physical Rehabilitation Hospital. Patrons gather under the stars on the wide terraces of the Country Club of Virginia.
<p>More exclusive than the Bal du Bois is the winter dance at the German Club, held at the Commonwealth Club. Open only to daughters of club members — the German is the coziest club for Richmond’s social elite. (Getting someone into the ranks of the German membership is a major act of kindness in Richmond social circles, and a cause for lifelong-indebtedness.)
<p>The Junior Board of Sheltering Arms Hospital puts on the Bal du Bois each year. This past June’s ball was the 40th. The young women who come out at the Bal du Bois no longer call themselves debutantes. Because the emphasis is raising money for the hospital, the women are called sponsors. Where in past years participants were limited to those women who were invited to debut there, today families can ask to be included.
<p>The fund-raising emphasis has opened up the Bal, Missy Blackwell, a member of the Junior Board, says. Ticket sales for the Bal and advertisements in the night’s program raise $70,000. Dozens of high- profile businesses support the dance.
<p>Tickets for the Bal range from $275 to $500 apiece, Blackwell says. The number of guests with each sponsor varies greatly. Some sponsors will have six guests while others bring as many as 30.
<p>Each year’s ball has a different theme. The first Bal in 1957 was a “Garden at Versailles,” complete with a fountain, statuary and chandeliers. For another Bal, a replica of the Eiffel Tower was built for a Parisian party. At last June’s event, the white-columned country club, itself an enclave of the city’s upper class, was transformed into “Le Jardin de Monet,” filled ceiling to floor with flowers.
<p>The sponsors held colorful bouquets during the presentation, which always includes a curtsy and a figure-eight procession in front of the black-tie crowd. 
<p>After the presentation, the rest of the evening is spent dancing with the fathers and escorts. Each sponsor can bring three dates, whose main function, says one young woman, is “to make sure you have a good time.” 
<p>The Bal falls in the middle of the young women’s social season, which runs from January to December. During this year-long season, each girl throws at least one private party for friends of the family, the other sponsors, their escorts and families. The themes of the sponsors’ parties vary from black-tie dances to bluegrass jams in the country.
<p>Sponsors’ families work closely together in coordinating the season’s events.
<p>Most of the river-house parties and cocktail gatherings are held during the summer and Christmas holidays when the sponsors are home from college. The sponsors are 21 years old, a change from when the debutantes were 18. When the legal drinking age was raised, the Junior Board waited several years to hold a Bal while the 18-year-olds who were next in line turned 21.
<p>The number of sponsors varies from year to year, Blackwell says. This year, 11 young women accepted the invitation to debut at the Bal du Bois.
<p>Beatrice Talley Weems Leachman accepted the invitation. A former Collegiate student who later attended boarding school in Connecticut, Leachman now attends Randolph-Macon College. While she was at Collegiate, Leachman says coming out was something she and her friends discussed as far back as eighth grade, but never really expected to do it when their turn came.
<p>When she received the invitation last year to participate, she and her mother discussed the commitment required of a Bal du Bois sponsor and she accepted.
<p>Leachman threw her party the day after the Bal at the Country Club of Virginia’s James River Clubhouse. Her event — a garden party with a flower theme — was “laid back,” she says. The cookout included popular singer Pat McGee who played to a crowd of 200 friends, sponsors, their escorts and their families.
<p>Collegiate classmate and fellow sponsor Dudley Carter threw a casual party, as well, with a bluegrass band and a dress code of jeans and cowboy boots.
<p>Invitations to participate in the season of parties are a bit mysterious and some of the debutantes will be the first to admit they don’t know exactly why they were chosen to make a debut while others were not.
<p>Although the Bal is open to any 21-year-old woman who wishes to participate, a limited number of invitations are sent out, mostly to graduates of the two big private schools in Richmond, St. Catherine’s and Collegiate. More often than not, a debutante is carrying on a family tradition.
<p>Blackwell says the Junior Board contacts young women who will be 21 all over the city, and there isn’t any method to who gets invited and who doesn’t. The Board contacts schools, and the Bal is open to the whole class, she says.
<p>“It’s not a matter of who’s who,” a Junior Board member says, on the condition her name not be used. “Everyone who is the right age is welcome, so the invitations are meaningless.”
<p>Regardless of the company line, prominent families produce the young women who debut here — a simple truth, albeit something the ball organizers lament even discussing. 
<p>One recent Collegiate graduate received an invitation to be a Bal sponsor, which made for an uncomfortable situation when some of her friends were left out, she says.
<p>Some Bal invitees decline the invitation, choosing instead to debut at the German Club where their fathers or close relatives are members.
<p>The German debutante ball is not a fund-raiser and therefore does not require tickets. It’s an exclusive “one night, one-shot deal” held during the Christmas season. The number of debutantes varies each year depending on the number of members’ daughters who are 21. (If you miss the newspaper blurb about the German debs, they usually mention it down the road in their wedding announcements.)
<p>Access to the German debut is, to say the least, limited. The debutantes’ escorts have to be a family member or a non-club member from another city. If an escort is a boyfriend, and is from another area of Virginia, he is allowed to attend. However, before he is given the green light to attend, the debutante’s father is expected to write a letter of recommendation to the chairman of the dance.
<p>Just any old guy can’t escort you to the German.
<p>For some of the girls who will come out this year in Richmond, being a debutante is simply a family tradition. <img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

<font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>When the only crowd you want is composed of flowers, shade trees and quiet paths</b></font>
<br><font color=#002050><b><i>By Cassandra Lindsay</i></b> </font>
<p>
<img src="./images/drop-t.gif" width=22 height=64 align=left vspace=0 hspace=8>he plain truth about Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is that you could lose yourself for hours in the cool shade of the giant sycamore tree at lake’s edge here. But if you don’t visit this urban oasis, there’s more room for the rest of us to stop and smell the flowers.
<p>The garden is located on 80 acres just north of the intersection of Hilliard Avenue and Lakeside Avenue.
<p>When you take your first step onto the red brick walkway that welcomes you, the plants seem to envelop you. The city melts away the farther you go. The only reminder of urban life is the occasional plane that flies overhead.
<p>This was the plan of Grace Arents when she willed Richmond the land with the stipulation that it be turned into a garden.
<p>Arents was an avid horticulturist, a love she had in common with her uncle, Lewis Ginter, for whom the garden is named. Ginter helped to build Richmond in the 19th century with the enormous wealth he made in the tobacco industry and real estate. He originally owned the land where he built the house that is still standing here and named it the Lakeside Wheel Club. After Ginter’s death, Arents inherited the land, which she named Bloemendaal Farm after Ginter’s hometown in Holland. She added another floor to the house and turned it into a children’s hospital to help fight the outbreak of tuberculosis.  
<p>Arents died in 1927, leaving Bloemendaal and $100,000 for its upkeep to the city. Arents’ will also stipulated that her friend Mary Garland Smith be allowed to live in the house until she died. Smith died in 1968, having lived to be 100. Richmond had been using the land to grow trees and plants for its urban beautification project but had not created the garden Arents dreamed of.
<p>The money for the garden was there, proponents of the garden project said, because the $100,000 Arents left had accumulated over the decades into $4 million. In 1983, Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden, Inc. was created.  
<p>The garden remains true to its history. The house that was first built as the Lakeside Wheel Club has been restored to its original luster. Although there are only two paintings that are original to the house, the rest of the home gives visitors a look into its glorious past. There is a formal dining room, living room and ladies parlor filled with reproductions of 19th-century decorations and furniture. The original stables have been renovated into a children’s educational center. Grace Arents’ personal garden is filled with a boxwood hedge and shrub roses similar to Arents’ original design. The original 1914 sundial of Bloemendaal is the centerpiece of the garden.
<p>Each of the other nine gardens retain their own distinctive personalities and pockets of wonder. The Henry M. Flagler Perennial Garden is one of the best of its kind on the East Coast. The garden is a blast to the senses because it has almost every kind of flower and plant a gardener could dream of. The Martha and Reed West Island Garden is made up of carnivorous plants including Venus’ flytraps that visitors can admire as they walk on a path of boardwalks on top of a lake filled with koi fish. Another high point in the garden is the Children’s Garden. A peacock made entirely of plants and flowers stands guard surrounded by vividly painted wheelbarrows and bright flowers. 
<p>Visitors can explore the gardens at their leisure or with a tour and then have lunch at one of two restaurants at the garden. There are educational programs for children and gardening classes for adults. Homeowners often walk through with note pads and clipboards to write down the names of the plants they would like to incorporate into their own landscaping. The garden is planning renovation in the near future. It will have a new visitors center and green houses beginning in 1998.
<p>Richmond’s wealthiest benefactors have embraced the garden, which continues to grow.
<p>Almost 70 years after Grace Arents died, her dream of a public garden is a reality. Lewis Ginter Botanical Gardens is a place of relaxation in an often claustrophobic and hectic city. Sitting beneath a tree or on a bench surrounded by the aroma of flowers, a visitor could hardly imagine that it came into reality just recently.

<p><i>Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden is open seven days a week, 9:30 a.m.- 4:30 p.m.. Cost is $3 for adults, $2 for seniors over 50, and $1 for children ages 2-12. No charge for garden members or children under 2. Of note is the Gardenfest of Lights, a holiday display of lights, decorations and events from December through early January. Call 262-9887. </i><img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

They are a reflection of its people and its history. In Richmond, the fabric, woven of people and places, is old, durable, established, maybe even entrenched a little, but always alive with the next generation, and typically understated, modest, never boasting, but beautiful in simplicity.
<p>Capitol Square’s grassy slopes.
<p>Hollywood Cemetery’s granite-strewn vistas.
<p>An ancient dam breached by the passing river.
<p>These and many other places are the timeless treasures of the people here, the places we take our friends who visit Richmond, the places we escape to, the places we go with lovers, or children or family.
<p>We’re still Old South here. How long, it’s hard to tell with new corporations coming and a new riverfront on the drafting tables, but the roots of a conservative, historic past hold fast to what we do and where we go today.
<p>We remain true to the past, and the places that symbolize that bond are cherished. These photographs and the articles that follow them recognize some of the places that matter most.</b></font>

<hr size=1><font size=4 face="Helvetica, Arial" color=#002050><b>Capitol Square</b></font>
<br><img src="./images/sense1.jpg" align=right width=150 height=216>Home of the Virginia General Assembly, Capitol Square is a rolling campus crowned with the white-columned Capitol building. Herringbone-patterned brick walkways and terraces traverse a lush green hilltop dotted with statues of Washington, Mason, Henry, Byrd and other Virginia giants. The governor’s Executive Mansion stands behind a low wall in the east end of the square, while state office buildings buttress the parklike setting, protecting it from traffic and downtown noise.
<p>The Capitol is open to the public seven days a week, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.. There is no admission fee, and group tours are available by appointment.
<p>For a quick lunch, eat at Chicken’s snack bar inside.
<p>The General Assembly is in session from the second Wednesday of the new year (January 8 this year), through the end of February. Parking is available in the square except during the session. For more information or to arrange a tour, call 786-4344.

<br><img src="./images/sense2.jpg" align=right width=150 height=235>It’s why we’re here. Only recently has the river begun to open up to significant public usage. Along both shorelines, the city operates a park system which includes Belle Isle downtown — a stunning theater in the round of whitewater and wildlife. In slow water, the dams and boulders make for excellent fishing. Up river, boaters pull skiers. Down river, departing from docks just east of downtown, the Annabel Lee takes dinner cruises over the wider sections. In the summer, inner-tube flotillas lazily pass by, providing, perhaps, the very best view of the city, and the wettest. In coming years, an ambitious riverfront redevelopment project is expected to transform abandoned commercial properties into a thriving waterfront with operating canals.
<p>If you want an up-close view without getting wet, walk the new floodwall’s overlooks.

There are gun racks, gun displays and even gun shops around town, but there’s only one Green Top, with its walls o’ guns and halls o’ fishing rods. Sportsmen across Virginia make pilgrimages to this store on Route 1 (go left off the Atlee-Elmont exit from I-95 North) to stock their hunting closets for every season.
<p>Stroll-through displays hold as many secondhand guns as new, making it a great place to trade or sell, as well as to buy, or just talk with the staff about firearms or fishing gear. If you close your eyes, you can practically smell the smoke of burnt gunpowder. There’s even an annual ladies night dedicated to female shoppers. Phone 550-2188.

<br><img src="./images/sense4.jpg" align=right width=223 height=150>Hollywood Cemetery, located behind Oregon Hill, is one of Richmond’s most historic locations. Granite markers, headstones and vaults create a medieval aura about these bluffs, which overlook the rapids below in the James River — appropriately known as Hollywood Rapids.
<p>Within Hollywood’s gates lie the remains of many famous Americans, including Presidents James Monroe and John Tyler. Jefferson Davis, J.E.B. Stuart and Gen. George E. Pickett also rest here, and visitors can see a memorial to Confederate soldiers. Gates are open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., 365 days a year.

<font color=#002050><b><big>Some are rock-steady restaurants we’ve been writing about for years. But others are new, building big-portioned reputations fast. Spanning the various cuisines, from continental to Indian, French to Southern (perhaps an ethnic class all its own when done right), these are the best restaurants in Richmond, say our venerable table of four, having reviewed their way through yet another year of dining out.</big></b> </font>

<br><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><big><b>Critics’ Top Ten</b></big></font>
<hr size=1><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Amici</b></font>
<br>Along with Franco’s, Amici is the Rolls Royce of Italian restaurants in Richmond. While the interior affords cozy comfort, the front patio fills for alfresco dining in welcoming weather. Chef Antonio Capece keeps his fans right at the forefront of Italian cuisine as it changes, offering classical presentations with an au courant twist. Fresh raviolis, stuffed with Chef Antonio’s special mixtures, are always whimsical and delicious. Located in the heart of Carytown, it’s a favorite of intowners and suburbanites alike.
<br><b>3343 W. Cary St., </b>
<br><b>353-4700</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>The Dining Room at the Berkeley</b></font>
<br>The Dining Room at the Berkeley has been a dining hot spot for over six years. The graceful dining rooms, the polished service, and the good food have made dining here a good bet. 
<br><b>1200 E. Cary St.</b>
<br><b>780-1300</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Fox Head Inn</b></font>
<br>Owned by Sheryl Robins and Chef Robert Ramsey, The Fox Head Inn in Manakin is a real contender to join The Inn at Little Washington as a world-class Virginia restaurant. Chef Robert brings a world of creativity to this place, having worked in Europe and South America before choosing Richmond as the place to build his dream. 
<br>It’s a place where every dish is prepared with herbs and vegetables fresh from the garden in back.
<br><b>1840 Manakin Road</b>
<br><b>Manakin-Sabot</b>
<br><b>784-5126</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Franco’s Ristorante</b></font>
<br>Chef/owner Paolo Randazzo takes traditional Italian ingredients and gives them new life in inventive combinations. The regular menu has lots of goodies, but look beyond the pastas and traditional favorites to the seasonal offerings for the real winners.
<br><b>Sassafras Square Shopping Center</b>
<br><b>270-9124</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>The Frog and the Redneck</b></font>
<br>The Frog and the Redneck is a vaunted destination for out-of-towners and a list of Richmond regulars. With the latter has come a more serious and formal atmosphere than the livelier early days.
<br>Chef Jimmy Sneed domesticates the exotic and creates something as inviting as Sunday dinner at Mom’s. An example is the almost-signature red pepper-crabmeat soup, smooth as silk to palate and taste.
<br><b>1423 East Cary St.</b>
<br><b>648-3764</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Grafiti Grille</b></font>
<br>Owned by Kenneth Bendheim, this West End eatery is still new, brashly colorful, gregariously noisy and usually crowded. The menu changes every three weeks. Risotto-stuffed quail with red cabbage and mashed potatoes is a winner, and the lamb chops, goat cheese and fresh spinach are delights here.
<br><b>403-B Ridge Road</b>
<br><b>288-0633</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Lemaire</b></font>
<br>All the components add up to make dining at Lemaire in The Jefferson a satisfying experience. The setting is unequaled in these parts. The several lavish and elegant rooms offer an intimate space for romantic dinners, and other areas are large enough to accommodate private parties. 
<br><b>The Jefferson</b>
<br><b>788-8000</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Millie’s</b></font>
<br>It’s hard to say anything about this place that hasn’t already been said in Gourmet magazine, Bon Appetit, House & Garden or here. It’s the preferred diner for gourmets, anointed by the harshest critics as well as by hungry folks just looking for a rolling good time.
<br><b>2603 E. Main St.</b>
<br><b>643-5512</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>La Petite France</b></font>
<br>La Petite France has, for 25 years, set the standard in the area for formal dining. Chef Paul Elbling and his lovely wife, Marie-Antoinette, are full of charm. The food remains classic French. The seasonal specials are usually even more interesting than the “regular” menu, and some Virginia favorites are often given a French twist. Finish the night with one of Chef Paul’s dessert souffles.
<br><b>2108 Maywill St.</b>
<br><b>353-8729</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>The Track</b></font>
<br>The Track has been going strong for almost 15 years. Owner Chris Liles and Chris Saladino (his chef going on 10 years now) know how to get the job done. Daily specials play up what’s seasonal and prime. Regulars know that shad roe is featured in early spring, and that soft-shell crabs have a place on the menu during the summer.
<br><b>2915 West Cary St.</b>
<br><b>359-4781</b>


<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><big><b>Foreign Flavors</b></big></font>

<hr size=1><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Chopstix</b></font>
<br>Fresh spring rolls packed full of shrimp, rice noodles and a touch of cilantro are perfect starters. Favorite entrees include beef and potato, seafood delight and grilled chicken over rice noodles.
<br><b>3129 W. Cary St. </b>
<br><b>358-7027</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Full Kee Restaurant</b></font>
<br>The restaurant is plain and unassuming, and the menu offers a chance to expand horizons beyond the popular Chinese-American dishes.
<br><b>6400 Horsepen Road</b>
<br><b>673-2233</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Greek Island</b></font>
<br>Owners Faye and Ted Kefalas oversee everything with such sharp eyes that you know you’re getting the real thing. And all the cooking is done by a family member, if not by Ted or Faye, then by son George.
<br><b>10902 Hull St.</b>
<br><b>674-9199</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>India House</b></font>
<br>This kitchen has a big following among vegetarians and among the local Indian community.
<br><b>2313 Westwood Ave.</b>
<br><b>355-8378</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Indochine</b></font>
<br>Indochine, a relative newcomer to Carytown and the growing number of Vietnamese spots around town, gives us a taste from this culinary melting pot where Asian meets French. The food at Indochine is not about bold and sassy flavors, but nuance and refinement.
<br><b>2923 West Cary St.</b>
<br><b>353-5799</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Mamma ’Zu</b></font>
<br>Whether it’s a meaty, plate-sized Portabella mushroom, or shrimp swimming in a fiery Fra Diavolo sauce atop a pile of linguine the size of Bermuda, I love it all. Owner/chef Ed Vasaio walks the edge. He always offers the requisite Italian dishes, like eggplant Parmesan (although it sells out fast) and various pastas. But he usually has something extra special. It might be calves brains; it might be a gigantic seafood soup.
<br><b>501 Pine St.</b>
<br><b>788-4205</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Mékong Restaurant</b></font>
<br>This comfortable and pleasant spot has an extensive menu offering specialties from all areas of Vietnam. From familiar spring rolls, a dozen noodle soups, barbecues, stir-fries to more exotic dishes like eel in a hot pot.
<br><b>6004 W. Broad St.</b>
<br><b>288-8929</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Hana Zushi</b></font>
<br>If sushi is what you want, this is the place. And not just because it’s the only restaurant in Richmond dedicated to sushi. Lunchtime bustles with downtown workers looking for light, healthy food. If you love the raw stuff, there are plenty of selections for all tastes. Teriyaki, tempura, gyoza (dumplings) and a variety of noodle dishes are tasty and filling. 
<br><b>1309 E. Cary St. </b>
<br><b>225-8801</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Saigon</b></font>
<br>If you want to follow those in the know, this little Grace Street eatery is the place for Vietnamese dining. There are more lavish places that afford greater creature comforts, atmosphere or longer menus. Saigon is a favorite of VCU academes and artists, as well as of other professional foodies in town.
<br><b>903 W. Grace St. </b>
<br><b>355-6633</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Thai Dinner </b></font>
<br>It’s a most unlikely marriage, but it seems to be working. Exotic Thai food served in the evening alongside hot fudge cake and triple scoops of Rocky Road. The varied and exotic flavors of Thai cooking are somewhat tamed in the atmosphere of an American ice-cream parlor.
<br><b>Westland Shopping Center</b>
<br><b>270-2699</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Vietnam Garden</b></font>
<br>Among the early Vietnamese restaurants in the area, Vietnam Garden has long provided this savory, diverse cuisine at reasonable prices. The space is modest but comfortable, and the waitstaff is cheerful.
<br><b>3991 Glenside Drive</b>
<br><b>262-6114</b>


<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><big><b>Catch of the Day</b></big></font>

<hr size=1><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Blue Point Seafood</b></font>
<br>Starters at Blue Point include Cockenoe oysters, jerked shrimp and jumbo shrimp cocktail from the raw bar. Appetizers are clam chowder, fried calamari and Maryland crab meat balls. This restaurant’s mark is variety.
<br><b>6th Street Marketplace</b>
<br><b>783-8138</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Crab Louie’s Seafood Tavern</b></font>
<br>Crab Louie’s, open for over 10 years, is housed in the reworked remnants of an 18th-century plantation house on the South Side. The trend-defying eatery has a loyal following.
<br><b>Sycamore Square, Midlothian</b>
<br><b>275-2722</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>The Hard Shell</b></font>
<br>This place has become a standard for fresh seafood prepared in a wide variety of creative ways. Making shellfish their specialty, The Hard Shell does it right. 
<br><b>1411 E. Cary St.</b>
<br><b>644-5341</b>


<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><big><b>Best in the West</b></big></font>

<hr size=1><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Azzurro</b></font>
<br>Azzurro is wonderfully cosmopolitan, a bit of New York and Milan right here in Richmond. Everything from antipastis to pasta to secondi piattis, from grilled veggies to spinach linguine is good. The menu, printed in Italian with English subtitles, is diverse.
<br>A brick patio promises dining alfresco.
<br><b>6221 River Road</b>
<br><b>River Road Shopping Center</b>
<br><b>282-1509</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Buckhead’s</b></font>
<br>Buckhead’s draws not only the hearty appetite but the discerning one. Prices are comparatively high, but the portions are large.
<br>Lamb chops are excellent, as are the creamed spinach and onion rings.
<br><b>8510 Patterson Ave.</b>
<br><b>750-2000</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>du Jour</b></font>
<br>In its 12th year, du Jour continues to offer creative seasonal menus for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch. OK, so lunch can be a bit noisy, but that’s no reason to miss out on the grilled vegetarian with it’s creamy pepper dressing and avocados.
<br><b>5806 Grove Ave. </b>
<br><b>285-1301</b>


<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><big><b>Fan and Carytown</b></big></font>

<hr size=1><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Avalon</b></font>
<br>Chef Q Derks at Avalon is one of many chefs around who’ve caught the spirit of the culinary revolution that started more than two decades ago. She is also one of the more imaginative, often combining unlikely ingredients and ethnic flavors in unusual ways.
<br><b>2619 W. Main St.</b>
<br><b>353-9709</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Davis & Main</b></font>
<br>Davis & Main is one of the Fan’s most reliable bistros. The grill is the cornerstone of the restaurant. The nightly blackboard specials (pasta, fish, or meat) are dependably good.
<br><b>2501 W. Main St.</b>
<br><b>353-6641</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Helen’s</b></font>
<br>One of the best restaurants around for people looking for inventive, well-prepared food. Recent winners include the scallop katsu with fried noodles and soy butter ($8) and the shrimp ravioli ($8).
<br><b>2527 W. Main St.</b>
<br><b>358-4370</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Zeus Gallery</b></font>
<br>This tiny Fan restaurant near the Virginia Museum is a gem. Getting one of the few tables can be a challenge, but it’s worth the effort. The little chalkboard menus change often.
<br><b>201 N. Belmont Ave.</b>
<br><b>359-3219</b>


<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><big><b>The Shockoe Connection</b></big></font>

<hr size=1><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>La Grotta</b></font>
<br>While Amici is the place for an upscale, full-of-frills Italian meal, its sister restaurant La Grotta (both restaurants are owned by Carlo Gaione and Antonio Capece), in Shockoe Slip, offers equally good food in an earthy setting. Walking down into the belly of a wine cellar, you know you’re in for a heady experience. 
<br><b>1218 E. Cary St.</b>
<br><b>644-2466</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>The Tobacco Company</b></font>
<br>We sometimes forget that The Tobacco Company was a pioneer in Shockoe Slip and also in the national trend toward warehouse chic. The multileveled restaurant is still a visual stunner. With attention to good live music and a bar that serves everything under the sun, the restaurant has never become dull, even in its lauded success.
<br><b>12th and Cary Streets</b>
<br><b>782-9555</b>

<!-------------------
<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Havana ’59</b></font>
<br>The restaurant (clotheslines flapping overhead and towering banana trees) seems to have as many different cultural influences as Cuba itself. The almond-crusted rockfish and the grilled salmon on baby greens with saffron hollandaise are delicious.
<br><b>16 N. 17th St.</b>
<br><b>649-2822</b>
-------- hmmm ------->


<p><font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><big><b>South of the River</b></big></font>

<hr size=1><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Bottega</b></font>
<br>At the bottom of Bottega’s lunch menu, it says, “Water is served upon request.” Now that’s European! Everything about the place feels like an Italian bistro from the low lighting to tables placed close to one another.
<br><b>10400 W. Huguenot Road</b>
<br><b>379-9899</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse</b></font>
<br>Best known for its large portions and classic steakhouse atmosphere, Ruth’s Chris serves more prime cuts than almost any other steakhouse in town. This is one place where beef tastes “like buttah.”
<br><b>11500 W. Huguenot Road</b>
<br><b>378-0600</b>

<p><font color=#000000 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>Seasons Restaurant</b></font>
<br>Chef Taki Takahashi, a native of Japan, treats food with Asian subtlety and French finesse, and he takes on the world. A large map of the world is prominently displayed.
<br><b>13124 Midlothian Tnpk.</b>
<br><b>Village Market Place, Midlothian</b>

<p>
<font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>On old Cary Street, children played under the watchful eye of a community.</b></font>
<br><font color=#002050><b><i>by Carole H. Kipp</i></b> </font>
<p>

<i>Editor’s note: Today Carytown is a thriving shopping district that defies the mall culture. It survives between very different neighborhoods, some poor, some better-off. Richmonder Carole H. Kipp, 56, remembers an earlier incarnation of Carytown. </i>

<p><img src="./images/drop-t.gif" width=22 height=64 align=left vspace=3>he Cary Street I knew as a child was a gathering place for friends and neighbors. Almost everyone from surrounding neighborhoods seemed to know each other. If we passed someone we didn’t know, we spoke to them. We did not know any strangers.
<p>Two or three evenings a week during the summer, my mother would say, “Let’s walk around to Cary Street and see who’s out tonight.” When I reflect on those years around WWII, I think of how close-knit neighbors used to be. They were family.
<p>You would see little girls taking their dolls for rides in baby carriages. You might spot children roller skating down the sloping sidewalk in front of Hofheimer’s Shoe Store, or bicycle riding on the sidewalks.
<p>There was a five and dime that let the children read the latest issues of the comic books. It was common to see three or four children lined up on the floor.
<p>On the western end of Cary Street, there were no stores. However, there was acreage on the left-hand side going west that consisted of stables, horse trails, and a small rink for pony rides — Rankin’s Pony Ranch. This was a favorite gathering place for parents and children to ride ponies or feed the geese. My favorite pony was named Silver.
<p>That’s also where the railroad tracks go through Richmond. My mother used to ride her bicycle to the railroad tracks with me in the basket. There was a set of wooden steps that led down a steep hill to the tracks where we would wait for a train to ride by and wave at the engineer as he chugged past.
<p>We would roller skate into Buddy Long’s filling station and hand him our skate key, and he would tighten our skates for us. He checked our bicycle tires to make sure they had enough air. Across the street from Buddy’s station was an ice house. Those were the days when the ice man delivered ice to our homes to put in the top of our iceboxes. He enjoyed chipping off pieces of ice for us to eat.
<p>There was also a large U-shaped area of stores which did not have a name then. In later years, it became Cary Court Shopping Center.
<p>We would visit Jones & Gooding, an appliance store — the first store to get air conditioning. As adults got a break from the heat upstairs, we would drop in to the employees’ lounge in the basement.
<p>Doc Sager, as we called him, was the pharmacist at Center Pharmacy nearby. He patched up countless skinned knees and small cuts. He would take care of small injuries so it would not be necessary to make a trip to the doctor’s office. Once when I was slicing an orange, the knife slipped and I almost cut off the end of my thumb. My mother quickly wrapped my thumb in a cloth, and headed to Doc Sager. He took me behind the counter, cleaned my cut, and bandaged it tightly. Every time I look at the thumb on my left hand, I think of Doc Sager. His fee for services rendered: a hug and a kiss.
<p>Most families bought their shoes at Hofheimer’s. When children were fitted for shoes, the manager always checked to see if the shoe fit properly. The sales person would then help the children step up on a machine to slide their feet into the holes at the bottom. The top of the machine was glass through which you could see skeletons of your feet. This was the final step to ensure that the shoes fit properly, and it was something we all enjoyed.
<p>Across the street from the U-shaped area was a High’s Ice Cream store, the Kenneth Lord Furniture Shop, and a piano and organ store owned by Cary Gee.
<p>Among the many memorable places were two dime stores, Woolworth’s and the Dixie. My aunt worked in Woolworth’s, and my mother was an employee of the Dixie next door. Mr. and Mrs. Glazer owned the Dixie. Their daughter-in-law, Fannie, worked in the office with them.
<p>There was a sidewalk behind the store where I spent many hours playing hopscotch and jack rocks. Of course, my homework had to be completed first and I did that in the employee lounge. 
<p>My mother, who was an excellent seamstress, worked behind the thread counter. She volunteered to dress the model dolls in the latest fashions of the era. Customers would come into the store just to see the new outfits she displayed.
<p>I remember when the Glazers’ son Edward was away at the war. I used to go up the stairs to the office to see Mr. and Mrs. Glazer and Fannie. Edward’s picture was on Fannie’s desk. Before leaving the store, I always kissed Fannie on each cheek. I would say, “One for Edward, and one for Fannie.” After World War II, Edward returned home. Shortly thereafter, his mother and father retired and Edward and Fannie took over the business.
<p>Daycare centers did not exist then, and families did not babysit for money. If children needed to be taken care of, neighbors or friends would keep them. Sometimes, when I was too young to stay alone, I would stay with our neighbors and play with my friends after school.
<p>Most of the time, I walked from the Robert E. Lee School to the Dixie. I liked the attention I received from the employees, and they watched over me while I was at the store. Most of their names are still in my mind. To this day I have a small stuffed elephant sitting on my bed named Miss Agnes, after the sales lady who made it              for me.
<p>When the yo-yo became a popular sport, a Duncan salesman came to the Dixie and gave instructions to us. After we learned the basic up and down motion on the string, he taught us how to do tricks. We learned how to make the yo-yo sleep, walk the dog, rock the baby, and go around the world. Once the tricks were mastered, he held a yo-yo contest one Saturday behind the Dixie and gave prizes to the winners.
<p>There were two movie theaters on Cary Street: The Byrd Theatre, which is still in use, and The Carillon. When my friends and I went to the Saturday morning matinees at the Byrd, we watched cartoons and western movies. The matinees cost all of fourteen cents. 
<p>The appearance of Cary Street during the ’40s and ’50s was much different from what it is today. I watched it begin to change as new stores replaced the older ones.
<p>Some stores on Cary Street simply closed their doors, while some newcomers opened without the same friendliness I had come to expect as a child.
<p>In the late ’70s, both by mother and aunt retired from Kenneth Lord’s furniture shop. At that time, Cary Street was rapidly deteriorating. Crime was beginning to hit our neighborhoods. It was not safe to go out walking at night anymore and people were afraid. Then, as the years passed, Cary Street began to rebuild and the image has improved. Cary Street is, once again, a great shopping area. There are more stores than ever; I do not believe you would have the time in one day to visit each of them.
<p>The difference between the Cary Street of the ’40s and ’50s and the Cary Street today, is the closeness of the people. Neighbors don’t know each other today the way they did back then. You may know the owners of some stores, but they are exactly that. They are no longer your friends and neighbors.
<p>The Cary Street of decades ago will always have a special place in my heart. You might say I was raised there by an extremely large family. <img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

<font color=#002050 face="Helvetica, Arial"><b>The key to getting an apartment in one of Richmond’s most popular neighborhoods is knowing how to play the game.</b></font>
<br><font color=#002050><b><i>by Kathryn Masterson</i></b> </font>
<p>
<img src="./images/drop-t.gif" width=22 height=64 align=left vspace=0 hspace=8>here’s no question that the Fan, with its eclectic townhouses, tree-lined streets, statues and neighborhood restaurants and bars, is one of the hottest locations in the city to live. But breaking into the neighborhood and establishing yourself in a balcony apartment around the corner from your favorite watering hole is like penetrating a shield of armor.
<p>Long searches, fierce competition for choice spots, fluctuating rents, shady landlords and a myriad of other obstacles face Fan hopefuls.   
<p>Everybody has a story.
<p>Kathleen Keenan faced just about every obstacle in her search for a two-bedroom apartment after her graduation from college. The first problem arose when she and her roommate found what they considered to be the “perfect” apartment on Floyd Avenue, around the corner from the Commercial Taphouse and World Cup. 
<p>After seeing the place, Keenan told the Realtor she was interested in renting the apartment. The agent then showed the apartment to two others who had graduated from the same college and knew Keenan and her roommates. He told the two that Keenan was looking at the place, and if they didn’t write the check then, he would rent to Keenan. They wrote the check. She got squeezed out.
<p>Keenan quickly figured out the most important thing to bring when looking at apartments is a checkbook. In cases with individual showings, the first to write the check is often the one to get the place.
<p>That lesson learned, Keenan attended several open houses with checkbook in hand, but the rules change for open houses. Everyone interested in the apartment fills out an application and pays a deposit.
<p>Then the landlord picks the lucky winner.
<p>There is a feeling of competition at the showings, where groups size each other up with sidelong glances and try to figure out who has the best credit, job title and salary. 
<p>Emily Wilson, another recent college graduate, went to an open house for an apartment on Monument Avenue. Several other couples were there, and Wilson says “everyone loved the place.” Those at the open house were asking each other, “’Do you like it? Are you going to fill out an application?’” 
<p>“It was very intimidating,” Wilson says.
<p>Even more intimidating is competition for the bad apartments. Keenan and her roommates saw a “filthy” apartment on Davis Avenue. The three bedroom place was a wreck — trash on the floor, overflowing ashtrays, Penthouse magazines displayed on the coffee table with empty pizza boxes and a refrigerator which only held 10 bottles of malt liquor. As bad as the place was, four people were inside filling out applications.
<p>Putting money up can also seem intimidating, if not downright questionable. Jeff Bidell went to one showing on the Boulevard where eight people each wrote a $300 check just to have their application considered.
<p>Keenan filled out an application for a place on Grove Avenue and handed over a $50 check. The apartment went to another person, but Keenan says she had to wait more than a month before her check was returned, requiring multiple calls to the landlord, who kept putting her request off.
<p>“There’s a real sense of urgency in finding a place in the Fan,” says Scott Borenstein, a Grace Street resident. Borenstein was aware of the demand for Fan apartments when he was looking, and when he saw the place he now rents, he immediately called his roommate to join him. Five minutes later, they wrote the deposit check.
<p>Because the Fan is in demand, landlords are free to set their own rent prices. Apartment seekers must be aware of inflated charges.
<p>Diana Webster, a student at VCU, looked at apartment listings posted in a restaurant near the campus. One of the listings for a two-bedroom place was in her range of $600. Webster says she looked at the apartment and liked it. Webster ran into trouble when her roommate got a listing of apartments from VCU. The same place was listed for $800 a month.
<p>When Webster talked to the landlord, she says the response was “rent goes up every year.” After arguing about the two listed prices, the landlord lowered the rent to $720 a month.
<p>Short on time and patience, Webster took the place.
<p>“I was really mad. I wouldn’t have even considered that apartment if I knew it was $800,” Webster says.
<p>Wilson was warned of a rate hike while waiting outside an apartment she had an appointment to see. Residents of the building walked out and told her the landlord was taking advantage of residents who needed to move in the same month they signed the lease by overcharging, Wilson says. That, in addition to warnings of bugs, no heat and problems with the pipes, prompted Wilson to flee the site. 
<p>Sleazy landlords were finally what pushed Bidell out of the Fan race. He was tired of people who would change the dates of availabilty or rent rates and he was also wary of those who asked personal information on applications, such as his mother’s maiden name and credit card numbers. 
<p>Of course, not all Fan landlords are sleazy. Keenan’s story had a happy ending when she met a landlord who seemed to play by the rules. Because she was the first person to look at the place, she was able to write the deposit check.
<p>Wilson ended up living on Park Avenue, although she ultimately made a deposit before actually seeing the place. Because the tenant was never available to show the place, Wilson had to settle for seeing the apartment upstairs that was supposedly “just the same.”
<p>Bidell settled for an apartment complex in the West End. This fate is not unusual — most Fan residents know people who ended up in the cookie-cutter suburban complexes — a consolation prize for those who either gave up on the race or ran out of time.
<p>Time to look is important, and Borenstein recommends taking several months to search for the apartment. “Don’t settle,” he says. “If the search takes a little longer, then that’s what it takes.”
<p>But there is a fine line between being careful and overly cautious. 
<p>“Once you do find it, don’t be afraid to jump on it,” Borenstein says.
<p>Those who did jump when the time was right say the end result was worth the search. Not only can you walk to Buddy’s and Bogart’s, you’re now part of a group that has been through the battle and won. ir<img src="./images/close_ir.gif" width=12 height=12 align=bottom>

<P>
On behalf of the Foundation for American Communications (FACS) and news people everywhere, we are pleased to invite you to use this important new service for journalists.<p>

While FACSNET is still in the first phase of its development, we want to encourage you to browse through its links to qualified sources and background material on a wide range of public policy issues. Even at this early stage of development, you will find FACSNET helpful and worthwhile. We believe that you and your associates will return frequently to FACSNET and that, in doing so, you will be generous with your suggestions for additions and improvements.<p>

FACSNET is the result of the combined efforts of journalists, scholars, and programmers at The Detroit News, the San Diego Supercomputer Center, FACS, and elsewhere.<p>

This site is for you. Happy browsing!<p>

Bob Giles<br>
Chairman, FACS<br>

<br>Frequently Asked Questions About FACS<br>
</center>
<hr noshade size=3>
</center>
<p>
<a name="what_is_facs">
<br>
<H3>What is the Foundation for American Communications?</H3>

<p>The Foundation for American Communications, or FACS (pronounced "FACKS"), 
is an independent, nonprofit 501(c)(3) educational institution, founded 
in 1976. While the organization is based in Los Angeles, California, we 
operate nationally and, sometimes, internationally. 

<a name="what_is_purpose">
</p>

<H3>What is the purpose of FACS?</H3>

<p>The FACS mission is to provide the knowledge and resources journalists 
and their sources need to effectively communicate information to the 
public through the news. News sources are people from business, the 
nonprofit sector, the academic community and government, who provide 
information to journalists.

<a name="goals">
</p>

<H3>How does FACS accomplish its goals?</H3>

<p>FACS offers programs, publications and computer on-line services. FACS 
has conducted more than 185 mid-career education programs for 8,200 
journalists nationwide, and hundreds of programs for more than 50,000 
news sources.</p>

<P>The <a href="../../facs_info/what_we_do/jprogram.html">Journalism Education Programs</a> each 
year include a one-week institute, approximately ten weekend conferences 
and several one-day seminars or workshops. For example, the weekend 
conferences are:</p>
 <UL>
 <li> Held at conference sites or universities throughout the U.S.
 <li> Restricted to 40 journalists, in most instances.
 <li> Focused on the academic disciplines underlying topical issues.
 <li> Taught in a Socratic style by expert university professors.
 <li> Designed to encourage lots of interaction between journalists and 
faculty.
 <li> Created to include debate by top policymakers and advocates.
 </UL>


<p>FACS teaches academic disciplines such as economics, science, law and 
ethics. Conference subjects might be headline issues like environmental 
risk, the economics of welfare or immigration and international trade. 
Always the objective is to help journalists learn to analyze the 
underlying issues in the news.</p>

<p>Attendance is limited to working journalists. Typically about half the 
attendees are specialists in the subject of the conference with many 
years of experience reporting or editing; the rest are general assignment 
reporters or people new to the beat. A majority of the people attending 
work within a few hundred miles of the conference site; the rest travel 
from all parts of the country. To encourage journalists to attend, the 
registration cost is kept low (usually $75), requiring 90% of the 
conference cost to be paid by other sources. </p>

<p>FACS also presents media education workshops for news sources, 
tailored to business, nonprofits or academic institutions. For instance, 
the Breaking News, Breaking Barriers half-day workshops for academics:</p>

<UL>
 <li> Are presented for the faculties of colleges and universities 
nationwide, on their campuses.
 <li> Explain the news-gathering process, what makes news and how to work 
with journalists.
 <li> Offer an opportunity to question a panel of journalists about how 
they make decisions.
 <li> Include copies of the companion book, Media Guide for Academics.
</UL>

<p>FACS also presents forums on vital issues, commissions national 
opinion polls on questions important to journalism. Members of our staff 
and faculty often give speeches and presentations about journalism 
issues.

<a name="funds">
</p>

<H3>Who funds FACS?</H3>

<p>All of our journalism programs are funded by grants from newspaper or 
broadcast news organizations, individuals and charitable foundations. The 
two largest benefactors are The Ford Foundation and the W.K. Kellogg 
Foundation. Traditionally, neither has funded journalism education, but 
both have provided major backing and support to FACS because of our work 
educating journalists in the content and analysis of major issues.</p>

<p>The FACSNET computer online service is paid for by news organizations, 
charitable foundations and corporate advertising. News Source programs 
and general office administration are supported by news organizations, 
charitable foundations, corporations and program revenues. No funds from 
corporations or corporate trade associations are used to fund FACS 
journalism programs. FACS accepts no government grants.

<a name="because">
</p>

<H3>Because FACS conducts programs for business, doesn't that compromise 
the educational role of the organization with journalists?</H3>

<p>All of our programs for business have been geared to help executives 
better appreciate the value of the free press and the First Amendment. 
Business people are often hostile toward the press and do not understand the 
news process. FACS programs do not teach media manipulation, but stress 
the importance of being open and truthful with reporters. The programs 
also provide opportunities for discussion between journalists and 
business executives, helping to build understanding.

<a name="corporations">
</p>

<H3>How do corporations work with FACS?</H3>

<p>Corporations can provide general operational grants or funding for 
specific educational programs for news sources. Corporations or trade 
associations sponsor FACS programs for their own memberships or staffs. 
In recent years, FACS has organized a variety of programs for national 
organizations and corporations such as Detroit Edison, The Business 
Roundtable, The National Association of Food Processors, the Edison 
Electric Institute, Independent Sector, Michigan Council of Foundations, 
Chevron and Quaker Oats.

<a name="political">
</p>

<H3>Does FACS have a political or partisan view point?</H3>

<p>Absolutely not. We take no position on political issues and work 
strenuously in our journalism education to avoid even the appearance of a 
point of view. FACS believes that everyone benefits when journalists 
understand the issues and when newsmakers understand the news process. 
Our commitment is to improve that understanding. 

<a name="people">
</p>

<H3>Who are the people of FACS?</H3>

<p>FACS has a full-time staff of ten, including veteran journalists, and a 
large group of part-time advisers and teachers. FACS is directed by a 
board comprised of 15 leaders from journalism, business and the academic 
community. The cochairs of FACS are Robert Giles, publisher and editor of 
The Detroit News, and Ed Turner, executive vice president of CNN. The 
organization also has several advisory boards made up of distinguished 
journalists, business people and educators.

<a name="journalism_programs">
</p>

<H3>How does FACS organize its journalism programs?</H3>

<p>FACS retains top academic advisers from leading institutions to work with 
our professional staff to develop conference. Together they choose 
conference subjects, design the curriculum, engage participating 
educators and policy people and present the sessions. 

<a name="differ">
</p>

<H3>How does FACS differ from other important journalism education groups 
such as the Poynter Institute or the American Press Institute?</H3>

<p>Outstanding organizations such as the Poynter Institute and the American 
Press Institute (API) work mostly on the "nuts and bolts" of journalism 
or management training. API works only with newspapers, and its 
educational programs also include people in newspaper business 
management. The Poynter Institute teaches writing, editing and other 
skills. FACS programs are not geared to training in process, but engage 
purely in content education in economics, science, law, ethics and 
international affairs.

<a name="whoelse">
</p>

<H3>Who else offers journalism education the way FACS does?</H3>

<p>FACS is the only organization providing this kind of regular, national, 
short-term, content education to journalists. Sometimes a university or 
other institution will hold an educational session for journalists. And 
journalism conferences are sometimes held on similar issues, but nearly 
all are comprised of panel discussions, instead of teaching analytical 
ability based in academic disciplines.

<a name="groups">
</p>

<H3>Do you work with other groups?</H3>

<p>FACS actively seeks partners. The Society of Professional Journalists 
(SPJ) cosponsors our programs with a host of other organizations, 
including such groups as the National Association of Black Journalists 
(NABJ), Hational Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), and various state and regional Associated Press newspaper and broadcast associations. Other co-sponsors of FACS programs have included the Southern Newspaper Publishers 
Association, New England Newspaper Press Association. California Society of Newspaper Editors, Michigan Press Association, Michigan Broadcasters Association, and the Illinois Broadcasters Association. We work with universities and hold some conferences on university campuses.</p>

<p>FACS is also active in the journalism profession. Our senior staff 
members have served on national committees of the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors (ASNE) and the Newspaper Association of America (NAA). 
The foundation has also organized programs for such national groups as 
the Radio-Television News Directors Association, American Society of 
Newspaper Editors and the Associated Press Managing Editors. A FACS 
executive served on the Associated Press Managing Editors Newspaper 2000 
Committee which charted the future of American Newspapers into the next 
century. Various FACS board members have participated on the national 
boards and served as national leaders of many groups including the 
Newspaper Association of America, the American Society of Newspaper 
Editors, Associated Press Managing Editors and the Radio-Television News 
Directors Association.

<a name="sponsor">
</p>

<H3>Do individual news organizations sponsor FACS programs for their 
members?</H3>

<p>Yes. In addition to the conferences we present that attract working 
journalists from a wide variety of news organizations, we do "in-house" 
sessions. These have included programs for NBC, Capital Cities/ABC, 
Gannett, Knight-Ridder and CNN.</p>

<p>
<p>
The Foundation for American Communications is an independent educational institution providing knowledge, resources and perspectives needed by journalists and their sources to effectively communicate, through the news, information about important public issues.<p>
<p>
To help the free press and its sources to constructively assess their performance and more effectively supply the reliable, accurate information upon which people base their decisions about the operation of a free society.<p>
<p>
To expand the ability of professional journalists to understand, analyze and report on issues in economics, law, business policy, ethics, science and the environment and international affairs and; <p>
<p>
To expand the ability of news sources to communicate about public policy issues by increasing their understanding of both the principles underlying the basic issues and the news process itself.<p>
<p>
In a democratic society, news is a vital commodity. It provides knowledge to help individuals and organizations make informed decisions about important public issues. The understanding of issues requires knowledge of basic concepts and principles and an up-to-the-minute appreciation of controversies and debates.<p>
Those who gather and report the news and those who are news sources are often poorly equipped to provide the public with the highest quality of information and insight. Thus, information vital to informed choices is inadequate because of deficiencies in the background and training of participants in the news process.<p>
In a complex, rapidly changing world, journalists and news sources recognize the critical need for educational help to overcome these deficiencies. The Foundation for American Communications was formed to meet this need.<p>
FACS is guided by continuing research of the educational needs of journalists and their sources.<p>
A recent Associated Press Managing Editors survey found that the major skill lacking in journalists today is the ability to think analytically. An American Opinion Research poll reports 72 percent of journalists believe that, in general, reporters lack the necessary training and background to cover technical and environmental stories. A FACS-Ford Foundation study on the quality of economic and business reporting quantifies the need for and effectiveness of FACS journalism programs. The study found that fewer than one third of today's journalists have economic training. The study also found that journalists attending FACS conferences chose economic themes and angles 70 percent of the time in their reporting, when given a choice, while those not attending any FACS conferences chose economic themes only 30 percent of the time.<p>
Since its founding in 1976, FACS has conducted more than 165 midcareer education programs for 8,000 journalists nationwide. It has offered its media education programs to more than 12,000 corporate and 50,000 nonprofit executives and academics. It has convened 50 "public and the press" forums on fast-breaking national and international issues. In addition, FACS has produced a wide range of support materials, including the highly regarded Media Resource Guide and its companion Academic Media Handbook. Among the foundation's materials are NewsBackgrounders, audio and video tapes and regular newsletters.<p>

<br><center><h3>Journalism Programs</h3></center><p>
<p>
Today's journalist must assimilate and process information and analyze issues on scales rarely, if  ever, experienced by journalists in the past. The choice of stories on any given day involves economic, scientific and political issues of profound complexity. These stories require specialized knowledge by journalists.<p>
To help journalists cope with growing informational and technological demands, FACS has developed a series of midcareer educational programs. The FACS Journalism Programs help furnish reporters and editors with the knowledge and analytic tools they need to understand and report complex issues.<p>
FACS programs deal with specific issues in the fields of economics, science and the environment, law, international affairs and journalism ethics. The topics include the economics and ethics of health care, environmental issues, foreign affairs, poverty and affordable housing, urban growth and pollution and U.S.-Latin American relations. The FACS program faculty includes top scholars from universities and colleges including Harvard, Stanford, California, Michigan, Northwestern, Georgetown, Pomona, Swarthmore, Yale and Princeton.<p>
Most educational programs for journalists are available only as long-term fellowships requiring extended leaves of absence few news organizations can afford. Conveniently and at low cost, FACS conferences and publications provide brief, concentrated education on the issues journalists encounter.<p>
Whatever the field of study, FACS engages the best experts to teach journalists in contexts they can understand and use in a broad range of areas.<p>

<center><h3>News Source Programs, Business, and Scholars</center></h3>
<p>
<p>
In a world of constantly growing information, news sources must effectively communicate to the American public. To communicate, they need an understanding of the news process, of the role of the press, of reporting and editing and of the role of news sources in journalism.<p>
<p>
During the past two decades, business news coverage has accelerated dramatically. But few business executives have education in communications. Business affects the daily lives of more citizens than does any other institution. The public is demanding more accountability by business executives for their decisions. That requires an ability to communicate to the public through the news media. Corporate leaders need to develop an understanding of the news process.<p>
<p>
FACS programs for business are designed to help business leaders gain understanding. They also provide perspectives on the American press and the role of sources in the news process. On key issues of vital concern to the public, FACS helps business, journalists, public interest groups and government find common ground and develop communications practices and policies that properly serve all of them and, ultimately, the public.<p>
<p>
One of the unique aspects of American life, noted by observers since Alexis de Tocqueville, is the solving of public problems and the meeting of public needs by volunteers. Volunteer, community and philanthropic organizations and academic institutions comprise the independent sector of American society.<p>
<p>
Not all news sources are government officials or business executives. Many are volunteers, scholars, representatives of community groups, charitable and philanthropic organizations, and others with important and valuable stories to tell the public.<p>
<p>
FACS has been active since 1976 in helping volunteer and nonprofit organizations and scholars develop an understanding of the news process and of the media tools required to communicate successfully with news organizations. The foundation helps community and nonprofit groups through regional workshops conducted jointly with local news organizations. Gatherings of community representatives as small as 35 and as large as 500 have profited from FACS Media Workshops. In all, 50,000 individuals representing the independent sector have participated.<p>
<p>
FACS workshops and conferences are attended by executives and leaders from volunteer and nonprofit sectors, government, labor, academic institutions and business associations. FACS also works directly with a variety of public and private agencies that need assistance in effective communications. FACS programs help solve communications problems, design media strategies and increase each organization's ability to reach clients, volunteers, supporters and neighbors. FACS also prepares scholars to become useful resources for journalists in such fields as economics, science, law, ethics and international affairs.<p>

<hr noshade size=3> <h1>Election Year Tax Rhetoric </h1>
            <h2> </h2>
            <strong>It is shocking, but true; politicians running for election or reelection tell people what they want to hear.
 About taxes, people want to hear that theirs will go down.
 In this NewsBackgrounder, veteran FACS teacher Frank Wykoff examines tax promises by candidates.
 Pulling no punches, Professor Wykoff discusses the failure of journalists to ask the candidates tough questions about their tax reform prescriptions.
 He lays out four issues we must understand before we can pin down politicians on their tax rhetoric.
<p></strong><strong>by Frank Wykoff<p></strong><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=20> <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><IMG SRC= "../../facsnet_grafix/report_tools/Wykoff.gif" ALT = "Frank Wykoff"> </TD><TD><B>Frank Wykoff</B> is the Eldon Smith Professor of Economics at Pomona College and the Claremont Graduate School. He specializes in macroeconomics theory, monetary theory and policy, econometrics and public finance, particularly investment and taxation. His most recent book is <I>Understanding Economics Today</I>, written with Gary Walton. He is editor of the influential journal <I>Economic Inquiry</I>. Professor Wykoff is director of the FACS Institute on Economics for Journalists and economics adviser to the foundation. Since 1979, he has taught economics to thousands of journalists at FACS conferences. </TD> </TR> </TABLE><p><P><EM>In political calls for tax reform, citizens hear promises of tax cuts.
 While we might accept hyperbole from politicians, the news reporter is expected to cut through the fog to disclose the underlying issues, the quality of the candidates' thinking, and their views of America.
</p>
It is valid for a candidate to suggest radical proposals--a flat tax, integration of corporate and personal tax systems, or elimination of all taxes on capital gains income.
 Even though one may disagree with them, these proposals are not preposterous.
 Still, people need to understand that tax proposals have identifiable consequences.
 Are you, as a journalist, up to the task of separating out the sense from the nonsense or of convincing the public of the implications of various proposals?
</p>
Tax proposals afford journalists an opportunity to inform the public about a candidate's thoughts on four core issues: (1) <A HREF="#Justice">distributive justice</A>, (2) <A HREF="#Consequences">economic consequences</A>, (3) <A HREF="#Deficit">budget deficits</A>, and (4) <A HREF="#Philosophy">tax philosophy</A>.
</EM>
<P> <HR>
<P>Every four years, as reliably as Old Faithful and the swallows at Capistrano, calls for tax reform fill the political air.
 Candidates promise faster economic growth, less intrusive government, better family values and, basically, nirvana, as a consequence of a new tax code.
 <P>What do taxpayers hear in these calls for reform?
 They hear promises of tax cuts.
 Most voters don't really care about abstractions of equity and efficiency or arcane discussion of budget deficits.
 They want tax cuts without program cuts.
 That, of course, is exactly what politicians tell them they can have.
 Never mind that the Congress and the White House rarely agree on even minor budget cuts in welfare and social programs, much less the substantial cuts and revisions needed in entitlements including medical care and social security.
 Never mind that all serious forecasts tell of huge budget deficits well into the 21st century.
 The politicians say, and the voters seem to believe, "We're gonna give you tax cuts.
"<P>
One expects a large dose of malarkey in political campaigns, but rarely have calls for tax reform been quite so absurd as during the 1996 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.
 The childish responses of news people too often reflected the juvenilia of some campaigns, and that is where the real problem lies.
 While we expect nonsense from politicians who aim for the 6 o'clock news sound bite, we would hope that journalists would ask probing questions about the public fisc.
 However, rather than ask serious questions about tax proposals, too many journalists either ignore them altogether or form summary opinions, without thought or research.
 <P>
This deplorable state of news coverage of American politics may reflect deterioration of the education level of the public.
 That is the usual defense by journalists who claim they have no choice but to be superficial because their audiences will tune them out if they get serious.
 If that justification for shallow coverage is correct, the problem requires a major reform of the educational system.
 <P>
Perhaps journalists should do a little boning up on those issues if they are to knowledgably communicate to the public through newspapers, magazines, radio and television.
 We tolerate fluff from politicians.
 Reporters, though, must cut through the fog and disclose the underlying issues and the quality of the candidates' thinking.
 When, instead, journalists completely ignore issues and report ad nauseam on who is outperforming or under performing expectations in the horse race, some reflection is in order on the state of the journalism profession.
 <P>It is valid for a candidate to suggest reducing the number of tax brackets, even down to one (a flat tax).
 It is valid to suggest, as Steve Forbes did, integrating corporate taxes with personal taxes so that this source of income is not taxed twice.
 It is valid tosuggest a zero tax rate on incomes below a certain level, even if that level is high.
 It is valid to propose tax-free capital gains income.
 One may disagree with them, but these proposals are not, prima facie, unreasonable.
 It is equally reasonable to suggest, as Michael Dukakis recently did, removing the income cap on social security payroll taxes.
 It is reasonable to suggest, as does President Clinton's 1997 budget proposal, cutting taxes on families with children.
 To say that proposals are reasonable is not to say they are a good idea, but that reasonable people can honestly defend them.
 <P>Nonetheless, some proposals go too far.
 In his stump speech, Steve Forbes proposed elimination of the Internal Revenue Service.
 Truth in advertising requires me to point out that I worked in 1974 for the IRS as a Brookings Institution Policy Fellow.
 Still, what did Forbes mean when he said he planned to pull the plug on the IRS?
 Can he possibly have meant that we should have no tax agency at all, or did he just mean that the IRS should be nicer?
 It seems to me that a bit of a problem would arise if we had no tax collection agency.
 Wouldn't that mean that we would have no government?
 Even adjusting for political hyperbole, that's a bit much.
 The most ardent of Newt Gingrich's shock troops have not suggested zero taxes for everyone.
 <P>
Voters need to understand that tax proposals have consequences.
 Journalists must help the public to separate the sense from the nonsense and inform readers, viewers and listeners about the implications of these proposals.
 Is the profession up to the task?
 Some examples are troubling.
<P>
On a network television interview, a prominent journalist used precious air time in an interview with Mr.
 Forbes by asking him what he, personally, stood to gain from his flat tax proposal.
 That was a wasted opportunity.
 First, it was a charge, not a question.
 An opponent, not a journalist, should have made it.
 It would have been just as productive if she had said,"You're a selfish, rich, S.
O.
B.
" and stuck her tongue out at him, emphasizing what seemed to be her only real point.
 Second, on the face of it, the question was absurd.
 Did she believe that Forbes is really so naive as to think he could spend $100 million and the better part of a year running for president as a subterfuge for trying to reduce his personal tax liability?
 This national correspondent was too lazy, too ideological, too ignorant or too intimidated by the subject to ask a serious question about tax policy.
 Any of those reasons is disturbing.
 <P>Reporters can use tax proposals to inform the public about how a candidate thinks of society.
 Serious questions about tax promises can open windows into the candidate's mind and help voters decide whether he or she will be a good leader.
 In 1996, tax policy questions should revolve around four issues.

Though many campaign tax stories cover distributive justice, the approach is often intellectually immature.
 Reducing tax liability of the rich, even on grounds of equity, is not necessarily bad.
 One criterion for fairness in a tax system comes from an approach developed by Harvard economic philosopher John Rawls in his A Theory of Justice.
 Rawls believes everyone can agree that the natural rights of any one person can be infringed on only if that is necessary to raise the well-being of the worst-off person.
 If you did not know how you, as an individual, would fare in a society, would you accept a tax system as fair?
 In other words, don't look at a tax system from your own point of view or that of any other actual person.
 Look at it from the abstract point of view that you could be any one person.
 Thinking that way, you may come up with surprising perspectives.
 <P>
Economists call taxes progressive if they take a higher percentage of a rich person's income.
 If a tax takes a higher proportion from a poor person, we call the tax regressive.
 Are all regressive taxes bad and all progressive taxes good?
 If you say yes, then you have some work to do to explain lottery taxes, which invariably take a greater percentage from the poor, who fall for lotteries more than do the rich.
 You also have to explain social security payroll taxes, which have a cap and, thus, take a greater percentage of a low wage earner's income.
 If you opposed flat taxes on grounds of regressivity, you would be wrong because, with a deduction, a flat tax rate is progressive.
<P>
    <H3><A NAME="Consequences">Efficiency vs.
 Equity In Tax Policy</A></H3>News people who analyze taxes should look beyond distributive justice issues.
 Economists worry a lot about the consequences of a tax.
 They call it tax efficiency.
 Anyone examining a tax should weigh its efficiency against its equity (or fairness) criterion.
 Taxes on capital gains provide an interesting example of how equity and efficiency considerations can conflict.
 Since the rich tend to own more capital assets than the poor, the impact of a capital gains tax reduction would seem to favor the rich over the poor.
 That is an equity point taken away from this proposal; but consider the systemic reaction to lower taxes on capital gains.
 Lower tax liability implies more capital gains investments, which, in turn, implies more investments and more growth.
 That is an efficiency point for the proposal.
 Which point wins the day?
 A person's view of the tax depends on how much importance he puts on equity versus efficiency and on the size of the effects.
 <P>
If capital gains accrue to many people, not to just a few Steve Forbeses, then the equity effects may be small.
 If the growth effects are large, then the efficiency argument may carry the day.
 Advocates of capital gains tax cuts are, of course, inclined to exaggerate the growth kick.
  Tax law changes alone rarely have big effects on growth across the economy.
 They may have significant effects when applied along with other measures, but a single tax code change would have to be pretty dramatic to have substantial short-term consequences for the whole economy.
 How can a reporter handle all of this in an interview?
 Ask the candidate to cite specific historical examples of a tax law that caused large growth.
 Then check his answer against some experts.
<P>
 <H3><A NAME="Deficit">Tax Cuts And Budget Deficits</A></H3>Should reporters allow candidates to propose tax cuts without asking them to comment on their deficit implications?
 Despite years of hand wringing and some short-term reductions, the long-range prospects are for $200- to $300-billion dollar deficits.
 There are two reasons for that.
 First, congressmen, senators and presidents have promised social security, health care and income maintenance that exceed the ability of the economy to generate tax revenues without huge increases in tax rates.
 All serious observers agree that the entitlement system needs fiscal reform.
 <P>
The second reason for deficits far into the future is more political.
 Of three political positions on taxes and the budget deficit, just one explicitly favors lower budget deficits.
 Only moderates care first about budget deficits.
 When the crunch comes, liberals show that they will tolerate deficits rather than incur the cost of significant cuts in social spending.
 The conservative position, while more subtle, also puts law priority on deficit reduction.
 Conservatives are willing to lower deficits only if they can do so by reducing spending.
 Conservatives do not want lower deficits if they require higher taxes.
 Thus, conservatives favor spending cuts and tax cuts.
 Since spending cuts are unpopular, conservatives talk more about tax cuts.
 Some conservatives will argue that tax increases will not actually lower the deficit.
 They argue that tax hikes will cause Congress to increase spending, which will leave the deficit intact.
 That is a political debating point.
       
<P>Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that conservative tax cutters differ from liberals and moderates.
 Conservatives want to reduce the revenues available for the public sector, so that the private share of the pie can grow at the expense of the public sector.
 They want that regardless of the tax deficit consequences.
 Liberals want a larger government share of the pie.
 Neither liberals nor conservatives view reducing budget deficits as the top priority.
 It is important to see that tax proposals from these two groups often do not reflect serious concern with budget deficits.
 
<P>        <H3><A NAME="Philosophy">Philosophy</A></H3>Taxes are a window into a candidate's philosophy.
 There are two philosophical approaches to tax policy.
 One is conservative, or what the Europeans call classically liberal.
 The other is the view of European socialists.
 Classical liberals see the tax system as a necessary evil to collect enough money to support government programs.
 This view implies that the private sector should be unchanged by a tax.
 The key to this philosophy is low incremental tax rates applied uniformly, regardless of economic activity.
 A true flat tax integrates corporate and personal income taxes and treats capital gains the same as ordinary income.
 Such a flat tax is based on the philosophy that the tax policy should distort the decision-making of the private sector.
 
<P>The European socialist views taxes as a tool the state can use to manipulate private behavior.
 This is social engineering.
 Examples of such taxes in the US.
 are sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol.
 Perhaps ironically, social engineering with tax policy is popular among both conservatives and liberals.
 Consider the biggest tax increase proposal of the 1996 campaign, Patrick Buchanan's proposal to tax imports.
 Why impose tariff duties on imports?
 To discourage people from trading across international borders.
 Thatis a social engineering tax philosophy.
 <P>Ask a candidate to justify his proposal to cut taxes for families with children.
 Such proposals are not designed to generate income without altering private behavior.
 Instead, they are intended as social statements about family values.

<P>By digging into the fascinating dynamics involved in tax policy, journalists can do a great deal to stimulate the election process and offset voter apathy.
 To accomplish that, they must be willing to think beyond short-cut questions about who will pay the tax.

            <h2>Beware the Hype</h2>
            <strong>This NewsBackgrounder addresses the language used by geneticists as they try to convey the importance of human genome research and especially its implications for gene therapy.
 Do the images promulgated by geneticists inform the public accurately and fairly about this complex field?
 How do journalists communicate those issues to the public?
<p></strong><strong>by Dorothy Nelkin<p></strong><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=20> <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><IMG SRC= "../../facsnet_grafix/report_tools/nelkin.GIF" ALT = "Dorothy Nelkin"> </TD><TD><B>Dorothy Nelkin</B> is a university professor at New York University, teaching in the Department of Sociology and the School of Law.

She has spoken at FACS science conferences for journalists.</TD> </TR> </TABLE><P>Threatened with declining public support at a time of increased research costs, scientists are using rhetorical strategies to communicate the excitement and the benefits of their work.
 Evocative images, catchy titles and corny metaphors have proliferated - often designed to attract media attention.
 We hear about chaos and quarks, big bangs and black holes, buckyballs and superstrings, master molecules and medical crystal balls.
 <BR> <BR> Geneticists worry about their public image.
 They hope to assure the continuity of public funding and to counter negative perceptions of genetics shaped by its historical association with eugenics.
 They have become skilled at media communication.
 In popular magazines, public talks, and media interviews, geneticists publicize their discoveries and promise a "genetic future" in which we will be able to predict and then find therapies for disease.
 <BR> <P><CENTER><A HREF="#tips">Click here to go directly to helpful Reporting Tips</A></CENTER> <P> <H2>Promotional Rhetoric</H2> The metaphors geneticists use to describe their work convey several messages: They define the gene as an essentialist and deterministic entity.
 They promise that genetic research will enable the prediction of future behavior and disease and that it will lead to therapeutic solutions.
<BR> <BR> Scientists call the genes the "master molecules.
" They say that we are but "readouts" of our genes.
 They describe the body in deterministic terms - as a set of instructions, a blueprint, a map, a program transmitted from one generation to another.
 They suggest that by deciphering the text, classifying the markers on the map and reading the instructions, they will unlock the key to human ailments and human nature, revealing the secrets of human life.
 Geneticist Walter Gilbert introduces his public lectures on gene sequencing by pulling a compact disk from his pocket and announcing to his audience: "This is you.
" He claims that scientists will "provide ultimate answers to the commandment, know thyself.
" Similarly, the Cold Spring Harbor Genetics Laboratory published a children's book called <I>Cells Are Us.
</I> <BR> <BR> Scientists also emphasize the predictive powers of their science by calling the gene a "Delphic Oracle," a "time machine," a "trip into the future," a "medical crystal ball.
" James Watson, the first director of the Human Genome Project, announces in frequent interviews, "Our fate is in our genes.
" In interviews, geneticists present futuristic scenarios associating genetic prediction with the ability to control disease.
 In the future, says a geneticist interviewed by <I>Discover</I>, "Present methods of treating depression will seem as crude as former pneumonia treatments seem now.
" In the future, writes food scientist Fergus Clydesdale, "Computer models in the home will provide consumers with a diet customized to fit their genetic individuality, which will have been predetermined by simple diagnostic tests.
" In the future, geneticist French Anderson told a <I>Time</I> reporter, "Physicians will simply treat patients by injecting a snippet of DNA and send them home cured.
 Celebrating the discovery of a tumor suppresser gene as the 1993 "Molecule of the Year," Science reported the possibility of curing "a terrible killer in the not too distant future.
" Molecular biologist Richard Mulligan declared to <I>Discover</I>, "We can use gene transfer to make a cell do whatever we want.
.
.
we can play God in that cell.
" The isolation of the colon cancer gene in 1993 prompted an enthusiastic report of its implications: "Deaths are entirely preventable.
" <BR> <H2>Magic Bullets </H2> Seeking the publicity that will attract funds for research, scientists and the press offices of their institutions often turn tentative experimental findings into magic bullets.
 The publishers of a 1994 handbook for physicians on gene therapy advertised it as offering practical information on treatment options as if clinically effective gene therapies were available.
 In early 1995, the Scripps Research Institute issued a press release announcing that researchers had found a cure for cancer through a small injection of a protein that would cut off the blood supply from tumors and cause them to shrink, leaving normal tissue intact.
 The announcement was about a laboratory observation; there had been no experimental trials testing the relevance of the observation to human pathology.
 <BR> The biotechnology industry has further encouraged hype.
 The industry has made a major commitment to gene therapy, expecting it to be the basis of future medicine.
 Despite economic and technical hurdles, more than 20 companies are specializing in gene therapy.
 Anticipating a profitable market in the near future, industry finances more than 60 percent of gene therapy studies.
 Corporate advertisements announce "a great leap in the treatment of disease," and promise "a healthy future one gene at a time.
" Right after the discovery of the mutation in the BRCA-1 breast cancer gene, a pharmaceutical company ad announced the firm's progress in finding "breakthrough .
.
.
new treatments and ultimately the cure for breast cancer.
" One ad says it all: "Bad Genetics?
 Use Opti-genetics—The first genetic optimizer.
" <BR> <H2>Celebrity Genes?
</H2> The promises coming from scientists and biotechnology firms have captured media interest: the gene has become a ubiquitous popular image, a remarkably newsworthy entity.
 The language of biological determinism is pervasive in the press.
 In a Lexis data base search of genetic images, I found references to genes for obesity, criminality, shyness, directional ability, religiosity, intelligence, political leanings, traditionalism, and preferred styles of dressing - suggesting that such complex attributes are transmitted like brown hair and blue eyes.
 In many news reports, the gene has assumed its own behavioral attributes.
 My media search uncovered selfish genes, pleasure-seeking genes, criminal genes, celebrity genes, homosexual genes, couchpotato genes, depression genes, genes for genius, genes for saving, and even genes for sinning.
 The Human Genome Program has replaced the space program as the new frontier, the cutting edge of high tech exploration.
 <BR> <BR> When a scientist finds a genetic marker or the genes for a disease - especially a common disease such as breast or colon cancer - it is newsworthy mainly because of the therapeutic implications.
 However, news reports often underplay the complexity of genetic and environmental interactions in the etiology of disease and ignore the distance between diagnosis and therapy.
 Repeated headlines express remarkable expectations: "Genetic Research Leaves Doctors Hopeful for Cures"; "New Hope for Victims of Disease"; "Genetics, the War on Aging.
.
.
[is] the Medical Story of the Century.
.
.
Genetic technologies will dramatically curtail heart disease, aging, and much more.
"<BR> <BR> The recent development of pharmaceutical products and the proliferation of clinical trials on new therapeutic procedures have encouraged technological optimism.
 In the 1980s, the introduction of therapeutic molecules, especially TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) for dissolving clots, and the use of human growth hormone to treat dwarfism became newsworthy issues.
 In 1990 came the first official gene therapy experiment.
 Scientists injected cells containing genes for adenosine deaminase (ADA) into a child with an immune system malfunction.
 It became a major news event.
 "The long awaited era of genetic therapy has at last arrived" said a writer in <I>The Sciences</I>.
 <I>Discover</I> called gene therapy, "The Ultimate Medicine.
" Writing on gene transfer techniques, the reporter proclaimed, "Genetic surgeons can now go into your cell and fix those genes with an unlikely scalpel: a virus.
" Similarly, <I>U.
S.
 News and World Report</I> told its readers that gene therapy is the medicine of the future.
 "No disease has given up more of its secrets to genetic sleuths than cancer.
" Genetics, promised the writer, will allow doctors to 'do something' about disease.
" <BR> <BR> These promises, backed by scientific authority, raise hopes of instant cures.
 Aside from controlling reproduction, however, there is little one can do about genetic disease.
 The gap between identifying a predisposition to a genetic condition and finding a therapeutic solution is very wide.
 <BR> <H2>Problems of Clinical Application</H2> The problems of clinical application follow in part from the complexity of genetic diseases.
 Some result from the absence of the activity of a gene product; others by altered proteins that disrupt cellular function; and still others by alterations of chromosomal structure.
 The fact that this disease has many more mutations than originally anticipated confounded the high expectations about a therapy for cystic fibrosis.
 <BR> <BR> There are also problems in finding safe vectors capable of transporting genes into targeted cells.
 Most gene therapies use viruses as the carrier mechanism.
 That is the most feasible way of targeting appropriate cells.
 Nonetheless, a cystic fibrosis therapy that used inactivated cold viruses as a vector failed to benefit patients.
 So too, research on a therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy had no effect.
 And there are risks.
 Inserting a gene in the wrong place along a strand of DNA could cause an undesirable mutation.
 The immune system may attack cells treated with gene therapy, responding to them as foreign or infected, especially when a virus transfers the genes.
 Gene transfer experiments on monkeys caused malignant T-cell lymphoma.
 Genetech halted clinical trials of the promising drug Pulmozyme, developed to treat cystic fibrosis, when a significant number of treated patients died.
 <BR> <BR> Discovering risks and side effects is, of course, the purpose of animal research and clinical trials.
 In an area hyped as "the medicine of the future," failures become more than routine science; they also become a news peg.
 Researchersseldom tell journalists that a failed clinical trial can yield very useful information.
<BR> <BR> Apart from the technical difficulties in the clinical application of gene therapies, the high cost of developing products for diseases that affect relatively few people may block their widespread availability.
 Biotechnology companies have benefitted from the Orphan Drug Act, which provides financial incentives to find cures for diseases affecting fewer than 100,000 people.
 As a reward for developing a drug only for a limited market, the government protects the company producing it for seven years from competition by identical products made by other companies.
 The monopoly on the drug allows the firm to recover its investment, but it has implications for the cost of treatment.
 That is the situation, for example, with an enzyme replacement theory that is available to treat the genetic disorder called Gaucher disease.
 This devastating disease, typically expressed in enlarged livers or spleens and bone lesions, affects about 20,000 Americans.
 They, of course, welcome the possibility of relief, but the cost of treatment is so prohibitive that economists suggest it would not only use up the insurance of affected individuals, but also deplete the national health care budget.
 According to <I>Nature-Medicine</I>, the cost of treating 1200 to 1400 Gaucher patients worldwide will soon approach one billion dollars; the same amount would pay for 50,000 patient years of renal dialysis.
<BR> <BR> Similarly, the much-publicized experiment on gene therapy for children who lack an immune system enzyme was a technical success, but its very high cost limits extending its use beyond experimentation.
 This problem of prohibitive costs precludes the widespread clinical use of bio-engineered products for many rare disorders.
 <BR> <H2>Heightened Expectations</H2> In this context, diagnostic capabilities have far outpaced therapeutic possibilities.
 This is, indeed, an old story; for diagnostic technologies have always precededthe ability of clinicians to provide appropriate treatment.
 Today, however, with greater knowledge about bodily processes and extravagant promises about "our genetic future," the public expects results.
 Yet understanding genetic diseases does not necessarily lead to benefits beyond the ability to predict.
 Indeed, the growing access to genetic information has left us in a state of enlightened impotence.
 That enlightenment is tempered by a likely result of predictive information about genetic status; people identified as predisposed to a genetic disease may be exposed to stimitization and discrimination.
 Insurers and employers, for example, have economic interests in gaining access to information about the future health status of their clients, and may use it to deny affected employees benefits or exclude them from work.
 <BR> <BR> The journal <I>Nature-Medicine</I> has observed the "upside down" history of gene therapy, "One in which conceptual advances has become widely accepted and firmly established as medical principle before even a simple clinical instance of clinical efficacy has been demonstrated.
" Similarly, a National Institutes of Health advisory committee has criticized the "extravagant and oversold" promises about gene therapy.
 Like advocates in any field, scientists are prone to overestimate the benefits of their work.
 Their promotional hyperbole may backfire; for exaggerated promises that play to people's hopes and expectations may open the way to cynicism should promises falter or fail.

<hr noshade size=3> <h1>Considering a New Tax System</h1>
            <h2> </h2>
            <strong>In this pre-election year, proposals to reform the national tax system are being promoted by some politicians and dodged by others.
 The Brookings Institution's Bill Gale offers background and economic perspectives that will help journalists analyze the major proposals and sharpen their questions about this crucial and complex issue.
<p></strong><strong>by William Gale<p></strong><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=20> <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><IMG SRC= "../../facsnet_grafix/report_tools/gale.gif" ALT = "William Gale"> </TD><TD><B>William Gale</B> is a senior fellow and Joseph A. Pechman Fellow in the Economic Studies Program at the Brookings Institution. Before joining Brookings, Gale served as the senior tax economist for the President's Council of Economic Advisers. His <I>A User's Guide to Fundamental Tax Reform</I> will be published by Brookings in 1996. </TD> </TR> </TABLE><P>Tax reform, a perennial topic in policy circles, has taken on a dramatic new edge.
  Several recent proposals to scrap the personal and corporate income taxes and replace them with a consumption tax.
  Any of these proposals would represent one of the largest U.
S.
 tax changes ever made and would make the United States the only Western country to replace an income tax with a consumption tax.
       <p>       <h3>What's the Problem?
</h3>       <p>       The push for fundamental reform has grown out of frustration over the inefficiency, inequity, and complexity of today's income tax.
  Critics charge that the income tax is a drag on savings and investment and thus on economic efficiency and the growth of living standards.
  For example, some forms of personal savings are taxed twice, once when earned and again when the saving earns interest.
 Corporate income is taxed at the corporate level and again when it is received by shareholders.
 Taxable capital income is not adjusted for inflation.
 Different forms of investments are taxed at different rates, generating investment decisions based on tax reasons, rather than economic values.
         <p>       Critics also claim that the system is unfair.
 Households with the same income and number of children often pay dramatically different taxes because different forms of income are taxed at different rates.
 Some income, such as health benefits provided by employers, is not taxed at all.
 Debates continue over how much wealthier households should pay in taxes relative to poorer ones.
 Equity issues, of course, can be addressed by tinkering with the current system.
  A more fundamental question is whether any income tax is fair.
  Income is what a person produces for society.
  Consumption is what he or she takes away from society.
  So, the argument goes, why not tax consumption rather than income?
       <p>       Another criticism of the current system is that it is complex and expensive to administer.
  Complexity also breeds suspicion among some that other people are unfairly avoiding taxes.
       <p>       <h3>Should We Modify the Income Tax?
</h3>       <p>       Clearly, the income tax has flaws.
  Are we ready to throw it out?
  Past reforms have tried to address the problems within the system.
       <p>       One approach — embodied in the Contract with America — is to provide incentives to increase saving and investment.
  Over the years, these incentives appear to have had some effect on investment, but little, if any, on saving.
  They complicate the tax system and require increased tax rates on the remaining tax base to raise the same revenue.
  Furthermore, creating one loophole breeds demands for more.
  Most fundamentally, the purpose of these incentives is to counteract a negative effect of the income tax.
  If the income tax is the problem, it would make more sense to remove the problem than to create more gimmicks.
       <p>       The opposite approach — adopted in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 — is to broaden the tax base by eliminating as many loopholes and deductions as possible and reducing rates.
  The aim is to tax all forms of income under the same progressive but low tax rates (or, practically speaking, tax as much income as possible at as a low a rate as possible).
         <p>       <h3>What Is a Consumption Tax?
</h3>       <p>       Proposals for fundamental tax reform would scrap the income tax altogether and start over with a new system that taxes consumption.
       <p>       Consumption is income less saving.
  The only difference in principle between a consumption tax and an income tax is the treatment of saving.
  An income tax taxes saving when the money is earned and again when the saving earns interest.
  A consumption tax taxes saving only when it is withdrawn and used for consumption.
  Despite this apparently simple difference, consumption taxes come in many forms, and some don't even look like consumption taxes at first.
         <p>       <h3>Current Proposals for a ConsumptionTax</h3>       <p>   <h4>Here is a brief overview of the current proposals for a consumption tax, with the author's comments in bold:</h4>       <p>       <h4>National Retail Sales Tax</h4>       <p>       Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN) recently proposed a 17 percent retail sales tax on consumption of all goods and services except food and medicine.
        <p>       <strong>Sales taxes appear to be simple, but as a replacement for the income tax, they present problems.
 First, if  food and medicine were exempted, it would take a 21 percent tax to replace personal and corporate income tax revenues.
 If housing were exempted, the rate would have to be at least 27 percent.
 If the sales tax reduced consumption (increased saving) as intended, even higher rates would be required.
 Such high retail sales tax rates invite widespread evasion and would require detailed, costly auditing of businesses.
 Second, the tax does not distinguish between final sales (to households) and retails sales from one business to another.
 In the latter case, taxes are imposed on goods used in producing other goods, adding a layer of tax with each transaction.
 This "cascading" raises the relative price of certain goods in a capricious way.
 Third, sales taxes are regressive.
 They absorb a greater percentage of the income of lower-income people than of wealthy people.
</strong>          <p>       <h4>Value Added Tax</h4>       <p>       Under a value added tax, each business pays taxes on the difference between gross revenues from sales and the cost of materials, including capital goods.
  Thus it pays taxes on wages, interest, and profits, the sum of which represents the value added by the firm in providing goods and services.
       <p>       <strong>The VAT avoids cascading because sales between businesses wash out.
 The baker who sells bread to the grocer pays VAT on the sale, but the grocer deducts the purchase in calculating his VAT.
 The VAT also reduces the sales tax evasion problem: Because the purchaser reports the transaction in order to claim the deduction, the seller—who pays taxes on the sales—is more likely to also report.
        <p>       A VAT places a tax on net value added at each stage of production.
 A sales tax places a tax on the final sales price, which is just the sum of net value added at each stage.
 Other than cascading and evasion, a uniform and comprehensive VAT has the same economic effects as sales taxes.
 Thus, a VAT is also regressive.
</strong>       <p>       <h4>Flat Tax</h4>       <p>       The so-called flat tax system devised by Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution assesses a 19 percent tax on all businesses.
 It is identical to the VAT, except that wages and pension contributions would be deducted from the tax base along with materials costs and capital investments.
 For individuals and households, there is a 19 percent flat rate tax on wages and pension benefits above an exemption of $25,500 for a family of four.
  No other income is taxable, and no other deductions are allowed.
       <p>       Congressman Richard Armey (R-TX), and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), have introduced a similar proposal with a $31,400 exemption for a family of four and a 20 percent tax rate.
 After two years, the exemption would rise to $33,300 and the rate would fall to 17 percent.
 This proposal combines tax reform with a tax cut.
 Hall and Rabushka's calculations suggest that at Armey's exemption level, a 22 percent rate would be needed to maintain revenues.
        <p>       <strong>Hall-Rabushka maintains the advantages of a VAT and addresses, at least partially, the regressivity issue.
 Absent the personal exemptions, it would be equivalent to a VAT, but with taxes on wages remitted by households rather than business.
 That is, the flat tax is a consumption tax even though it will look like a wage tax to households and a variant of a VAT to most businesses.
 Therefore, other than the exemptions, the economic effects of the flat tax shouldbe essentially the same as a VAT or sales tax.
 The family exemptions make the flat tax progressive for low-income households.
 But at the high end of the income distribution, the tax will be regressive, just like sales taxes and VATs.
</strong>         <p>       <h4>Unlimited Saving Account Tax</h4>       <p>       The USA tax, sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Sam Nunn (D-GA) assesses an 11 percent value added tax on all businesses and places a graduated tax on households' consumed income, the difference between income and qualified net saving.
  Qualified net saving can be thought of as an unlimited IRA without the withdrawal restrictions.
 A family of four would receive exemptions totaling $17,600.
 Deductions for mortgage interest and charitable deductions now in the tax code would remain, as would the tax preference for municipal bonds and the earned income tax credit.
 Households and business would receive a full tax credit for payroll tax payments.
 Consumed income less deductions would be taxed at rates starting at 19 percent and rising to 40 percent on amounts above $14,000 for a married couple.
 The credit for payroll taxes lowers the effective rates 7.
65 percentage points for about the first $60,000 of earned income.
        <p>       <strong>The USA tax is estimated to be at least as progressive as the current income tax, but has problems in other regards.
 First, for many households the USA tax would be even more complicated because of the need to track net saving.
 Second, the treatment of borrowing, which is just negative saving, is muddled.
 As one example, retaining the mortgage interest deduction in a consumption tax is a mistake.
 Under an income tax, interest income is taxable so that there is no gain to a household that increases its mortgage debt and invests the proceeds in interest-bearing assets.
 Under a consumption tax, however, interest income is not taxable, so if mortgage interest were deductible, the household could exploit this inconsistency to generate tax-induced gains.
 This is precisely the type of tax arbitrage that should be eliminated, not encouraged, by tax reform.
 Third, the efficiency and simplicity of the USA system is reduced by transition rules, as discussed below.
</strong>       <p><h3>Evaluating Fundamental Tax Reform</h3>       <p>       Analysts find it hard to predict with precision the effects of minor tax changes, and heated debate continues about the effects of the major 1980's tax reforms.
  Hence, efforts to evaluate the effects of uprooting the entire tax system must be qualified appropriately.
       <p>       A central issue in tax reform is always who wins and who loses.
  Under the sales tax, value added tax and the flat tax, low-income households will lose because they now pay no income tax and are eligible for a refundable earned income tax credit of up to $3,370.
  Although the flat tax is more progressive than a value added tax, it is more regressive than the current system.
  All three new tax systems would mean huge gains for high-income households, both because their marginal tax rate will fall and because they consume relatively less of their income than do low-income households.
  As a result, if these systems are to raise as much revenue as the current one, the tax burden for the middle class will have to rise.
  Consumption taxes are less regressive when viewed over longer periods of time because income changes from year to year, but these tax systems would raise tax burdens on lower and middle income households over any time frame.
       <p>       Perceptions of fairness may also be difficult to retain when, under the flat tax, some wealthy individuals and large corporations remit no taxes to the government while middle-class workers pay a combined marginal rate above 30 percent on a flat tax, state income tax and payroll taxes.
       <p>       As to simplicity, the flat tax would likely slash compliance costs for many businesses and households.
  But for most, the tax system is not that complicated.
  Most taxpayers do not itemize.
       <p>       And fundamental tax reform will not end the demands for special treatment that made the income tax so complex.
 Ten years from now we may find that what started as simplicity itself has once again become a confused jumble.
  Thus, some simplification is likely, but it is by no means a certain or lasting outcome of tax reform.
  Moreover, many gains in simplification could be made through changes in the income tax.
       <p>       A third concern is how reform would affect different sectors of the economy.
  Removing the mortgage interest deduction and the deductibility of state and local property taxes may have profound effects on housing prices and homeownership, but the results will depend on how interest rates adjust, the sorts of grandfathering rules that are introduced, and other factors.
  How and when health insurance benefits and coverage rates adjust to the elimination of tax-favored treatment of employer-provided health benefits is an open question.
       <p>       Removing the deduction for charitable contributions would reduce overall giving and could affects its composition as well: wealthy donors, for whom the write-off is now worth the most, tend to favor hospitals and universities.
 Low-income donors tend to give to religious institutions.
       <p>       Effects on businesses and investment would be complicated.
  The flat tax would eliminate the corporate income tax and put all businesses on an equal footing, reduce the statutory tax rate applied to business income and make investment write-offs more generous.
  But it would also remove the deductibility of interest payments and of state and local taxes.
  This could induce dramatic changes.
  For example, Hall and Rabushka estimate that General Motors' annual tax liability could rise to $2.
7 billion from $110 million, while Intel's would fall by 75 percent.
 In addition, the effects of a consumption tax on international economic transactions and on the financial sector are potentially far-reaching and need to be examined carefully.
       <p>       <h3>Economic Efficiency and Growth</h3>       <p>       Ultimately, increased economic efficiency and growth must be the key selling point.
 Without a significant gain in living standards, uprooting the entire tax system is probably not worth the risks, redistributions and adjustment costs it would impose.
        <p>       Efficiency gains might arise from five sources: the change of tax base from income to consumption; a more comprehensive tax base, which eliminates the different tax treatment of different assets and forms of income; lower tax rates, which raise the rate of return to working, saving and investing and reduce incentives to avoid taxes; reduced compliance costs; and the taxation of previously existing assets during the transition to a consumption tax (about which, more later).
       <p>       Estimates vary, but efficiency gains could reach as high as 1 percent of lifetime income, or about $200 per person per year.
 But many of these gains are available through reform of the income tax, in particular by making the taxation of capital more uniform.
 And the estimates apply to pure, well-designed consumption taxes.
 Allowing mortgage interest deductions or having a transition would reduce the gains or turn them into losses.
 And other estimates show that even a well-designed consumption tax could generate efficiency losses.
       <p>       As for saving, proponents typically point to two reasons why consumption taxes should raise it.
 First, a revenue-neutral shift to a consumption tax is expected to raise the after-tax rate of return on saving, while keeping total tax payments constant.
 Second, consumption taxes reallocate after-tax resources toward high-saving households.
 Such reasoning is straightforward but incomplete.
 Saving is likely to rise only a little, if it rises at all.
        <p>       Most estimates suggest that long-term saving would rise by between 10 and 20 percent—an increase in private saving to 5.
5 percent of GDP, from its current 5.
0 percent.
       <p>       <ol>       <p>       <li>The U.
S.
 tax system is not a pure income tax.
 It is a hybrid between a consumption and an income tax.
 About half of private saving already receives consumption tax treatment.
 The return on pensions, KEOGHs, 401(k) plans and most IRAs is not taxed untilthey are withdrawn.
 The return on them, then, is the pre-tax rate of return.
 A consumption tax would reduce the pre-tax interest rate, so the rate of return on these forms of saving would fall and voluntary contributions fall as well.
        <p>       <li>Pension coverage may fall.
 The income tax treats pensions as a tax-preferred form of saving.
 A consumption tax treats all saving alike, making it less likely that workers and employers will continue to accept the increasing regulatory and administrative costs of pensions.
 to the extent that workers do not resave all their reduced pension contributions, saving will fall.
       <p>       <li>Under a pure consumption tax, all capital at the time of the transition is (implicitly) taxed again when the capital is consumed.
 But, according to Auerbach and Kotlikoff,  transition rules likely to be added to a consumption tax to avoid this double taxation will reduce the long-term effect on savings by as much as 70-100 percent.
        <p>       </ol>       <p>       <h3>The Transition: Can We Get There From Here?
</h3>       <p>       Even if a consumption tax is the right system for an economy starting from scratch, it may not be the right way to reform an existing system.
        <p>       The main transition issue is the taxation of "old capital," capital assets accumulated earlier out of after-tax income.
 Under the income tax, the principal of those assets would not have been taxed again.
 Although some transitional treatment of old capital is typically thought to be likely, it can be argued that not having a transition — that is, implicitly taxing old capital again under a consumption tax — is consistent with the three main goals of tax reform: efficiency, equity, simplicity.
       <p>       Not having a transition is obviously simpler.
 Less obviously, virtually all of the estimated efficiency gains of a consumption tax come from not allowing a transition.
 Hence, transitional issues are absolutely critical to consideration of a tax reform.
        <p>       Surely, the strongest argument for exempting old capital from taxes is fairness.
 The assets have been taxed once; is it fair to tax them again?
 The answer may not be as obvious as it seems.
 First a one-time implicit tax on existing capital is very progressive.
 The distribution of such capital is more skewed toward wealthy households than is the distribution of overall wealth, which in turn is more skewed than the distribution of income.
 Second, within any age group, wealthy households do most of the saving.
 Since these households will benefit most from eliminating the double taxation on future saving under a consumption tax, it is reasonable that they pay for some of the costs.
 Third, older households tend to have more assets than younger ones, and taxing existing capital places heavier burdens on older generations.
 But those old households have received transfers through Social Security and Medicare that far outreach what they have put in.
 And the vast majority of income and wealth for most elderly households is in the form of earnings (which have not yet been taxed), housing (which receives extraordinarily preferential treatment under the current tax), pension income (which already receives consumption tax treatment), Social Security benefits (which are not taxed under the flat tax) and Medicare benefits (which are not and would not be taxed).
 Relatively few elderly households finance much of their living expenses by other assets, and those that do tend to be very well off.
        <p>       But can one tax old capital?
 Will investors and firms find ways to get around the taxation of old capital in the transition to a consumption tax?
 If the USA tax were to go into effect next January 1, households could remove assets from their accounts on December 31 and redeposit the funds on January 2.
 The tax benefit would be large (for high-income tax payers, on the order of 40 percent of the amount shifted), but there would be no increase in saving.
       <p>       <h3>Look Before You Leap</h3>       <p>       Consumption taxes offer in principle the possibility of improving the efficiency, equity and simplicity of the tax system.
  But these gains are uncertain and depend critically on the details of reform.
  At least some of the gains could be made simply by modifying the existing system.
       <p>       Idealized consumption taxes may always look better than actual income tax systems.
  Once in place, though, they would be subject to the same compromises and pressures as those that affect the income tax.
  They could even lead to a system that is less efficient and less fair than the one we've got.
  The debate over fundamental tax reform may be more like the infamous health care reform debate than advocates of either policy would care to admit.
  Both issues are complicated and  subject to wildly exaggerated claims on both sides.
 They would redistribute substantial amounts of income across various groups, and attack some of society's most cherished institutions.
  Ultimately, this is a constructive debate to have, but it is not for the faint of heart.

<h2>Hearst Newspapers Sponsors 3rd Annual Survey</h2>This study was conducted by American Opinion Research (AOR) in cooperation with the Foundation for American Communications (FACS) and was sponsored by Hearst Newspapers.<p>This is the third State of the Newspaper Industry study, examining attitudes and concerns of newspaper executives across the nation.<p>Questionnaires were mailed to 1,200 newspaper publishers, advertising and marketing directors, and editors selected at random from across the U.S.  A total of 888 executives participated in the study.<p>Complete copies of the report are available by calling or writing:<p>Tony Casale <br>American Opinion Research<br>707 State Road, Suite 102<br>Princeton, NJ 08540<br>609.683.4860<p><b>©1996 American Opinion Research<br>A Company of Integrated Marketing Services, Inc.<br>American Opinion Research, Inc.<br>Environmental Research Associates Infocus, Inc.</b>

<font size=+4><b>On-Line: Will it Hurt or Help Newspapers?</b></font><p>
American newspaper executives are evenly divided about the impact on-line services will have on traditional newspaper products.<p>
Forty-five percent say on-line services will hurt newspapers in the long term and 44 percent say it will help them.<p>
There is little disagreement, however, about the importance of on-line services in the future. Almost 80 percent of newspaper executives -- publishers, advertising and marketing directors and editors -- say on-line services will be an important factor in the communications industry:<p><ul>
<li> 38 percent say it will be an important force<p>
<li> 39 percent say on-line services and the Internet will be a truly revolutionary force.</ul><p>
Indeed, newspaper executives see on-line services affecting almost all phases of their business. The use of the Internet as a news-gathering tool has grown dramatically over the past year. And, while marketing executives see on-line services as a serious competitor for advertising in the years ahead -- perhaps THE most serious competitor -- they also see ways in which on-line can help newspapers.<p>
Most of all, many can't wait to jump on board.<p>

<h2>Going On-Line</h2><p>
While there are still many questions about on-line services -- including how to make them profitable -- most newspapers don't plan to be left behind; 43 percent say they currently have some presence on-line. Only 10 percent of these newspapers say, however, they're currently making a profit on these projects.<p>
Still, most other newspapers are planning to go on-line.  <p>
If their plans are correct, by next year at this time eight in 10 daily newspapers will have some kind of on-line service.  <p>
Why then are so many newspapers jumping on board?<p>
Most are looking to the future. <p>

<h2>Why Will Newspapers Be In Worse Shape?</h2><p>
<p>
Increased competition will dramatically affect the health of the newspaper industry, executives say; particularly competition from a new source, the Internet.<p>

<h2>Readership Still Top Issue</h2><p>
Readership remains the top problem facing the newspaper industry.<p>
Five of the top six issues rated by newspaper executives (shown in the following table) are related to readership and content, including increased competition for readers' time.<p>
Concern about the growth of the Internet, while still ranked lowest by newspaper executives, increased in the past year by more than 50 percent, the largest increase for any issue. <p>
<br>
<img src="../../facsnet_grafix/splash/state5.gif"><p><br>
While publishers and advertising directors are more concerned than editors about increased competition for advertising dollars, they agree that declining readership is just as vital an issue. There's good reason for this. Research conducted by American Opinion Research consistently shows that penetration, the percentage of adults in its market a newspaper reaches, is the No. 1 priority of advertisers when allocating their budgets.<p>
Advertising and marketing directors are significantly more concerned than editors about competition from the Internet.<p>
<a name="rating">
<p>
<h2>Rating Editorial Quality</h2><p>
<p>
Nine out of 10 newspaper executives rate the editorial quality of their newspapers as "excellent" or good," the same as in 1995. However, fewer than 1 in 5 say their editorial is  "excellent". This is slightly lower than last year and lower than we see in other industries when  executives are asked to rate the quality of their services.<p>

<h2>Advertising Issues</h2><p>
Newspaper executives are clearly concerned about the growing competition for advertising dollars.  Where is this competition coming from?<p>
Executives were asked to cite their single greatest competitor today, and forecast what it will be five years from now. If this prediction holds true, on-line services would be newspapers' single biggest competitor in 10 years.<p>
<br>
 <img src="../../facsnet_grafix/splash/state6.gif"> <br><br>
<a name="campaign">
<p>
<h2>1996 Presidential Campaign: "We're not Doing A Great Job"</h2><p>
<p>
How are the news media covering the 1996 presidential campaign?<p>
<p>
Not very well according to the people who run the nation's newspapers.<p>
<p>
Fewer than 1 in 10 American newspaper executives feel the media is doing an excellent job of covering the campaign. And, these executives say their own newspapers aren't doing any better.<p>
<p>Other studies have looked at how voters rate the media. This is the first to look at how newspapers rate themselves.<p><br>
<img src="../../facsnet_grafix/splash/state7.gif"> <br><br>
<p>
The main reasons executives give for poor coverage: 41 percent say the media is not covering national issues important in the campaign. Other major problems:<p>
<p><ul>
<li>	Too much focus on the "horse race;"  who's ahead in  the polls, cited by 25 percent<p>
<li>	Too little analysis of campaign issues, 13 percent<p>
<li>	Media decides who are the "major candidates" and who are the minor ones, 9 percent<p>
<li>	Not enough analysis of candidate performance, 8 percent<p>
<li>	Too much emphasis on "event"  coverage, 8 percent<p>
</ul><p>
Asked to rate campaign coverage generally on a scale ranging from 10 to 1 (with 10 being excellent and 1 very poor), newspaper executives rate coverage between 5 and 6 -- fairly mediocre ratings. They gave their own newspapers about the same rating.<p><br>
<img src="../../facsnet_grafix/splash/state8.gif"> <br><br>
<p>
More than eight in 10 (83 percent) say the media focuses too much on the "horse race" aspects of the campaign compared with 1 percent who say it focuses too much on issues.<p>

<H1>Redefining Government</H1>
<H2>What Responsible Journalists Need to Know and How FACS Can Help Them Learn it</H2>

<P><STRONG>By Frank C. Wykoff</STRONG>

<P><i>Frank C. Wykoff is the Elden Smith Professor of Economics at Pomona College and 
the Claremont Graduate School. He specializes in macroeconomics, mathematical economics, 
growth, capital formation, productivity and econometrics. His most recent book is 
<I>Understanding Economics Today</I>, written with Gary Walton, is in its fifth edition. Professor 
Wykoff is chief economist and adademic dean of FACS and directs the FACS Institute on 
Economics for Journalists. He has taught thousands of journalists at FACS conferences.</i>

<P>Professional journalists gear up quickly to report a scandal, a political event, a crime or a 
disaster. Coverage of the economy, business, and government budgets can be far more difficult. 
Reporting the economic story well without knowing economics is like covering the French 
parliament without knowing French. Economics is a subtle and complex subject that bridges 
ideas from political science, philosophy, statistics, mathematics and anthropology and exploits 
literary skills and historical knowledge.
<P>In addition to economic stories, today's journalists are often expected to cover air pollution, 
solid waste disposal, toxic substances and dozens of other highly technical scientific issues. 
Unless they have learned about the science involved, general interest reporters and their editors 
cannot make wise coverage choices or explain in plain language information based on technical 
understanding.
<P>For two decades, FACS (Foundation for American Communications) has helped thousands 
of professional journalists to improve their coverage of issues in economics, science and the 
environment. Experience and evidence tell us that these FACS programs have been of significant 
help in raising journalists' level of understanding. In addition, FACS now provides FACSNET, an 
internet service designed especially to help journalists find information and sources as they cover 
economic and scientific stories.
<H2>Redefining Government</H2>
<P>FACS expects that over the next several year's journalists will give much of their attention to 
stories dealing with the concept sometimes referred to as devolution of government. The central 
governments of all advanced industrial societies will attempt to reduce their commitments and 
responsibilities in a variety of areas. The reduction will have significant financial and 
organizational implications for state, regional and local governments, for the private business 
sector and for individual families. Budgets will be squeezed. New organizational arrangements 
will be needed. Massive dislocations appear imminent. 
<P>Some of these changes have begun. Clouds on the horizon indicating the storm to come:
<UL><LI>The 1996 welfare reform legislation<LI>Proposals in 1994 and 1996 to alter 
Medicare<LI>Proposals to privatize and modernize various aspects of Social Security</UL>
<P>Do journalists have the perspective, background and insights to prepare their readers, 
listeners and viewers for the massive institutional changes that will be occurring over the next 50 
years? FACS intends to help them gain that knowledge. To do so is our mission, our obligation 
and our skill.
<P>FACS is uniquely experienced, staffed and positioned to provide the educational programs 
and internet resources needed by the journalism profession to prepare to cover this burgeoning 
story. The foundation's reputation among journalists is well established as an honest provider of 
balanced, nonpartisan analysis of issues. FACS has proved that it can provide tools, analysis and 
data that will convert short news reports into rich, clear and detailed presentations of facts with 
adequate perspective and depth. FACS can also provide journalists with sources, 
<I>NewsBackgrounders</I>, glossary information, primers, guides and access to sources.
<H2>A Core Issue for the Next Fifty Years</H2>
<P>What is the appropriate relationship between the individual and the state? This question was 
at the philosophical core of the great ideological battles of the 20th Century. Many have argued 
that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War brought to an end this debate, 
settling the question in favor of Democratic capitalism. What though, is the nature of the system 
that won, this dual system of democracy and capitalism? How will it evolve?
<P>The appropriate relation between the individual and the state is by no means decided. The 
modern capitalist welfare state is quite different from Adam Smith's 18th Century marketplace.
<UL><LI>Which decisions are made by the individual and which are left to the state?<LI>Who 
now owns the means of production and, from the point of view of control, what does that 
ownership entail?<LI> As complex a question as that about the role of the state versus the role of 
the individual is this one: What level of "state" is appropriate for which set of activities?<LI> 
Federal, state, regional, county, city; all govern, but what is the right balance?</UL>
<P>One thing is certain. The U.S. federal government cannot continue to function along the path 
it is traveling. The same may be said of the governments of virtually all of the advanced industrial 
economies of Europe and Asia. If for no other reason, the welfare state must change and it must 
adapt to the reality that it is running out of money. There is a limit to the tax rates the state can 
impose on a voluntary private sector. At some point, the state must stop growing relative to the 
private economy. Otherwise, incentives to produce are destroyed and the market economy fails 
to provide adequate revenue to support the welfare state. We may be coming to the end of the 
20th Century's trend of government growing in size and concentration. There are five major 
indicators.
<H3>1. <U>Productivity Slowdown</U></H3>
<P>There is a significant and widespread slowdown in the growth rate of labor productivity. Labor 
productivity (output per worker hour) has slowed dramatically in the U.S., falling from three 
percent to less than one percent per year, a collapse of nearly 300 percent. Germany, France, 
the United Kingdom and Japan also have records of slower productivity growth. How does the 
public sector respond to such a shift in circumstances?
<P>The U.S. federal government's response to the slowdown has been to protect and insulate 
various groups and individuals from the consequences of the slowdown. To provide that 
protection, the federal government has lowered tax rates and burdens on some while raising 
expenditures and transfer payments in support of others. That means unprecedented increases 
in social spending without a commensurate increase in revenue sources. The result is sustained 
fiscal crisis. Structural budget deficits in the past 15 years have grown four fold.
<P>Projections tell us that massive changes in the way our national government functions will be 
essential, and soon. Federal spending on health care alone, under existing rules, will multiply so 
fast that it will be, by far, the largest non-interest item in the budget, 20 times the size of the 
defense budget. Changes are inevitable in Social Security, health care financing, income security 
and other so-called mandates. Even if we could solve these economic problems relatively easily 
by more economic growth or by modest program tinkering, other forces suggest significant non-
marginal changes in the nature of the public sector. 
<H3>2. <U>End of The Cold War</U></H3>
<P>The end of the Cold War was an enormous force for change. The East-West ideological fight 
drove an enormous proportion of GDP for more than thirty years. The arms race fostered a 
strategic system that required more than $7 trillion in the 1980s alone. Now, however, defense 
spending - the largest single component in the federal budget in the 1980s - continues to fall in 
real dollars and relative to GDP. Thus, there is diminished international strategic need for a 
strong and large central government to provide protection against foreign aggression. The federal 
government has lost one of its basic justifications for expansion.
<H3>3. <U>Lower Trade Barriers</U></H3>
<P>A series of decisions in the post-World War Two era has lead to a substantial decline in 
tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers among industrial nations. International competition among 
governments will force significant changes in the operation of the U.S. federal government and of 
the state and local governments.
<H3>4. <U>Government Redefined</U></H3>
<P>The end of ideological conflict between fascism, communism and democratic capitalism 
speaks against the need for a strong and expensive central federal government. Citizens no 
longer feel the need for protection against another system. The hiatus in ideological conflict frees 
public dialogue to seriously contemplate revision of the role of the federal government. 
Devolution, or redefining, of government and new talk of federalism has arisen as the Cold War 
ended.
<H3>5. <U>Technological Change</U></H3>
<P>Technology is forcing changes within and among institutions. If information is power, if 
politics is the exercise of power, then political power is devolving as information becomes more 
accessible through telecommunications, computers and other manifestations of modern 
technology.
<P>Events will force changes in the roles of the state and in the roles of different levels of the 
state. While the initial reaction to the labor productivity slowdown was to try to insulate 
constituents against its negative consequences, governments eventually have to downsize just 
as the private sector has had to. The public sector has a hard time reducing its size. It is not clear 
how it will do so. This raises a host of new critical questions.
<H2>Questions for those covering the Public Sector</H2>
<UL><LI>How much of its traditional functions will the federal government shift down to the 
states and local governments?<LI>Which functions will the federal government try to mandate 
onto the private sector? Health care is the most obvious example of a substantial mandate 
already imposed on the private sector by the federal government. How much more of this will be 
done? Perhaps even more troubling to some is whether some functions that the federal 
government can no longer afford will simply cease to take place at all. What will fall between the 
cracks?<LI>A recent federal decision to end welfare as we know it may illustrate this last 
outcome. Once off the welfare roles, what will happen to families unable to earn adequate 
income from viable work?<LI>Will such shifting of government responsibility be coherent, 
following an understandable pattern, or will it be chaotic and reflect forces largely beyond our 
understanding and power?</UL>
<P>Much of the electorate's information and comprehension of these issues will have to do with 
how well journalists understand the issues and cover them for their audiences, the voters.
<UL>
<LI>How will various public and private institutions respond to downsizing of the federal 
government?
<LI>Will states take up the slack in the abolition of federal welfare programs?
<LI>Who will pay when Medicare becomes too expensive for the federal government?
<LI>Will different states respond in different ways, generating a variety of social experiments from which we can all learn?
<LI>Will some problems be so difficult that no entity but the federal government 
can take them on?
<LI>If so, then how will individuals and families react to the loss of a safety 
net?
</UL>
<P>
As the nation faces these complex changes in its institutions, what will journalists contribute? 
In a free and open democracy, and in a capitalist economy, the press plays a vital role. Economic 
agents need reliable, unbiased information in order to make sound personal and business 
decisions. Similarly, the electorate must be well informed for decisions to be made by the body 
politic. They need to understand their options and to have the consequences of those options 
fully and clearly illuminated. Are American journalists on all levels up to the task of carrying out 
their ideal function in the democracy? Are they aware of the changes already underway in 
government and our major institutions? Based on their general complacency during the 1996 
presidential election campaign, there is cause for concern. 
<P>With adequate financial resources, FACS can provide the tools that journalists need to help 
them fulfill their indispensable role. During an era of massive change, it is crucial that the 
American media achieve their potential as providers of information for citizens as voters, 
consumers and producers who must make choices about the critical issues they face as 
individuals and a nation.

<H2>FACS Conferences Relevant to Redefining Government</H2>
<B>Redefining Government: <U>Reporting the Coming Crisis in State and Local 
Finance</U></B><BR>
February 7-9, 1997<BR>Radisson Suite Hotel at River Ridge<BR>Oxnard, CA

<P>Under chronic financial pressures, the Congress has given greater shares of fiscal 
responsibility to state, regional and local governments. The process is sometimes called 
“devolution.” Each of the new burdens implies complex questions that journalists must know how 
to ask, whether they cover Capitol Hill, city hall, or anything in between. Citizens depend on newspeople to help them understand local economic problems and the role of local government in solving those problems. 
This program about the shifting economic ground of government provides journalists with background knowledge and context they need to understand new trends and pressures.

<P>Call Christina Gardner, FACS manager of programs, at (213) 851-7372 for more information 
or to register for this conference now.

<H2>Introduction to the 3rd Edition</H2>
<HR>

<P>
This latest edition of <I>Computer Assisted Research: A Guide
to Tapping Online Information </I>continues with the mission of
the past two: to provide an overview of the world of online research
for journalists. When the first edition was written in the summer
of 1992, the Internet was not even mentioned. Just three years
later, the retrieval of information and networking with people
made possible through the Internet has revolutionized news reporting
and research. The incredible growth and value of Internet accessible
information requires additional emphasis on this resource in the
Guide. You'll see a greatly expanded section on Internet-accessible
resources.
<P>
The way some of the &quot;traditional&quot; database services
have changed and adapted to the Interneted world are reflected
by the addition of Website addresses in the <A HREF="cardirec.htm">Directory of Online Services </A>.
The number of sales, mergers, and divorces in the information
industry has rendered the second edition's directory virtually
useless. Keeping up with the fast changing information marketplace
continues to be a challenge. David Shedden, The Poynter Institute's
researcher, has been meticulous in his tracking of those changes,
which are reflected in the new directory.
<P>
So many options are possible for accessing information, we have
added a new section on &quot;<A HREF="carconsu.htm">Information Consumerism </A>&quot;
to provide tips for getting the best bang for your data buck.
And to help you figure out what types of information you need
the most, take the &quot;<A HREF="carasse.htm">Information Needs Assessment. </A>&quot;
<P>
Since the Guide has found a niche as a training aid in newsrooms
and as a teaching text in universities, sample questions or exercises
have been added to give a sense of the practical application of
the resource.
<P>
In addition to the new features, the form of the Guide has changed.
The three-ring binder format, divided into five sections (&quot;Introduction
to Computer Assisted Research,&quot; &quot;Types of Information
Resources,&quot; &quot;The Internet,&quot; &quot;News Organizations
Online,&quot; and &quot;Checklists and Directories&quot;) allows
us to make more frequent updates to the directory. Use your binder,
too, to gather tipsheets and sources lists you might get at conventions
or seminars.
<P>
The final change with this edition was that it was published first
electronically on <A HREF="http://www.poynter.org/poynter/">Poynter Online </A>and
then went to paper (a disc version with hyper-links is also available).
The linking of documents possible with the World Wide Web made
the compilation of material for this edition more fun, and it
is difficult to get back to a linear format after working with
links. But, since the Guide is intended as a handy overview and
an introduction to the vast array of information resources for
the uninitiated, paper will continue to be our predominant medium.
So no matter which version you are using - paper or electronic
- I hope you enjoy this tour through the world of information
and the discussion of applications in reporting. Your suggestions
for additions or editions would be appreciated. When the next
new information utility comes around (probably intelligent search
agents), look for the next new edition. In the meantime, changes
and updates to the Guide's sections will be posted on our web
site, <A HREF="http://www.poynter.org/poynter/">Poynter Online</A>:
look for announcements of changed pages at <A HREF="http://www.poynter.org/poynter/chome.html">http://www.poynter.org/poynter/chome.html</A>.

<H2>Computer Assisted Journalism:  The Four Rs of CAJ</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Computers have been changing the way journalists do their jobs
ever since newpaper newsrooms threw out their Royale typewriters
and switched to cold type production systems, and television newsrooms
went from tape splicing to digital editing. This change to computer
assisted production quickly and dramatically altered the way news
is delivered.
<P>
The impact the computer has had on news-gathering has been more
subtle, but no less dramatic.
<P>
&quot;Computer Assisted Journalism&quot; is the umbrella term
for the use of computers in news-gathering. This term can be daunting
because so many different aspects of the journalist's job are
lumped into this term. Often, people hearing the term think immediately
of expensive equipment, complicated programs, and sophisticated
analyses. In fact, CAJ can be broken down into four Rs: Reporting,
Research, Reference, and Rendezvous. Each of these four functions
is critical to news gathering. Each can be accomplished without
the assistance of a computer, but the use of a computer can speed
up, simplify, and / or expand the range of the work. Here's a
quick look at each of these functions, and how the computer assists:
<H4><B>Computer Assisted Reporting</B></H4>

<P>
<I>(Definition of reporting: to announce or relate the result
of a special search, examination, or investigation.)</I> Computers
can help reporters conduct these special examinations through
use of spreadsheet programs for complex calculations, statistical
programs for the analysis of large datasets, and database software
to build original collections of information. The data that result
from using these computer applications informs the reporting,
spots trends, and provides independent verification of information.
<H4><B>Computer Assisted Research</B></H4>

<P>
Research, like reporting, requires a special search or investigation.
The distinction comes from the sources used by each. Generally,
reporting relies on primary sources (<I>firsthand, independent,
original</I>), such as interviews, observation or self-conducted
computer analyses. Research uses secondary sources (<I>made up
of elements derived from something else</I>) as the material being
investigated. Together, reporting and research help form a complete
news report. Databases consisting of secondary sources such as
reports, articles, and studies can be used in computer assisted
research.
<H4><B>Computer Assisted Reference</B></H4>

<P>
<I>(Definition of reference:</I> <I>consultation of sources of
information) </I>Reference works, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias,
gazeteers, almanacs and glossaries, are available for use on the
<A HREF="carready.htm">Internet </A>and through <A HREF="carcdrom.htm">CD-ROMs </A>.
These virtual reference shelves provide handy and quick access
for quick fact-checking, spellings, and definitions.
<H4><B>Computer Assisted Rendevous</B> </H4>

<P>
<I>(Definition of rendevous: a place to which people customarily
come in numbers</I>) The &quot;virtual communities&quot; of the
wired world are electronic rendevous spots for journalists. The
ability to hang out, listen in, seek advice and tap into other
people's networks of sources is the newest and, perhaps, most
exciting aspect of computer assisted journalism. These areas include
<A HREF="carlists.htm">listservs </A>and <A HREF="carnewsg.htm">newsgroups. </A>
<P>
Each of these four aspects of computer assisted journalism require
different software, skills, and knowledge. Some are easier to
learn than others. Some are more expensive than others. Some are
more useful for certain types of reporting than others. Some are
used at different stages of reporting than others. All are important
parts of your work as a journalist.
<P>
If you are looking for more detail on the uses of computers for
analyzing large datasets, crunching numbers with spreadsheets
and creating original databases, there are some great books about
<A HREF="carcarbi.htm">computer assisted reporting </A>. But those
techniques won't be covered in this guide.
<P>
If you are looking for an overview of the other three Rs of CAJ,
(Research, Reference, Rendevous) this is the guide for you! Read
on for information on the use of the computer to tap into databases,
reference works, and to connect with people who can help you with
researching and writing full, accurate, balanced. and interesting
news stories. <HR>

<H2>USES OF ONLINE INFORMATION</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Before we look at each of the information resource types, and
discuss the pros and cons of using them, we need to discuss how
to use online information at different stages of reporting. The
following list indicates the types of resources that would be
most helpful at various stages of reporting. <HR>

<H3>Story Idea</H3>

<P>
You need to keep your ear to the ground, find out what the &quot;people
in the know&quot; know, spot trends <I>before</I> they happen.
Otherwise, you'll just be following everyone else's leads. Here
are some techniques for keeping up with your beat and spotting
fresh leads.
<UL>
<LI>Join a <A HREF="carlists.htm">listserv </A>related to your
beat.
<LI>Scan <A HREF="carbbs.htm">bulletin board </A>message areas.
<LI>Monitor alternative sources of information on the <A HREF="carinter.htm">Internet </A>.
<LI>Set up a <A HREF="carfilte.htm">news filter </A>to get the
latest news on a topic.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>Begin Reporting</H3>

<P>
You need to get up to speed on the topic you will be reporting
on, find out background information, do some reconnaissance on
the coverage of that topic in other media, and locate people who
can give you different perspectives. Try some of these resources
to get information, locate sources and prepare for interviews.
<UL>
<LI>Check newspaper and magazine articles in <A HREF="cardbs.htm">commercial database services </A>.
<LI>Find <A HREF="carwww.htm">World Wide Web </A>sites with articles
or background material.
<LI>Post requests to <A HREF="carnewsg.htm">newsgroups </A>looking
for people with certain backgrounds or experiences.
<LI>Locate government reports and statistics in <A HREF="cargophe.htm">gopher </A>holes
and <A HREF="carwww.htm">World Wide Web </A>pages.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>During Reporting</H3>

<P>
You need to check the &quot;facts&quot; you get from interviewees,
find and qualify the sources you are talking with, and follow
up on angles uncovered during reporting.
<UL>
<LI>Use <A HREF="carready.htm">ready reference </A>sources to
check spellings, facts, statistics.
<LI>Use <A HREF="carpeopl.htm">people finders and public records </A>to
locate sources and background them.
<LI>Use <A HREF="cargovdo.htm">government documents </A>to check
statistics given by sources.
<LI>Qualify sources' expertise through checks of published material
on <A HREF="cardbs.htm">commercial database services </A>.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>During Writing</H3>

<P>
You need to find &quot;fun facts&quot;, quotes, and story embellishments
to brighten your writing, locate experts who can help interpret
what you've found in reporting, and ensure you've kept up with
the latest developments in the story you're covering.
<UL>
<LI>Find quotes in <A HREF="cardbs.htm">commercial database services </A>.
<LI>Get &quot;fun facts&quot; from <A HREF="carready.htm">ready reference </A>sources.

<H2>THE ANSWER'S HERE. WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?</H2>
<HR>

<H4>&quot;Computers are useless, they can only give you answers.&quot;
Pablo Picasso</H4>
<HR>

<P>
Most people think the ability to do good research requires only
good equipment, appropriate software, access to the services,
and knowledge of how to use the resources. Actually, the most
important requirement for research is a good, clear question.
Careful consideration of what you are looking for and what you
are trying to get done is mandatory for effective use of online
resources. A clear question will describe both the topic of the
search and the information need you are trying to fulfill.
<P>
Once a question has been clearly formulated, select the information
resource you need to answer the question. With so many options
available, it is essential to carefully consider the services
to decide which would best serve your purposes.
<P>
After you select a service for your research quest, you must think
through the strategy you will take to find the information from
the service.
<P>
Thinking through the &quot;who, what, when, where, why and hows&quot;
at each critical stage in the research process will help you stay
focused on your information need, utilize the best resource, and
develop an effective search strategy. Use these guidelines for
thinking through each step:

<H2>COMMERCIAL DATABASE SERVICES</H2>
<HR>

<P>
The first shots of the information revolution came from commercial
database services. Defined as &quot;a collection of data or body
of information that is organized for rapid retrieval via a computer,&quot;
databases have been the foundation of computer assisted research
since the late 1970s. The proliferation of online collections
of data is best illustrated by charting the <A HREF="carchart.htm">numbers of databases </A>(need
Netscape browser) profiled by <A HREF="cargale.htm">Gale's Directory of Online Databases. </A>
<P>
Commercial database services act as agents for the individual
databases developed by database producers (such as government
agencies, newspapers, magazines, associations). They are the vendors
of the data to the public, offering computer space, search software,
marketing and access in exchange for part of the revenue generated
by people using the database.
<P>
However, as more database producers host their own Internet sites,
bulletin board services or CD-ROM products, their reliance on
the database vendor for distribution and support is lessening.
The golden age of commercial database services just might be on
the wane.
<P>
But for now, commercial database services continue to be a major
information resource for journalists. Even though many databases
that had only been available only in commercial services are now
found on the Internet, the commercial version is often more comprehensive,
covers a greater range of years, and is more rigorously compiled
(for content and structure) than the information found on Internet
sites. As the number of options for accessing a given set of data
grows, the need for careful shopping increases.
<P>
The biggest advantage of these large commercial database services
continues to be their allowing &quot;one-stop shopping&quot;.
In a single search, a wide range of databases can be checked,
offering a variety of viewpoints, documents and sources. Think
of commercial database services as information malls. Each boutique
offers different kinds of information products from different
information producers.
<P>
Here are the types of information available on commercial database
services, and how they can be used in newsroom research and reporting.
Individual databases consist of one or more of the following types
of information:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="carbiba.htm">Bibliographies and abstracts </A>
<LI><A HREF="cartrans.htm">Articles and transcripts </A>
<LI><A HREF="carbooks.htm">Books and directories </A>
<LI><A HREF="cargovdo.htm">Government documents </A>
<LI><A HREF="carpeopl.htm">People finders and public records</A>

<LI><A HREF="carart.htm">Photos, graphics, and art </A>
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Uses of commercial database services</B></H4>

<P>
Finding background articles from newspapers and magazines, getting
up to speed on a topic, finding how others have covered a topic,
seeing if a topic has been &quot;over-covered&quot; or is fresh
when pitching story ideas, locating people who can talk about
a topic (because they have written about it or have been quoted),
getting a national or international perspective on a local interest
story.<HR>

<H4><B>Cautions for using commercial database services</B></H4>

<P>
You must be knowledgeable about how the database was compiled
and how the search engine works, otherwise searches can be very
expensive or overwhelming amounts of information will be retrieved.
These services are generally designed for use by information professionals,
if you have one available to you, this is where their expertise
should be used. For other hints for effective and efficient use
of online searching, see the <A HREF="carmoney.htm">Tips for Saving Time and Money Online</A>
chapter.<HR>

<H4><B>Use requirements</B></H4>

<P>
In addition to a computer and modem or <A HREF="cartelne.htm">telnet </A>capabilities,
you must subscribe to the database service that provides access
to the database. See the <A HREF="cardirec.htm">Directory of Database Services </A>for
information on subscribing to services.<HR>

<H4><B>Cost</B></H4>

<P>
This varies depending on the database service and, sometimes,
on the database within the service. Most vendors have various
pricing options available. Careful shopping, and knowledgeable
searching will help keep the cost of these high-end services in
check.<HR>

<H2>BULLETIN BOARD SERVICES</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Cliched as it is, the information superhighway analogy works well
when talking about bulletin board services (BBSs). Think of bulletin
board services as the mom and pop shops that are all too often
driven past quickly on the way to the Stuckey's (the commercial
bulletin board services). If you took the time to stop you might
find some real information treasures and bargains. They may be
a bit harder to get to, but they are often worth the extra effort.
<P>
With the development of the <A HREF="carwww.htm">world wide web </A>as
an easy and inexpensive publishing platform, bulletin board services
may be a dying breed. On the other hand, the use of <A HREF="cartelne.htm">telnet </A>links
to bulletin boards have made them more easily accessed than having
to dial a phone number for each. Whatever their future might be,
bulletin board services are an important evolutionary step in
the development of information utilities.
<P>
First developed as a way to provide online product support to
hardware and software buyers, bulletin boards started to become
popular computer hobbyist services and evolved into an important
medium for associations and groups wanting to get information
out.
<P>
Bulletin boards are systems set up on a computer that is running
bulletin board software. The software allows callers to dial into
the bulletin board and do a number of things. These functions
are referred to differently on different boards, but basically
they include the following:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="caremail.htm">Electronic mail </A>: In the bbs, e-mail
is sometimes restricted just to other people on the bbs. Sometimes,
however it can be sent to any e-mail address.
<LI><B>Messages: </B>Equivalent to Internet <A HREF="carnewsg.htm">news groups </A>,
these are public messages posted in the boards' message areas
that are available for reading and comment by anyone who signs
on. This is where the &quot;bulletin board&quot; analogy comes
from.
<LI><B>Libraries: </B>Areas on the service where people upload
articles, lists, documents, photos, or software which others can
download and use.
<LI><B>Conferences: </B>People calling into the board can arrange
to be on at the same time for &quot;real-time&quot; discussion
of a topic.
</UL>

<P>
There is a BBS systems operator (or &quot;sysop&quot;), usually
the person who has the bulletin board software running on their
computer, but sometimes a volunteer who helps monitor the messages,
post items in the library, and provide support and guidance to
users.
<P>
After registering for membership (usually your name, address and
voice phone number are requested), you can go into the BBS. While
on a bulletin board, you can read messages and if there is one
you'd like to reply to, you can post a response. There is usually
a way to tell who else is on the board at the same time you are.
If there is, you can send a &quot;live&quot; message to them and
have an online conversation. You can go into the libraries, do
a search on a keyword assigned to the articles and locate information.
Either read the file online or download it to your computer to
read later.<HR>

<H4><B>TYPES OF BULLETIN BOARD SERVICES</B></H4>

<P>
Bulletin board services can differ in a number of ways, beyond
just the content they make available. Some require preapplication
to access the board; some provide online registration. Some cost
only the phone call charge; others have additional fees for longer
access to the board or access to particular file areas. Some can
be accessed through telnet, necessitating internet connectivity,
others can only be accessed through a telephone call to the computer
which requires the use of a modem, phone line and communications
software.
<P>
Just who makes these bulletin board services differs, too:
<H4><B>SOLO SHOPS </B></H4>

<P>
Run by individuals on their home computers. Usually have large
libraries of shareware (software that is free to use), games,
chat areas (often the online equivalent of CB radio). Many solo
shops provide links to other boards through &quot;echomail&quot;
networking. This allows you to call a local board and read messages
that have been posted to boards all over the world.
<H4><B>CORPORATE </B></H4>

<P>
Corporations have been moving rapidly to the world wide web as
their information distribution platform, but many maintain their
bbs' for users not yet on the internet.
<H4><B>PUBLICATIONS </B></H4>

<P>
Many newspapers and magazines are venturing into new media projects
with bulletin board services. Some of the earliest online newspapers
continue to operate with bulletin board services, some with software
with as sophisticated a look as the <A HREF="carhybri.htm">hybrid services - commercial bulletin boards. </A>For
more on news organizations' online projects click to <A HREF="carenews.htm">electronic news </A>.
<H4><B>ASSOCIATIONS </B></H4>

<P>
Associations create bulletin boards to allow members and other
interested people access to notices, files of information and
message boards on topics of interest.
<H4><B>GOVERNMENT </B></H4>

<P>
Government agencies were early and enthusiastic adopters of bbs
technology for the posting of press releases, updates of regularly
issued statistical information and other documents. Although many
have migrated to the world wide web for posting of information,
the agency bulletin board has the advantage of message areas and
monitoring of mail by agency employees. For more information on
what local, state, national and international agencies are doing
with electronic distribution of information click to <A HREF="cargovdo.htm">government documents. </A>
<HR>

<H4><B>BULLETIN BOARD SERVICES FOR BEATS </B></H4>

<P>
Mark Leff, reporter at CNN, has been the keeper of a comprehensive
list of bulletin boards with content that would help beat reporters.
He has organized his list into helpful categories and then provides
full information in an area code arranged listing. Download the
list, and then send a message of thanks to Mark. The most current
version of the list is always found at the <A HREF="http://town.hall.org/places/spj/spj.html">Society for Professional Journalist's </A>ftp
site (file name: tvbd0595.zip for the most recent).
<P>
One of the many features that makes Boardwatch (see listing below)
the key magazine for BBSing is their listing of keepers of bbs
lists. On it is the numbers of bulletin board services where people
have posted listings of bulletin boards in particular areas or
topics. Here is a sampling of the list of list keepers of beats:

</B></H4>

<P>
<B>PRO:</B> Instead of &quot;one to one&quot; communication (as
with a telephone), you get &quot;one to many&quot;. <BR>
<B>CON: </B>You also get &quot;many to one&quot;. You can get
inundated with messages.
<P>
<B>PRO: </B>Access is inexpensive, often free, certainly less
expensive than commercial databases.<BR>
<B>CON: </B>But the people time it takes to wander around, looking
for useful information can cost.
<P>
<B>PRO: </B>Equipment necessary to use bulletin boards effectively
is less expensive than full Internet access, web-browsing needs.
<BR>
<B>CON: </B>But the access is usually slower, and the software
a bit less sophisticated.
<P>
<B>PRO: </B>Virtually limitless in the topics covered.<BR>
<B>CON: </B>And critical that you are aware who is doing the covering,
you must learn about who is sponsoring the site or bbs.
<P>
<B>PRO: </B>It is serendipitous. You never know what you'll find.
<BR>
<B>CON: </B>It can be frustrating. You never know if you'll find
anything.
<P>
<B>PRO: </B>It's fun. You can make some great connections, find
interesting documents, and solicit comments from people you might
never find otherwise.<BR>
<B>CON: </B>It's fun. You want to do it more and more and eventually
forget why you were out there in the first place. Deadline? What
deadline!<HR>

<H2>COMMERCIAL INFORMATION SERVICES</H2>
<HR>

<P>
What do you get when you take the features of a bulletin board
service (messages, forums, archives), add access to some large
commercial databases, and throw in access to the Internet? The
answer is: a commercial information service. These hybrids services
(ie: CompuServe, America Online, Prodigy, eWorld, Interchange,
Microsoft Network) were designed for the home information consumer
and have become a fast growing segment of the commercial information
marketplace.
<P>
In the early rush towards publishing <A HREF="carenews.htm">electronic editions </A>,
many newspapers and magazines partnered with these commercial
information services. You can <A HREF="http://www.mediainfo.com/edpub/e-papers.home.page.html">find e-ditions </A>of
the San Jose Mercury News, Atlanta Journal Constitution, Florida
Today, The Seattle Times, and 40 other newspapers on commercial
information services.  
<P>
You will find a great listing of electronic newspapers on the
Editor &amp; Publisher site, compiled and maintained by Steve
Outings.  The list, organized by where you can find them:  by
service, on BBSes, on the Web, and by state or country, can be
found at:  <A HREF="http://www.mediainfo.com/edpub/e-papers.home.page.html">http://www.mediainfo.com/edpub/e-papers.home.page.html</A>.
<P>
Commercial information services have several main uses for journalists
and researchers:<HR>

<H4><B>Message Areas / Forums:</B></H4>

<P>
Just as with the <A HREF="carbbs.htm">bulletin board services </A>,
these commercial information services host special topic interest
groups. Ranging from education to parenting to medical topics
to leisure activities, these forum areas allow people to post
and respond to messages from other members of the forum. These
are closed forums in that only subscribers to the information
service have access, the messages are not distributed throughout
the Internet like <A HREF="carnewsg.htm">newsgroup </A>messages.
<P>
Some of the forums also contain archives of files, strings of
messages on important topics and documents that never make it
into mainstream commercial databases.
<P>
If you subscribe to one of these commercial information services,
use the finder function in the service to locate a few areas where
topics of interest in your reporting are being discussed.
<H4><B>Gateway to Commercial Database Services:</B></H4>

<P>
IQuest, a service available through CompuServe, allows non-subscribers
to retrieve articles from the big commercial database services.
In a simple menu interface, IQuest takes your request and translates
it into the search syntax required by the commercial database.
They charge a premium for the searching, but if you really need
information from a file available only on a large vendor's service,
this can be a reasonable option.
<H4><B>Databases: </B></H4>

<P>
Some services have substantial searchable databases available.
Phonefile on CompuServe (a nationwide criss-cross) and the text
of 16 newspaper archives on America Online (through the Mercury
Center) are two examples of the databases available on commercial
information services.
<H4><B>Internet Connectivity:</B></H4>

<P>
The ability to send and receive Internet e-mail, read Internet
news group messages, and to browse Internet Webpages has become
a key component of the service to subscribers of commercial information
services. This is an area where careful shopping is required.
Compare the cost of e-mail sending and receiving and browsing
time. Find out if the full range of Internet tools are available
(can you telnet, do gopher searches). Some services are better
deals in one area, others are better in another. For example:
you cannot yet telnet from America Online, e-mail messages over
a certain number are an extra charge on CompuServe. This is an
area of high competition and constant change, so be sure to have
a good list of questions before you decide which service to subscribe
to.<HR>

<H3>Advantages of Commercial Information Services:</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Information boutique: </B>You can get a good sampling of
services, forum areas and access through this one information
utility.
<LI><B>Common organization / design: </B>Once you get familiar
with the layout and navigation of the service, you can quickly
find anything and use any area.
<LI><B>Generally higher quality information: </B>Forum sysops
generally exert more control over the forum areas, keeping discussions
on target. The content submitted by the publications and services
is generally high, since they are selling this as a commercial
product. The organization is thoughtful and consistent. Quality
standards are more rigorous. These services are like mini-World
Wide Webs.
<LI><B>Low cost access to high-end databases:</B> Some information
providers on commercial services provide access to database at
substantially lower cost. The Mercury Center's database of 18
newspapers costs $9 / hr ($ .15 / min.) for searching after 6
pm. Retrieving the same stories on Dialog, you'd pay $120 / hr.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>Disadvantages of Commercial Information Services:</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Restrictions by the service:</B> The commercial service
controls what news groups are available, can impose language and
conduct standards on discussions, limit the access to certain
sites, not have all functions of the Internet (yet). Be sure you
know what you can, and can't, do in the service.
<LI><B>More expensive:</B> The hidden costs (number of messages
allowed, online time charges) can add up with commercial information
services. If all you want is Internet accessibility, there are
much less expensive options available. Most of the services have
certain areas available at no extra charge, but if you click over
to another area you are charged for connect time. Read your charge
sheets carefully.
<LI><B>Limited community:</B> When posting to a message area on
the commercial information service, only subscribers to the service
can see the message, a very small sub-set of the connected world.
<LI><B>Bad browsers:</B> Some of the browser software developed
for commercial information services cannot view all the attributes
of html documents as well as other browsers. This is a big problem
for looking at Web documents.

<H2>PEOPLE FINDERS / PUBLIC RECORDS DATABASES</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Computer access to information about people is probably the most
useful and most controversial area of computer assisted research
in newsrooms. These databases, from the simplest telephone look-up
to more sophisticated dossier services, are invaluable to both
deadline reporting and long term investigations.
<P>
Information about people comes from two sources: records gathered
by government agencies and those gathered by business. Think of
them as records of life as a citizen and as a consumer. Public
records from government agencies have always been available, but
in paper form they were difficult or time-consuming to access.
Information about consumers is a new area, and probably the cause
of most of the concerns about privacy. Each of these types of
records have tremendous value in news research but require extra
care and knowledge when they are used. <HR>

<H4><B>PUBLIC RECORDS DATABASES</B></H4>

<P>
Over the past few years many state and local government agencies
have been moving towards electronic access to their records. While
some of it may be useful in issues stories (ie: statistics on
health care or water quality or road characteristics), we'll be
talking here about databases that can help you track down people,
their associates, their assets and their personal histories. The
types of records, what they can provide, and what information
you usually need to search by can help you determine what information
might help you get what you need. Some are state-wide databases,
others are local compilations, for which you would have to search
county-by-county to get full coverage.
<UL>
<LI><B>Motor vehicle information:</B> automobile registrations,
driver's licenses, accident reports
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> address, date of birth, driver history,
social security number (in some states), physical characteristics
of the driver (height, weight, race, sex, need for eyeglasses),
type of automobile driven (make, model, year).
<LI><B>Need to search by</B> name (sometimes full name is required
- sometimes date of birth is also required), driver's license
number, VIN (vehicle identification number) or motor vehicle registration
number.
</UL>

<LI><B>Secretary of State filings: </B>incorporation records,
uniform commercial code filing, limited partnerships
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> address information, names of business
associates and associated businesses, name of company registered
agent, address of the business, status of the business, names
of debtors and creditors.
<LI><B>Need to search by</B> name of officer or business name.
</UL>

<LI><B>Property records:</B> tax appraisals and mortgage filings
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> name and address of owner, characteristics
of the house (sq. ft., no. of rooms), mortgage holder and amount,
appraised value, who sold the house and when.
<LI><B>Need to search by</B> address of the property, owner or
seller's name.
</UL>

<LI><B>Utility records:</B> water and sewer billings
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> name and address of owner (useful for rented
properties), delinquency of payment. (Check your water board members
and see how they are doing with their bills!)
<LI><B>Need to search by</B> property address, owner's name.
</UL>

<LI><B>Voter registration records</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> address information, party affiliation,
last election they voted.
<LI><B>Need to search by</B> name.
</UL>

<LI><B>Marriage / divorce records</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> maiden name of bride, dates of marriage
- divorce, whether there were previous marriages.
<LI><B>Need to search by</B> name.
</UL>

<LI><B>Occupational licenses</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> information about business line, address.
<LI><B>Need to search by</B> name.
</UL>

<LI><B>Civil and criminal court cases / criminal history </B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Can provide</B> plaintiff and defendant names, lawyers'
names, case file numbers (to get the full case record), arrest
records.
<LI><B>Need to search by </B>name, case number.
</UL>

<LI><B>Other records of interest: </B>concealed weapons permits,
boat and aircraft registrations, bankruptcy filings, mortgage
default records.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Ways agencies make their databases available</B></H4>

<P>
<B>DIRECT ACCESS TO THE AGENCY'S COMPUTER:</B> ie: Minnesota's
dial-in account to Department of Motor Vehicle records.
<UL>
<LI><B>Advantages:</B> The data is as current as the agency has
available, you are searching the same database they use.
<LI><B>Disadvantages:</B> Sometimes the search interface is not
designed for consumer use, but for agency use, and is not very
user friendly. It is possible the agency can monitor what is being
searched on the database. Sometimes the database is available
only during regular office hours.
</UL>

<P>
<B>GATEWAY THROUGH A COMMERCIAL DATABASE VENDOR: </B>ie: The computer
holding Florida's Secretary of State Corporations database is
accessed through CompuServe.
<UL>
<LI><B>Advantages: </B>Same as above, you are getting exactly
what the agency has available.
<LI><B>Disadvantages:</B> Same as above, plus there is usually
an additional charge for the time you are on the commercial database
vendor.
</UL>

<P>
<B>AGENCY SELLS DATABASE TO A VENDOR: </B>This is the fastest
growing area, public records resellers buy and repackage public
records databases.
<UL>
<LI><B>Advantages:</B> The searching and look of the database
is more consumer oriented and usually easier to use. There is
often a wide range of databases available (by type of record or
geographic area) providing &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for public
records. Some services pull records together, giving you a dossier
of the person you are looking for. Usually, there is virtually
24-hour, seven day a week access to the records.
<LI><B>Disadvantages:</B> Records are often not as current as
direct access to the agency's database, be sure you know when
the records are updated. All counties in a state database may
not be represented, be sure you know the coverage of the data.
You are paying a premium for the access and searchability of the
data, it may be the more expensive access option.
</UL>

<P>
<B>THROUGH A BULLETIN BOARD SERVICE: </B>Federal circuit courts
and bankruptcy courts offer bbs dial-in service to appellate court
decisions and docket information. There is a central registration
number to call (800-676-6856). Click to the <A HREF="http://www.uscourts.gov/PubAccess.html">Directory of Electronic Access to U.S. Federal Courts </A>for
more information (http://www.uscourts.gov/PubAccess.html)
<UL>
<LI><B>Advantages:</B> Fairly inexpensive ($.75 / minute), some
districts are free. Does not require high-end computer to access.
<LI><B>Disadvantages:</B> Separate access to the different courts,
no centralized call-in. Different courts have their bbs arranged
differently.
</UL>

<P>
<B>ON THE INTERNET: </B>The University of Kentucky has put the
state's <A HREF="gopher://UKCC.uky.edu:70/1menu%20VITALREC%21191/VITAL.INFO">Dept. of Health Statistics </A>files
on a gopher server which contains death records (1911-1992), marriage
records (1973-1993), and divorces (1973-1993). Hopefully, this
will start a trend in university / agency collaboration and use
of Internet accessibility.
<UL>
<LI><B>Advantages: </B>FREE! Quick and easy search template. Provides
basic information (age, race, residence county, and date of event).
<LI><B>Disadvantages: </B>The search is by name only.
<LI>* The &quot;About these files&quot; documents are excellent
in that they caution about the quality of the records and give
full instructions for use of this dataset.
</UL>

<P>
<B>LOCATOR SERVICE SUBSCRIBES TO VARIOUS VENDORS: </B>Many service
companies are springing up which subscribe to the various public
records databases and offer comprehensive search and retrieval
of records in both electronic and paper form.
<UL>
<LI><B>Advantages:</B> You don't have to have subscriptions to
a number of different services. They can access records in a number
of forms through network of searchers in various cities.
<LI><B>Disadvantages: </B>Probably the most costly option since
the search service passes along the cost of the search as well
as a service charge. Usually, quick turnaround service costs extra,
may be several days delay in getting some records.
<LI>* for examples of public records search services click to
<A HREF="http://www.iu.net/hodges/">National Locator and Data </A>,
<A HREF="http://www.nmia.com/~search/dataques.html">DataQuest </A>or
<A HREF="http://www.ameri.com/sherlock/sherlock.htm">Sherlock </A>(this
is by no means an endorsement of these particular services, they
just provide an interesting inventory of the types of records
available!)
</UL>

<P>
<B>PURCHASE TAPES OF THE DATA AND ACCESS ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER:
</B>ie: Waterbury, CT's city employees database has been purchased
and stored on city reporters' laptop computers, allowing quick
checks of names, addresses, salaries of employees.
<UL>
<LI><B>Advantages:</B> No cost for searching after the data has
been purchased. The data can run on software that is designed
for easy use.
<LI><B>Disadvantages: </B>For databases with frequent updates
and changes, the purchased database is quickly outdated.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>How to locate public records databases</B></H4>

<P>
Not all states or local governments offer the same level of access
to similar records. Not all records of the same type have the
same information from state to state (for example, New York does
not require the listing of officers names in the corporate filings).
Although, on the state level, some public records search companies
are getting more comprehensive access to records, the compilation
of local level records is still far away. Here are some ways you
can track down public records for your state, and local area:
<UL>
<LI><B>Check with the agency itself<BR>
</B>Determine which agencies' files you would find useful for
routine checks (corporate filings, drivers' records and property
records are generally the most useful). Call the agency's data
manager and see whether you can arrange for direct access.
<LI><B>Check with public records database vendors<BR>
</B>Several database vendors specialize in public records access.
Shop around the different services to see which ones have the
types of records you want and the most comprehensive coverage.
<LI><B>Check with your state press association<BR>
</B>The press association should be tracking public records access
in your state. Several states have developed guides to public
records.
<LI><B>Check with a university data center<BR>
</B>Many large universities have data centers with tape libraries
of state data. They can tell you the status on availability of
different types of records.
<LI><B>Check with the state information center or the city / county
data processing office<BR>
</B>These are the keepers of the information inventory. They will
know what databases are available and the access there is to the
records.
</UL>

<P>
A critical step in locating public records is knowing your rights
for access to the records. Again, your state press association
or the <A HREF="repcom.htm">Reporter's Committee for Freedom of the Press </A>are
good sources for information about records access.<HR>

<H4><B>CONSUMER RECORDS DATABASES</B></H4>

<P>
Every time you change your address, subscribe to a magazine, or
apply for a credit card, you leave an electronic trail. So do
the people you are looking for when you are reporting the news.
Database vendors offer access to some of these databases which
can be very useful in tracking down people or providing key pieces
of biographical information. The access to records of different
types can also help you verify, from a couple of different sources,
information you have found.
<P>
In the past couple of years, information that had previously been
available to the searchers has been removed. For example, information
from credit headers used to tell where the person worked. This
is no longer available, except to those with permissible (under
the <A HREF="gopher://wiretap.spies.com:70/00/Gov/faircredit.act">Fair Credit Reporting Act </A>)
use of credit information (reporters are not a category of &quot;fair
users&quot;!)
<P>
But there are still useful compilations of data from consumer
based records such as:
<UL>
<LI><B>Post Office Change of Address: </B>This had previously
been widely available, now it is accessible on only a few services
(WDIA's National Credit Information Network, for one). This has
the change of address forms people fill out to have their mail
forwarded to a new address.
<LI><B>People Finders: </B>With just a person's name and the state
he or she lives in, you can get a record giving address and telephone
number. These databases are usually compiled from standard directories
(such as telephone books) and other sources such as product response
cards and magazine subscription cards.
<LI><B>Address Search:</B> Nationwide criss-cross directories
allow you to search on an address and get information on who lives
there, telephone number, age (sometimes), and other residents.
These usually have a feature allowing you to see the names of
neighbors with their telephone numbers and addresses. A recent
example of the usefulness of neighbor access. When a plane crashed
in North Carolina, an Associated Press reporter had the address
of the church near the crash site. He looked up the address, got
neighbors listings and started calling. The second number reached
a woman who had had a burned survivor of the crash stumble onto
her front porch just minutes earlier.
<LI><B>Phone Search: </B>A compilation of listed telephone numbers.
There are a number of phone search products and services. Be careful
to determine which is the most current, most frequently updated
and which might include unlisted numbers.
<LI><B>Credit Headers: </B>A database of information extracted
from credit reports. It does not include specific financial information
but can provide you with current and previous addresses, social
security number, month and year of birth, spouse's name.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Cautions to Use of Public Records and Consumer Records
</B></H4>

<P>
As useful as these databases are in locating people you need to
talk to, they are also the riskiest to use and potentially the
most expensive. Keep these guidelines in mind:
<UL>
<LI><B>Verify, verify, verify: </B>The old computer adage, &quot;Garbage
In, Garbage Out,&quot; was never truer than with these databases.
Usually this information is contributed by the person it is about
(is anyone honest about their weight on driver's licenses?), comes
from handwritten forms which are keypunched into the database.
Errors are rampant and it is essential that any information you
find from these files be verified.
<LI><B>Consider the source: </B>Understand how the data came to
be in the database, what is required of that particular record,
what kind of checking is done of the veracity of the information.
Public records databases may be more reliable than consumer records,
but someone with no car, property records or utility bills may
be found in consumer records.
<LI><B>Get specifics: </B>If you only have the person's name you
need to search, and it is a common name, you might as well not
search. Unless you have some specific information that can identify
the entry as the person you are looking for, you cannot assume
you have found the right person.
<LI><B>Don't expect miracles: </B>Some data is just not available.
You can check the same name in different databases and just get
the same information over and over. Know what you are searching.
Also, privacy laws are getting stricter, know what you can reasonably
expect to find, and don't expect more.
<LI><B>Shop carefully: </B>Know what you are paying for and which
database is being searched when you look at different vendors.
You may be charged a premium for searching a database you could
have gotten at directly for much cheaper.

<H2>INFORMATION MALPRACTICE<BR>
and the use of online information resources</H2>
<HR>

<P>
&quot;Information is the currency of journalism&quot; (according
to novelist / journalist John Katzenbach). But if you aren't careful,
it is easy to get short-changed when using online information.
There are four stages in online database use where there is danger:
<UL>
<LI>When the data is created.
<LI>When the database is compiled.
<LI>During the search of the database.
<LI>While interpreting the results of the search.
</UL>

<P>
Whether fault for the inaccurate, misleading, or incomplete information
lies with the data creator, the database compiler, or the searcher,
ultimately, you, the journalist, are responsible for the credibility
of the information incorporated into your news report.<HR>

<H4><B>POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AT EACH STAGE </B></H4>

<P>
<B>Data Creation: Studies, reports, public records</B> 
<P>
Databases consist of reports, studies, statistics and information
compiled by a variety of agencies, universities, research centers
and special interest groups. The original compilation of data
can be the first place where information credibility may be tainted
(for an excellent examination of this, read <U>Tainted Truth </U>by
Cynthia Crossen). Also, some databases compiled from source documents
might have their own set of inaccuracies brought in at the data
creation stage. Problems can be caused by:<B> </B>
<UL>
<LI><B>Subsidized research:</B> Research funded by special interests
looking to support certain views.
<LI><B>Biased research:</B> Research skewed to emphasize one aspect,
unbalanced in the research.
<LI><B>Input errors:</B> Keypunchers put data into wrong field,
transpose numbers, misread words.
<LI><B>Source document errors</B>: The original document has inaccuracies
or misinformation.
<LI><B>Currency of the data:</B> Updating of data or records for
the database may be behind.
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Data Creation: News stories</B> 
<P>
News stories are full of error, misinformation and inconsistencies.
In fact, an Editor &amp; Publisher article once said most news
librarians agree that up to 50 percent of news articles contain
some type of error. These are the articles that get into the news
databases. Whether the error is as innocent as misspelling or
as grievous as a statistical or factual error, these are the stories
that live on and are used as daily resources. Problems are caused
by:
<UL>
<LI><B>Inaccuracy in reporting</B> 
<LI><B>Errors in editing</B> 
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Database Compilation: </B>
<P>
When the database is compiled there are many factors that can
result in problematic searches later. Awareness of these problem
potentials will help the savvy searcher conduct a better search.
Problems can be caused by:
<UL>
<LI><B>Story selection -</B> <B>database policies:</B> Not all
stories in a publication necessarily make it into the database,
policies for inclusion or exclusion may change over time so that
databases from one year to the next may contain a different selection
of stories.
<LI><B>Corrections - published and unpublished:</B> Most news
libraries take care to append corrections to news stories in the
database and alert the reader of the story, but not all database
compliers are as careful. Some errors in the reporting which are
caught don't make it as a published correction and policies for
how unpublished corrections are handled differ.
<LI><B>Versions of the story saved:</B> Some news database compilers
take the longest version, others the latest version. This can
create confusion for the searcher.
<LI><B>Currency of update:</B> Gaps in the creation of the database
or delays in the entry of current material can result in problems
with search results.
<LI><B>Keywords:</B> The addition of keywords or the optimistically
named &quot;controlled vocabulary terms&quot; can be done haphazardly
or applied differently by different enhancers.
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Database Searching:</B> 
<P>
The more you know about the dangers of sloppy searching the more
you realize how much a skilled researcher brings to the search.
Some of the problem areas when searching are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Searching on words that aren't in the story:</B> You want
stories about homicides, you type in &quot;homicides&quot;, you
may get one third of the stories that would be about homicides,
the other stories don't use that word, so you won't get them.
<LI><B>Searching for common words or words with multiple meanings:</B>
Getting overwhelmed with irrelevant searches because the search
found the term you entered is one of the biggest problems with
online information. Don't search for &quot;Gulf Oil&quot; with
just the word &quot;gulf&quot;.
<LI><B>Searching for words with multiple spellings:</B> Forgetting
to accomodate variations in spellings, particularly in databases
with both U.S. and European sources, can cause you to miss relevant
articles.
<LI><B>Forgetting plurals, conjugations:</B> Forgetting to truncate
words so that different word endings will be found will cause
incomplete results.
<LI><B>Not understanding the search engine</B>: You must understand
how words are grouped, what the database is searching, how it's
logic works in order to optimize the searching.
<LI><B>Not understanding the databases' content, scope:</B> Going
by what the database says it is rather than what it actually contains
is dangerous. It may say &quot;Real estate records for Georgia,&quot;
but read the fine print, it only includes eight counties!
<LI><B>Failing to retrieve full record:</B> Forgetting to display
each page of a multi-page or multi-level document can be a problem.
Don't just count the hits and assume, look at each record.
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Results Interpretation:</B> 
<P>
You've got the search results, you still must understand what
the results mean. Misinterpretation of a search can cause the
most significant problems with searching, and the use of the data
in news stories. Problems can be caused by:
<UL>
<LI><B>Misunderstanding relevance / significance of results: </B>Be
sure you understand what you have, and do not have, as a result
of the search. Do not make assumptions about the significance
of a search; consider the possibility of error.
<LI><B>Misunderstanding the source document: </B>Be sure you understand
the type of record you are looking at, and what the fields of
information in that record signify.
<LI><B>Misinterpreting the results: </B>If you search for occurrences
of &quot;post-modern&quot; in 1994 databases and 1984 databases,
you will find thousands more occurrences in 1994. Does this show
an increased usage of the term &quot;post-modern&quot; over the
past decade. Not necessarily. There are hundreds of additional
publications in 1994 databases than there are in 1984 databases,
and it may just be an indication of better scope of the databases
(and those non-databased publications may have been spouting &quot;post-modern&quot;
all over their pages back in 1984).
<LI><B>Assuming the data is accurate: </B>If it is critical to
your news story, second source it. If you have doubts, find corroboration.
<LI><B>Failing to &quot;consider the source&quot;: </B>Be as skeptical
with online sources as you are with human sources.
<LI><B>Failing to &quot;second source&quot;: </B>See &quot;assuming
the data is accurate.&quot;
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>TIPS FOR SAFE(R) SEARCHING </B></H4>

<P>
<B>1. Watch for spelling, editing and / or style inconsistencies</B>

<P>
Be careful when using online for verification of spellings or
styles (ie. the variations on Gaddafi). If you are not accomodating
spelling variations you might miss relevant stories.
<P>
<B>Tip:</B> Use the &quot;or&quot; logic to string together possible
variations.<BR>
<B>Future solutions:</B> Fuzzy logic software, relevance ranking
<P>
<B>2. Watch the numbers</B> 
<P>
Be sure you know what the numbers in stories are referring to
(with currency, for example, is it dollars, liar, yen?)
<P>
<B>Tip:</B> Read carefully, ask questions of the source if not
certain
<P>
<B>3. Understand the software</B> 
<P>
In some systems a space is &quot;and&quot; , in others it's &quot;or&quot;.
You need to know how to truncate, &quot;nest&quot; terms, force
adjacency. You need to know what words are &quot;stopwords&quot;
and will not be searched.
<P>
<B>Tip:</B> Read the manual, work with a professional researcher
<P>
<B>4. Know the three Cs: content, coverage, currency</B> 
<P>
You need to understand exactly what the database contains, the
range of it's coverage and how current the information is, if
there are any gaps in the file.
<P>
<B>Tip:</B> Read the database documentation
<P>
<B>5. What's the credibility, authority of the source</B> 
<P>
Who compiled the information, from what sources, and for what
purpose? Discover all you can about the source of the information.
Which source is more credible. News magazines are often better
sources for background facts than newspapers because they tend
to do a more thorough job of fact-checking.
<P>
<B>Tip:</B> Read the database documentation or contact the compiler.

<H2>INTERNET</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Over the past few years the Internet, the so-called &quot;network
of networks,&quot; has become the essential tool in the reporter's
toolbox. This is largely because of the increasing use of the
<A HREF="carwww.htm">World Wide Web </A>by government agencies,
research centers, publications and other groups with valuable
information. The joke about the Internet is the only people making
money with it are those who are writing books about it. There
are so many good guides to the Internet, aimed at particular uses
of it and different levels of expertise, that the best thing this
guide can offer is a list of some that come highly recommended.
<P>
Just to get you started, the following will provide an overview
of just what the Internet is, and isn't.<HR>

<H4><B>What is the Internet? </B></H4>

<P>
The Internet is not a company or a commercial information service
you subscribe to like Dialog or CompuServe. Instead, it is the
inter-networked connection among a number of regional computer
networks. These regional networks link individual computers found
in universities, database services, publishing houses, bulletin
board operations, libraries, newspapers and television stations.
When you buy a subscription to an Internet access company or a
direct line to a inter-networked computer hub, you are actually
connecting to one of these regional networks that allows you to
&quot;travel&quot; all over the world, from computer to computer,
through its connection to the other networks.
<P>
Think of the Internet as the telephone system. You don't subscribe
to telephone wires; you arrange an account with a telephone access
company that is connected to the telephone wires. Your account
with this telephone access company allows you to hook into the
network of telephones. But the rates you pay, the service you
get and even how you dial in depends on which telephone access
company you use. The same with the Internet. The way you access
the tools of the Internet will differ depending on the service
you use to get access. However, once you are connected, there
are certain things you can do with the connection between computers
you are now linked into:
<UL>
<LI>Send <A HREF="caremail.htm">e-mail </A>to individuals around
the world, a new way to conduct interviews.
<LI>Subscribe to <A HREF="carlists.htm">listserv </A>discussions
of various topics to keep up on a beat or tap into a community
of experts.
<LI>Read messages and post comments to <A HREF="carnewsg.htm">newsgroups </A>populated
by people with experience or an interest in a topic.
<LI><A HREF="cartelne.htm">Telnet </A>to another computer for
access to that computer's files to find background articles, reports,
speeches or to use a remote computer's bulletin board service.
<LI>Browse documents and files found on the <A HREF="carwww.htm">World Wide Web </A>or
in <A HREF="cargophe.htm">gopher </A>space for backgrounding,
verifying information, or doing <A HREF="carready.htm">ready reference</A>.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>The Internet is...</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Amazing: </B>When you have fast access on great equipment
to the whole range of Internet tools, there is no more amazing
information utility. The size, scope, diversity and entertainment
value of the information on the Internet is unprecedented and
constantly growing.
<LI><B>Uncontrolled:</B> There are no standards for the look,
navigation, quality or organization of information on the Internet.
That is part of the charm, and a large part of the frustration.
The rule for Internet searching is, &quot;Browser beware&quot;.
<LI><B>Vast: </B>No, everything that has ever been published is
NOT on the Internet, but some very good things are. So is a lot
of pure dreck. Sorting through and getting to the quality information
is a big part of the challenge of using the Internet.
<LI><B>An essential information tool: </B>Increasingly, this is
true. The quality and quantity of the information is increasing.
The web is becoming a publishing standard for great government
information. E-mail is a vital communication channel. News groups
can help you keep your ear to the ground. Access to the Internet
is becoming an essential means for the journalist to stay connected,
find facts and monitor topics of interest.
<LI><B>Interactive and multi-media: </B>Find a great site with
information, but you have a question about it? Send a message
to the creator immediately. This is interactivity. Want not just
text, but photos and sound and video? This is possible with the
multi-media capabilities of the World Wide Web.
<LI><B>Inexpensive: </B>With careful shopping you can have full
Internet access for a month for less than pizza and a six-pack.
<LI><B>Easy to use: </B>If you can type in a URL (uniform resource
locator), locate and click on the forward and backward navigation
keys, and read, you pretty much have all the technical skills
needed to use the world wide web.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>The Internet isn't... </B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>An information superhighway:</B> It's more of an information
relay station. A superhighway conjures up a seamless ribbon of
smooth asphalt, well marked and patrolled.
<LI><B>A replacement for commercial database services: </B>If
you are needing to quickly find articles published in a wide range
of mainstream newspapers and magazines you will not be able to
use the Internet - you still need a Nexis or Dialog or Datatimes.
If you are looking for public records and people finding databases
you will not be able to use the Internet - you still need a commercial
service. The internet's resources are very good for supplemental
information for a number of information needs. It is not the ultimate
source for information...yet.
<LI><B>Usable on low end equipment:</B> Sure, you can get e-mail
and yes, you can read news group messages. But to experience the
full range of Internet's wonders, you must invest in a fast communications
line, upgraded modem, more powerful computer and some additional
software.
<LI><B>Cheap: </B>If time is money, the Internet may be the biggest
expense in your newsroom. Diving into the resources of the internet
takes time. Serendipity is the key element of using the internet
and the more time you take to wander the 'net, the more you will
find of use and the better your skills of navigation will get.
<LI><B>Easily used: </B>Yes, it is easy to use, but you cannot
always easily find information on the internet. The spiders and
robots and directories that are being created as finding aids
for the internet are developing at great speed, but none is the
final catalog of this resource. Knowing how to use these different
<A HREF="carfind.htm">finding tools </A>is not easy, but it is
essential, otherwise you may miss important resources.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Read more about the Internet</B> </H4>

<P>
This is just a starting list of books about how to use the Internet's
resources. The best bet is to go to a good bookstore and wander
the aisles, pick up a few books and see which ones have the language,
arrangement and contents that best suit you and your needs. At
the end is a list of links to websites with good introductory
information on using the internet. This listing was compiled by
Poynter's Head Librarian, Sandra Allen.

<H2>E-MAIL</H2>
<HR>

<P>
E-mail, (electronic mail), is the common denominator of Internet
access. If you have a way to get on and use the resources of the
Internet, you have an e-mail address. And if you have an e-mail
address, you have the means to connect with the millions of other
Internet users around the world. E-mail allows you to subscribe
to a <A HREF="carlists.htm">listserv </A>, post messages to a
<A HREF="carnewsg.htm">newsgroup </A>, or correspond with colleagues
and contacts. <HR>

<H4><B>The E-Mail Address</B></H4>

<P>
Just how you retrieve, read, compose, and send messages through
the Internet depends on your Internet access. But basically all
e-mail software allows you to receive messages in your in-box,
display the messages, reply to messages, compose new messages
and store messages. Always check with the service you use to find
out what charges there might be for the receipt and storage of
e-mail (this can be a painful hidden cost if you aren't careful).
<P>
An e-mail address, like a postal address, directs the mail handlers
passing e-mail messages through the network of computers to get
the message to the right mail slot. The e-mail address consists
of four parts. We'll break down my e-mail address, <B>npaul@poynter.org
</B>:
<UL>
<LI><B>npaul: </B>my user name (I made it up myself, some systems
generate random user names, ie. Compuserve's numbers)
<LI><B>@: </B>&quot;at&quot;, the universal separator between
the user name and the rest of the address
<LI><B>poynter: </B>the host computer, where the user has her
e-mail box
<LI><B>org: </B>indicates the type of host computer (org for organization,
gov for government, edu for university, com for commercial, net
for network)
</UL>

<P>
A software package called SMTP (simple mail transfer protocol)
allows the transmission of messages sent between machines of dissimilar
types.<HR>

<H4><B>Uses for E-Mail</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI>E-mail allows you to send personal messages to individuals,
providing more privacy in the correspondence. You might post a
message publicly to a newsgroup, get some responses and then carry
on the conversation through e-mail. Many reporters request that
responses to a publicly posted message be sent only to their private
e-mail.
<LI>E-mail can be a more efficient way to communicate with hard-to-reach
individuals. Avoid phone tag or rambling voice mail messages by
sending an e-mail request for information to someone. They can
then answer, at length, at their convenience by posting a message
back to you.
<LI>E-mail responses put an answer into text form, making it easy
(with their knowledge and permission) to incorporate someone's
comments into your story.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Cautions for Using E-Mail</B> </H4>

<P>
I imagine when those new-fangled telephones first started being
used in newsrooms, the old-timers said, &quot;How can you believe
you're really talking to the person they say they are? You can't
see them!&quot; A similar healthy skepticism is being voiced about
using e-mail as a way to contact and interview people. Ira Chinoy,
while he was at <I>The Providence Journal</I> (he is now at <I>The
Washington Post</I>), put together a few simple but important
guidelines for reading and sending e-mail messages that will be
used in stories:
<P>
<B>Verify:</B> Just because e-mail arrives with the name of a
sender, there is always the possibility of a hoax. If you plan
to quote an e-mail message, contact that person directly to confirm
that they are, indeed, the author. (And if you can't, don't use
it!)
<P>
<B>Verify, part 2: </B>If you got an anonymous call claiming something
to be true, you'd check it out. The same rule applies on the Internet.
<P>
<B>Verify, part 3: </B>Some e-mail systems are capable of passing
along, unwittingly, everything a person typed -- even errors the
senders thought they were deleting. This is not common, but keep
an eye out for it. Check with the sender if you suspect a problem.
<P>
<B>The rules of libel, slander and privacy are evolving in this
new realm. Be alert.</B> 
<P>
Wise words, heed them well.<HR>

<H2>LISTSERVS</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Listservs, along with <A HREF="carnewsg.htm">newsgroups </A>,
are two ways to join into discussion with other people interested
in a particular topic. While newsgroups are modeled after bulletin
board message areas, listservs are an e-mail routing list. Listserv
software manages the subscription list of those who want to be
part of a listserv. When anyone sends a message to the listserv,
the software sees that a copy is routed to all the members of
the listserv.
<P>
Listservs can be open (anyone who wants to can &quot;subscribe&quot;)
or closed (you must prove you have the necessary credentials,
usually job or experience, to belong to the listserv). Some listservs
are set up just for members of a committee to correspond or people
from the same organization.
<P>
There are two types of listservs: &quot;Moderated&quot; listservs
generally have a person who looks over messages posted to the
list, ensuring that the message is on topic for that particular
listserv's discussion interest. &quot;Unmoderated&quot; listservs
just pass along anything sent, sometimes resulting in a lot of
&quot;noise&quot; on the listserv.
<P>
Another difference between listservs and newsgroups is that newsgroups
are more transient, while the listserv community is fairly constant.
Listservs are more for personal / professional support and updating
while the newsgroups' messages are more for keeping an ear to
the ground on a topic or beat.<HR>

<H4><B>Uses for listservs </B></H4>

<P>
There are thousands upon thousands of listservs dealing from very
specific to more general discussion. For example, look for listservs
on the topic &quot;crime&quot; and you'll find one specifically
for discussion of the National Crime Survey and another for on
the more general topic of juvenile delinquency.
<P>
The people who &quot;subscribe&quot; to listservs generally are
very knowledgeable and / or interested in the topic of the list
either because of their profession or their life experiences.
Estimates are that fewer than 15 percent of the subscribers to
a list actively post messages, the rest being &quot;lurkers&quot;
only. However, all the subscribers, whether just readers or active
participants, have their own personal networks of contacts that
might be helpful to you. Posting questions (if they haven't been
answered, and re-answered in the past) to the list can tap you
into a group of experts, and people with experience. Listservs
are also often the early warning system for events and trends
being spotted by a group of people with a great deal of interest
in a topic.
<P>
Anyone with a specific &quot;beat&quot; (health or education or
environment, for example) should subscribe to at least one listserv
on that topic. This is a great way to keep up with what experts
are talking about, solicit information, advice or contacts from
them and to generally tap into a broad expert base.
<P>
One of the best resources for journalists combines e-mail messaging
and listservs. <A HREF="http://www.dgsys.com/~editors/profnet.html">Profnet</A>
is a listserv set-up for college and university public information
officers. Journalists can send a message (<A HREF="mailto:profnet@vyne.com">profnet@vyne.com </A>),
or call ( 800-776-3638 or 516-632-6332) to Profnet which posts
it to the Profnet listserv. The subscribers (the PIOs) read these
messages requesting contacts with experts in universities and
put the journalist in touch with appropriate faculty members.
<H4><B>Other Uses </B></H4>

<P>
<B>Keep in touch with colleagues:</B> There are numerous listservs
operating for journalists. Whether you are a copy-editor, a news
researcher, a computer-assisted reporting specialist, or a photojournalist,
there is a special listserv of your colleagues.
<P>
<B>Request information, raise concerns:</B> As a professional
development tool, these communities are great support groups.
Listservs you might join because of beat responsibilities can
help you stay current with the latest interests and concerns of
the members of that listserv.
<P>
<B>Receive 'zines:</B> Hundreds of specialty publications are
distributed only through listserv subscriptions. Sign up to get
the latest issues. Search John Labovitz's E*Zine*List (<A HREF="http://www.meer.net/~johnl/e-zine-list/index.html">http://www.meer.net/~johnl/e-zine-list/index.html </A>)
to find some that may be useful.<HR>

<H4><B>What you need to use listservs</B> </H4>

<P>
One of the great things about listservs is they are useful even
to those with lower-end equipment. As long as you have an Internet
e-mail address through any Internet connected service, you can
join a listserv.
<P>
<B>Cost:</B> Most listservs are free to belong to, a very few
request an actual subscription to join. Be careful when reading
over your Internet service's charges. Sometimes there are additional
charges for numbers of e-mail messages received or amount of storage
of messages. This could add up if you belong to a very active
listserv.
<P>
<B>Instructions for using listservs:</B> To subscribe to a list,
send an e-mail message to the listserv &quot;subscribe to&quot;
address with one line in the body of the message: ( SUB listname
yourname) where listname is the name of the list, and yourname
is your full name (ie: sub CARR-L Jane Smith). When your &quot;subscription&quot;
goes through, you will usually be sent a message with instructions
for posting and signoff the list. The address you send a message
to is the listserv name and @ address. The listserv software used
by different listservs can have different routines and instructions,
so be sure you know how the ones you subscribe to work.<HR>

<H4><B>Tips for using listservs</B> </H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Flame-prone lists: </B>Some listserv groups are, frankly,
friendlier than others. &quot;Lurk&quot; for awhile (read messages
but don't send messages) to get a feel for the tone of that particular
listserv. Also, always read the directions for how to post to
the list and how to &quot;unsubscribe&quot;, nothing generates
more irate messages than uninformed users. Getting flamed (curt
or cutting messages about your posting) can keep you from getting
fully involved in the group. Part of being on a list is knowing
that list's style.
<LI><B>Stay on topic, know what's been discussed: </B>Other instant
sources of flamebait, people who wander off the topic of the list's
discussion or who bring up for discussion a topic that has been
discussed to death. Check the archives of the listservs messages
to see if topics you want to bring up have already been covered.
<LI><B>Consider the source of the message: </B>One of the benefits
of listservs over newsgroups is the user base is more stable.
Some listservs restrict members to those who have a legitimate
interest or knowledge in the topic being discussed (closed lists).
So, although it is often easier to confirm the legitimacy of the
members of a list, it is still important to verify anything posted
to a list.
<LI><B>Don't quote without permission: </B>Consider e-mail messages
the same as you would personal correspondence or telephone conversations.
If you are going to quote, let the speaker (typer) know.
<LI><B>Don't use on deadline: </B>Don't expect to post a message
to a list (or a newsgroup) and get an immediate response. If you
are on deadline, this may not be the technique to try.
<LI><B>Identify yourself: </B>The messages get posted to the list
and look as if they come from the list, not from an individual,
so be sure you add your &quot;sig&quot; to any message so readers
can readily identify who sent it.
<LI><B>Be generous:</B> What goes around, comes around. If you've
gotten help or advice from people on the list, be sure to be an
active participant and help out others. The quality of the discussion
depends on the individual members.
<LI><B>DON'T SHOUT:</B> A message typed in all caps looks like
shouting in the world of listservs. Be sure you don't have cap
lock on, and try emphasis by putting an asterisk on either side
of the word.
<LI><B>Re-read before you post:</B> The ease and quickness of
e-mailing messages to lists can sometimes be dangerous. Be sure
to look over what you post before you send it. Messages live a
long time in cyberspace, and you never know just who will be reading
the message.
<LI><B>Beware the over-flowing e-mail box: </B>Some listservs
might generate dozens of messages a day. If you don't monitor
your e-mail box regularly, you could quickly be overwhelmed with
messages. Some listservs provide a &quot;digest&quot; feature
which merges all the messages sent to the list and sends out just
one huge message to your mailbox each day. This can cut down on
the message volume.
<LI><B>Pick your group carefully: </B>Make sure the community
you are joining is the right one for you. You will be getting
lots of e-mail, so if you find that most is irrelevant or annoying,
it will only be taking up your time.
<LI><B>Don't advertise:</B> Most listserv subscribers deeply resent
being used as a promotions mailing list. Unless the group specifically
allows advertising type announcements, don't send them.
<LI><B>If it's personal, send it to a person: </B>Be sure to send
messages that might have limited interest to the whole group to
specific people rather than to the listserv.
<LI><B>Ask for help if you need it, not just because you're lazy:
</B>Sure, you can post to an astronomy listserv and ask for an
explanation of the &quot;big bang&quot;, but you will probably
get flamed. If you can look it up, don't expect the members of
the listserv to waste their time responding. And don't send out
25 question surveys to a list, at the very worst you'll just be
ignored.

<H2>NEWSGROUPS</H2>
<HR>

<P>
There are several ways you can read or take part in discussions
on the Internet. One way is to subscribe to a <A HREF="carlists.htm">listserv </A>.
Another is to join a newsgroup. The main difference between these
two are that you sign-up for a listserv and the messages go to
your <A HREF="caremail.htm">e-mail </A>box, while you go to a
newsgroup area and read the messages like on a bulletin board.
Newsgroup messages are posted publicly, available for anyone to
read and respond to. There are over 15,000 newsgroup areas currently
active on the Internet covering every conceivable topic from the
arts to zoology. <HR>

<H4><B>Use for</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Story ideas: </B>While some of the messages will be more
like CB radio talk, others can give you a first alert about a
developing new topic or area of concern to the group.
<LI><B>Finding sources to talk to: </B>The people who read newsgroup
messages are a great source for information themselves, and they
know others who are experts or experienced in the topic being
discussed. By connecting to a newsgroup's population, you are
connecting to their rolodexes, too.
<LI><B>Seeking people who know about a specific topic: </B>Again,
anyone who joins a newsgroup is likely to be very interested,
concerned or knowledgeable about the topic being discussed. The
group is highly motivated to share information and to support
the questions raised by other members.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>What you need to use newsgroups</B></H4>

<P>
You must have access to a service which has newsgroup access.
Most of the commercial bulletin board services (America Online,
Delphi, Prodigy) do have newsgroup access. Any Internet provider's
service should have newsgroup access as an option. Some may restrict
which newsgroups you can get to.
<P>
<B>Cost: </B>The service you use for Internet access might charge
by the hour for the time you spend reading messages. Otherwise,
there is no fee for reading newsgroup messages or for joining
newsgroup discussions. <HR>

<H4><B>Tips for using newsgroups</B></H4>

<P>
Newsgroups are great resources for connecting with experts and
people with certain types of experiences. However, there are some
things you should keep in mind as you are using them:
<UL>
<LI><B>You need lead time: </B>You might post a message and not
get a response for a day or two. Don't rely on responses for short
deadline stories.
<LI><B>Identify yourself: </B>Although you're in cyberspace, you
need the same ethics as when you're dealing with people face to
face. If you are trolling for comments to use in a story, be sure
to disclose who you are and something about why you are looking
for comments.
<LI><B>Remember, what you post will be read by who knows who:
</B>Don't tip your hand on a big story, there may be other journalists
out there. Be as vague as possible but specific enough to get
some response. Ask people to reply to your e-mail address, not
to post to the newsgroup.
<LI><B>Verify, verify, verify: </B>Would you put in the paper
something you heard at a cocktail party without verifying it?
Of course not. Same with what you read in a newsgroup.
<LI><B>Read the FAQs: </B>Don't become instant flamebait by asking
a question that has already been answered by the group. Be sure
to find and read the FAQ (frequently asked questions) document
which most newsgroups have available on their topic.
<LI><B>Search the Archive: </B>Many newsgroups retain an archive
of messages. Before you send out a question, search to see if
it has already been addressed by the group. (a great source for
locating newsgroup archives can be found at: <A HREF="http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/news.lists/newsgroup_archives.html">http://starbase.neosoft.com/~claird/news.lists/newsgroup_archives.html </A>)
<LI><B>Get a sense of the climate before you get active:</B> Lurk
(read messages but don't send or reply) for awhile on the newsgroup
before you become active. Learn about the community of people,
their concerns, their tolerance level before you solicit information
from them. Be as sensitive to the group as you would be in a face-to-face
situation. And don't overdo it. When Jerry Garcia died, a message
was posted by a journalist to the rec.music.gdead newsgroup, asking
for stories or memories anyone would like to share, information
about local vigils, etc. One member of the newsgroup responded,
&quot;You want a comment? How about &quot;GO THE F*** AWAY!&quot;
You can read the posts here. People are upset. Stop digging for
news bites and let us grieve!&quot; Bottomline: this is a great
resource for journalists, just be sure to use it appropriately
and sensitively.
<LI><B>Find a few to monitor:</B> As with all the Internet resources,
if you start off thinking you have to eat the whole thing, you
will quickly have a stomach-ache. Take small bite, find a few
good places, monitor them well, and gradually build up your skills,

<LI><B>If there is a choice between a moderated and an unmoderated
newsgroup on a topic, go moderated:</B> Moderated lists usually
have someone who oversees the message traffic to see that it stays
on topic and to mediate flamewars. Unmoderated are &quot;anything
goes&quot; and what often goes is trivial, off-point kinds of
messages. Most newsgroup lists and finders will indicate whether
or not a newsgroup is moderated.

<H2>TELNET</H2>
<HR>

<P>
You are sitting at your computer in Peoria and would like to tap
into Fed World - the bulletin board service running from a computer
in Washington, DC. You could use your modem and dial long distance
to connect. Or you can use <B>telnet </B>software to set up a
client (your local computer) / server (the remote computer) connection.
Once you've established the connection, by typing in the address
of the computer you want to access (in Fed World's case - fedworld.gov),
it is as if you were sitting at a terminal connected directly
to the network housing the information or service you want to
use.
<P>
The advantage of telnet over modem access is obvious; no long-distance
charges. Many of the commercial database services have telnet
access (ie: Dialog can be reached at dialog.com) and news libraries
are realizing considerable savings from avoiding use of transaction
priced telecommunications lines.<HR>

<H4><B>Uses of Telnet</B></H4>

<P>
Some sites, particularly university libraries' online catalogs,
are currently only available for use through telnet access.
<P>
University OPACs (online public access catalogs) can be great
sources for locating authors who've written about particular topics
or to do some ready-reference spell checks.
<P>
Specialized collections of articles and reports are sometime only
available on computers accessible through telnet, they are not
yet on the World Wide Web. <HR>

<H4><B>Finding Telnet Sites</B></H4>

<P>
Galaxy has a search page for <A HREF="http://galaxy.einet.net/hytelnet/HYTELNET.html">Hytelnet </A>,
a program that gives a user access to all known telnet-accessible
sites on the Internet. (http://galaxy.einet.net/hytelnet/HYTELNET.html)
Do a search for <I>hazardous waste </I>and you'll get a listing
of six sites (ranging from the Environmental Protection Agency
to the University of Illinois Environmental Health and Safety
BBS) that can be telnetted to. The entry for each gives details
about the contents of the site and how to connect.
<P>

<H2>GOPHER</H2>
<HR>

<P>
The warm and fuzzy sounding gopher is actually an early hero of
the Internet frontier. Gopher is a client / server software package
developed at the University of Minnesota (the Fighting Gophers)
that lets you search for files and documents found in Internet-accessible
computers around the world. The development of the gopher search
was the beginning of easier access to millions of files (text,
audio, graphic). It was a vast improvement over the need to have
an exact file location and name and to do an FTP (file transfer
protocol) for a file.
<P>
Gopher searches come back as menus of items that match your search.
Knowing how to read the menus is important.
<P>
Even in the age of the <A HREF="carwww.htm">world wide web </A>,
gopher sites can contain files, reports, transcripts and documents
that are not yet incorporated into a www site. <HR>

<H4><B>Finding Gopher documents </B></H4>

<P>
There are a number of sites that help you locate gopher documents.
Here are a couple you can use.<BR>
<A HREF="gopher://cwis.usc.edu/11/Other_Gophers_and_Information_Resources/Gopher-Jewels">gopher://cwis.usc.edu/11/Other_Gophers_and_Information_Resources/Gopher-Jewels: </A>Gopher
Jewels, a gopher menu listing, by subject, rich gopher holes.
<P>
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.unr.edu/11/veronica">gopher://gopher.unr.edu/11/veronica: </A>Veronica
search menu, veronica searches for keywords in the titles of gopher
documents (making the need for good titling crucial). A good explanation
of veronica searching is found at that same site: gopher://gopher.unr.edu/11/veronica/veronica-faq
<P>
<A HREF="gopher://mudhoney.micro.umn.edu:4326/7">gopher://mudhoney.micro.umn.edu:4326/7 </A>:
Gopher name search (one of many sites where you can do a gopher
search).<HR>

<H4><B>Analysis of a Gopher Search</B> </H4>

<P>
We go to the gopher search utility at NYSERnet and enter the term
&quot;medicare&quot; into the search box.
<H5>gopher://empire.nysernet.org:2347/7 <BR>
Gopher Search<BR>
This is a searchable Gopher index. Use the search function of
your browser to enter search terms. </H5>

<H5>This is a searchable index. Enter search keywords: <I>medicare
</I></H5>
<HR>

<P>
The following is a sampling of the menu retrieved from the search
on &quot;medicare&quot;. In graphical displays, there is an icon
of a file folder for items that will give you another menu of
selections, or the icon of a piece of paper for items that will
take you to a document. In non-graphical displays, the punctuation
at the end of the item tells you about the item. A slash (/) takes
you to another menu of choices, a period (.) takes you to a document.
Look over the list of items retrieved:
<P>
1. <B>glossary of medicare-related terms .<BR>
</B>2 .<B> index; other publications about medicare .<BR>
</B>3.<B> what medicare does not pay for .<BR>

</B>13.<B> Medicare across the USA . <BR>
</B>14.<B> Medicare Outpatient Hospital Charges and Costs</B>

<P>
There are clearly some documents that could be very useful. Items
1, 3, 4 could be helpful in understanding medicare so that you
can explain it in your news story. Item 2 might take you to a
bibliography of readings that can help you get up to speed on
the topic. Item 7, an message from a newsgroup, sent by a danny
burstein (the [138] indicates how many lines this message is)
might be an interesting lead to a story idea. Item 9 might refer
you to a great new website for more information. Items 10 and
11 could be great lists with contact names for medicare carriers
and information offices. <HR>

<H4><B>The Trouble with Gophers</B></H4>

<P>
As easy as the searching part of using gophers is, just plug in
a keyword in the search box, the hard part is determining what
documents will be useful and retrieving the documents. Here are
some of the problems with using gophers:
<UL>
<LI><B>Where did it come from?: </B>There is no indication in
the menu listing who submitted the information or when it was
submitted. You have to retrieve the document and look for clues
in the document about who compiled the information or how current
it is (and that is not always clearly stated in the document).
You can sometimes try to decipher the site where the document
resides from the gopher address, but that is not always indicative
of who submitted the information.
<LI><B>Sorry, connection refused by the server...: </B>Gopher
holes are busy, and unstable and you'll quite often get a message
saying a particular server (the host computer) is not accepting
connections. It's a case of &quot;so near, and yet so far&quot;
- you know the document you may need is sitting there, but you
can't get to it.
<LI><B>Cannot access directory...:</B> The gopher search may find
the article, but the host doesn't allow &quot;outsiders&quot;
into the files.
<LI><B>Great title, but lousy content: </B>Sometimes the advance
billing doesn't match what you get when you get there. Look at
item 13, &quot;Medicare across the USA&quot;. Very promising title,
could be a listing of all offices, or a huge report on medicare
status state-by-state or a chart of coverage. Look what you retrieve:
</UL>

<P>

this is what you get when you retrieve it:

<P>
<I>---------------------------------------------------------------------
</I>
<P>
Hunh? Is this a listing of all Illinois hospital charges to Medicare
from Oct. 1988 to Sept. 1989? Does the number in the right column
reflect all charges - $2, 248,724.99 in outpatient charges, for
example? What is the variable referring to? Most important, who
can I talk to to clarify this? Sometimes the information retrieved
is a tease, or even worse, dangerous unless you take the critical
next step of finding and talking to the person or agency which
compiled the data. And the gopher document doesn't usually help
you accomplish that critical step.<HR>

<H2>WORLD WIDE WEB</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Two years ago, the World Wide Web (WWW), was just getting mentioned
in articles about new developments on the Internet. <A HREF="cargophe.htm">Gopher </A>was
the information distribution method of choice.
<P>
Since the middle of 1994, however, the World Wide Web has quickly
eclipsed gopher as the preferred method for compiling and publishing
sets of documents, files, photos, sound, and video clips. WWW
has become the primary way government agencies, news organizations,
associations, interest groups, and individuals with eclectic hobbies
package, display, and disseminate information on the Internet.
There are several reasons for this:
<UL>
<LI><B>Multi-media: </B>WWW pages, through the use of html (hyper-text
markup language) coding, can incorporate text, images, sound files
and video clips all together. The ability to deliver multiple
mediums in a single package has created a greater flexibility
in information delivery.
<LI><B>Interactive: </B>You can't respond or comment to a gopher
document. But you can click on a highlighted link on a Webpage
and get an e-mail box for sending an immediate message to the
compiler of the site. This instant access to the &quot;publisher&quot;
allows easier connection to the creator of the pages' content
(always a frustration with gopher documents).
<LI><B>Hyperlinked: </B>Gopher documents stood alone. Webpages
can link you to other pages or sites containing information relevant
to the topic you are looking for. This ability to &quot;give them
more&quot; makes Webpages an interesting way to package vast amounts
of information in logical ways.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>What you need to use the World Wide Web:</B></H4>

<P>
You must have full Internet access through an Internet provider
service or a direct line into your network to be able to use WWW.
You also need &quot;browser&quot; software. This software allows
the multimedia information on the Webpage to be easily displayed.
The software has three main functions:
<UL>
<LI><B>Locate / go to:</B> There is a box where you can type in
the URL (uniform resource locator) for the site you want to go
to.
<LI><B>Navigate:</B> Buttons or arrows allow you to go to the
next screen or go back to the screen just displayed.
<LI><B>Save: </B>The &quot;bookmark&quot; function is the most
important. When a good site is found, one you'd like to use again,
creating a bookmark entry for it will simplify it's retrieval
later.
</UL>

<P>
If you can do these three things, you can get around in the World
Wide Web.
<P>
You also need to find documents and Webpages. Look at <A HREF="carfind.htm">Finders </A>for
a list of some of the types of location aids available on the
Internet.<HR>

<H4><B>Types of Web sites and their uses:</B></H4>

<P>
<B>Federal government: </B>Government agencies are making their
files available, with easy to use search templates for finding
particular types of information.
<UL>
<LI>Find the latest 10-K filings for companies from the Securities
and Exchange Commission: <A HREF="http://www.sec.gov">http://www.sec.gov </A>
<LI>Search for population statistics from the Census Bureau: <A HREF="http://www.census.gov">http://www.census.gov </A>
<LI>Get the text of presidential speeches from the White House:
<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov </A>
<LI>Read the text of bills going before Congress: <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov">http://thomas.loc.gov </A>
</UL>

<P>
<B>Use for:</B> Go to interviews with background and facts that
your source may not want to tell you. Read text of previous speeches
when reporting on a current speech, see where opinions and statements
have changed. Find statistics that help illustrate a point you
are trying to make or put an event into a broader context.
<P>

<P>
<B>State government: </B>Increasingly, state governments are using
the Web to provide information about agencies' work, government
personnel and contact information, and legislative records. Some
states are providing lots of information online, others are just
beginning. Here's a sampling of what you can find:

<H4><B>Cautions and tips for using WWW:</B></H4>

<P>
<B>Know the site creator:</B> All things look equal on the Web.
Be careful in determining who is sponsoring and contributing information
to the site you are looking at. Do some background research before
you use their information as background research!
<P>
<B>Traffic can get heavy: </B>Even with a fast line and reliable
connection to the Internet, Web traffic can get heavy, especially
to popular sites. Don't rely on a Website to be available when
needed.
<P>
<B>Don't get lost: </B>Went to a great site last week and you
just know it will have the information you need now? Can't find
it again? You didn't use your bookmark! Learn how to use the bookmark
feature of your Web browser software, be consistent in it's use
and clean it up every so often. (Bookmark editing will let you
annotate what information is available on the site or what story
you used information from the site for - time taken now will save
time later, guaranteed.)
<P>
<B>Data is dirty </B>(on paper, electronically, over the phone...):
Use healthy skepticism (and a second source) if you are going
to use information you found online (or, for that matter, in a
book or magazine or from a person). Consider the source of the
information - data from a government source might be more reliable
than data provided in the press release from a special interest
group. If the information you are going to use is critical to
your story, or the key point you are making, take the time to
verify the information from another source.
<P>
<B>Site cites: </B>How do you cite the source of information you
get? Does the medium used to retrieve the information from an
agency matter, or is it just the source of the information you
need to attribute? Figure out citation guidelines for your newsroom.
Here are some readings about citing Internet sites, from &quot;A

<H2>READY REFERENCE</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ready reference, fast facts, those little details that sometimes
take longer to find than you know they should. Every useful library
has a good collection of dictionaries, biographical directories,
glossaries, quote books, encyclopedias, chronologies, statistical
abstracts, and gazeteers. If yours doesn't or that ready reference
book can't readily be found, try some of the growing resources
available in the virtual library shelves of the Internet.<HR>

<H4>CAUTIONS TO USING READY REFERENCE</H4>

<P>
Before we look at a sampling of the ready reference sources available
on the Internet we need to discuss some cautions when selecting
and using them:
<UL>
<LI><B>What is the source of the reference?: </B>Is the reference
an online version of a reputable reference source or is it a compilation
by a hobbyist?
<LI><B>When was the reference last updated?:</B> How current is
the online version, is there a more current print version, is
there a more current version online somewhere else?
<LI><B>Can you get to it?:</B> Some libraries make reference works
available on the Internet, but may have copyright or license restrictions
that allow only local or approved users access to the reference.
Don't be frustrated by finding a great title in a search, but
being denied access to the resource.
<LI><B>How easy is it to get to?: </B>If the connection to get
to the Webster's dictionary is unreliable or slow and you use
that dictionary all the time, figure out that it might be smarter
to invest in a pulp-based version of the reference book! Time
is money, spend it well.
<LI><B>How easy is it to search?: </B>Are you not finding information
that you just know must be there? Be skeptical about the reliability
of the search engine, ask questions of the resource provider to
make sure you are using the resource properly.
<LI><B>If it's not on the Internet that doesn't mean it doesn't
exist:</B> Repeat after me, &quot;All the knowledge of the world
is NOT on the Internet, all the knowledge of the world is NOT
on the Internet.&quot; Don't think that if you can't find it on
the WWW there isn't anything on the topic. While Internet resources
are growing quickly, there are billions of valuable reference
books that are not, and probably will not, be available through
Internet access. The Internet is a good source of supplementary
information for some kinds of information searches. As valuable
a resource as it is, it is not the be-all, end-all information
tool.
</UL>

<P>
With those cautions understood, let's look at some examples of
ready reference sources on the Internet.<HR>

<H2>FINDERS: Robots, Spiders, Indexes, and Scouts </H2>
<HR>

<H3>The half of knowledge is to know where to find knowledge*
<BR>
</H3>
<HR>

<P>
The vast and overwhelming resources of the Internet, particularly
the World Wide Web, are becoming more manageable thanks to the
efforts of software developers and site compilers. There are a
variety of ways people are trying to help you find the resource
you need, the site that can help or the document with the information
you're looking for. It is important that you understand how each
of them works, what exactly they cover and what is really happening
when you put in that keyword.
<P>
Following is a discussion of the types of finding aids available,
how they work, cautions when using them and a few examples of
that type of finding aid. The main thing to remember, though,
is there is no single comprehensive index to the information available
on the Internet. Staying focused and clear about what you need
to find, and flexible in your techniques for finding are the keys
to success when seeking relevant sites. <HR>

<H4><B>COMPUTER GENERATED INDEXES: Spiders / Crawlers</B></H4>

<P>
Spiders (AKA Web crawlers) are programs which go out and retrieve
information about files and Web pages sitting in computers all
over the Internet. They then compile vast look-up databases which
are used to match requests for sites with particular words in
them.
<P>
<B>What you need to know to use them:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>What networks they check: Some spiders have a wider range
they check than others.
<LI>What sources they check: Do they index Webpages only, or do
they include messages on newsgroups or gopher documents.
<LI>How often do they update: Look for spiders that update frequently,
you'll be less likely to get references to inactive sites.
<LI>How do they generate the index: Some index every word on the
Web page, others just the title and header information.
<LI>How do they rank the returns on your search: Read the FAQ
about the search aid you use to understand how hits are ranked.
Some ways might be by number of times search terms occur in a
particular page or document, location of search terms on the page
(higher up on the page is higher rank), search term in the title
has higher rank than further down in the document.
<LI>Can you get to it when you need it: Some of the more popular,
free search aids are difficult to get to, too much traffic. If
locating sites on the Internet is a critical part of your work,
you might consider one of the aids that costs, they tend to have
less traffic and are more accessible.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Examples:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>OPEN TEXT<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.opentext.com/omw/f-omw.html">http://www.opentext.com/omw/f-omw.html</A>
<BR>
1,000,000 indexed pages. Every word on the page is indexed.
<LI>LYCOS<BR>
<A HREF="http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/">http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/ </A>
<BR>
634,000 references. Title, headings, first 20 lines are indexed
only.
<LI>INFOSEEK<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com/">http://www.infoseek.com/ </A>
<BR>
Over 400,000 Web pages, mailing list archives searched by every
word. Costs $9.95 / month.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>COMPUTER GENERATED INDEXES: Human </B></H4>

<P>
Some search aids rely on human submitted descriptions of the document
or Webpage for the text that is searched. These types of indexes
might have a higher rate of relevant hits on searches because
the descriptions are more targeted.
<P>
<B>What you need to know to use them:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>What is searched: Is just the annotation about the site searched
or is there a combination of that and the Webpage title and header.
<LI>Who submitted the description of the site: The quality of
the description is critical if this is the key to finding relevant
sites. Search aids with some editorial control over the description
fare better than ones that just take any submitted description.
<LI>What types of sites are included: There may be a certain area
of specialty or concentration that one finding aid might have
over another. Read the description of the search services' coverage
carefully (and if they don't give you enough information, e-mail
the host of the site with your questions).
</UL>

<P>
<B>Examples:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>ALIWEB<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nexor.co.uk/public/aliweb/aliweb.html">http://web.nexor.co.uk/public/aliweb/aliweb.html </A>
<BR>

<LI>HARVEST HOME<BR>
<A HREF="http://town.hall.org/Harvest/brokers/www-home-pages/">http://town.hall.org/Harvest/brokers/www-home-pages/ </A>
<BR>
110,000 documents indexed by author, keyword, title, URL.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>EDITED DIRECTORIES (with search capabilities)</B></H4>

<P>
The earliest attempts at cataloging the resources of the Internet
were with organized directories listing good sites. They generally
were organized in hierarchical subjects, making the location of
sites good for general topics easy. Usually these aids also incorporate
a search engine, allowing you to find sites on a particular topic.
<P>
<B>What you need to know to use them:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>What is the subject hierarchy: How is the finding aid organized,
is the organization logical and can it be approached from a variety
of angles?
<LI>How have the subjects been assigned: Is this human editing
or computer generated indexing of submitted descriptions - again,
the quality of the description is critical.
<LI>What is the search engine searching: Is a search of the aid
looking only at assigned subject terms or at all the words of
the sites' description.
</UL>

<P>
<B>Examples:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Yahoo!<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.yahoo.com/">http://www.yahoo.com/ </A><BR>

</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>SCOUTS</B></H4>

<P>
I use the term &quot;scouts&quot; because it refers to those brave
souls who forge ahead of the rest of the explorers to see what's
coming up, and because a good scout is helpful, thoughtful and
kind. Those people who have scouted and are good scouts are helping
to compile lists of sites and resources that can help you in your
reporting. Almost every topic has someone who has taken on the
task of locating, evaluating and then compiling lists of sites
and documents that contain good and useful information.
<P>
<B>What you need to know to use them:</B> 
<UL>
<LI>Who put it together (and what do they know?): Find out as
much as possible the thinking behind the evaluation and compilation
of the list of links.
<LI>How often is the list updated: List compiled then forgotten
will be full of dead links and will not have the latest and greatest
resources.
<LI>How are they organized: What is the logic in the organization
of the links? By topic (some newsroom pages are organized by beat),
by resource type (lists of news groups, lists of Websites...)
Find the lists that are most helpfully arranged.
<LI>What information do they give: Look for lists compiled by
scouts that have some annotation about the site they are sending
you to. There are so many places with information on particular
topics, evaluating between them should be part of the work the
scout does for you.

<H2>NEWS FILTERS</H2>
<HR>

<H4><B>What are News Filters?</B></H4>

<P>
Do you have the time to routinely scan all the news groups on
the Internet for messages that might be interesting? Do you get
all the newswires and read through them for stories about a topic
or event you're following? Do you wish you could? You can.
<P>
News filters are software programs running at various places on
the Internet and on commercial information services. While the
directions for use, the services and information feeds monitored,
and the cost vary for each one, they all work basically the same
way. The user types in words about the types of topics you want
the filter to catch. The software stores your interest profile
and uses it to check the stories or messages it filters. When
it finds a story or message containing the words you have in your
profile, the program snags it and posts it to your e-mail box
(or an area on the service you can check). <HR>

<H4><B>Uses of News Filters </B></H4>

<P>
If you are getting ready to do a major investigation or project,
create a wire service news filter on the topic you will be writing
about. You'll get stories from around the world which relate to
the story you will be writing about, great for background and
to broaden the perspective of your reporting.
<P>
Looking for sources, people who are interested or knowledgable
about a topic? Use a message news filter and you'll get the messages
posted by individuals that contain the words you are interested
in. They can then be contacted through e-mail for more comment.
<HR>

<H4><B>Types of News Filters </B></H4>

<P>
<B>Saved Profiles:</B> Some services allow you to store topic
searches you do routinely, and the service checks the resources
against that profile when requested. This saves you the time of
re-inputting a search request. An example of this type of news
filter is Infoseek's &quot;Personal Newswire&quot; <A HREF="http://www.infoseek.com">http://www.infoseek.com </A>(which
costs) or SIFT &quot;Stanford Information Filtering Tool&quot;
<A HREF="http://sift.stanford.edu/">http://sift.stanford.edu/ </A>(which
is free).
<P>
<B>Newswire Filters:</B> Services such at &quot;NewsHound&quot;
on America Online and &quot;Executive News Service&quot; on Compuserve
filter wire stories against the profiles you've submitted. When
stories matching your terms are found, they are posted to your
personal e-mail box. These cost a premium, over the cost of accessing
the service ($4.95 / month for up to five profiles for NewsHound,
an additional $15 / hr. for accessing Executive News Service).
Dialog also allows custom search profiles to be developed, new
articles posted to any of the databases are put into a personal
folder for you.
<P>
Doug Oard maintains a list of Information Filtering Resources
at <A HREF="http://www.ee.umd.edu/medlab/filter/">http://www.ee.umd.edu/medlab/filter/ </A>
<HR>

<H4><B>Cautions for Using News Filters</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Choose your words for the profile very carefully:</B> You
must be specific enough that you get relevant hits, but not so
specific that possible stories are not caught.
<LI><B>Know how the filter works: </B>Some will match character
by character - the profile word &quot;labor&quot; won't find &quot;labour&quot;.
Others work on a relevancy model where similar words will be caught,
too, but given a lower relevance in the results calculation. For
example, search for &quot;Eyal&quot; (the name of the radical
Israeli group Rabin's assassin belonged to) in a relevancy search
and it will find articles with &quot;eye&quot; or &quot;eyes&quot;
as well.
<LI><B>Know what the filter is filtering: </B>If you hope to be
notified of any messages about a new medication posted to alt.support.depression
be sure you know if your news filter monitors that area. DejaNews,
for example, doesn't filter messages posted to alt.*, soc.*, talk.*
or *.binaries news groups.
<LI><B>Know what you're paying for the service: </B>Some charge
for the storage and running of the profile, others just charge
for the time you are connected, others are free. Careful consumers
will comparison shop!
<LI><B>Bottom line - read the FAQ: </B>Virtually every service
has an FAQ (frequently asked questions) list which will answer
all your questions about how the search engine works, how often
the files are searched, how you can modify for better results.
Take the time to find, and read, the FAQ or user manual - it will
save time in the long run.

<H2>E-NEWS: Newspapers online</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Newspapers have discovered cyberspace, and not only as a resource
for research. There has been a rush by news organizations to explore
the Internet and commercial information services as a new way
to connect with their readers, find alternatives to newsprint
for news delivery, and to experiment with how news can be reported
with an interactive, hyperlinked, multimedia medium. According
to Steve Outing, tracker of online news services, as of November
1995, about 580 commercial newspapers worldwide have or are developing
online news services.
<P>
There are three primary approaches newspapers are taking in exploring
the opportunities and obstacles to new news delivery:<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="carbbs.htm">Bulletin board services: </A>With off-the-shelf
software, some dedicated staff time, and a small investment in
hardware, some newspapers are hosting standalone bulletin boards
out of their offices. These services allow you to send e-mail
messages and read files with information from the newspaper. Some
systems charge nothing for the service; readers get the daily
password from the newspaper. Others let in everyone free to the
basic areas, but charge additionally for access to the databases.
Others have subscription rates, cheaper for newspaper subscribers
than for non-subscribers.
<P>
<B>Examples: </B>
<UL>
<LI>Albuquerque Tribune - The Electronic Trib - 505-823-3664 (for
information)
<LI>Bismarck Tribune - North Dakota Online - 701-255-2579 (modem)
<LI>Evansville Courier - Courier Online - 812-424-1099
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="carhybri.htm">Commercial information services: </A>For
a short time in late '93 and early '94, many organizations were
rushing to make deals with commercial information services like
Prodigy and America Online. They host areas on the service which
featured news stories, message areas and other information files.
Their users may have the newspaper's area the front door to the
other services offered. Other newspapers are more like boutiques
which users may choose to go to in the commercial information
services' mall.
<P>
<B>Examples (not a comprehensive list):</B> 
<UL>
<LI><B>On America Online: </B>Chicago Tribune, New York Times,
Orlando Sentinel, San Jose Mercury News
<LI><B>On Compuserve:</B> Detroit Free Press, Florida Today, USA
Today
<LI><B>On Prodigy: </B>Atlanta Journal, Dayton Daily News, Hartford
Courant, Southam Newspapers, Tampa Tribune
</UL>
<HR>

<P>
<A HREF="carwww.htm">WWW </A>: Currently, the most excitement
over online newspapers is being generated by use of the world
wide web. Newspapers are rushing to the web with products which
incorporate the best of the features of hypertext, multimedia
products. They are taking a number of approaches to developing
their online news products, here are some things they are doing:
<P>
<B>World Wide Publisher:</B> Raleigh News &amp; Observer's Nando
service (<A HREF="http://www.nando.net">http://www.nando.net </A>)
has full news coverage, special features available only on the
web and considers itself a world-wide publication.
<P>
<B>Regional Specialty:</B> Indianapolis newspapers' Speednet (
<A HREF="http://www.starnews.com/speednet/">http://www.starnews.com/speednet/ </A>)
focuses on Indianapolis' specialty, auto racing, with this online
paper featuring racing stories, background, statistics and information
on upcoming events.
<P>
<B>Story Specialty: </B>The Spartanburg Herald - Journal (<A HREF="http://www.teleplex.net/SHJ/smith/">http://www.teleplex.net/SHJ/smith/ </A>)has
taken it's coverage of the Susan Smith murder and put it online.
<P>
<B>Community Specialty: </B>Western News ( <A HREF="http://www.libby.org/WesternNews/Welcome.html">http://www.libby.org/WesternNews/Welcome.html </A>),
Montana's only online newspaper's aim is, &quot;to show to the
world a weekly snapshot of the communities of Libby and Troy in
northwest Montana.&quot;
<P>
<B>Alliances: Newspaper and Radio:</B> WinonaNet (in Minnesota)
(<A HREF="http://www.luminet.net/winnet/">http://www.luminet.net/winnet/ </A>).
<HR>

<H4><B>Finding E-News</B></H4>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.newslink.org/menu.html">Newslink</A> offers
lists of newspaper, magazine and broadcast sites on the Internet.
<P>
For a comprehensive and well organized list of news organizations'
electronic product ventures check out <A HREF="http://www.mediainfo.com/edpub/e-papers.home.page.html">Steve Outing's list</A>
on the Editor and Publisher website. His FAQ on online newspapers
is an excellent backgrounder on the topic.
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.infi.net/naa/hot.html">Newspaper Association of America's </A>web
has a listing of newspapers on the web.<HR>

<H4><B>What newspapers are offering online</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Same day text of the newspaper:</B> Read this morning's
edition online. Since there are no newshole constraints, the online
version may be considerably longer than the newsprint version.
<I><B>Use in news research:</B> Get different, regional takes
on big news stories. Seeing sources used and angles covered may
give you ideas for follow-up stories.</I> 
<LI><B>Back issues: </B>Some newspapers online have several days,
weeks or even months of stories available. Sometimes these past
archives are searchable, others can just be retrieved by date.
<I><B>Use in news research:</B> Readily available background on
news stories from different regions can add perspective.</I> 
<LI><B>Archives of news stories: </B>A few newspapers have full-text,
free-text access to their news archives. While these are usually
an additional cost, the charge is considerably less than commercial
database services. The advantage of this is the lower cost, the
disadvantage is the need to go from one database to another, there
is not the &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; available from the large
database vendors. <I><B>Use in news research: </B>Check the archives
of a area's publication when someone influential comes to your
town from there - see what they were up to in their old hometown.
</I>
<LI><B>Forums and discussion areas:</B> Talk to us! Newspapers
are creating discussion areas for readers to comment about the
news coverage and to hold conversations about topics and concerns
in their community. <I><B>Use in news research:</B> If there is
something that is going to happen in your town that just happened
in another town, you can post a message to that community's forum
and ask for comment about the event or read the reactions people
had to the event. </I>
<LI><B>Reference and community contacts: </B>Many online news
services are developing basic reference files about their traditional
circulation areas. Listings of community contacts, events, resources
are being provided. <I><B>Use in news research:</B> Handy look-up
of key community contacts can be there when needed. Great source
for ready reference checks of spellings and proper names.</I>

<H2>E-TV: Television stations online</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Television stations have been considered late-bloomers in the
use of computers both for reporting and research as well as in
the area of delivering alternative news products.  But they are
catching up quickly in both areas.  When television stations first
came to the 'net, it was primarily as a public relations tool.
 There was information about the news anchors and some of the
programs.  Now, many television stations are developing rich and
unique deposits of information, reports and graphics which supplement
their nightly newscasts.  Now, researchers interested in how local
news organizations have covered certain stories can check not
just the print organizations, but the broadcast offerings as well.
<HR>

<H4><B>Finding E-TV</B></H4>

<P>
The best site for locating both national and international television
sites on the Internet is <A HREF="http://tvnet.com/TVnet.html">TV Net</A>.
 There are links to U.S. and World TV Home Pages.<HR>

<H4><B>What television stations are offering online</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Scripts of news programs:  </B>Didn't catch the name of
the doctor mentioned in the package on a new cancer treatment?
 Get the text from the teleprompters and find it.  <BR>
<I>An example:</I>  <A HREF="http://www.kvoa.com/news/">KVOA-TV</A>
(Tucson, AZ)  Click on the &quot;scripts&quot; icon and go to
listing of scripts available.
<LI><B>Investigative Packages:   </B>The text and, sometimes,
frames from the video from large investigative stories are being
posted on some e-tv sites.<BR>
<I>An example:</I>  <A HREF="http://www.wdiv.com/special.html">WDIV-TV </A>(Detroit,
MI)  Investigative reporter <A HREF="http://www.wdiv.com/mwendlnd.html">Mike Wendland</A>
is providing not just the text of the stories he's investigated,
but the background data used in reporting the story.  The explanations
of how the data was found and analyzed are great lessons in computer
assisted reporting.
<LI><B>Editorials: <BR>
</B><I>An example:</I>  <A HREF="http://www.kcbs2.com/">KCBS-TV</A>
 (Los Angeles, CA)  Weekly editorials are posted (with a box for
sending comments attached at the end) and there is an <A HREF="http://www.kcbs2.com/002/003/002/index.html">archive</A>
of the editorials for the past eight months.
<LI><B>Photos:</B>  Some sites are making interesting use of photos:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.whnt19.com/weather/towercam.html">WHNT-TV</A>
(Huntsville, AL) presents hourly photos of the weather in the
hill country of Huntsville from their Tower Cam (and they will
show radar system images in severe weather).
<LI><B>Audio and Video:</B>  Many believe television has a distinct
advantage over newspapers in the creation of multimedia products
because they have been creating a multitude of mediums for years
(text, audio and video).  Some are incorporating these elements
into news stories for the web.<BR>
<I>An example:</I>  <A HREF="http://www.kvoa.com/news/">KVOA-TV</A>
(Tucson, AZ)  Their Online Lead feature often includes audio and
video clips along with the text of the story.  A nice feature
is the addition of links to more information on the story being
covered.
<LI><B>Archives of news stories:</B>  News databases, accessible
by sophisticated search engines, are new developments for most
television stations.  Some are being made available through the
Internet.<BR>
<I>An example:</I>  <A HREF="http://www.kpix.com:80/news-archives/">KPIX</A>
(San Francisco, CA)
<LI><B>Forums and discussion areas:</B> Talk to us! Like newspapers,
television stations are creating discussion areas for viewers
to comment about the news coverage and to hold conversations about
topics and concerns in their community.  Many stations, even if
they don't yet have a website, are posting their e-mail addresses
to allow better access to reporters, producers and directors.

<H2>GETTING STARTED</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Getting into database searching, using bulletin board services
or connecting to the Internet requires considerable investment
for three 'wares: hardware, software, and wetware.
<P>
The hardware is the computer, modem, printers and other equipment.
The software is the programs needed to do various operations (sending
e-mail, logging into remote computers). The wetware is you, the
operator of the hardware and software.<HR>

<P>
<B>HARDWARE: </B>Almost any type of computer will work, programs
are being written that allow virtually the same applications to
run no matter what operating system you are using. However, Windows
is closer to a standard than almost any other platform and programs
almost always are written first for the Windows environment. One
set-up recommended by participants of a Poynter Institute Computer
Assisted Reporting seminar follows:
<UL>
<LI>486 DX2-66 personal computer with 16 megabytes RAM and 1.2-gigabyte
hard drive -- $3,000
<LI>28.8-kbps modem (external) -- $250
<LI>New b/w ink jet or used laser printer -- $300
</UL>

<P>
<B>Tips:</B> 
<P>
<B>Shop around: </B>Have your list of minimum requirements for
a computer set-up and comparison shop. Don't buy things you don't
need, don't neglect things you do (especially speed and storage
space).
<P>
<B>Talk to people:</B> There are plenty of byteheads that would
be pleased to help you think through the kind of rig you need.
Take a tech to lunch - it will be worth the investment.
<P>
<B>Investigate savings programs: </B>Lots of news organizations
are offering employee discounts on computer purchases or interest
free loans for computer buys. Investigate what types of programs
are offered.
<P>
<B>Don't forget at tax time:</B> This is a business expense, be
sure to write off the cost of your computer purchase on your income
tax - the savings you get might be enough to buy that software
upgrade you need!
<P>
<B>Plan for obsolescence:</B> It's guaranteed, the state of the
art computer you buy this week will be old technology next year.
Know what is &quot;good enough&quot; for you and don't be tempted
to constantly upgrade, but do plan to invest in a new machine
every 3-5 years!<HR>

<P>
<B>SOFTWARE: </B>The programs needed to get into the services
and databases you want to use. There are several types:
<P>
<B>Service software: </B>Some database services and commercial
information services have their own software packages, usually
given away for free, that are needed to use the service. Usually
this software makes most of the searching point and click, rather
than having to type in commands.
<P>
<B>Communications software: </B>If you are going to be using standalone
bulletin board services or some boutique commercial services (not
accessible through <A HREF="cartelne.htm">telnet </A>) you will
need to buy and install communications software such as Procomm
Plus or Crosstalk or Microphone. This software allows your computer
to send and receive data to and from other computers, based on
the setup of the transmitting computer.
<P>
<B>Applications software: </B>Certain applications you will want
to be able to do on the Internet require their own software. E-mail
software, browsers and telnet, for example, are different software
applications that must be installed in order to be able to do
them. Most Internet service providers (ie: America Online, Prodigy,
Compuserve) have these separate application software packages
bundled in with their service software. If you are running the
Internet with an in-house connection, these software packages
will probably be installed on your network.<HR>

<P>
<B>WETWARE: </B>Even if you have the most powerful computer set-up
and start-of-the-art software loaded, you still have a long way
to go before you are ready to go online and use databases and
the Internet. Understanding how to navigate through the various
information resource types, how to construct a search in particular
types of databases, how to evaluate the results you get takes
time, study and careful reading of the documentation about the
database.
<P>
<B>Tips:</B> 
<P>
<B>Schedule &quot;wander-time&quot;:</B> Make cruising the Internet,
locating useful sites and carefully noting where they are a part
of your job description. Negotiate with your boss to have Internet
wandering time scheduled into your work week with the promise
of compiling sites that would be useful to the rest of the newsroom
as an incentive.
<P>
<B>RTFM: </B>Read The Friendly Manual (you may have heard other
versions of this acronym, but <I>friendly</I> works, too, because
most manuals and FAQs are written in a user-friendly, helpful
way.) Take the time to read the documentation, you'll discover
what the search engine is really doing and how to avoid getting
too many or too few hits.
<P>
<B>Talk to an expert researcher:</B> but don't expect them to
be able to tell all their searching secrets in a single session.
Think of it this way, would you sit down and ask a lawyer to explain
how to practice law? Professional researchers have spent years
researching and countless hours honing their searching skills
and developing their bank of knowledge about where the best resources
are. Passing on to you this hard-earned knowledge is no simple
task.
<P>
<B>Go to a training class: </B>If you have access to Nexis in
your newsroom, see about attending a Nexis training session. If
you have Internet access but haven't been given training in your
newsroom, see if the community college or university in town holds
Internet introduction classes. <HR>

<H2>RESEARCH PRIORITIES</H2>
<HR>

<P>
The most pressing question for many people when making online
information choices is, &quot;Which service should I subscribe
to if I have a limited budget for online research?&quot;
<P>
The answer to that question is another question, &quot;What is
it you need to do?&quot; Figuring out your research priorities
will help you specify research needs and focus on those services
that can best fulfill those needs.
<P>
This exercise was developed to help you prioritize your information
needs. Look over each of the types of research needs listed then
rank the level of need by the following three factors:
<UL>
<LI><B>HOW OFTEN. </B>Write the number of times each day you do
that particular type of research.
<LI><B>ACCESS NOW.</B> Rank between 1-5 to indicate how satisfactory
access is now to resources for this type of need.<BR>
<B>1</B> = very satisfactory access to needed information. <B>5
</B>= almost impossible to easily get needed information.
<LI><B>IMPORTANCE. </B>Rank between 1-5 to indicate the importance
of this type of research. <BR>
<B>1</B> = If I can't get it, I can write around it. <B>5</B>=
This is absolutely critical to my reporting. <BR>

</UL>

<P>
For example, look at the first entry in the <A HREF="carneedt.htm">Information Needs Assessment</A>
(Background individuals who find themselves in the news.) If you
are looking up people you need to locate for comment or interviews
10 times a day, put 10 in column 1.
<P>
If you have wonderful access to people finder database services
and can almost always &quot;get your man&quot;, put 1 in column
2.
<P>
If it is definitely preferable to locate the people, but you can
always write around it if you can't find them, then put 3 in column
3.
<P>
Add together the numbers you get from all three factors. &quot;Background
people in the news&quot; would get a total of 14.
<P>
When you've completed the Information Needs Assessment, the items
with the highest ranking are your areas of greatest research need.

<H2>INFORMATION CONSUMERISM</H2>
<HR>

<P>
What does a smart consumer look for when shopping? With real estate,
it's location, location, and location. With automobiles, it's
make, model, and mileage. With information services it's content,
cost and customer service.
<P>
Information shoppers need to keep the three C's in mind when they
comparison shop the information resource options. For each database
you might need, there can be a number of vendor options for access.
For each vendor, there are different pricing options available.
Here are some of the things you should factor in as you make decisions
about where to spend your data dollars.<HR>

<H4><B>CONTENT: What the services offer</B> </H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>What do you need the most?:</B> Before you shop, know what
you are looking for or you may come home with something nice that
just sits in the closet. Take the <A HREF="carasse.htm">information needs assessment </A>inventory
to figure out what your information priorities are. This will
help you narrow down to the kinds of services which will best
fill your biggest information needs.
<LI><B>Which service has the files you need?: </B>If you are in
Florida and your needs assessment shows that state-wide news coverage
is a big priority, look at the full-text news vendors and see
which has more Florida newspapers available than the others. If
you are a reporter in Georgia and need access to public records,
look at the public records re-sellers and see which one has the
better offering of Georgia state and county records. Knowing what
you need, then knowing what is offered will help you target the
best services to explore.
<LI><B>Which service has the most comprehensive file?: </B>You've
determined that access to Washington Post files is a high priority.
The Washington Post is available on DataTimes, Dialog, Dow Jones
and Nexis. Now you need to compare: which has the oldest material
(Nexis - started Jan. 1977), which has the newest material (Nexis
has same day access to the Post's A section), which has the most
comprehensive coverage of the paper (DataTimes - includes citations
to non-Post staff written articles, the other databases don't
indicate non-staff stories at all). Many newspapers and magazines'
text are available on a number of services - comparison shop.
<LI><B>Which service has the cleanest, most up-to-date database:
</B>Some vendors are better about updating news databases with
corrections and changes than others. Some have backlogs in their
updating. Determine as much as possible the housekeeping and maintenance
standards of the vendors and pick the one that does a better job
of upkeeping their service's files. With public records databases,
determine how often the records are updated, driver's records
updated weekly are better than those updated monthly and if it's
only updated annually, don't rely on the database too much!
<LI><B>Software: </B>How is the service searched, how easy is
it to get to the content, how logically is the service organized.
A service with difficult commands or obtuse organization will
be frustrating and costly to use. Test drive services as much
as possible before buying to get a sense of how they will be to
use.
<LI><B>Other content: </B>You may be interested in a particular
service because of a certain file available, but also consider
what else you are getting by subscribing. If you're choosing a
commercial information service (AOL, Delphi, Prodigy or CompuServe,
for example) for it's Internet access - be sure to consider the
other features specific to that service. If one service has a
strong offering of medical related information and forums and
medical coverage a priority, that may be the deciding factor on
which service to use.

<H4><B>COST: The up-front, and hidden charges of using the data
</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Sign-up fee: </B>What money do you have to cough up just
to sign up? What does the sign-up fee give you: training support,
user manuals, search software? Can you negotiate on the sign-up
fee?
<LI><B>Monthly or Annual fee: </B>Is there a monthly or annual
subscription fee, payable whether you use the service or not?
What does this subscription fee give you: a certain number of
hours access before a per hour charge kicks in, training support
or customer service support, user updates or newsletter? Can this
monthly fee be negotiated or might it be cheaper to pay an annual
fee?
<LI><B>Telecommunications: </B>What do you have to pay to connect
your computer to their computer? Is the telecommunications charge
wrapped into the online access charge or is it a separate line?
What are your telecommunications options: long distance phone
call, 800-number, Sprintnet, Tymnet, can you <A HREF="cartelne.htm">telnet </A>?
<LI><B>Access: </B>How are you charged for using the database:
by the amount of time you are online, different charges for different
databases? Can you get flat rate subscriptions and pay a set amount
each month no matter how long you use the service? Can you get
flat rate for certain specific files you use frequently and pay
as you use for the others?
<LI><B>Display / print: </B>Is there a charge for looking at or
printing the documents found from your search? Is the charge by
document type, fields displayed, number of lines displayed, number
of screens displayed? Is it cheaper to print online or to capture
your search and print off-line?
<LI><B>Extras: </B>Do you get software upgrades automatically
and for free? Do you have to pay for training sessions? Do you
get user manuals for free or must you buy them? How many people

<H2>TIPS FOR SAVING TIME AND MONEY ONLINE:</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Budgeting for online research has changed dramatically over the
past several years. Commercial database services are aggressively
offering flexible pricing options. Newsrooms are purchasing datalines
linking them directly to the Internet and it's array of research
resources. (see <A HREF="carconsu.htm">Information Consumerism </A>for
more on pricing and access options). Online research has more
reasonably priced options than ever before, thanks to competition
and market demand.
<P>
But you still need to develop some research conservation techniques.
You may have unlimited money (ha!), but there is only so much
time. Unfocused or uninformed research can quickly become black
holes of disappearing time. Here, then, are some tips to help
you make the most of your online budget, help you avoid information
overload, and ensure that your research time is well spent.<HR>

<H4>Prepare, prepare, prepare</H4>

<P>
Professional researchers always say most of the time spent doing
online research should be spent off-line. Ask yourself the <A HREF="carquest.htm">whos, whats, whens, wheres, whys </A>of
your research before you plunge in. You must have a clear question
in mind, otherwise, you won't know when you've found the answer!
<HR>

<H4>Focus, focus, focus</H4>

<P>
Initially, and particularly with cruising the Internet, wandering
time through databases and online resources is valuable and necessary.
However, once you start real research, staying focused on your
research need is essential, particularly in the world of endlessly
linking web documents. If you don't want to click aimlessly, (albeit
entertainingly) all over cyberspace, you must keep your specific
information destination in mind and STOP when you've accomplished
your research task.<HR>

<H4>Build a &quot;best resources&quot; bookmark list or database
of databases</H4>

<P>
Develop a way in your newsroom to build an annotated list of the
best resources for certain types of questions. A simple flat file
database could be used to create entries identifying and describing
useful databases within commercial services or resources that
were used to answer tough questions. If a method is created allowing
everyone to contribute what they've found to be useful, this would
quickly become a valuable time saving resource. For Internet sites,
create a universal bookmark list or, even better, a well designed
webpage of useful places.<HR>

<H4>Use customer service</H4>

<P>
If you are searching in an unfamiliar database or in a rigidly
structured research field (patents or legal cases, for example),
save yourself time by calling the database search <A HREF="csupport.htm">support line </A>provided
by the vendor or the database producer (usually listed in the
vendor's information sheets). They will help you identify likely
databases to try, and sometimes run the search themselves as they
help you develop a search strategy. <HR>

<H4>Ask for advice from pros</H4>

<P>
Post a message about a particular research problem to a <A HREF="carlists.htm">listserv </A>or
<A HREF="carnewsg.htm">newsgroup </A>and ask for advice about
likely ways to approach the search. By tapping into the experience
of others, you can save time yourself. Use this technique sparingly,
however. Nothing will prompt flames as fast as postings that seem
like you are just being lazy. Ask for advice, don't ask for the
answer! <HR>

<H4>Take advantage of free time and practice files</H4>

<P>
Most commercial database vendors have practice areas and offer
special deals on new files to get people acquainted with them.
Most commercial bulletin board services offer a free month of
service to lure people in to using them. Take advantage of this
free time to hone your searching skills and familiarize yourself
with the features of the service - this will save you time later.
<HR>

<H4>Use custom search software</H4>

<P>
Several commercial database vendors provide software packages
that make searching easier, with graphical user interfaces (point
and click) or search menus rather than command lines you have
to type in. Be sure to ask the vendor about search software options
available. You may end up spending less time typing.<HR>

<H4>Know your search &quot;engine&quot;</H4>

<P>
Take the time to understand just what is happening when the search
service you are using is conducting the search. Is it matching
character by character or is it using fuzzy logic? Are results
given in reverse chronological order or by relevance of the document
by weight of the search terms in it? Is it automatically searching
for plurals, or must you specify singular or plural? Knowing what
is happening will help you construct a more effective search and
interpret your results accurately.<HR>

<H4>When you're stumped, get off</H4>

<P>
If you are online, particularly with a per-minute charge search,
and you are getting too much or too little information from your
search, don't try to re-construct your search while online. Get
off, re-think your strategy, and then get back on. Don't wallow
around as the dollars tick away.<HR>

<H4>Have an information coach and develop a league of research
expertise</H4>

<P>
The playing field of the information world is too broad for any
one person to cover - you need an information team. Develop resource
expertise throughout the newsroom, managed by an information coach
(used to be known as the librarian!). The information coach needs
to be someone who understands the use and misuse of information,
and who knows how to shop for the best bargains. The information
coach should spot strengths in the newsroom, those who can take
specific positions (he'll cover environmental resources, she'll
know about people-finding) and develop ways to share their knowledge.
The information coach must develop ways to provide opportunities
for the newsroom to practice using valuable research sources.
The coach may pinch-hit occasionally, but for the most part, they're
there to lead players to the best strategy for searching, not
to do the searching themselves. (Read <A HREF="http://www.hvu.nl/~pverweij/co4.html">New Roles for News Librarians </A>for
other ideas about the role of the librarian in the changing world
of computer assisted research.)<HR>

<H2>CD-ROM: Off-line alternative to online databases</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Compact discs are influencing newsroom decisions about online
service budgeting. In the past several years, almost half the
newspapers available through commercial services have come out
with compact disc versions of their databases. Some key reference
books, long available in online versions, have also been released
on disc. Just as with online information, compact discs allow
for much more flexibility of retrieval than the print version.
Some multimedia compact discs provide information well beyond
what would be available in print. For newsrooms attempting to
get a handle on research costs and expand their library of reference
works, the alternative of purchasing databases on compact disc
has some distinct advantages, but there are also some disadvantages
to be aware of. Let's look at both:<HR>

<H4><B>Advantages</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI>Set purchase price makes it easy to budget.
<LI>Cost vs return can be easy to analyze and justify with CD
purchases by figuring the number of times this type of information
is accessed, what it would cost to do a similar search online,
and how much it would cost per search on the CD.
<LI>No transaction cost; once purchased, you can use it as much
as you want, for as long as you want.
<LI>Easier to search; usually there are several levels of search
allowed by the search software (beginner, advanced) and there
is on disc help.
<LI>End-user search tool, because there is no online cost to keep
in control, this can be used by the person needing the information.
<LI>Without online dollars ticking away, you can be more creative
in using the database, browse for ideas rather than having to
quickly search.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Disadvantages</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI>Not as up-to-date as the online service; there is often a
three-month time lag for updates for newspapers on disc. You must
still have online database accounts to get the most current information.
<LI>Requires additional equipment and a higher grade computer
to run the CD player.
<LI>Requires learning a new search interface from the online version,
which can be confusing when going from current to more archival
records.
<LI>The search interface can be different from one product to
another. If you have a number of CDs there will be different instructions
required for each.
<LI>Discs can be easy to steal or lose, and they are expensive
products. Online is secure.
<LI>Like books, they allow only one access at a time.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Questions to Ask</B></H4>

<P>
Most of these questions you should ask before selecting products
come from an article in News Library News, Spring 1992, written
by Barbara Ellenbogen Maxwell, USA Today's Library Director.
<UL>
<LI>What is the initial subscription or purchase cost? Are there
recurring costs?
<LI>Will the product run effectively on existing hardware, if
not, what additional hardware is required?
<LI>Are updates to the database cumulative or will you have to
shuffle discs to search a whole range of years?
<LI>How frequent are the updates?
<LI>What is the anticipated use of the data? Calculate the &quot;per
use&quot; cost of purchasing the database (it may actually be
cheaper to search online when you need it for infrequently accessed
files).
<LI>Is there a discount if the product is already being purchased
in another form? (This won't always be offered by the producer,
be sure to ask).
<LI>Is this material available from more than one vendor? Weigh
the advantages of one vendors version over the others'.
<LI>Is the information accurate and timely?
<LI>What sources you currently purchase could this CD replace?
<LI>Can the product be connected to a network or is it for a single
search station only?
<LI>Is the product easy to use?
<LI>Will reporters be trained to use the products themselves?
Where will the search stations be located? Who will do the training?
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Recommended CD-ROMs</B></H4>

<P>
This extensive list of CD-ROMs which newsroom should consider
having was compiled by Kathleen Flynn, Assistant Director of the
Atlanta Journal &amp; Constitution news research center. The following
links you to the list, as posted on the Special Library Association's
<A HREF="http://www.nando.net/prof/poynter/nd/ndmenu.html">News Division </A>website.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.nando.net/prof/poynter/nd/cdrom.html">Flynn's CD-ROMs for News Libraries </A>
<P>
The listing includes recommended CD-ROMs by categories, listing
of CD-ROM producers and a bibliography of sources and magazines
for further information about CD-ROMs.<HR>

<H2>SOURCES FOR INFORMATION ON COMPUTER ASSISTED REPORTING: </H2>
<HR>

<P>
<U><B>Computer-Assisted Reporting</B></U>, by Bruce Garrison.
Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995.
<P>
Garrison, a journalism professor at the University of Miami, has
written this as a &quot;what's happening&quot; book, rather than
a &quot;how-to&quot;. It covers the techniques and applications
of computer usage in all stages of news reporting, in all sizes
and types of newsrooms.
<P>
<U><B>Computer-Assisted Reporting: a practical guide</B></U><B>,
</B>by Brant Houston. St. Martin's Press, 1995. (forthcoming)
<P>
Houston is the director of the National Institute for Computer
Assisted Reporting. This guide is full of exercises and examples
of the various aspects of CAR, and shows specifically how each
application can be used in news reporting.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.poynter.org/poynter/carsem2.html">Computer Assisted Reporting Needs Assessment </A>
<P>
Dan Woods, formerly of the Raleigh News &amp; Observer and co-designer
of 9-Track Express, lead this assignment at the Poynter Institute's
Computer Assisted Reporting seminar (April 1995). He and his teammates
designed a tiered approach to making hardware and software purchase
decisions for CAR.
<P>
<U><B>The New Precision Journalism</B></U><B>,</B> by Philip Meyer.
Indiana University Press, 1991.
<P>
The bible for reporters looking to use the statistics gleaned
from computer analysis in informed, valid and interesting ways.
The principles outlined in this book should be the foundation

<H2>GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Access to government publications used to be one of the big selling
points of commercial database access. The ability to quickly look
up and retrieve presidential speeches, texts of legislation and
campaign contribution records was a tremendous aid to reporters.
It came, however, at a cost, causing a great deal of controversy
over the need to pay to retrieve government information which
your tax dollars helped collect.
<P>
The impact of the <A HREF="carwww.htm">WWW</A> and it's increasing
use by government agencies to make official documents available
is still being gauged by commercial database vendors. There have
been attempts by the information industry lobby to close off the
free access to some public documents (notably EDGAR, the electronic
version of SEC documents) but they have, as yet, been unsuccessful
and the number of government documents available on the Internet
grows. <HR>

<H4><B>Advantages and Disadvantages of Use</B> </H4>

<P>
While the disadvantage of a higher cost to access might weigh
against the commecial vendor of government documents, there are
some advantages to their use:
<UL>
<LI><B>Information dates back farther:</B> Presidential speeches
are available for free on the White House website (<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">http://www.whitehouse.gov/</A>)
but only dates back to 1993. Presidential Documents database on
Nexis dates back to 1981, and on Westlaw to 1936.
<LI><B>Accumulation of records:</B> Reports and studies sponsored
by individual agencies may be sitting on their free <A HREF="carbbs.htm">bbs</A>
or website but you may have to go to a number of sites to do a
search. Commercial database services can access compilations of
these individual file, such as Dialog's access to National Technical
Information Services' Bibliographic database.
<LI><B>More targeted searching:</B> The commercial services take
advantage of elaborate record structures to allow for field searching
which can help target and specify the types of documents you need.
The documents available on free services are often do not have
field searching capabilities (although that is coming in some
cases).
<LI><B>Faster:</B> Time is money, and sometimes connecting to
those popular, free government databases on the Internet can be
time costly exercises. The Census site, (<A HREF="http://www.census.gov">http://www.census.gov</A>)
for example, is often very slow to get into. When you need the
information and you need it now, sometimes going to a commercial
service is more efficient.
</UL>

<P>
Keep in mind the disadvantages, too, however:
<UL>
<LI><B>Tracking down source documents:</B> Often, the information
you retrieve is a reference to a government document, which you
then have to locate to get the full text. This is particularly
true for older documents.
<LI><B>Interpretation of data:</B> Statistics can be difficult
to interpret; it is essential that you understand where the statistics
come from and what they are based on, and use care as you compare
statistics from one year to the next, be sure you are comparing
like values.

</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Uses in news research</B> </H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Find facts, statistics: </B>The U.S. government collects
data and statistics on virtually every topic. These databases
help make those figures accessible. You can even do searches on
a figure (say, the national debt) and see if there are other items
with that number that come up which might make an interesting
comparison.
<LI><B>Reality check: </B>The capture of essentially every public
word spoken by government officials, legislators, and executives
means you can easily check back on what they've said in the past
when you want to verify something they're saying now.
<LI><B>Background: </B>Financial information, Congressional testimony,
and other information can be used to help background people and
companies you are writing about.
<LI><B>Finding experts:</B> Check in the transcripts of Congress
to find names of people who have appeared as experts and testified.

<H2>PHOTOS, GRAPHICS AND ART</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Image databases are the latest addition to the online supermarket.
Image databases consist of drawings, photographs, charts, and
clip art. The images range from company logos to patent drawings,
from photos taken by satellites to drawings of the Starship Enterprise.
Image databases will be the biggest growth area as digital photography
increases and archives are developed to store and retrieve the
images. <HR>

<H4><B>Types of Photo, Graphics, and Art Databases</B></H4>

<P>
<B>Bulletin Board Services:</B> Within the forum areas of both
standalone and commercial bulletin board services (like Compuserve),
there are libraries of images available for the downloading. Usually
the topic area of the forum (health or automotive or singles)
lets you know what kind of images will be available.
<P>
<B>Commercial Databases:</B> Kodak's Picture Exchange is an example
of an image database you dial into for access. For more information
about Picture Exchange, call 1-800-579-8737.
<P>
<B>Internet - WWW: </B>Picture Network International brings you
<A HREF="http://www.publishersdepot.com/pubdepot/guest/">Publishers Depot </A>,
with 350,000 photos, drawings, and maps available for searching.
This service charges a fee for the image downloaded based on the
use that will be made of it. Register for free trial access at
http://www.publishersdepot.com/ The Associated Press is also planning
to make it's image archive available through a website.
<P>
For a good collection of information about image databases, current
projects and existing standards for imagebases, check Howard Besser's
site at <A HREF="http://www.sils.umich.edu/~howardb/ImageDB/interesting-projects.html">http://www.sils.umich.edu/~howardb/ImageDB/interesting-projects.html </A>.
His article, &quot;Getting the Picture on Image Databases&quot;,
(Database, April/May 1995, pp. 12-19), also provides a good overview.
<HR>

<H4><B>Using Photo Databases</B></H4>

<P>
In order to view, download, and use images from image databases,
you generally need some additional software. While the value of
image databases for graphic artists and desktop publishers is
clear, their value in news research is just being explored. Once
large databases of photos that correspond to text stories are
available, the visual clues and information they provide should
be a valuable resource for reporters wanting color, detail, and
a sense of scene.<HR>

<H2>CONDUCTING THE SEARCH</H2>
<HR>

<P>
This checklist will help you to put your search strategy together
and conduct the search.<HR>

<H3>WHO</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Who can help if you get into trouble during the search?
</B>Be sure to have the help desk numbers handy.
<LI><B>Who is the expert on searching in your newsroom? </B>Be
familiar with your newsroom's research staff and their expertise.
<LI><B>Who can help you put a search strategy together? </B>
<LI><B>Who are you searching for? </B>Do you have the correct
spelling of their name, and have you taken care to cover possible
nicknames or variations?
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>WHAT </H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>What kind of search will it be? </B>Is it a free-text search,
structured public records search?
<LI><B>What search terms will I use? </B>Work up a list of terms
that would be relevant to your search.
<LI><B>What will I do if I don't find any information (or too
much)? </B>First thing you do is GET OFFLINE! and regroup your
search.
<LI><B>What are the search commands you need to use? </B>Make
sure you are familiar with the search &quot;engine&quot;.
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>WHEN</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>When should you do the search? </B>Some services have cheaper
access in off-hours<B>?</B> 
<LI><B>When should you stop researching? </B>When your search
results are totally unexpected - getting too much or too little
material.
<LI><B>When should you stop researching - part 2? </B>When your
question has been satisfactorily answered!
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>WHERE</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Where should you do your search? </B>Within the service
selected, which database should you use?

<UL>
<LI><B>Why <I>are</I> you doing the search? </B>Keep in mind why
you are searching, staying focused on the research goal.
<LI><B>Why are <I>you </I>doing the search? </B>If you are the
researcher, should this search be done by the end-user. If you
are the end-user, should you have a research expert doing the
search (much of this depends on the resource being used).
</UL>
<HR>

<H3>HOW</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>How do you build a search strategy? </B>Be sure you understand
how to link terms within the search (and, or, not).
<LI><B>How much is the search going to cost? </B>Know the cost
structure of the service you are going to use, know when to abort
a search.
<LI><B>How might you find it cheaper? </B>Be sensitive to the
cost versus return in your searching.

This two volume compilation is the most comprehensive listing
of computer searchable databases. Volume One is for databases
accessed through online services, Volume Two covers over 4040
databases available on CD-ROM, diskette, or magnetic tape. Information
for each entry includes contact information for the database producer,
information about the content, subject coverage, time span and
where it is available. Indices by database producer, online service,
subject and geographic area.
<P>
For more information on the growth of online database searching,
there is a very comprehensive look by Martha E. Williams of University
of Illinois called &quot;The State of Databases Today: 1995&quot;

<H2>BIBLIOGRAPHIES AND ABSTRACTS</H2>
<HR>

<P>
The first databases available commercially were bibliographic
or abstract based. These databases provide references to articles
available in thousands of publications. Bibliographic citations
give only author, title, and publication information, while abstract
citations also give a synopsis of the contents of the article.
Most of these databases use a set of keywords or controlled vocabulary
terms to aid in searching. Most producers of bibliographic or
abstract databases focus on a particular subject area.<HR>

<H4><B>Examples of bibliographic and abstract databases</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Cancerlit:</B> Over 1 million citations to cancer studies,
articles and treatment reports dating back to 1963.
<LI><B>Dissertation Abstracts: </B>More than 1.1 million citations
to doctoral dissertations from accredited educational institutions.
Great for finding experts on esoteric topics.
<LI><B>Religion Index: </B>From the American Theological Library
Association, provides citations to articles dating back to 1949
in more than 500 international religion studies journals.
<LI><B>Social Scisearch: </B>The Institute for Scientific Information
has pulled together these cites from 1,500 social science journals
since 1972.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Uses in news research</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Background information:</B> The abstracts often give you
basic information about the topic and lead you to alternative
terms to search by.
<LI><B>Locate experts:</B> Writers of articles on specific topics
can be great sources. Usually the magazine they wrote for can
help you locate the writer.
<LI><B>Story ideas:</B> Just reading through a list of article
titles can give you ideas and angles to the topic you may not
have thought to pursue.
<LI><B>Facts, statistics: </B>Abstracts from some databases pull
the most relevant facts and figures from the article, obviating
the need to go to the source article.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Advantages</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI>One-search access to information on millions of articles in
thousands of journals.
<LI>Location of subject specialists by finding authors of articles
on specific topics.
<LI>International coverage of topics of the most arcane and specific
nature.
<LI>Generally well indexed and use subject headings that make
searching easier.
<LI>Widest range of dates, usually indexes material dating much
further back than full-text databases.
<LI>Data is compiled by associations, institutes and organizations
which can be contacted for specific help in locating material.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Disadvantages and cautions</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI>Can be frustrating to find the perfect article, but not be
able to get the full-text easily.
<LI>There are so many documents, it is easy to be overwhelmed
with your search results unless you clearly target your search
request.
<LI>These are labor intensive databases, writing abstracts takes
time, there is often a considerable time lag in the posting of
information. This will not have quick access to the most current
articles.
<LI>Be sure to check whether the database is still active. Some
databases are not being added to, but they continue to be searchable.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Sample search </B></H4>

<P>
<I>The city fathers have decided a way to make some money for
the town would be to rent land to the DOE for nuclear waste storage
in dry cement casks. You are going to attend the press meeting
on this decision. What do you need to find out? What questions
do you have?</I> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Background:</B> What is this type of storage, how is it
being used currently, what are the alternative types of storage
for nuclear waste? What are the &quot;technical&quot; terms for
this type of storage?
<LI><B>Experts:</B> Who knows about the uses of this type of storage,
who supports it, who disagrees with it?
<LI><B>Story ideas:</B> What are the angles in covering nuclear
waste stories? What would be a fresh approach, not just transcribing
the press conference?
<LI><B>Facts, statistics:</B> How many nuclear storage sites are
there? What do they use? How many dry cement casks are being used?
<I>What other questions might you have?</I> 
</UL>

<P>
<B>A search strategy to use:</B> 
<P>
Go to Dialog and select the &quot;ENVIRON&quot; category of databases.
This includes Enviroline, Environmental Bibliography, Pollution
Abstracts, TOXLINE, Academic Index. Enter your search by typing
after the question mark:
<H6>?s (dry or cement or storage) and cask? and nuclear</H6>

<P>
This is what is displayed on screen:
<H6>65301 STORAGE<BR>
37553 DRY<BR>
13489 CEMENT<BR>
1047 CASK?<BR>
94556 NUCLEAR<BR>
S1 114 (STORAGE OR DRY OR CEMENT) AND CASK? AND NUCLEAR</H6>

<P>
<I>The numbers in front of each term (storage, dry, etc.) indicate
the times that term is contained in the articles in the targeted
database; 114 documents having either storage or dry or cement
AND cask (or casks or caskets...) AND nuclear were found in the
targeted databases)</I> 
<P>
Type after the question mark:
<H6>?d 1/5/all</H6>

<H6>ABSTRACT: The 111 nuclear power plants operating in the US
have generated<BR>
20,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste to date. This amount
of<BR>
highly radioactive waste is expected to double by the end of the
decade. At<BR>
present, a large amount of this waste is temporarily stored in
pools, and<BR>
steel or concrete dry casks. These wastes require thousands of
years to<BR>
degrade to the point where they are no longer considered a hazard.
The<BR>
development of a long-term storage facility for radioactive wastes
has been<BR>
problematic due to public fears and active resistance on the part
of local<BR>
political groups. The Department of Energy (DOE) was assigned
the task of<BR>
developing a long-term radioactive waste storage facility. Researchers
at<BR>
the DOE selected Yucca Mountain, NV, as the best site for this
facility.<BR>
Features of the Yucca Mountain site are examined. (Full text available
from<BR>
Congressional Information Service.) <I>(abstract of the article)

<P>
This abstract gives you some useful statistics, a brief overview
of the problem, names of some experts (the authors), useful terms
for future searching and hints to what the full text might offer
if you track it down (features of the site that you could compare
with your area.) All this without having the full text. <HR>

<P>
Also referred to as &quot;full-text&quot; databases, these take
you a step further than the bibliographic database by providing
you with the complete text of articles, programs, speeches, press
releases. Most databases created since the mid 1980's provide
full-text retrieval of material. Some full-text databases contain
the text from just one publication, others are compilations of
articles from a variety of source publications. Most commercial
database services allow you to search for articles across a number
of databases with one search, essentially making one huge compilation
database from a number of separate databases.<HR>

<H4><B>Examples of article and transcript databases</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>AP, TASS, Reuter, Xinhua, States News Services </B>and
other wire services.
<LI><B>Magazine ASAP: </B>More than 380,000 articles from 100
general-interest periodicals, with 3400 additional records uploaded
weekly.
<LI><B>Washington Post, Jerusalem Post, Jakarta Post, Evansville
Courier,</B> and more than 200 other daily newspapers around the
world.
<LI><B>Screen Digest, Insider Trading Monitor, Food Chemical News,
Infectious Disease Weekly</B> and over 4000 other newsletters

<UL>
<LI><B>Background: </B>Full-text databases of news stories can
help track down previous incidents, find background on the people
involved in an incident and otherwise put a news story into context.
The broad range of publications, and their particular focus, offer
articles representing a variety of viewpoints.
<LI><B>Scope and range:</B> The range of sources available in
full-text databases make it possible to put a broader perspective
on a local story, or to make an international story relevant to
your community.
<LI><B>Facts, statistics:</B> Full-text articles from subject-specialty
magazines and newsletters can reveal information from reports
and studies that may not have gotten into mainstream publications.
<LI><B>Story ideas:</B> As with abstract databases, the articles
retrieved can give you ideas about angles to follow in covering
your story.

<P>
There has been a rash of smash and grab incidents on your town's
highways. Kids are throwing cinderblocks off highway overpasses
and grabbing purses from the victims as they pull to the side
to check damage. What do you need to know?
<P>
<B>Background:</B> Has this happened in our town in the past?
So far, the incidents haven't hurt anyone, has anyone somewhere
else been hurt? What is the specific crime being committed when
this happens?
<P>
<B>Scope and range: </B>Is this happening in other areas, what
are other areas doing about it? Knowing the scope of the problem
can let you put the events in your town into context.
<P>
<B>Facts, statistics: </B>What are the crime statistics for this
category of crime, what studies have been released about juvenile
crime?

Go to Nexis and select &quot;NEWS&quot; databases. This includes
more than 110 national and international newspapers. You just
want to see current examples of autos being struck by kids throwing
rocks, so select CURNWS (the current news files - most recent
two years). Enter your search.

<H6>SECTION: EDITORIAL, Pg. 14A<BR>
LENGTH: 396 words<BR>
HEADLINE: Throw the Book at Rock-Throwers<BR>
BODY:</H6>

<H6>Maybe the six kids arrested recently for throwing rocks at
moving cars and<BR>
trucks didn't mean to hurt anybody. Maybe they didn't think about
what can<BR>
happen when a softball-sized rock slams into the windshield of
a vehicle<BR>
cruising at 50 or 60 miles per hour. That's no excuse. In fact,
that's the<BR>
problem. Either they didn't think about the consequences of their
actions or<BR>
they didn't care. Which is precisely why these rock-throwing incidents
must not<BR>
be dismissed as pranks. If the justice system doesn't forcefully
oppose these<BR>
kids, then other youths will go on thinking such troublemaking
is fun.....</H6>

<P>
These examples of the stories found in searching for rocks being
thrown from overpasses help give a range of the locations where
this is happening (Chicago to Tacoma), the reasons (political
statement to mischief) and the reactions (the editorial goes on
to give some recommendations). These stories can give you background
on the scope of the problem, the worst-case scenarios (someone
died in one incident) and let you go to interviews on the topic
with more information than the person you might be interviewing.

<H4><B>Advantages of Full-Text Databases</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Instant gratification: </B>You get the whole article immediately.
<LI><B>Online library: </B>You have the text of thousands of magazines,
publications, speeches and news programs instantly available.
<LI><B>Cost effective: </B>If you add up what paper subscriptions
to these publications would cost, it may be cheaper to just access
when you need them.
<LI><B>International scope:</B> European, Asian, Australian and
Latin American wire services and newspapers are available.
<LI><B>Regional information:</B> Access to a wide range of local
newspapers and weekly magazines gives you a regional perspective
on people and events.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Disadvantages and cautions</B></H4>

<UL>
<LI><B>Difficult to search: </B>There is so much material, it
is easy to retrieve too many articles.
<LI><B>Searches what you type, not what you mean:</B> Full-text
is searched for the characters in your search statement, not for
the meaning of the words you type. In full-text, it is easy to
have a search for the planet Mercury to retrieve &quot;as the
mercury soared to 102 degrees&quot;, or &quot;the Mercury Cougar
careened into the embankment&quot;, or &quot;Mercury Morris will
always be remembered&quot;, or &quot;the mercury gray siding&quot;.
Balancing specificity without too tightly narrowing your search
is a skill developed over time. Ask your researcher.
<LI><B>Duplication of material:</B> Searching in newspaper files,
for example, can retrieve multiple copies of the same article
from different newspapers. Some newspapers even put in different
editions' versions of the same story, often with little or very
subtle changes.
<LI><B>Not comprehensive:</B> Do not assume that if something
or someone is not retrieved in a search that there has been nothing
written about them. This is a tool of inclusion (if you find it,
you can assume it is there), not a tool of exclusion (if you don't
find it, you can't assume it isn't there).
<LI><B>Consider the source: </B>Errors in articles are not always
caught. If a piece of information is important to the story you
are writing, verify it with another source. You must understand
about how the articles and the publications are written and how
the database is compiled to get the fullest sense of what your
search has and has not revealed.

<P>
Some of the most useful reference books are available in database
form, and become even more useful. Because every word in a database
is indexed, information that is hidden or difficult to find using
a traditional book index is revealed in a database search. Many
of these useful reference works are also available on <A HREF="carcdrom.htm">CD-ROM </A>,
a particularly cost effective method for searching frequently
used books.<HR>

This search has done several things: given you contact names and
numbers for a variety of associations and research centers you
can contact for background information and learned comment, given
you a sense of the scope of the issue (parents, medical community,
law, international aspects). This is a good example of the use
of computer assisted research to get you to the right sources
to do your telephone assisted interviewing.<HR>

<H4><B>Advantages of Book and Directory Databases</B> </H4>

<UL>
<LI>Full text indexing allows hidden information to be easily
located.
<LI>These are often databases of expensive reference books, it
may be cheaper to search as needed than it is to buy the book.
<LI>The database version is usually updated with new information
and corrections more quickly than the print version.
<LI>Since these are from well-organized reference sources, the
information is usually well edited and the information is reliable.
</UL>
<HR>

<H4><B>Disadvantages and cautions</B> </H4>

<UL>
<LI>These are not necessarily comprehensive: Don't assume something
does not exist just because it isn't found in a search.
<LI>Some of the information in directories is from submission
by the company or person (American Business Directory, Who's Who)
so you must not assume that the information given is the unvarnished
truth. Always consider the source of the information - in book
and directory searches, and any other kinds of research.
<LI>The structure of many of these databases is fairly rigid.
In order to do searches on particular fields or elements, you
must understand how the database is compiled. Some fields require
use of specific terms or else you will not get valid results.
Use the sheets provided by the database vendor detailing the structure
of individual files.

<H2>Part I: How "good" is information on the Internet?</H2>


A science reporter for <EM>The New York Times</EM> did a network search
looking for information on predicting earthquakes. What looked
like a lot of good material turned out to be based mostly on
astrology. There's lots of great, reliable, credible information
out there on the Internet, but there's also lots of junk. 

<P>
How can you evaluate the quality of information you pull off the
net?
<P>
A few simple strategies can help.

<P>

For newsgroups, IRC channels or Web-based chat zones, forums,
and e-mail discussion lists, start by treating all information
and quotes much the same as you would random interviews on the
street or as conversation overheard on the subway. First of all,
you have no way of knowing who the person "speaking" is, what
credentials he or she has, or even if the person posting the
message is really who he or she says she is. These places are
starting points only. They may provide leads to more substantive
source material. In some cases, you may want to telephone the
person, exchange personal e-mail messages, and take other steps
to verify the source. Having done so, treat such sources as you
would any other sources.

<P>

For documents found on the Internet, one should take similar
cautions. Anybody can claim to represent "Scientists for
Colonizing Space," set up a server (or rent space on an existing
server), load the server with authoritative looking documents,
and see to it that those documents get indexed by some of the
more popular search engines. There will come a day when
journalists too hurried (or too careless) to verify network
sources will give us the Internet equivalent of the Janet Cooke
case. Again, until you have taken steps to verify that the site
is maintained by credible people with reputable credentials,
treat it as you would any other elementary school project,
fraternity prank, or scam -- all of which are on the Internet.

<P>

Most World Wide Web, Gopher, and Telnet sites provide some kind
of information about the sponsoring organization. If you can't
get and confirm information about people maintaining the site
delivering a document, treat the site's information as if it had
the plague. You can often use Finger or Whois utilities or
Internet registration services to ascertain who "owns" the
server on which information is maintained. 

<P>

Journalists have always had the ultimate responsibility for
verifying sources, validating documents, and otherwise testing
the veracity of all they report. That responsibility expands in
a world of global computer networks.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

 
<P>

<H2>Part II: Domain names and Internet sources</H2>


One of the more difficult aspects of using the Internet for news 
gathering is the prospect of verifying the information you get. 
If you are corresponding with someone by e-mail, you have no way 
of knowing who the person at the other end really is. In some 
ways, it is much like relying on the telephone. Until you develop 
some kind of tested relationship, you do not know the distant 
person's credentials or even if the person is who he or she 
claims to be. 
<P>
Gathering documents off the Internet, a journalist has 
difficulties authenticating information. Any child or crank can 
put up Web pages or other documents on the net and give himself 
or herself the apparent credibility of some public interest 
group. Teenagers are not nearly as dangerous to the interests of 
the press as some groups who would use the media for their own 
ends.
<P>
A common ploy of advocacy groups is the practice of adopting 
names associated with widely held ideals. "People for the 
American Way," in the United States for example, borrows prestige 
from the widely esteemed generality, "the American Way" to 
promote liberal social and political causes. At the other end of 
the spectrum, the John Birch Society graces its magazine with the 
name, Public Opinion, suggesting that the views expressed by the 
society are those held by a broad cross section of the American 
public.
<P>
In the online world, anybody can claim to be "Scientists for 
Colonizing Space." They don't have to be scientists, and they 
don't even have to have an organization. They can serve up 
documents to the world, pretend they have done research, and make 
their "research" available. 
<P>
<H3>Domain names suggest clues</H3>

The journalist working in such an environment must exercise cau
tion. The ISOC (Internet Society) domain name system can often 
shed light on the source of a message or location of a document. 
The domain name system is not foolproof, but it can help in the 
process of verifying sources. As a reminder, the ISOC assigns 
domain names, especially in the United States, according to the 
following scheme:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>.com = a commercial enterprise
<LI>.edu = an educational establishment
<LI>.gov = a governmental agency
<LI>.mil = a military organization
<LI>.net = a network
<LI>.org = a non-profit organization

</UL>

In nations outside the United States, a two-character ISOC 
country code denotes network sites. Thus uk denotes United 
Kingdom; es, Spain; se, Sweden; dk, Denmark; fr France; de, 
Germany; ch Switzerland; ru, Russia; and so forth.
<P>
Thus, you might expect with some assurance that an organization 
claiming to be a university would put up its information on a 
server using a .edu address. Similarly, a professor at that 
university would be likely to have a .edu e-mail address. 
Likewise, you should be able to expect with some assurance that 
people and resources bearing .mil addresses are truly affiliated 
with military units, .gov addresses are connected to governmental 
bodies, and .org addresses are owned by non-profit organizations.
<P>
The cases of .com and .net addresses are a little more 
problematical. Internet service providers (ISPs) use both of 
these addresses. Anybody can buy an account with such ISPs. A 
university professor or a state legislator might buy an account 
through one of these providers. Thus, an address bearing a .com 
domain really gives you little information about the person 
behind the e-mail or the persons behind documents put up on the 
net at .com addresses or .net addresses. 
<P>
This process can be further complicated by utilities that give 
"alias" e-mail addresses or that forward mail from one address to 
another.
<P>
As imperfect as the domain name might be for verifying the source 
of information acquired from the Internet, some strategies can 
help journalists on a verification quest.
<P>
For example, a person whose e-mail address ends with "hp.com" in 
all likelihood works for Hewlett-Packard, and one whose e-mail 
address ends with att.com works for AT&T. And there is an 
Internet utility available for finding out who is behind a given 
Internet domain name. A program called "WHOIS" queries the ISOC 
domain name registration data base and reports who "owns" the 
domain and who is responsible for maintaining it. 
<P>
<H3>Using WHOIS</H3>

If you gain Internet access through a shell account, your host 
computer might have the WHOIS program on it. Just type "WHOIS" 
followed by the domain you want to look up (such as WHOIS 
att.com), and hit the Enter key. If you access Internet with a 
personal computer through a direct connection or a SLIP or PPP 
account, you can install a standalone "Whois" program on your 
computer that performs the same function. Ask your ISP or your 
systems person for Whois client software.
<P>
In the case of e-mail, the process can be complicated by some POP 
mail client software. These clients permit the user to specify a 
return address on e-mail messages that may have nothing to do 
with the true address of the sender. Thus a college student 
wanting to make life difficult for a Rice University professor in 
1993 faked that professor's e-mail "signature" on a series of 
messages that then reflected poorly on the professor and made the 
professor the subject of an investigation. A careless reporter 
under deadline pressure could easily be misled.
<P>
<H3>The bottom line for journalists</H3>

What is the net result for journalists using the Internet to 
source stories? Be alert to ways in which the Internet and its 
addressing system can be abused. Understand how easy it is for 
anyone to claim to be anyone else and to put up phony 
information. Then watch for clues and seek to verify in as many 
ways as possible the credibility of all net-based information. 
<P>
Every day reporters unfamiliar with the owners of voices at the 
end of a telephone line trust information given by distant, 
unknown sources. Why? Often there is a string of small, 
circumstantial evidence that the source is reliable. A listing in 
a trusted directory. A telephone receptionist who answers with 
the name of the right organization. Sometimes some very pointed 
questions can be answered only by someone in the "right" 
position.
<P>

The same process can apply to net-gathered information. A trail 
of circumstantial evidence supported by other clues and pointers 
can help provide verification of the source.

            <h2>How Do We Adapt Old Rules to the Chaos of Conversion? </h2>
            <strong> <p></strong><strong>by Thomas W. Hazlett<p></strong><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=20> <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><IMG SRC= "../../facsnet_grafix/report_tools/Hazlett.gif " ALT = "Thomas W. Hazlett"> </TD><TD><B>Thomas Hazlett</B> teaches economics and public policy at the University of California, Davis, where he is Director of the Program on Telecommunications Policy. He served as Chief Economist of the Federal Communications Commission in 1991-92. Professor Hazlett teaches at FACS conferences and is a member of the faculty for the FACS Institute on Economics for Journalists. </TD> </TR> </TABLE><P>Our computers, cable systems, phone companies--even electric utilities--are hard-charging toward a convergence collision.
 They all want a piece of the profits from traffic on that now-clichéd Information Superhighway.
 And there, standing smack-dab at the crash point, are the people in the striped shirts-government regulators gripping copies of the 1934 Communications Act.
         <p>        Most fundamental to traditional regulatory structure is the bright line separation of various "lines of business.
"        <p>        <ul>        <p>        <li>A local telephone company is not allowed to manufacture telephones, supply television signals, or connect customers over long distance within its local exchange region.
         <p>        <li>A cable television company may not provide a dial tone for its customers to access the local exchange.
         <p>        <li>Long distance telephone companies are not permitted to come all the way into the local loop--they must hand off their distant calls to local exchange companies.
        <p>        </ul>        <p>        This regulatory grid has developed over several decades of local, state and federal regulatory actions, along with a good measure of court decisions thrown in.
 It is "regulatory apartheid"--a system of rules that separates sectors of the industry when market forces would integrate them.
         <p>        There are fierce debates about how well the system has worked to police telecommunications providers, but there is little debate about what threatens this system today: convergence.
         <p>        <h3>Bytes Are Bytes</h3>        <p>        In a digital world, electronic information is conveniently standardized.
 To engineers, moving bytes of digital information for telephone calls looks pretty much like moving bytes for movies or live sports.
 With the growth of personal computers, customers are hungrier than ever for digital bit streams, and will hook up to whatever chute they need to in order to get them.
 This is convergence in a technical dimension, but it implies convergence in an economic one--as the cost of delivering more product over the same network drops, <strong>economies of scope</strong> motivate each competitor to invade the other's turf.
 The name of this game is: <strong>Get into the competitor's market before he gets into yours.
</strong>        <p>        <ul>        <p>        <li>Local telephone companies want to invade cable markets, using an integrated system to supply both voice and video.
         <p>        <li>Cable companies want to go the opposite way, upgrading their coaxial cables to carry telephone calls.
         <p>        <li>Long distance companies want to integrate into the local loop, bypassing the local access charge.
        <p>        <li>Local exchange providers want to go long-distance, grabbing more of the toll revenue.
         <p>        <li>Wireless providers are desperate to go at the core of the wired telephone market--and the surprisingly lucrative cable television business.
    </ul>        <p>    Virtually every segment of the American public has a stake in the telecommunications revolution:        <p>        <ul>    <li>Computer companies want more sophisticated transmission grids for their hardware and software.
         <p>        <li>Equipment manufacturers and consumer electronics makers know that lower prices for access to information networks stimulates demand for gadgets, from cell phones to fax machines to computers.
         <p>        <li>U.
S.
 businesses, which have often jumped the gun by building their own private networks to facilitate faster data flows for internal operations, would like to see "public switched networks" -- the grids the rest of us use--offer better access to customers and suppliers.
         <p>        <li>The greater efficiency domestic enterprises can enjoy, naturally, the greater their competitiveness in international markets.
        <p>        <li>There are huge payoffs for education: advanced telecommunications can bring the best teachers, books and libraries to students everywhere.
        <p>        <li>The spontaneously evolving "network of networks" --the Internet-- has already meant huge leaps in improving scientific research.
         <p>        <li>The medical sector is exploiting breakthroughs by telemedicine--connecting patients with far-off specialists or monitoring patients at home by computer.
</ul>        <p>        In short, technical and economic forces are powerfully challenging the old lines of demarcation under regulatory apartheid.
        <p>        <h3>Public Interest Mandate</h3>        <p>        The politics of the process are complicated and fascinating.
 Every industry segment is "for competition, but.
.
.
.
"  What comes next is a lengthy, technical, jargon--filled essay which, translated into English, means roughly: "Our entry into other markets will save the world; letting new entrants into our market will cause people to die!"  The process is so effective at tying up markets for years or decades, and so reliable in quashing potential competitors, that everyone with an interest in telecommunications, or some political clout, is drawn into playing the regulatory reform game.
         <p>        The most problematic part of the regulatory process is the FCC's mandate under the defining 1934 Communications Act, ordering it to set rules for communications services in "the public interest.
"  We have had six decades to understand what that means, but still don't.
 Operationally, we know that it means whatever three of five FCC Commissioners take it to mean.
 This tends to be somewhat political.
        <p>        FCC veteran William Ray recalls what the chief of licensing, Lonnie Emerson, told him after a meeting.
 "They told us who is to get the license, but when I asked what their reasons were, Commissioner [Robert E.
 Lee] just said, 'Lonnie, you'll think of some.
'  "In this kind of world, interest group politics are rugged.
         <p>  <h3>Cell Phone Success?
</h3>        <p>        The FCC considers cell phones to be a major regulatory success story, but it helps to put that success in perspective.
 In fact, radio telephone service was first available in the 1930s, and today's systems were conceived at Bell Labs in 1946.
 In 1968, the Commission opened an official proceeding.
 In 1970, it announced the frequencies to be used for the service.
 It took 12 more years to issue the first license--12 years of wrangling and reconsideration.
 One study puts the cost to the American economy of that delay at $87 billion.
 And the system?
 The FCC mandated an outmoded analog standard, sacrificing the gains of the digital electronics revolution.
        <p>        Cable television offers another clear case history.
 Concerned that cable would undermine the economic viability of broadcast TV, the FCC built tall barriers with the first regulations it crafted between 1965 and 1972.
 It banned on cable:        <p>        <ul>    <li>Movies older than ten years or newer than three years        <p>        <li>Live sports        <p>        <li>Any regular series    </ul>        <p>        By the end of the 70s, the courts and regulators changed those policies, opening the way for the huge diversity of today's cable, from CNN to C-SPAN, ESPN to MTV.
 The tremendous success of this reform strongly suggests that reliance on market rivalry may be the most effective way to provide for both enhanced consumer choice and the "public interest.
"        <p>        <h3>Limitations of Human Foresight</h3>        <p>        The key to successful public policy can be found in rules that recognize the inherent limitations of human foresight.
 We are lousy forecasters of future markets generally, and particularly lousy in telecommunications today.
 There is much uncertainty in the world, as any executive in the computer business could testify.
 And, sadly, the government's crystal ball has been lost in a federal warehouse somewhere in Maryland.
        <p>        So regulations must be crafted that allow maximum flexibility to operators to meet consumer demands.
 Freeing up competitive opportunities is the guiding star.
 While virtually all players today understand and pledge allegiance to the principle, the regulatory processes can be better designedto protect consumer interests.
        <p>        Today, the victory of regulatory process is apparent when interested parties raise administrative question marks and stretch rapid market deployment into a twenty-year FCC rule making.
 The central problem now is that a firm that wants to enter a new market is subjected to a burden of proof: It must establish that the "public interest" will be served.
 The monopolist or duopolist protected by the current rules shoulders no such responsibility, and profitably draws out the debate with the most creative legal briefs and expert affidavits money can buy.
        <p>        One of the explanations for these delays is that it helps ensure that new technology will be available to everyone.
 Indeed, it is difficult to find a news analysis of the emerging Information Superhighway without extended discussion of the impact it will have on the old rules of universal service.
        <p>        <h3>Universal Service</h3>        <p>        How well do the current rules deal with universal service?
 Consider that only about 94% of U.
S.
 homes have telephone service.
 While that may seem a high percentage, it is lower than other technologies--98% of U.
S.
 homes have televisions, for instance--and there's a simple reason it's not higher: Long distance telephone bill run-ups have caused a good number of low-income citizens to be disconnected from the network.
 That problem should be easy to fix--just provide telephones that don't allow toll access but do provide local and emergency number service.
 Our regulatory systems, while professing great concern for universal service, have generally not moved to solve the problem.
        <p>        Atthe same time, regulators enthusiastically step up to question whether new competition should be permitted.
 They eagerly impose a burden of proof on those who would threaten universal service by undermining monopoly market structures.
 It all sounds hauntingly familiar, since we know from experience that regulators are much better at limiting competition than they are at providing universal service or other elements of the "public interest.
"        <p>        <h3>Apple Slice of History</h3>        <p>        Consider this slice of history: It is 1976.
 It is what will soon become known as Silicon Valley.
 The impish Steve Jobs and wizardly Steve Wozniak are fiddling around in a garage, slapping circuit boards together.
 Voila! The personal computer is born.
    <p>    Suppose that before allowing Apple to actually offer this new information system to the public, Mr.
 Jobs and Mr.
 Wozniak had to obtain an FCC license according to "public interest, convenience or necessity," or a PUC "certificate of convenience and necessity.
"  (It is due only to the technical quirk that the computer does not transmit its signals over the air or string cable over streets that he needn't do so.
 Other technologies are not so lucky.
) To obtain the license, they may have had the wherewithal to imagine how hugely important this invention would become.
 But, in impressing the regulators--and then-giant manufacturers of mainframes--as to the revolutionary importance of this new tool, they would have been pressed to explain how a license, if issued, would impact the marketplace.
 Would the poor have the same access as the rich?
    <p>    There would have been absolutely no way for the fledging entrepreneurs to know the answer to this question.
 The burden would have been terrifyingly high, and a tremendously powerful new technology might have been suppressed--in "the public interest.
"  But what is even more revealing about this process, and particularly about this question, is that now, in perfect hindsight, we are convinced that the personal computer has not been as accessible to the poor as it has been to the rich.
 On the contrary.
 The increasing skew of incomes in all of the Western economies over the past two decades is widely associated with the rapid spread of just the technology that Apple and its PC competitors so ruthlessly thrust upon the marketplace.
        <p>        Should this make us want to turn back the clock and undo the "damage" done by the technology?
 Nearly everyone would agree that solutions to the challenges of the computer age will be found by moving forward, not by artificially protecting the past.
 Now, consider whether regulators are confronting similar questions in telecommunications technology, trying to enforce "public interest" rules on the Apples of tomorrow.
 What would happen if we shifted some of the burden of proof away from competitors and innovators, and put more of it on incumbents and regulatory traditionalists?
 If we are to avoid getting crazy answers, we had better stop asking the wrong questions.

<hr noshade size=3> <h1>Law and the Environment</h1>
            <h2>Challenges for the Press</h2>
            <strong> Environmental problems pose extraordinary challenges for journalists, especially when it comes—as it inevitably does—to legal aspects.
 For journalists as for lawyers, two things are key: appreciate the complexities, and understand how to cope with them.
 
   <p></strong><strong>by James E. Krier<p></strong><TABLE CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=20> <TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><IMG SRC= "../../facsnet_grafix/report_tools/krier.gif" ALT = "James E. Krier"> </TD><TD><B>James E. Krier</B> is the Earl Warren DeLano Professor at the University of Michigan Law School. His teaching and research interests center on property law, environmental law and policy, and law and economics. <P>Professor Krier’s research in the environmental field first focused on air quality problems. He is author of two books on that subject — <I>Environmental Law</I> and <I>Pollution and Policy</I>. He is also the author of <I>Property</I>, the most widely used property course book in the United States.<P>Most recently, Professor Krier’s research interests have turned to problems of risk management. He teaches frequently at FACS conferences.</TD> </TR> </TABLE><P>          <h3>Then and Now</h3>          <p>          A good way to get a picture of modern environmental law is by looking at a snapshot from a much earlier time, then contrasting the present situation.
 So begin by considering Aldred's Case, commonly regarded as one of the first instances of environmental litigation.
 The case arose in the 17th century.
 Aldred, a farmer, sued his neighbor Benton, claiming that odors from the latter's pigsty were unlawfully polluting the local air.
 The court agreed.
 It held that Benton had caused what was then (and is now) called a nuisance, and awarded Aldred damages.
          <p>          Imagine how easy it must have been for the local press, if there was a local press, to cover this story.
 There were only two parties involved (and they presented themselves in the exact terms of a law professor's hypothetical problem: A sued B!); there was no obscurity about who did what to whom; the nature of the alleged injury was immediately apparent and utterly familiar to every English citizen of the day; the relevant law--the common law of England--was also pretty familiar; there was no legislation that might bear on the case; there was no fancy technology involved.
          <p>          Now contrast the modern scene, noting a number of particulars that complicate the journalist's job:          <p>          <ol>          <p>          <li>1.
 Modern pollution lawsuits of the victim-versus-polluter type still occur, but they typically resemble Aldred's Case in only the roughest way.
 Usually there will be many parties on each side of the case, simply because today most pollution problems aren't localized; hence they implicate many people--multiple polluters, scores of victims.
           <p>          <li>As aconsequence of this, there will be much uncertainty about just who did just what to just whom.
 Factory A might have injured some victims, Factory B some others, and so on, with no one knowing for sure.
 Experts, called by defendants and plaintiffs alike, will testify about elaborate models designed to show the area of pollution fallout.
          <p>          <li>The alleged injuries in contemporary pollution litigation are likely to be of an exotic sort, involving, for example, illnesses that might have been caused by pollution but on the other hand by something else, possible aggravation of preexisting medical conditions, increased incidence of chronic illness, and so forth.
 On these questions there will again be expert testimony, and it too will be of an exotic sort.
          <p>          <li>The applicable law will be complicated.
 The common law has expanded enormously since the time of the Industrial Revolution, and it varies from place to place.
 Moreover, any lawsuit is likely to have in the background a lot of possibly relevant legislative and administrative material coming from every level of government--local, state and federal.
          <p>          <li>There are, in addition, likely to be complex technological issues.
 Technology will come into play from the standpoint of what caused an alleged problem and from the standpoint of what might cure it.
 And needless to say, there will once again be competing expert views on virtually every technological question.
     </ol>          <p>     Even this short list should make plain the difficulties of giving effective and objective coverage to the modern day counterpart of Aldred's Case.
 What complicates the job even more is the fact that legal literacy is probably lower today than it was 300 years ago.
 The observation seems odd, but only at first.
 Legal doctrine is much richer now than it was long ago, with the result that even among lawyers there is a high degree of specialization and, thus, a low degree of understanding once thelawyer gets out of his or her immediate field.
 If the general body of law is obscure tolawyers, it's ever the more obscure to the lay people who rely on the press to keep informed.
 The same story holds for technology.
 Technological advance has made all of us terribly ignorant.
 It's commonly acknowledged that as the specialized technological knowledge of experts goes up, their general understanding goes down.
 If experts encounter grave difficulties as they move outside their specialties, imagine how lay people feel.
 So the journalist has to get on top of things and explain them in especially clear and objective terms to a fundamentally ignorant audience.
 But how are journalists to understand all that no one else can?
          <p>          <h3>Courts, Legislatures and Administrative Agencies</h3>          <p>          The good news is that lawsuits of the victim(s)-versus-polluter(s) type are less important than they used to be; the bad news is that the reason for this promises only more complications for journalists.
 Victim lawsuits against polluters have faded, though they still occur, for the simple reason that they are a poor means to deal with modern environmental problems.
 The problems are too widespread, too ongoing, too complicated and involve too many difficult tradeoffs for courts to manage effectively through common law means.
 They are, in this sense, political problems, and legislative and administrative regulation has pretty much displaced the courts as the means of problem management.
 Courts, in other words, have moved from a front-line to a rear-guard position.
 The most important environmental litigation today involves lawsuits not at all like Aldred's Case, victim(s) versus polluter(s); now, instead, we most typically see citizens, or firms and industries, suing the government for doing not enough, or too much, regarding some particular problem.
     <p>     In one way or another, then, governmental control programs will be at the core of most stories to be covered by environmental reporters.
 One set of complications has been replaced by another set.
 There are government programs at every level--federal, state and local--and they mesh and intertwine in exceedingly complex ways.
 Though journalists might still find themselves having to get on top of an occasional heap of environmental litigation, they will more regularly have to surmount a mountain of legislative and regulatory material.
            <p>          Truly a mountain?
 Judge for yourself.
 Federal environmental legislation itself probably runs over a thousand pages.
 The federal regulations implementing the legislation increase that number by an order of magnitude.
 Many of the regulations are written, literally, in Greek: the alphas, gammas and deltas used by physical chemists, engineers and economists.
 No journalist can hope to become familiar with much of this material, even by faithfully reading secondary sources.
 The literature comes from a variety of disciplines, each arcane.
 The writing is full of jargon and shorthand expressions and buzzes with acronyms: CAA, CWA, CERCLA, SERA, RCRA, TOSCA, NAAQS, NSPS, SIPS, NEPA, EIS, BAT, BDT, RACT, LAER, TCP; each of these refers to legislative programs and provisions administered (in most instances) by--of course!--the E.
P.
A.
 (My students say this is all BS.
) And these are just the federal programs and provisions.
 Over the last 20 years or so the federal government has come to play the dominant role in environmental regulation, but journalists will still have to know about the law at lower levels of government.
 Most of the federal laws require the states to enact legislation of their own to implement federal mandates, and the states in turn have administrative regulations, some of which direct local governments to adopt rules and regulations.
 There are, in short, countless pieces of paper involved, and all of them are obscure.
            <p>          Does modern environmental regulation reflect or engender complexity?
 Probably a little of each, but from the journalist's standpoint it hardlymatters: one has to learn to cope with regulatory complexityin either event.
 Coping, moreover, will require journalists to confront a kind of complexity barely hinted at thus far, arising from the fundamentally difficult tradeoffs at stake in virtually any environmental controversy, whether one handled by the courts or by legislative and administrative bodies.
       <p>     Tradeoffs make it hard to get an angle on a story, other than by way of telling readers what most of them might not want to know--that everything is very complicated.
 But everything is.
 Take hazardous waste as an example.
 It seems obviously wrong to dispose of the stuff in the local community's backyard, but if it doesn't go there it has to go somewhere else; the local press does a grave disservice if it ignores that unpopular little issue.
 Or take air pollution.
 Air quality in many areas is bad, but dramatic improvements can mean, to exaggerate only slightly, putting some of these areas out of business.
 So what angle should you take on your local air pollution problem?
 What about sulfur oxide pollution from coal burning power plants?
 This is a problem of national and even international significance.
 It can be controlled with scrubbers (a very expensive technology), but the use of scrubbers will greatly increase utility bills, including the bills of many low income people.
 Using low sulfur coal would be a much cheaper way to control sulfur oxides, but all the low sulfur coal is in the Southwestern United States.
 If we switched to that fuel we would put a lot of Appalachian coal miners out of work.
          <p>          Making good policy about problems with tradeoffs like these is a very intricate job, so covering the policy process is necessarily intricate too.
 Environmental law--the actual provisions and doctrines--may be unnecessarily complicated, and the convoluted way in which lawyers and legislators and other legal actors talk is almost unforgivable; but environmental problems themselves are necessarily complex, irreducibly complex, by definition complex.
 If they weren't they wouldn't be here.
 The days of Aldred's Case are gone in more ways than one.
          <p>          <h3>Risk</h3>          <p>          Until rather recently, neither society generally nor the legal system in particular has paid much attention to the long-term risks of environmental pollutants.
 Control programs have traditionally been most concerned with the acute (short-term) effects of conventional air and water pollutants.
 Now that situation is changing.
 Suddenly there is great concern about, for example, things like radon, asbestos, toxic chemicals, food additives.
 The worry is not that all of these are always immediately hazardous.
 The worry, rather, is that some of them might on some occasions lead to severe consequences down the road.
 This is why we speak of a risk of injury.
 The most we can say is that there is some probability, usually small, of danger.
 And the danger is usually latent: the unwanted effects will typically manifest themselves (if at all) only many years after some triggering event.
       <p>     Problems of risk regulation will soon be (if they are not already) a staple of environmental news.
 Journalists covering the problems will find themselves confronting every one of the difficulties discussed above, now usually in spades.
 There are complicated lawsuits of the Aldred-type (so-called toxic tort suits, some of which are leading to startling doctrinal developments), and of the type that pits citizens or industries against the government; there is considerable regulatory activity at every level of government, with much more on the agenda; there are experts speaking in secret voices to all aspects of the risk problem (including some new kinds of experts, like experts on risk assessment and on cognitive psychology, in addition to the customary array of medical doctors and toxicologists, economists and engineers); there are deeply difficult tradeoffs (many possibly risky chemicals also provide extraordinary benefits, all hazardous waste has to go somewhere and it'snot feasible to simply stop producing it, nuclear power still promises cheap energy and many experts regard it as much safer than conventional fossil-fueled power plants--these are examples).
            <p>          If risk were simply as tough to cover as is any other modern environmental problem, matters would be troublesome enough from the journalist's point of view.
 But I think risk is even tougher, for at least three reasons of special interest to reporters.
 Each of the reasons has to do with the sorts of "expert sources" journalists commonly talk to for advice and illumination.
       <p>     First, how does the journalist pick reliable sources?
 If I were a journalist, I'd go to people with good track records--people who had given me, or who I know to have given others--reliable information in the past.
 But now there isn't much of a past to draw upon.
 Risk problems are a fairly new item on the regulatory agenda, so we lack experience and accumulated wisdom.
 Experts have widely (perhaps wildly) different views on just about any aspect of risk.
 Given the absence of track records, how does one choose among experts?
     <p>     Second, how long will we have to wait around for trustworthy experts to appear?
 Risk problems typically involve long latencies, which is a way of saying that we won't know until way down the road--perhaps 20 or 30 years down the road--whether expert A or rather expert B has been calling the shots right.
 Where does the reporter go in the meantime?
            <p>          Third, and perhaps most interesting, most experts--expert risk assessors, anyway--look at risk in a very narrow way.
 They tend to be concerned with estimating the average number of annual fatalities that might follow from exposure to some given level of some given agent, period.
 Lay people, on the other hand, have a much richer picture.
 They are more concerned about risks with catastrophic potential than risks without that potential, even if the catastrophe is very unlikely to happen; more concerned about fatalities concentrated in time or space, preferring a risk that threatens 100 fatalities annually for each of 100 years to one threatening 10,000 fatalities in a single year, but likely to occur only once in any 100 years, or preferring a risk threatening about 2 people in each state to one threatening 100 people in a single community; more concerned about irreversible than reversible harms; more concerned about man-made than natural hazards; more concerned about involuntary than voluntary risks.
            <p>          It follows from this that a reporter asking an expert's opinion on the relative risks of A and B might be told "Clearly A is safer," have this confirmed by 10 other experts, and still have a distorted picture.
 All of these experts are probably saying nothing more than that A carries with it fewer annual expected fatalities than B.
 If the reporter then reports that virtually all experts agree that A is the safer alternative, the public might be misled, because A might have greater catastrophic potential, or threaten irreversible effects or effects that are much more concentrated than those of alternative B.
 (If you ask the experts to comment on these matters, they will likely reply that the public is irrational.
 But the question of public rationality is beyond their expertise.
)            <p>          <h3>How to Cope: Tips for Coverage</h3>          <p>          <ol>     <li>When it comes to environmental regulation, lawyers have it easy.
 They can specialize.
 As much as possible, reporters should specialize too.
 Few papers can afford to assign one person to one topic area, like air pollution, but many can probably afford to make environmental problems a large part of one journalist's portfolio.
            <p>          <li>Journalists hoping or expecting to spend a lot of their time on environmentallaw matters should begin building some intellectual capital.
 They should look around for occasional courses to take at the local university--in law, natural resources, introductory toxicology and so on.
 (I think most law schools would be happy to have a few journalists sit in on courses like environmental law, free of charge, and this is probably true of other university departments as well.
) Taking courses will help build contacts; it will also guide journalists to the best and most accessible literature in areas of relevance.
            <p>          <li>Reporters have to understand the range of expert contacts that are necessary, and get started on building a list of names.
 Depending on the problem, people from fields like law, engineering, medicine, economics, chemistry and risk assessment are likely to prove helpful.
 If they can't help, usually they'll know who can.
 Universities are a good place to look for expert advice.
 Academics generally don't have a stake in outcomes, and they try hard to be objective.
 Moreover, they are usually eager to talk to the press.
 Reporters should also develop contacts within the regional office of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and within state and local resource and environmental agencies.
 On matters of law generally, it's often easier to get information from public interest firms than from conventional private law firms (but it must be kept in mind that public interest lawyers usually have an ax to grind.
)          <p>          <li>When it comes to problems of risk in particular, reporters should be a little skeptical of expert views about what the future holds.
 They should learn how the public regards risk problems and run popular opinion by experts for a reaction, cross-examining a bit in the course of doing so.
 Many experts will implicitly claim that because they know a lot about one thing they know a lot about everything.
 Reporters have to be careful to confine expert views to their proper domain.
            <p>      <li>Because of the multitude of tradeoffs involved in environmental regulation, reporters have to work hard at discovering the stakes and identifying all the stakeholders.
            <p>          <li>When they've done that, they have to be careful to cover all sides as objectively as possible.
 Usually those on one particular side will say that everybody else is irrational, but it's almost always the case that each point of view has something powerful going for it.
 The reporter's job is to find out what, and also to assess the merits of contending views.
            <p>          <li>But, generally speaking, bottom lines should be avoided.
 The safest bottom line, usually, is that there isn't one.
 The objective should be to get buried in the process and learn its complexities well enough to convey them in a clear and balanced fashion.
          <p>          <li>Drama should also be avoided.
 The press is commonly blamed for exaggerating public concern, and the accusation is sometimes warranted.
 On the other hand, government and industrial interests all too often want to make things seem better than they are and reporters mustn't let themselves be lulled.
