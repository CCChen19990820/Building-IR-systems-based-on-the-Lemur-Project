<title>Particulate Test Combustor, Pulse-Jet
Baghouse, and Electrostatic Precipitator</title>

<h2> Particulate Test Combustor, Pulse-Jet Baghouse, and Electrostatic Precipitator </h2></center>
<hr>

     The pilot furnace, known as the particulate test combustor (PTC), is a 550,000-Btu/hr
pulverized coal (pc)-fired unit designed to generate fly ash representative of that produced in a
full-scale utility boiler.  The combustor is oriented vertically to minimize wall deposits.  A
refractory lining helps to ensure adequate flame temperature for complete combustion and
prevents rapid quenching of the coalescing or condensing fly ash.  Based on the superficial gas
velocity, the mean residence time of a particle in the combustor is approximately 3 seconds. 
The coal nozzle of the PTC fires axially upward from the bottom of the combustor, and
secondary air is introduced concentrically to the primary air with turbulent mixing.  Coal is
introduced to the primary air stream via a screw feeder and ejector.  An electric air preheater
is used for precise control of the combustion air temperature.  Originally, the PTC used cold-water
annular heat
exchangers to provide flue gas temperature control to the baghouse or
electrostatic precipitator (ESP).  However, analysis of ash deposits collected from the heat
exchangers indicated that some mercury was collected on the duct walls.  To minimize this
effect, the heat exchangers were modified to provide for higher duct wall temperatures.<p>

<p>

     The PTC instrumentation permits system temperatures, pressures, flow rates, flue gas
constituent concentrations, and baghouse operating data to be monitored continuously and
recorded on a data logger.<p>

<p>

     Flue gas samples can be taken at three system sample points:  the furnace exit,  the baghouse
inlet, and the baghouse outlet.  After passing through sample conditioners to remove the
moisture, the flue gas is typically analyzed for O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>,
SO<sub>2</sub>, and NO<sub>x</sub>.  Except for the CO<sub>2</sub>,
each constituent is normally analyzed at both the furnace exit and outlet of the baghouse
simultaneously, using two analyzers.  The concentration values from all of the instruments are
recorded continuously, using circle charts.  In addition, data are manually recorded at set time
intervals.  NO<sub>x</sub> is determined using two Thermo Electron chemiluminescent
NO<sub>x</sub> analyzers. The O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> analyzers are
made by Beckman, and the SO<sub>2</sub> analyzers are manufactured by DuPont.  Each of
these analyzers is regularly calibrated and maintained to provide accurate flue gas concentration
measurements.<p>

<p>

     The baghouse vessel is a 20-in.-ID chamber that is heat-traced and insulated, with the flue gas
introduced near the bottom.  Since the combustor produces about 200 acfm of flue gas at
300&#176;F, three 13-ft by 5-in. bags provide an air-to-cloth ratio of 4 ft/min.  Each bag is cleaned
separately with its own diaphragm pulse valve.  In order to quantify differences in pressure
drop for different test conditions, the bags are cleaned on a time basis, rather than with the
cleaning cycle initiated by pressure drop.  Once bag cleaning is initiated, all three bags are
pulsed in rapid succession on-line. <p>

<p>

     Instead of directing the flue gas through a fabric filter, a single-wire, tubular ESP can be used. 
The unit is designed to provide a specific collection area of 125 at 300&#176;F.  Since the flue gas
flow rate for the PTC is 130 scfm, the gas velocity through the ESP is 5 ft/min.  The plate
spacing for the unit is 11 in.<p>

<p>

     The ESP has an electrically isolated plate that is grounded through an ammeter, allowing
continual monitoring of the actual plate current to ensure consistent operation of the ESP from
test to test.  The tubular plate is suspended by a load cell which will help to monitor rapping
efficiency.  In addition, sight ports are located at the top of the ESP to allow for on-line
inspection of electrode alignment, sparking, rapping, and dust buildup on the plate.  The ESP was
designed to facilitate thorough cleaning between tests so that all tests can begin on the same
basis.<p>

<h2> Combustion Test Facilities</h2> </center> 
<hr>


     Research programs have been under way at the EERC for more than 28 years to study ash
fouling of boiler heat-transfer surfaces in coal-fired utility boilers.  A 550,000-Btu/hr pulverized
coal pilot plant test furnace was constructed in 1967 to evaluate the influence of variables,
including ash composition, excess air, gas temperature, and tube wall temperatures on ash
fouling.  Results from this work have shown a strong correlation between ash characteristics,
boiler operating parameters, and degree of fouling.<p>

<p>

     The research capabilities of the combustion test facility (CTF) have been enhanced over the years
and expanded to provide information on a wide range of combustion-related issues.  To achieve a
wide range of operating conditions, the refractory-lined furnace may be fired at a rate sufficient
to achieve a furnace exit gas temperature as high as 2500&#176;F.  Most tests are performed with
the furnace exit gas temperature maintained at approximately 2000&#176;-2200&#176;F.  Some of
the many research applications of this pilot-scale combustion equipment over the years have included
the following:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Determine ash-fouling rates and the strength, composition, and
structure of fouling deposits for coals of all rank and also determine the effectiveness of ash-fouling
additives.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Apply sophisticated analytical methods to characterize input
coal,
ash, and deposits and to correlate coal and ash properties with deposit growth rates and strength
development.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Evaluate the combustion characteristics of coal-water fuels,
biomass fuels, municipal solid waste, and petroleum coke.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Determine fly ash collection properties of various fuels by
electrostatic precipitation or fabric filtration using a pulse-jet baghouse, including high-temperature
applications.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Evaluate the slagging potential and slag corrosion in a simulated
wet-bottom firing mode.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Perform flame stability tests for comparing a particular fuel at
full
load and under turndown conditions.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Evaluate fouling, slagging, and electrostatic precipitator (ESP) 
performance for blends of bituminous and subbituminous coals.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Evaluate the combustion properties of petroleum coke, alone and
in blends with subbituminous and lignite coals.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Evaluate sorbent injection for SO<sub>x</sub> control and
assess integrated particulate and SO<sub>x</sub>-NO<sub>x</sub> control.<br>
</ul>
<p>

     The CTF is fully instrumented to provide on-line analysis of the flue gas.  Three flue gas
sampling ports are available, although only two are used on a regular basis.  Flue gas
concentrations of O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub> are
obtained simultaneously at the furnace exit and stack.  Emissions of CO and NO<sub>x</sub>
are obtained at the furnace exit.  System O<sub>2</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub>
analyzers are manufactured by Beckman; the SO<sub>2</sub> analyzers are manufactured by
DuPont; and NO<sub>x</sub> is measured with a ThermoElectron chemiluminescent analyzer. 
All system temperatures, pressures, and flue gas analyses are recorded continuously to chart
recorders and the system's computer-controlled data acquisition system.<p>

<p>

     Coal is pulverized remotely in a hammer-mill pulverizer to a size of 70% less than 200 mesh (75
&#181;m).  The coal is then charged to a microprocessor-controlled weight loss feeder from a
transport hopper.  Combustion air is preheated by an electric air heater.  The pulverized coal is
screw-fed by the gravimetric feeder into the throat of a venturi section in the primary air line to the
burner.  Heated secondary air is introduced through an annular section surrounding the burner. 
Heated tertiary air is added through two tangential ports located in the furnace wall about 1 ft above
the burner cone.  The percentages of the total air used as primary, secondary, and tertiary air are
usually 10%, 30%, and 60%, respectively.  An adjustable swirl burner, which uses only primary and
secondary air with a distribution of approximately 15% and 85%, respectively, is used during flame
stability testing.  Flue gas passes out of the furnace into a 10-in.-square duct that is also
refractory-lined.  Located in the duct is a vertical probe bank designed to simulate superheater
surfaces in a commercial boiler.  The fouling probes are constructed of 1.66-in.-OD Type 304
stainless steel pipe cooled to a surface metal temperature of 1000&#176;F (or other specified
temperature) with steam.  Deposit strength can be assessed by laboratory determinations using a drop
impactor technique and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  The drop impactor technique
provides a calculated measurement of deposit strength, taking into account the conditions under which
the test was performed.  SEM point count provides a point-by-point analysis of the deposit.  These
data can be used to calculate the viscosity of each data point that can be related to deposit
strength.<p>

<p>

     After leaving the probe bank duct, the flue gas passes through a series of water-cooled heat
exchangers before being discharged through either an ESP or pulse-jet baghouse.  The test
furnace has numerous ports that permit observation of the probes and the furnace burner zone
during the test run.  These ports can also be used for installation of additional test probes,
auxiliary measurements, photography, or injection of additives.<p>

<title>EERC Slurry Development Program</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"><br>
<h2>EERC Slurry Development Program</h2> </center> 
<hr>
     Slurry fuels are a promising alternative energy source to meet future energy needs.  However, the
cheapest and most abundant feedstocks--low-rank coals (LRCs), municipal solid waste, and
peat--have been overlooked because of their high inherent moisture.  Research conducted at the
EERC has shown that the energy densities of slurries made from high-moisture feeds can be
enhanced significantly by hydrothermal treatment.  Hydrothermal treatment, or slurry
carbonization, induces coalification by heating a slurry to specific temperatures above 240&#176;C at
saturated steam pressures for a few minutes.  When heated under pressure to temperature,
carboxylic groups attached to the coal structure decompose to form carbon dioxide, which forces
liquid water out of the pores and into the carrier medium.  The elevated temperature of the
process also causes the solid material to undergo both chemical and physical changes, which,
depending on process severity, may include decarboxylation, mild pyrolysis, extraction,
dehydration, and surface modification.<p>
     Technical feasibility has been demonstrated using a bench-scale system and a 6-tpd process
development unit (PDU) at the EERC with 24 different LRC feeds from around the world.  In
addition, the EERC has processed refuse-derived fuel slurries, sewage sludge, and biomass
materials.  To assess the technology, the EERC has, on-site, separate buildings for coal
preparation, slurry production, and combustion.  Various ground support equipment such as coal
hoppers, bins, and barrels are used to transport the coal between buildings.  The pilot plant has
made over 60 research and production runs, processing over 100 tons of solid material over the
past 10 years.  The 60- &#215; 48-ft slurry preparation building has a laboratory, a main floor
section,
and a mezzanine.  The 300-ft<sup>2</sup> laboratory is used to perform slurry fuel viscosity
evaluations, moisture and ash content analyses, and feed or product separating and houses a small
inventory of samples.  The main floor section houses the pilot-scale equipment required to produce
the ton quantities of slurry fuel.  This requires a building height of 40 ft to enclose the slurry heaters
and reactor system.  The mezzanine is used for final slurry fuel storage (3000-gal tank), water
storage (1000 gal), and the autoclave assembly.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Autoclave System</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Prior to slurry production, a review of the material's responsiveness to carbonization is performed
using a 7.6-L cold-charge autoclave.  The purpose of the procedure is to evaluate slurryability
and the effect that temperature has on slurry fuel performance.  The bolted-closure reactor is
externally heated by electric (ceramic band-type) heaters and is equipped with an automatic
temperature controller and a variable-speed, magnetically driven stirrer.  It is instrumented to
continuously measure and trend pressure plus slurry and vapor temperatures.  The stainless steel
autoclave is rated at 5500 psi at 340&#176;C.  The product gas is vented after completion of a test
and travels through a diaphragm meter to quantify the noncondensables.  The temperature and
pressure ranges studied have been between 240&#176; and 330&#176;C and between 400 and 2200
psi, respectively, for residence times typically of 15 minutes.  The system is complete, with
numerous high-pressure valves and fittings.  Normal testing procedures are to slurry pulverized
coal with an appropriate amount of water (usually 50:50 coal-to-water ratio), charge the
autoclave, and follow with heat treatment.  Hold times and selected temperature conditions are
based on previous coal experience and raw coal quality.  Heatup to the desired hot-water-drying
(HWD) temperature takes approximately 2 to 2.5 hours, after which the slurry and vapor
temperatures are allowed to stabilize.  Once the material has been sufficiently treated, the heaters
are shut off and the contents allowed to cool down overnight, prior to product collection.  The
slurry are continuously stirred throughout heatup, temperature stabilization, and cooldown.  After
cooldown, various samples are collected for analysis.<p>

<p>

   <font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Process Development Unit</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>

          Once the initial temperature parametric investigation has been completed using the autoclave
system, the  material is processed using a continuous 270-kg/hr hydrothermal treatment pilot
plant.  The purpose of the tests is to evaluate process residence time and to generate large
quantities of material for combustion or gasification testing.  The unit is capable of processing up
to 1000 microns of coal-water slurry at temperatures and pressures of 240&#176;-330&#176;C and
400-2200 psi for residence times of 1 to 60 minutes.  It consists of four basic areas as follows:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Area 100 - Size Preparation consists of size reduction and
handling equipment.  This work is conducted in a separate 60- &#215; 60-ft building, which is 300 ft
from
the PDU.  The building houses eight bunkers capable of storing approximately 200 tons of
as-received coal, a 4-ton/hr Williams coal crusher, a 1-ton/hr Mikro pulverizer, and coal-handling
and classifying equipment.  A Nelmore shredder is used to size biomass, plastics, and dry pellet
fuels.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Area 200 - Slurry Preparation consists of slurry mix tanks,
pressurization units, and a water storage system.  Mix tanks provide adequate blending of the solid
and water.  The final unit operation involves slurry pressurization, which is accomplished by a
hose-diaphragm pump system.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Area 300 - Slurry Heating consists of a double-pipe steam heat
exchange, followed by condensing Dowtherm heaters, used to heat the slurry to the selected
temperature conditions.  Residence time for the 6-tpd plant is accomplished using a
1.2-ft<sup>3</sup> vessel with static mixing features.<br>
 <p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Area 400 - Product Recovery consists of the slurry pressure
letdown and concentration systems, followed by final blending and storage of the slurry fuel.  Slurry
letdown consists of three pressure chambers equipped with release valves and pressure control valves. 
Centrifuges or filter presses are used for slurry dewatering, while high-shear units homogenize the
final slurry fuel.<br>
</ul>
<p>

     The unit is monitored using a software package, Genesis&copy;.  This PC process control tool
allows
fast and easy systems analysis using icon-driven CAD software.  The Genesis&copy; Runtime system
is a real-time process management and control environment built around a powerful real-time
multitasking operation system that is coresident with DOS.  For the thermal processing unit, the
Genesis&copy; system logs temperature, pressure, and flow rate data from each respective area.  The
data are logged and stored; in addition, Genesis&copy; allows the user to generate on-line historical
replay for a given module.  Every 15 minutes a printout of the key process conditions are stored
and printed to allow the shift engineer the ability to monitor thermal properties and real-time
trend information.

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  18- &#215; 18-in. Bubbling Atmospheric Fluidized-Bed
Combustor Test Unit</b> </h3></font> <p>

     The 2.25-ft<sup>2</sup> test unit is a fully instrumented pilot plant system that was
constructed in 1979 and has been in operation since 1980.  This combustor operates in the bubbling
mode of fluidization and has been used primarily for the generation of environmental and operational
data for the fluidized-bed combustion of western coals.  The unit has overbed and underbed feed
capabilities, a primary cyclone with fly ash reinjection capabilities, and a baghouse for fine
particulate control.<p>

<p>

     The unit is fully instrumented and equipped with a computer-controlled data acquisition system
to collect and display detailed operating information, including temperatures and pressures
throughout the system and flue gas concentrations.  Additionally, critical operational parameters
like excess air, superficial gas velocity, and fuel feed rate are continuously calculated and
displayed.  Flue gas analyzers measure concentrations of oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon
monoxide, nitrous oxides, sulfur dioxide, and total hydrocarbons.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  8- &#215; 8-in. Bubbling Atmospheric Fluidized-Bed
Combustor Test Unit</b> </h3></font> <p>

     The 0.44-ft<sup>2</sup> test unit was specifically designed and constructed at the EERC for
investigating the potential corrosion, erosion, and/or deposition that can occur to metal surfaces
inside a bubbling fluidized-bed boiler as a result of burning coal.  This unit was constructed to permit
economic operation representative of larger-scale units for long-duration tests of minimally 1000
hours.  A test program was conducted from 1985 to 1989.  Since that time, this unit has been utilized
for a variety of testing on coals, chars, and gas.<p>

<p>

     The main bed of this unit is 8 &#215; 8 in. square, and the freeboard expands to 10 &#215; 10
in.  A convective pass section with dimensions of 3 &#215; 6 in. provides velocities similar to
full-scale  units.  A cyclone, heat exchanger, and baghouse make up the balance of the system.  An 
extractive flue gas analysis system provides the capability of measuring oxygen, carbon dioxide,  and 
sulfur dioxide contents, and a microprocessor-controlled data acquisition system monitors and records
temperature, pressure, and flue gas concentration data.  Superficial gas velocity, excess air, and other
critical parameters are also calculated and displayed using the data acquisition system. <p>

<p>

     There are provisions for 18 horizontal heat-transfer tubes in the fluidized-bed region and the
splash zone.  Up to 12 horizontal tubes can be located in the convective pass region. Vertically
oriented coupons for the purpose of simulating waterwall heat-transfer surfaces are located in the
fluidized-bed and splash zones.  Surface temperatures of coupon and tubing materials are
controlled at specified temperatures by either water-cooling, air-cooling, or by a lack of cooling.
<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  20-in.-Diameter Circulating Fluidized-Bed Combustor
Test Unit</b> </h3></font> <p>

     The 42-ft-tall pilot-scale circulating fluidized-bed combustor (CFBC) was completed in 1990. 
The unit was designed as an independent test facility to be used by the energy industry to
perform evaluations on operating conditions, fuel characteristics, and sorbent characteristics on
combustion and emissions performance.  Several such tests have been performed to provide
emissions data and ash stream samples to facilitate permitting of a full-scale CFB.  A wide
variety of fuels have been tested in the CFBC, including high- and low-rank coals, petroleum
cokes, and dried municipal sewage sludge.  The pilot plant is capable of operating over the range
of conditions currently offered by most boiler vendors.<p>

<p>

     To quantify the effect of CFBC design and operating parameters and the effects of fuel and
sorbent properties, the EERC measures a number of important performance variables and relates
them to design and operating conditions, fuel, and sorbent properties.  Environmental
performance is evaluated by measuring sorbent addition and utilization to achieve the desired
SO<sub>2</sub> control; NO<sub>x</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, CO, and hydrocarbon
emissions; particulate collectibility; and waste characterization and disposal.  Evaluation of thermal
performance is accomplished through measurement of combustion efficiency (carbon burnout); heat
transfer; moisture, ash, and sorbent thermal losses; and fouling in the convective pass.  Operational
performance can be qualitatively assessed by examining for fouling and deposition on heat-transfer
surfaces, agglomeration or sintering of the ash or bed materials, changes in coal or ash particle size,
and evidence of erosion or corrosion.<p>

</h3></font> <p>

     The 55-in.-tall, 3-in.-diameter pressurized fluidized-bed reactor (PFBR) was built in 1992 to
investigate pressurized fluidized-bed combustion sorbent utilization, emissions, alkali gettering,
hot-gas cleanup, and agglomeration over a wide range of operating conditions.  An alkali
sampling probe can be inserted through the top of the hot cyclone.  A data acquisition/control
system is used to monitor/record all critical temperatures, pressures, flow rates, and emissions,
and to remotely control the numerous valves distributed throughout the system.  A solids-sampling
port is located at the top of the cyclone, and flue gas is sampled after the pressure
letdown valve.  The system is designed to operate at pressures up to 300 psi and temperatures up
to 2000&#176;F at ambient pressure.  Either dry or slurry fuel can be used.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>2-in. Bubbling Fluidized-Bed Reactor</b>
</h3></font> <p>

     The 2-in. fluidized-bed reactor was constructed in 1985 for the purpose of investigating the
formation of bed material agglomerates and other bed chemistry aspects on a bench scale. The
use of the reactor permits many of the important variables to be more carefully controlled.  These
include such parameters as bed temperature, bed particle size, chemical and mineral composition
of bed particles, and flue gas oxygen concentration.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>8-in.-Diameter Circulating Cold Model</b>
</h3></font> <p>

     An 8-in.-ID by 20-ft-tall cold flow model was constructed in 1988.  This system is being utilized
for the development of heat-transfer correlations between the circulating fluidized bed and the
containing walls and between horizontal and vertical surfaces suspended in the bed.  Variables
that can be studied include particle size and distribution, gas velocity, solids loading, and vertical
and radial position.  Additional studies include the investigation of the fluid dynamic
characteristics of circulating fluidized beds as a function of radial and axial position in the bed,
and sealing laws.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>4-in.-Diameter Bubbling Cold Model</b>
</h3></font> <p>

     The 4-in.-ID cold flow model constructed out of Plexiglas material has an overall height of 8 ft. 
It operates in the bubbling mode and has been used for cold-flow heat-transfer investigations. 
Air or water can be used as the fluidizing media.

<h2>Advanced Process Systems Equipment</h2> </center> 
<hr>

     The Advanced Process Systems group at the EERC performs research in the areas of pressurized
and nonpressurized conversion technologies.  Most of the process development involves
reducing environments, but oxidizing reactions are also possible.  Bench- and pilot-scale systems
are designed and operated by the group to pave the way for commercial development of new
processes by industry.  At this time, the industrial community is strongly interested in the
advantages presented by pressurized unit operations.  The Advanced Process Systems group is
ready to assist with the research efforts of industry by providing access to a wide array of
equipment and expertise in the area of pressurized and nonpressurized systems.<p>

<p>

     Units available for process development include several thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) units,
a small batch fluidized-bed reactor, a bench-scale continuous fluid-bed reactor, and two process
development units.  These units, in conjunction with a wide variety of analytical support, can
provide the necessary information for process development from a basic understanding of the
process chemistry to commercialization.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Thermogravimetric Analysis Units</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>

     Developed specifically for rapid preliminary screening of basic process chemistry, the TGA units
can perform over 15 tests a week.  With three units available, experimental conditions can be
varied up to a temperature of 1200&#176;C at pressures up to ambient psig or 800&#176;C at
pressure up to 600 psig, and gas atmospheres consisting of inert, steam, NO<sub>x</sub>,
SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, and syngas.  Among the analytical methods
developed to keep pace with this process testing capability are the thermal decomposition profiles,
proximate analysis of fuels, and gasification and combustion testing.  Use of these instruments may
be applicable when kinetic or thermodynamic information is desired.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Integrated Bench-Scale Gasifier</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>

     The integrated bench-scale gasifier (IBG) is a small batch reactor, with a charge capacity of 70
grams of solids.  Its design allows real-time observations of reaction dynamics and generation of
small, inexpensive samples of solids, liquids, and gases under pressures and temperatures of 200
psig and 850&#176;C, respectively.  Feed gas combinations tested to date include
N<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and steam.  Oxidizing atmospheres can also be
tested.<p>

<p>

     Solids are fed and withdrawn from the system in a batchwise fashion.  Liquids are collected in
condensation traps, and the gas is sampled by bags for later gas chromatography (GC) analysis or
on-line for analysis by GC/Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR).<p>

<p>

     The IBG has been used in catalytic reaction studies and also trace element evolution in
gasification studies.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Continuous Fluid-Bed Reactor</b> </h3></font>
<p>

     The EERC operates a 1- to 4-lb/hr continuous fluid-bed reactor (CFBR) bench-scale test unit
previously used to pyrolyze/gasify coal, plastics, automotive shredder residue, and wood chips. 
The unit has also been used in combustion tests and in the processing of lunar soil simulant.  The
system is rated at 815&#176;C (1500&#176;F) and 170 psi.  Various process gases can be used for
reactants.  To date, ten gases have been used, including CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, NO,
NO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, Air, O<sub>2</sub>, HCl,
and  C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>.  Two liquids were also used as reactants:  water and
ethanol.  Products have included solids, liquids, and gases, including coal char, ash, basaltic rock,
diesel fuel, water, and various proprietary compounds.  Various catalysts have also been used to
accelerate chemical reactions.  Procedures exist to handle hazardous materials such as
H<sub>2</sub>S, HCN, and HCl.<p>

<p>

     The reactor consists of a 33-in.-high bed, having a nominal 3-in. ID.  The freeboard section is 17
in. high, with a nominal 4-in. ID.  Any liquid used in the fluidization gas mix is first preheated
and vaporized, then mixed with heated fluidization gas and, finally, heated to reaction
temperature in a superheater.  Some feedstocks may have a very low density so an inert bed
material may be used to facilitate adequate fluidization.  Solids are fed into the reactor through a
dual-auger arrangement.  The first auger, horizontally situated, meters out the feed material.<p>

<p>

     The metered feed drops to the second auger.  This second auger, at a 30&#176; angle from
horizontal, delivers the feed material quickly into the hot reactor.  Because feedstocks may soften,
get sticky, or begin to react at low temperatures, it is important to keep the feed at a low temperature
until it enters the reactor.<p>

<p>

     Spent solids are collected from the reactor through a top bed drain leg, lock hopper-type system. 
Gas, volatiles, and fines leave the top of the reactor and enter a 3-in.-ID cyclone where fines are
removed.  The cyclone is heated with a ceramic filter heater capable of operating at a temperature
of 1650&#176;F and 200 psig.  Gases leaving the cyclone can pass through a reactor vessel designed
for testing of sulfur and chlorine sorbents.  A hydrogen separation membrane has also been
installed and tested on this unit.  The gas stream then enters one of two condensation trains.  The
two condensation trains are identical, each consisting of a water-cooled indirect heat exchanger,
followed by two glycol-cooled indirect heat exchangers.  The stream is then depressurized,
sampled, and metered.<p>

<p>

     A fixed-bed filter cartridge may be located prior to one of the condensation trains.  The cartridge
is made of 3-in. Schedule 10, 304 SS pipe.  Two cartridges were available for use:  one 4 in. long
and one 8 in. long.  The cartridge and the lines leading to it are externally heated.<p>

<p>

     Data collection and process control are achieved with a Genesis&copy; process control software
package.  Sixty-two data points are stored on disk every 30 seconds and are updated on the
screen every 2 seconds.  The data are stored in a Lotus format that can be downloaded or
replayed graphically using the Genesis&copy; software.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Process Development Units</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Process development units (PDUs) currently utilized by the Advanced Process Systems Group to
conduct testing in the 50-250-lb/hr feed rate range are divided into the following areas:<p>

<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Area 100 - Coal Preparation</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>

     Area 100 is for feedstock preparation.  Material can be delivered either by truck or railcar.  Solid
feedstock is prepared to the desired specifications and stored in nitrogen-purged bunkers.  The
following equipment is available for feedstock preparation:<p>

<p>

</ul></ul>
<p>

     A steam dryer is available to dry feedstocks before they enter the carbonizer or TRDU.  The
objective of drying the feed material is to reduce or eliminate the net production of wastewater,
reduce the heat load of the feed, or reduce feed problems that are inherent with excess surface
moisture.<p>

<p>

     <font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Area 200 - Utilities</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The utilities area, Area 200, consists of the following:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Electrical service<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Natural gas<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Cooling water<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Nitrogen<br>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Steam boiler and superheater<br>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Process oxygen<br>
</ul>
<p>

     The boiler, which supplies steam to the carbonizer and TRDU, has the capacity to deliver 400
lb/hr of saturated steam at temperatures up to 400&#176;F (204&#176;C).  The electric superheater
can heat 200 lb/hr of steam from 250&#176;F (121&#176;C) to 1400&#176;F (760&#176;C).<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Area 300 - Solids Feed System</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>

     The carbonizer and TRDU share a common coal feed system.  Solids enter the system in a
nonpressurized hopper with a capacity of 2500 lb.  The coal is gravity-fed into the pressurized
coal lock hopper, which has a capacity of 1700 lb.  A set of valves isolates the pressurized lock
hopper from a small, pressurized surge hopper, which maintains an uninterrupted flow of coal
while the pressurized coal hopper is being filled.  An auger at the bottom of the surge hopper
meters the solids.  The rotational speed of the auger is controlled to produce various feed rates. 
The feed auger drops the solids into a high-velocity gas stream of ambient temperature or
preheated nitrogen or air (572&#176;F/300&#176;C).  The flow of nitrogen entrains the material into
either the carbonizer or TRDU, depending on which unit is in operation.  The solids can also be
augered into the carbonizer rather than by pneumatic transport.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Area 300 - Carbonizer</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Area 300 contains the carbonizing reactor, two cyclones, the feed system, and a natural gas
preheat burner.  The carbonizer can be operated as a spouting- or bubbling-bed reactor with a
feed capacity of 100 lb/hr at temperatures from 900&#176;F (480&#176;C) to 1650&#176;F
(900&#176;C) and steam partial pressures from 0% to 60%.  This design was chosen based on
favorable results with caking coals in the COALCON and KRW gasifier systems.  The operative
principle allowing the use of caking coal in this reactor is the dilution of the entering coal by an
internal recycle of char back to the bottom of the tapered bed, where high velocity and low bed
density also reduce agglomeration.  A similar regime existed in the 400-lb/hr fast fluidized-bed Perry
carbonizer previously used with caking coals at the Grand Forks Energy Technology Center, Grand
Forks, North Dakota.  The body of the carbonizer consists of four 5-ft-tall sections.  The modular
design of the carbonizer allows removal of different sections to obtain a variety of gas and char
residence times.<p> 

<p>

     The lower two sections are constructed of 24-in. 304L SS pipe.  The pipe is lined with 5.25 in. of
insulating refractory and a layer of hard, abrasion-resistant refractory, resulting in a 10-in. ID. 
The two upper sections are constructed of 30-in. 304L SS pipe.  The pipe is lined with 4.625 in.
of insulating refractory and 2 in. of hard refractory, resulting in a 16-in. ID.<p>

<p>

     When operated in spouting-bed mode, the smaller diameter of the lower sections of the reactor is
intended to increase the velocity and turbulence of the bed and thus reduce agglomeration of the
test coals.  When the high-velocity gas jet enters the larger-diameter upper section, its velocity
decreases.  The char entrained in the gas jet falls back into the lower section and dilutes the fresh
coal entering the bottom of the reactor, providing a longer residence time for the char.<p>

<p>

     The fluidization gases can be heated by a stoichiometrically operated natural gas burner.  The
desired operating temperature is maintained by adding air and/or steam or nitrogen to the burner
gas in the carbonizer plenum.  <p>

<p>

     The char can be removed from the system and cooled in a nitrogen-purged tote bin.  The char
fines entrained by the gases leaving the top of the carbonizer are separated from the gas stream
by a pair of cyclones.  The primary cyclone removes particles greater than 10.7 &#181;m in size
with 50% efficiency.<p>

<p>

     The cyclones are constructed of 304 SS pipe.  Refractory was cast inside the pipes to form the
cones at the bottoms of the cyclones.  The fines are removed from the hot-gas stream by the
cyclones and collected in a lock hopper.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Area 400 - Transport Reactor Development Unit</b>
</h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The TRDU proper consists of a riser section with an expanded mixing section at the bottom, a
disengager on top of a solids standpipe, and a cyclone with its associated dipleg.  The solids
standpipe is connected to the riser mixing section by a J-leg transfer line.  All of the components
in the system are refractory-lined and designed to operate at 120 psig and an internal temperature
of 2000&#176;F (1090&#176;C).<p>

<p>

     The premixed coal and limestone feed to the transport reactor can be admitted through three
nozzles located at various elevations on the riser.  During operation, feed will be admitted
through only a single nozzle at a time.<p>

<p>

     Oxidant is fed to the riser by three pairs of nozzles at differing elevations within the mixing zone. 
For the combustion mode of operation, two additional nozzles are provided in the riser to
introduce secondary air.  Hot solids from the standpipe are recirculated through the J-leg into the
mixing zone, where they come in contact with the oxidant and steam.  This feature prevents
exposure of the raw coal to the oxidants, preventing combustion of the volatile matter released. 
Only char is burned to provide process heat.  This staged gasification process is expected to
improve process efficiency.  All gasification, combustion, and desulfurization reactions are
carried out in the riser, as coal, sorbent, and oxidant (with steam for gasification) flow up the
tube.<p>

<p>

     The bulk of entrained solids leaving the riser are separated from the gas stream in the disengager
and are recirculated back to the riser via the standpipe and J-leg.  Gas exiting the disengager is
further screened of solids as it enters the cyclone.  Gas exiting the cyclone pass through the hot-gas
cleanup
loop and proceed to the gas quench train.  Solids removed by the cyclone are
reintroduced to the standpipe and, in turn, to the riser.  A solids stream is withdrawn from the
standpipe via a cooling auger system to provide a means of removing accumulated ash and spent
sorbents.  The rate at which solids are removed from the system is determined by the level of
solids inventory in the standpipe.<p>

<p>

     The TRDU is fully instrumented with an array of internal thermocouples, pressure and
differential pressure transmitters, and gas flowmeters.  All measured process variables are
controlled and recorded by a PC-based process control and data acquisition system.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Area 500 - Gas Quench and Liquid Separation</b>
</h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Area 500 contains the carbonizer and TRDU condensation trains.  Gas passes through the sieve
tower and then the two water scrubbers.  The gas stream enters the bottom of the sieve tower,
where it passes through a series of perforated plates.  The plates in the sieve tower are connected
for easy removal for inspection and maintenance.  In the sieve tower, recycle oil from the bottom
of the tower is cooled and used to quench the incoming gas.  Heat exchangers are used to cool
the recycle streams in the sieve tower.  The Dowtherm on the shell side of this heat exchanger
can be heated electrically or cooled by passing through the tube side of a water-cooled heat
exchanger, removing heat from the overall system.  The tar and oil product is placed in 55-gal
barrels for storage and/or analysis.  After the sieve tower, the gas enters a direct-contact water
scrubber (venturi cyclone) and is sent to a flare.<p>

<p>

     Next is a series of two direct-contact water scrubbers (venturi scrubbers/cyclones) that are used
when the gas stream contains minimal amounts of vaporized organic liquids.  The gas stream is
cooled to between 200&#176;F (93&#176;C) and 225&#176;F (107&#176;C) in the first water
scrubber and to below 125&#176;F (52&#176;C) in the second scrubber.  Heat is removed from the
recirculating water/oil-cooling fluid by a bank of water-cooled tube and shell heat exchangers.  The
gas from the second venturi is flared, and the liquid products are stored in 55-gal barrels.  The flare
operates at a temperature of 1800&#176;F (982&#176;C) and a residence time of 0.5 seconds.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Area 700 - Hot-Gas Filter Vessel</b>
</h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The hot-gas filter vessel (HGFV) is designed to handle all of the gas flow from the TRDU at its
expected operating conditions.  The vessel is approximately 48-in. ID and 185 in. long and
designed to handle gas flows of approximately 325 scfm at temperatures up to 980&#176;C
(1800&#176;F) and pressures of 130 psig.  The refractory lining brings the ID down to 28 in., with a
24-in.-ID shroud to distribute the air flow.  The vessel is sized such that it could handle candle filters
up to 1.5 m long; however, 1-m candles are expected to be utilized in the initial 540&#176;C
(1000&#176;F) gasification tests.  Candle filters are projected to be 2.375-in. OD and with a
minimum 4-in. center line-to-center line spacing.<p>

<p>

     The following are the design criteria and range of operating conditions for the HGFV:<p>

<p>
<ul plain>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Temperature drop access HGFV:  &lt;30&#176;C
(50&#176;F)<p>

<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Nitrogen backpulse system:  Unheated<p>
</ul>
<p>

     Ports have been added to the filter vessel to allow temperature and pressure measurements to be
obtained and for the insertion of a water-cooled borescope probe for inspecting candle filters on-line. 
The ash letdown system consists of two sets of alternating high-temperature valves with a
cylindrical pressure vessel to act as a lock hopper.  Additionally, a preheat natural gas burner is
used to prevent condensation from collecting in the vessel while the gasifier is starting up.<p>

<p>

     The nitrogen backpulse system will backpulse up to four sets of four or five candle filters in a
time-controlled sequence.  The pulse length and volume of nitrogen displaced into the filter vessel is
controlled by the regulated pressure (up to 900 psig) of the nitrogen reservoir and the solenoid
valves used to control the timing of the gas pulse.<p>

System</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The high-pressure and high-temperature sampling system (HPHTSS) was designed to extract
dust-laden flue gas isokinetically from either an oxidizing or reducing environment.  The
maximum design temperature of  the gas stream is specified as 980&#176;C (1800&#176;F) for the
HPHTSS.  The maximum working pressure of the gas stream is specified as 150 psig.<p>

<p>

     The probe is a 3/8-in.-OD and1/8 -in.-ID 304 SS tube.  The probe is used for only one sampling
test and then discarded.  The key to the sampling system is the use of a vessel designed to
withstand high-pressure and high-temperature conditions to enclose the low-pressure sampling
devices.<p>

<p>

     The process gas is cooled through a set of impingers to remove moisture and organic vapors if
present.  A set of up to six impingers may be used in this sampling system.  These impingers are
rated for 200 psig at 120&#176;C (250&#176;F) maximum operating conditions.  The impingers are
made of 304 SS, with the interior surfaces coated with Teflon.  The Teflon-coated surfaces allow the
HPHTSS to be used for trace metal sampling.<p>

<p>

     The dry gas is then throttled to atmospheric pressure and metered through a rotometer and orifice
in order to measure total flow.  The process gas then reenters the main gas stream for cleanup and
disposal.

     The Particulate Research Laboratory (PRL) specializes in flue gas sampling on pilot- and
full-scale systems as well as performing bench-scale experiments using a system capable of
simulating flue gas conditions, such as temperature, particulate loadings, air-to-cloth ratios,
and gas concentrations (e.g., SO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CO,
CO<sub>2</sub>).  The PRL has the capability to maintain and certify calibration of equipment
used for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved sampling procedures as well as a database
that includes most EPA and EPA-proposed sampling methods.  The PRL also provides equipment to
support bench- and pilot-scale testing and sampling.  <p>

     Near-real-time measurements are made for particles ranging in size from 0.5 to 30 &#181;m,
using an aerodynamic particle sizer (APS 33) manufactured by TSI, Inc.  The primary advantages of
this system are the high resolution and the short sampling time.  For most applications, the
particle-size distribution (either as number or mass concentrations) can be obtained within 20
seconds, giving near-real-time measurements.  A more convenient and effective method of plotting
fine-particle emissions as a function of time is to use the computer-generated respirable mass feature
of the APS program.  Rather than looking at the emissions of several particle sizes, this feature 
combines fine-particle emissions by using a calculated value of respirable mass.  The respirable mass
from all of the channels is added to obtain the total respirable mass.<p> 
<p>

     To determine the concentration of submicron particles (0.01 to 1.0 &#181;m), a SMPS, also
manufactured by TSI, Inc., is used.  The SMPS system consists of two primary sections:  an
electrostatic classifier and a CPC.  The purpose of the electrostatic classifier is to remove a
predictable fraction of the particles within a narrow size range and pass these on to the CPC
where the particles are counted.  The CPC measures particle number concentration by using the
light-scattering technique.  This instrument can be used independently of the electrostatic
classifier as a continuous real-time monitor of the number of fine particles that are present in the
flue gas.  An impactor, prior to the gas stream entering the CPC, removes the larger particles,
giving the number concentration of submicron particles.<p>

     Many operational problems encountered during the combustion of coal in utility power
systems are related to the inorganic constituents of the coal.  The problems include deposition
on heat-transfer surfaces, formation of fine particulates that are difficult to collect, erosion and
corrosion of structures, slag flow control, and slag and alkali attack on refractory or structural
ceramic materials.  The Materials Properties Research Laboratories (MPRL) were designed to
work in conjunction with project scientists and engineers at the EERC to determine the
physical properties of coal ash and other ceramic materials and also to test the utility of coal
ash as a valuable by-product of coal utilization.  The MPRL consists of two laboratories, the
High-Temperature Research Laboratory (HTRL) and the Coal By-Products Utilization
Laboratory (CBUL), working in conjunction.  The HTRL focuses on evaluation of the
temperature-dependent physical properties of ash and other ceramic materials, including
viscosity, thermal conductivity, surface tension, thermal stability, strength, and corrosivity. 
Several furnace systems are available for testing with any atmosphere up to temperatures of
1700&#176;C.  The chemical composition and micromorphologies of the materials can be
determined with a scanning electron microscope equipped with Auger electron, electron
spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry detectors.  A high-vacuum electron-beam
vaporizer is also being employed to develop coatings for ceramic materials that will resist
corrosion in high-temperature coal utilization environments.  The CBUL has provided physical
testing and research on concrete, fly ash, and engineering materials for more than 20 years. 
Research and development work on coal by-products have resulted in significant technological
advancement in several applications, including mineral wool, cement replacement,
high-flexural-strength
ceramics, sulfur concrete, high-heat-capacity brick, soil and road subbase
stabilization, controlled low-strength materials, and ash-liner materials.  The CBUL is fully
equipped to evaluate almost all materials testing parameters used in civil engineering, which
are the cornerstone of testing procedures for evaluating the utilization of coal by-products.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Research Activities</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The MPRL are active in a wide variety of research activities at the EERC.  One of the key
difficulties in the development of advanced pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC) and
integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) systems is the need to remove particulates at
high temperatures and pressures.  HTRL research on these advanced combustion systems has
included examination of ash deposition behavior, mechanisms of strength development, and
surface reactions, all at elevated temperatures under simulated combustion atmospheres. 
Power generation facilities in the eastern United States have started blending western U.S.
coals with the local eastern coals in attempts to reduce sulfur emissions.  The HTRL is active
in determining the ash deposition and strength development rates of the blended coals as the
resulting ash deposits and sinters inside a combustion process.  The CBUL is currently
working with the North Dakota Industrial Commission on characterizing thirteen different
sources and types of North Dakota coal by-products for use in the construction of a highway in
western North Dakota.  The results of this construction effort will tremendously enhance
utilization potential of several current nonutilized coal by-products.<p>

<h2>Analytical Research Laboratory</h2> </center>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Laboratory Capabilities</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The Analytical Research Laboratory (ARL) is equipped for routine and specialized analyses of
inorganic and organic constituents, which are performed using classical wet chemistry and
instrumental procedures  on a variety of sample types, including groundwater, wastewater,
sludges, fossil fuels, and geologic materials.  The ARL has  Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) certification through the state of North Dakota, which requires blind sample testing and
periodic on-site evaluations.  The staff is familiar with EPA, American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM), and other standard methods for the analysis of samples.  The ARL provides
analytical support for EERC projects by interacting with project managers to determine
appropriate analytical methods and interpret data accurately.  The ARL also conducts fully
integrated research programs focused on analytical research needs.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Research Activities</b> </h2></font> <p>
<p>

     Several research projects at the EERC are addressing issues related to trace element
transformations in combustion systems.  The ARL has aided in this research by developing
improved microwave digestion techniques for the dissolution of coal and coal fly ash for accurate
quantitation of trace elements present in these types of samples.  Graphite furnace atomic
absorption (GFAA) methods have also been developed for the analysis of these samples, with the
focus directed toward lowering instrument detection limits.  With several EERC projects focusing
on the occurrence and fate of mercury in combustion systems, the ARL staff has gained
considerable experience in mercury chemistry and analytical techniques for providing precise and
accurate data.  Atomic fluorescence using gold amalgamation tubes developed in the ARL has
lowered detection limits to the picogram level.  The ARL is also involved in research activities
that relate to sediment and groundwater contamination.  One research project is assessing the
subsurface fate of monoethanolamine (MEA) at sour gas processing plant sites for which current
analytical data are extremely limited.  The ARL is working to develop ion chromatographic (IC)
techniques for the analysis of MEA in groundwater, soils, sediments, and various experimental
residues.  Specifically, these techniques use two types of ion-exchange columns with
reverse-phase properties in conjunction with three types of detectors (conductivity,
ultraviolet/visible, and electrochemical) for the quantitation of MEA at varying concentrations in
a variety of sample matrices.<p>

<p>

     Other research employs novel leaching characterization methods for determining the
hazardousness of disposed materials and environmental impact by materials incorporated into
construction materials.  In addition to the conventional regulatory leaching procedures, such as
the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and ASTM methods, the ARL uses the
synthetic groundwater leaching procedure (SGLP) and the long-term leaching (LTL) procedure to
better predict environmental impact by disposed materials.  The SGLP was developed at the
EERC to simulate the leaching a material undergoes when in contact with groundwater under field
conditions.  The TCLP, which uses an acetic acid solution, is inappropriate in cases where
materials such as coal combustion by-products are being disposed of in a monofill or used in
construction materials, since, in either case, their contact with acetic acid is highly unlikely. The
LTL procedure, which is an extension of the SGLP, was designed to help determine long-term
trends for the leachability of certain trace elements found in disposed materials.  The LTL
procedure extends the leaching time beyond 18 hours to 60 days or longer.  Extended leaching
times are particularly important when determining leaching trends in materials such as fly ash
which will form hydration products that have the potential for reducing trace element
concentrations in the leachate.  Many of these hydration reactions take as long as 30 days or more
to come to equilibrium, hence the need for an extended leaching procedure such as LTL.<p>

<h2>Natural Materials Analytical Research Laboratory </h2> </center>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Laboratory Capabilities</b> </h3></font> <p>

     <p>

     The Natural Materials Analytical Research Laboratory (NMARL) offers analytical services
designed specifically to address engineering problems in the field of energy research.  State-of-the-art
analytical facilities, combined with an experienced team of researchers, provide a
full range of advanced materials characterization and data interpretation.  An ongoing
commitment to technique development has produced several unique analytical procedures. 
These advanced capabilities have made the NMARL a nationally recognized analytical
research laboratory, especially in the areas of coal, coal by-products, and coal ash utilization
products characterization. <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Research Activities</b> </h3></font> <p> 

<p>

     The NMARL is involved in several major research activities at the EERC.  One major area of
emphasis has been in characterizing the relationship between the mineral composition of coal
and the resultant ash deposit.  Scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques have been
developed to identify the compositions of individual mineral grains in pulverized coal samples
and to determine how each grain is associated with organic coal matter and with other mineral
grains.  The EERC's SEMs are also used to obtain information about the mineral content of
ash deposits.  SEM results for a coal and a corresponding ash deposit, together with
complementary data obtained through x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF),
can be used to determine which coal characteristics tend to cause troublesome ash deposits to
form in boilers.  A specially adapted SEM technique for the smallest ash particles (those less
than a micron in diameter) is available for projects requiring data on the mineralogical
composition of this size fraction, information which is helpful in resolving problems
concerning plume opacity, ceramic filter blockage, or other situations where these particles
play a crucial role.  Mineralogical and chemical characterization of a number of coal and ash
samples can lead to the formulation of predictive models designed to allow electrical utilities to
anticipate ash deposition problems likely to be incurred through the use of a particular coal,
simply by obtaining SEM and associated data for the coal in question.  Many EERC projects
have used this information.  These projects have ranged from large consortia with joint
sponsorship by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI), and several utility companies, to short-term efforts sponsored by a single utility.  As
with all EERC projects, work on ash deposition problems is carefully tailored to suit the needs
of the sponsors.<p>

<p>

     The NMARL is also involved in research into the transformation of trace elements in coal and
other fuels during combustion, as part of a larger EERC-wide effort.  An SEM technique to
determine how trace elements are associated with mineral and organic matter in coal is under
development.  This technique provides information on the occurrence of trace elements in
individual coal mineral grains and ash particles.  These results are complemented with bulk
trace element data obtained through XRF in order to understand how the metals found in a
particular fuel can be expected to behave during combustion. Sponsors for this work include
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and several utility companies.<p>

<p>

     Another research area with significant involvement by the NMARL is fly ash utilization. 
Techniques that are of particular use for fly ash samples are XRD and SEM.  These two
techniques are used to identify mineral phases present, information that is used to predict how
a particular type of fly ash is likely to perform in traditional and nontraditional uses.  The
XRD and SEM results are used to supplement results obtained through more standard fly ash
testing procedures.  This work is sponsored by a consortium of fly ash producers and
marketers as well as DOE.<p>

<h2>GC/MS Laboratory</h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Laboratory Facilities</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Gas Chromatography</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) Laboratory has several Hewlett-Packard
5890 capillary gas chromatographs equipped with both on-column and split/splitless
injection ports and a variety of detectors (flame ionization, electron capture, and atomic
emission).<p>

<p>

     Gas chromatography with capillary columns is utilized to separate complex mixtures of volatile
materials into their individual components.  When a GC is interfaced to a flame ionization
detector (FID), one obtains data essentially proportional to the number of CH groups in the
component (GC peak).  This can then be related to the wt% of the component in the sample. 
An atomic emission detector interfaced to a gas chromatograph allows for specific element
detection.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry</b>
</h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The GC/MS Laboratory has three Hewlett-Packard GC/MS systems (5985B, 5988, and 5972). 
These instruments can operate in either the electron impact or chemical ionization mode. 
Additional interfaces for techniques such as supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)/MS,
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/MS, and thermogravmetric analysis
(TGA)/MS are available in addition to the standard GC interface.<p>

<p>

     When gas chromatography is interfaced to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS), the identity of the
eluting organic compounds can be determined.  Electron impact ionization of organic
molecules produces fragmentation patterns that can be used (within limitations) to identify
individual compounds present in a GC peak.  Many compounds do not produce a recognizable
molecular ion under electron impact conditions.  Altering the amount of energy used in the
ionization process (e.g., chemical ionization methods) generally produces a detectable
pseudomolecular ion and can be used to confirm the molecular weight of the compound.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Supercritical Fluid Extraction</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>

     Instrumentation available for supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and SFC includes pumping
systems from ISCO (100D and 260D), Lee Scientific (501), Suprex (PrepMaster), and
Hewlett-Packard
(7680T).<p>

<p>

     SFE reduces the time needed for the extraction and concentration of organic compounds. 
Supercritical fluids have solvent strengths approaching those of liquid solvents.  The solvent
strength of a supercritical fluid, which is directly related to its density, can be modified by
changing the extraction pressure and temperature.  Supercritical fluids have lower viscosities and
higher solute diffusivities than liquid solvents, thus enhancing mass transfer.  The use of
supercritical fluids that are gases at room temperature (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub> and
N<sub>2</sub>O) makes sample concentration relatively simple.  Capillary SFC is a rapidly
developing method for the separation and identification of organic compounds that lack sufficient
volatility or thermal stability to be separated by GC.<p>

     The Infrared Spectroscopy Laboratory (ISL) includes advanced analytical capabilities for
detailed analyses of inorganic and organic materials.  Solid, liquid, and gaseous products can
be analyzed by a variety of techniques.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Laboratory Facilities</b> </h3></font> <p>

<ul plain>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>GC/FT-IR/MS System</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     A serial gas chromatography/Fourier transform infrared spectrometry/mass spectrometry
(GC/FT-IR/MS) system consisting of a HP 5890A capillary GC and a Nicolet 20-SXB FT-IR
provides vapor-phase infrared spectra of volatile and semivolatile components of a complex
mixture.  On-column and purge-and-trap inlets are available.  When coupled with GC/MS, the
complementary spectroscopic data obtained for each component allow high-confidence
identification and quantitation of the component.<p>

<p>

     Complex mixtures from coal processing have been analyzed with the system.  These include
liquefaction products, hydrotreated coal liquids, and coal gasification liquid by-products. 
Environmental studies of well water and soil components have also been completed, as well as
the identification of intermediate products of combustion of benzene.  The GC/FT-IR system
identified numerous aliphatic and aromatic acetylenic compounds that have not been previously
characterized.  Quantitative isotope dilution GC/FT-IR methods are in place for the
determination of numerous phenolics, aromatics, carboxylic acids, and other organics present
in aqueous, nonaqueous, or headspace samples.<p>

<p>

     A Nicolet 20-SCB FT-IR spectrometer system is operated with a photoacoustic accessory and a
diffuse reflectance accessory in addition to the capillary GC interface and transmission cell. 
These cells are required for the analysis of coals, chars, activated carbons, minerals, and
coal-derived solid
materials.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Molecular Weight Determination</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>

     An LDC-Milton Roy KMX-6 low-angle laser light-scattering (LALLS) photometer and a
KMX-16 differential refractometer are used for the accurate measurement of weight-average
molecular weights of coal macromolecules and synthetic polymers used in modeling coal
structures.  Combined with gel permeation chromatography, the LALLS gives an accurate
measurement of the molecular weight distribution of the samples.  The optical anisotropy of
the macromolecules can also be obtained with the LALLS by using polarizing filters.  These
data give information on the shape or form of the molecules.<p></ul>

can be designed and fabricated in the EERC machine shop for use in the simulation of large-scale
process
evaluation and data collection, which are essential for process development and
troubleshooting.

<p>

     The EERC routinely has requirements for the design and construction of highly specialized
equipment.  These requirements often involve using materials and equipment at or beyond
normal design limits.  In order to ensure the safety of researchers and the integrity of the
research equipment, the EERC has a mechanical design group to address these needs.  <p>

<p>
<font color="#990066"><h2>  <b>Capabilities</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The members of the mechanical design group represent a broad range of engineering design
backgrounds.  The current design staff has experience in the following areas:<p>

<p>

<p>


<ul plain>

</ul>
     <p>

The mechanical design group has incorporated a number of software programs in order to meet
the demanding design requirements of EERC researchers.  In-house programs have also been
developed to support the pressure vessel and pressure piping design activities.  <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Applications</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     In addition to the design of equipment for in-house use, the design group has been asked by a
number of manufacturing firms to provide specific design expertise in the areas of stress
analysis, design optimization of mechanical components,  and CFD.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Facilities and Equipment</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The design group uses Pentium-based PCs as well as Sun Sparc10-41 and Sparc10-51
engineering work stations.  The design group also has access to the University of North
Dakota's supercomputer for more complex finite element analysis (FEA) applications.<p>

<p>

<h2>Information and Computing Technologies</h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</i></b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The EERC recognizes the need to manage quickly and accurately the vast amount of
information being developed in various energy and environmental technologies.  The EERC
has the facilities, equipment, and experienced personnel to manage information and develop
predictive models, relational database management systems (including geographic information
systems [GIS]), and multimedia applications.  Our information and computing technologies are
extremely valuable tools for rapidly assessing and manipulating information,  and this ability
has become critical to the EERC's research.  Along with the development of processes and
products, these information systems are also key deliverables in our research programs.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Capabilities</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The EERC maintains a uniquely integrated information and computer technologies group that
consists of computer systems, modeling, and database design.  Tools developed in the
computing and information technologies area allow researchers and clients to use the
information generated in EERC research programs efficiently. <p>

<p>

     Computer systems are an indispensable tool within the EERC.  Our computational capabilities
revolve around personal computers and workstations integrated in a local area network.  To make
information readily available to clients, the EERC is an integral part of a wide area network,
allowing researchers direct access to the Internet and the ability to share information with clients
through our World-Wide Web server and FTP (file transfer protocol) site
(http:/www.eerc.und.nodak.edu).  This server provides current news and information on EERC
projects and personnel and allows clients to transfer information directly to the EERC.<p>

<p>

     Predictive models are developed to enhance fundamental research and aid clients in making sound
economic and operational decisions at a fraction of the cost required by testing.  For example, the
ash transformations model (ATRAN) predicts the particle-size and composition distribution of
ash produced during the combustion of coal in tangentially fired pulverized coal boilers and
cyclone-fired boilers.  This information is used to optimize the design and operation of ash
collection equipment and can aid in fuel selection to minimize the effects of ash deposition.<p>

<p>

     An immense amount of analytical and systems performance data is generated within and
outside of the EERC during experimental testing.  The most efficient means of managing and
utilizing these data is through the use of relational database systems.  Database systems allow
researchers and clients enhanced problem-solving capabilities by presenting complex data in a
more usable form, allowing for improved interpretations.  Databases which are spatially
oriented can be portrayed in a very meaningful format through the use of GIS.  GIS presents
data in two- or three-dimensional formats, such as contour and thematic maps. <p>

<title>Advanced Recycling Technologies: 
Technical Aspects and Regulatory Issues
Workshop</title>

<h2> Advanced Recycling Technologies: Technical Aspects and Regulatory Issues Workshop
</h2> </font> 
</center>
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The EERC has been developing advanced recycling technologies in conjunction with several
sponsors and research organizations for the past 3 years.  In May 1995, the EERC hosted a
workshop for industry, academia, and federal, state, and local government agencies.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective of the Advanced Recycling Technologies workshop was to promote
dialogue among industry, government, the research community, and public interest groups,
enabling the commercialization of new and innovative recycling technologies.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>
<ul plain>
<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Technology Issues</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The workshop was divided into four sections:  technology, regulatory,
environmental/economics, and group discussions.<p>

<p>

     The workshop included an overview of advanced recycling technologies, with discussion on
the status of recycling in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Japan.  Work by British
Petroleum, BASF, VEBA, and others was summarized.  Trends in feedstocks in the United
States and Europe were discussed regarding the types of plastics produced today and those
planned for tomorrow.<p>

<p>

     Two case studies of tertiary recycling of postconsumer plastics were discussed in detail:  the
EERC fluid bed and the Conrad Industries auger (Washington).  The presentation included
general product descriptions, process parameters, and general environmental and occupational
exposure control philosophies.<p>

<p>

     Several presentations were made on the types of liquid hydrocarbon products that can be
produced.  Gaseous olefins as an alternative product were also discussed.  Detailed analysis of
liquid hydrocarbons included boiling point curves, specific gravity, individual component
breakdowns, and aromaticity data.<p>

<p>

     Solid residuals from the chlorine sorbents are produced in some systems.  Standard U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) leaching tests have been conducted, and discussion
also included potential products that may be derived from these residuals.<p>

<p>

     The largest single contaminant in all tertiary recycling streams is chlorine.  Estimates are that
from 1% to 5% of the feedstocks are polyvinyl chlorides, of which 50% by weight is chlorine. 
Calcium-based sorbents have been used to remove chlorine from the hydrocarbon liquids. 
These results were presented, along with the types of analyses and their reliability.  Discussion
also included heavy metals and the fate of nitrogen-based polymers such as nylon and
polyurethane.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Regulatory Issues</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     A general overview of technologies, products that are produced, and the implications of
premanufacturing notifications was presented.  Information was included on individuals
engaged in recycling activities and their obligations under the Toxic Substances Control Act
(TSCA).  TSCA regulatory requirements, procedures, and policies were presented, with an
emphasis on the manufacture and import of chemical substances generated during recycling
activities.  It is important to EPA that nontraditional chemical manufacturers are provided with
the opportunity to be made aware of their responsibilities under the TSCA and other related
federal laws.<p>

<p>

     Nomenclature issues for searching the TSCA Chemical Substance Inventory to determine
whether a substance is considered an "existing" chemical substance, one that is already listed
on the inventory, or whether the substance is considered a "new" substance, subject to
premanufacture notification reporting prior to commercial manufacture, were presented.<p>

<p>
<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Economic Issues</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Commercializing issues were discussed on today's, yesterday's, and tomorrow's wastes.  Also,
a presentation was made on the steps involved in moving any process into the commercial
arena, including creating a competitive advantage, considering products, establishing historical
trends, making realistic future assessments, and penetrating the market through customer
acceptance.  A brief presentation was made from the perspective of the local consumer in
regard to costs and other available options (landfills) and how job creation plays a role.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>      <b>Group Discussions</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     An open discussion was aimed at developing a dialogue among industry, the research

<p>

     On November 1-5, 1994, the EERC and the Power Research Institute of Prague (EG&Uacute;
Praha)
cosponsored their second conference since 1992 in the Czech Republic, entitled "Energy and
Environment:  Transitions in East Central Europe."  This conference was a continuation of the
EERC's joint commitment, initiated in 1990, to facilitate solutions to short- and long-term
energy and environmental problems in East Central Europe.  Production of energy from coal
in an environmentally acceptable manner is a critical issue facing East Central Europe, because
the region continues to rely on coal as its primary energy source.  The region's energy
infrastructure must be methodically upgraded as new technology is phased in during the
coming decades.<p>

<p>

     With the theme "Partnerships for a Better Quality of Life," the conference and its associated
workshops attracted more than 300 industry representatives, government officials, and
researchers from 20 countries.  Nations represented at the conference included the Czech
Republic, the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Switzerland,
Sweden, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Germany, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Austria,
the Ukraine, Russia, Yugoslavia, and Canada.  Among the topics addressed were conventional
and advanced energy generation systems, the economic operation of energy systems, air
pollution controls, power system retrofitting and repowering, financing options, regulatory
issues, energy resource options, waste utilization and disposal, and long-range environmental
issues.<p>

<p>

     Prior to the conference, EERC staff met with the East Central European Advisory Council
which was formed in 1993 to provide guidance on the conference mission and program.  A
similar council was formed in the United States.  The EERC is continually exploring potential
opportunities for partnerships with East Central European organizations and companies.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The goal of the conference was to develop partnerships between industry, government, and the
research community in East Central Europe and the United States to solve energy and
environmental issues in a manner that fosters economic development.  Partnerships have been
developed in the areas of systems technology, environment, resource evaluation, and social
economics.  Other objectives were to:<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
 <IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> Provide a forum for East Central European professionals
involved in science, engineering,
business, and government to discuss energy and environmental situations and needs.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">   Stimulate an exchange of practical scientific ideas and
engineering technologies between East
Central European and U.S. professionals.<br>
<p></ul>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Both Prague conferences have assisted in facilitating solutions for long- and short-term energy
and environmental problems in East Central Europe by bringing together people, ideas, and
technologies that can be applied to specific problems in a systematic manner.  Conference topics
were carefully chosen and balanced to provide a global perspective against which local and
regional issues could be evaluated.<p>

<p>

     Completion of the second international conference in Prague was a step toward major economic
development and job creation opportunities through the export of American technologies to East
Central Europe.  The conference assisted participants in building relationships leading to
partnerships that, in turn, create opportunities.  Strategic contacts made by conference
participants have led to major projects and, more importantly, a continuation of the
communication process, which leads to opportunities for equal partnerships.  The 1994 Prague
conference also demonstrated the EERC's long-term commitment to East Central Europe.<p>

<p>

     The Prague conference attracted key, quality people--CEOs and decision makers--from a variety
of industry, government, and research organizations.  Another important result of the conference
was discussions on removing socioeconomic barriers in East Central Europe and encouraging
movement toward a market economy while continuing to address the concerns and the needs of
the region.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Since regaining their political and economic freedom in 1989, the nations of East Central Europe
are emerging from five decades of centralized economic management and environmental neglect. 
Economic recovery, environmental restoration, and political stability, as well as eventual
entrance into the European Community, require a reordering of policies and priorities, including
those bearing on energy and the environment.  As the largest regional energy source, the coal
industry is the prime target for modernization and downsizing to improve the environment and
quality of life.  East Central Europe requires clean, efficient, stable, and low-cost energy to
facilitate its transition from a centrally planned to a free-market economy.  Concurrently, the
region must undertake remedial action to clean up environmental impacts to the air, water, and
soil.  This combination of circumstances has created a new market for energy and environmental
technologies and services, as well as very substantial investment and partnership opportunities. 
<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective of this workshop, which preceded the second "Energy and Environment: 
Transitions in East Central Europe," conference in Prague, was to identify the technologies,
technical issues, and solutions that will advance the production of clean burning briquettes for
East Central Europe, where these fuels are used extensively to meet residential and small
industrial/commercial energy requirements.  The workshop focused on the technical,
economic, and environmental factors affecting brown coal briquetting options to produce
smokeless fuels for use in the region.  A projected outcome of this workshop is the formation
of commercial ventures involving U.S. technologies and East Central European industries.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Results of the workshop indicated that the commercialization of new ecological and smokeless
fuels
depends only partly on technical factors.  Equally important are legislative action on air pollution
standards and fuel composition limits, aggressive marketing of premium solid fuels, and "bankable"
business plans for new or revitalized plants.  This workshop was an important first step toward
adopting new clean coal technologies and building partnerships for initiating commercial ventures. 
Both briquetted fuels and lump coal are used extensively throughout East Central Europe for
residential space heating, as well as commercial and small industrial heat generation.  Most of these
applications do not involve high-quality low-sulfur fuels, and conversion to a smokeless solid fuel at
significant added cost will likely be accomplished only through emissions legislation.  Standards are
set either in terms of the emission rate (e.g., 5 grams per hour in the United Kingdom) or the volatile
content of the fuel (a maximum of 15 wt% defines smokeless fuel in the Czech Republic). 
Technically feasible improvements in production methods that would substantially resolve dispersed
air pollution problems from household use of coal or briquettes are available based on a variety of
advanced methods for coal cleaning, drying, carbonizing, and briquetting with additives.  <p>

<p>

     The potential size of the market for smokeless fuels is illustrated by the estimated 50 million tons
of residential solid fuel used throughout East Central Europe, including the Ukraine.  Briquettes
of varying quality account for only about one-fourth of this total, and briquette production has
been declining for economic and ecological reasons.  Poland has closed its conventional
(noncarbonized) briquetting plants and is now producing 180,000 tons of smokeless fuel per
annum.  Production of conventional briquettes in the former East Germany has declined by 90%
to under 6 million tons per year.  In Western Germany, the current production of 10 million tons
of brown coal briquettes represents only 15% of capacity.  In the Czech Republic, only one plant,
producing 600,000 tons per year of partially devolatilized briquettes, remains in operation at
Vresova, after the plant at Tisova was closed in 1993.  <p>

<p>

     The conclusion reached at the 1994 workshop in Prague was that a significant market for
improved smokeless fuels in East Central Europe could be served by small plants using indigenous
coals and drawing on the developmental methods described in the workshop proceedings. 
Imported natural gas and anthracite are the competing alternatives.  Several smokeless fuel
projects are being implemented or planned, including the ECOCOAL process in Poland,
MIBRAG in Central Germany, and an Ostrava hard coal project in the Czech Republic. 
Specifications for future smokeless fuels will typically include a volatile content below 10%, sulfur
content below 1%, high heat content (e.g., 25 MJ/kg), good strength both wet and dry, good
ignition characteristics, low ash, size and shape appropriate for heating appliances, and reasonable
cost.  Representative costs given for smokeless briquettes are in the range of $80 to $120/metric
ton, or $3.20 to $4.80/GJ at a heating value of 25 MJ/kg.

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Since regaining their political and economic freedom in 1989, the nations of East Central
Europe (ECE) are emerging from five decades of centralized economic management and
environmental neglect.  Economic recovery, environmental restoration, and political stability,
as well as entrance into the European Community, require a reordering of policies and
priorities, including those bearing on energy and the environment.  <p>

<p>

     ECE economies are among the most energy-intensive in the world, due mainly to subsidized
energy prices and emphasis on basic, energy-intensive industries with low value-added per unit
output.  There is a heavy reliance on coal for electricity and household heating.  In the past,
energy prices were seriously distorted, and energy prices have still not been fully adjusted to
market levels.  Demand for energy has continuously declined since 1989 and is only now
beginning to stabilize.  Serious barriers inherited from former centralized planning systems are
delaying implementation of energy conservation and efficiency improvements.  The
restructuring of the energy sector currently under way is crucial for the success of overall
market reform in the ECE countries.  Official ECE energy projections are characterized by a
shift from coal to gas, oil, or nuclear energy; significant energy efficiency improvements; and
stringent regulations designed to reduce environmental pollution.  Future energy policies in
ECE countries will continue to be shaped by economic restructuring, efficiency improvements,
environmental targets, and energy supply diversification.  <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The overall objective of this workshop, which preceded the second "Energy and Environment: 
Transitions in East Central Europe," conference in Prague, was to identify technical solutions
leading to implementation of clean coal technologies in East Central Europe.  This workshop
focused on understanding the implications of varying fuel properties on combustion systems,
including operational issues, gaseous and solid emissions, and the reuse/disposal of the ash
residuals.  The cost, efficiency, and environmental performance of various options were
discussed, including conventional systems, options for retrofit/repowering, and emerging
advanced power systems.  The workshop provided a forum to identify opportunities for
commercial ventures involving U.S. technologies and East Central European industries.  <p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The session, entitled "Improvements in Availability and Life Extension of Existing Units/Impacts
of East Central European Coal Properties," presented a variety of options that can be used to
improve efficiency and availability at a very low capital cost.  Information was presented on how
the properties of indigenous ECE coals impact the availability and efficiency of existing units. 
Aging of power plants, use of low-quality fuels, and lack of adequate maintenance have resulted
in poor operating performance for a high percentage of the fossil fuel-fired generating capacity of
East Central Europe.  Capital constraints on the addition of new capacity are such that the
operating improvement and life extension of existing capacity may often be the only feasible way
to maintain or increase system output in the near future.  The availability and efficiency of aging
plants can be increased significantly by implementing well-structured maintenance and
performance optimization procedures.  Availability improvements of 10% to 15% can be achieved
at a maintenance cost as low as $10-$20/kW/yr.  Training of key power plant staff should be an
important part of implementing these programs.  Blending of indigenous fuels with low-sulfur,
low-ash subbituminous coals imported from Indonesia, the western United States, or South Africa
could also help to maintain design ratings, improve reliability and efficiency, and meet air quality
regulations.  However, the social impacts of imported fuels on the domestic mining industries
would be an important consideration in fuel switching or blending decisions.  <p>

<p>

     The session entitled "Retrofit and Repowering for Emissions Control and Efficiency" presented
information on the most cost-effective retrofits for emissions control and advanced power systems
for either repowered or new installations.  A summary of available options and costs for
controlling SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, and particulate was presented.  Low-cost
options include electrostatic precipitator (ESP) upgrades, low-NO<sub>x</sub> burners, overfire
air, natural gas reburning, selective noncatalytic reduction, and sorbent injection.  Higher-cost
options requiring larger capital expenditures to achieve substantially higher removal efficiencies
include new ESP or baghouse installations, selective catalytic reduction, and wet and dry flue gas
desulfurization.  Other alternatives for reducing emissions of SO<sub>2</sub> and possibly
some other air toxics include coal cleaning or switching to a cleaner coal.  <p>

<p>

     Advanced power systems for coal firing provide an opportunity to meet very stringent emission
requirements while producing electricity at far greater efficiency.  Emerging pressurized fluid-bed
combustion (PFBC) and integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) generating systems can,
in the near future, be installed at costs similar to those of conventional technology.  The high
reactivity and nonagglomerating properties of many ECE coals make them acceptable fuels for
properly selected advanced power systems that are designed to accommodate high levels of
moisture, ash, and sulfur.  <p>

<p>

     The session, "Opportunities for Partnerships," established the groundwork from which
partnerships can be developed.  Mr. Thomas Bechtel, Director of the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) Morgantown Energy Technology Center, presented a perspective on problems facing East
Central Europe based on recent U.S. experience with the U.S. Clean Coal Technology
Demonstration program.  The U.S. power industry, in cooperation with DOE, is demonstrating a
suite of 45 technologies, with an investment of over $7 billion.  A principal goal of this workshop
was to share the experience gained from the Clean Coal Technology Demonstration program and
to begin forming the partnerships to transfer the technology.  Least-cost planning can be used to
assess the clean coal options available.  Projects in several countries have obtained financing
through a combination of private and public financing from the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation, the
U.S. Import-Export Bank, commercial banks, and institutional investors.  U.S. industries need to
recognize that developing these markets will take time and effort.  Dr. Gerald Groenewold,
Director of the EERC, emphasized that the partnerships initiated in the workshop should evolve
to achieve significant accomplishments.

<h2> Alaska Native, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian Remote-Site Power Generation
Workshop:
Transferring the Alaskan Experience </h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), together with the Alaska Division of Energy, Doyon
Limited, and a number of native corporations, has undertaken a project to develop alternative
small-scale power generation technology options for application in remote villages of Alaska.  The
EERC is working with the DOE Morgantown Energy Technology Center to assess options for
using the tremendous reserves of high-quality coal found in Alaska in small-scale power units
fired on indigenous resources such as coal, coal-bed methane, and municipal solid waste.<p>

<p>

     The Alaska Native, American Indian, and Native Hawaiian Remote-Site Power Generation
Workshop:  Transferring the Alaskan Experience builds upon the Small Alternative Power
Generation Workshop held in Anchorage, Alaska, in May 1994.  Alaska Natives, state officials,
and representatives from industry, universities, and DOE discussed the energy needs of the
indigenous villages and identified the most suitable energy options to meet those needs.  Since
that time, projects have progressed to demonstrate these small, easy-to-operate-and-maintain,
environmentally friendly, economically acceptable technologies using indigenous fuels and waste
materials to produce electricity and heat.  The lessons learned to date in Alaska are transferable to
Native Hawaiian and American Indian communities throughout the United States.<p>

<h2>Environmental Education Committee</h2> </center> 
<hr>


<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>
     The Environmental Education Committee (EEC) was formed in November 1993 by staff
members who were concerned about promoting environmentally responsible activities at the
EERC and in the larger community.  The EEC has approximately twenty members, all
volunteers from the EERC staff, and meets several times a year to plan events.  The EEC
works closely with the recycling coordinators employed by the city of Grand Forks and by the
University of North Dakota.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>
<p>

     Goals of the EEC include facilitating reduction of office and laboratory wastes at the EERC
and elsewhere on campus and promoting pollution prevention by working with local schools.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The EEC is active in several areas.  In cooperation with the North Dakota Forest Service, the
Committee hosts environmental education workshops for teachers of grades K-12.  The 15-hour,
1-credit workshops explore uses of the "Project Learning Tree" curriculum, a package of hands-on
activities
that focus on helping children develop critical thinking skills so that they can learn to
make wise decisions about the use of our air, land, and water resources.<p>

<p>

     The EEC also conducts waste audits annually.  The audits involve sorting and weighing two days'
worth of garbage to evaluate the status of recycling at the EERC.  Between the first waste audit
in December 1993 and the second audit in February 1995, the total amount of garbage generated
per person was reduced by 39%.  This change reflects the overall success of the EERC's recycling
program, which was expanded greatly in 1994.  EERC employees are currently able to recycle
many items on the job, including all types of paper, cardboard, cans, glass, and plastic.<p>

<p>

     Other functions of the EEC include participating in local environmental fairs, assisting with
school
tours of the EERC, helping with campus events sponsored by the student environmental club, and
other community outreach activities.<p>

<title>Mercury in the Oil and Gas Industry: A
One-Day Workshop</title>
</head>

<h2>Mercury in the Oil and Gas Industry: A One-Day Workshop </h2> </center> 
<hr>



<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The use of mercury-filled flowmeters (manometers) at gas metering stations has resulted in soils
contaminated with elemental mercury.  These manometers are used at gas production wells, along
pipelines, at gas processing plants, at underground storage facilities, and within gas distribution
systems.  A major research program was designed to address how the gas industry could deal with
mercury contamination at its facilities.  The primary tasks of the mercury research program
included  1) a literature review and development of a bibliographic database;  2) the evaluation of
sampling, preservation, and analytical protocols for mercury;  3) the evaluation of leaching
techniques;  4) the development of a risk-based site prioritization model;  5) the site
characterization and groundwater monitoring of six metering stations;  and 6) an evaluation of
existing and developing remediation technologies for mercury-contaminated soils.  Although
approximately 1700 documents resulting from this research have already been distributed to
industry managers, consultants, regulators, and researchers, additional information transfer is
needed that summarizes the various aspects of the research in an interactive environment.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The objective of this project is to provide a 1-day workshop at three locations in the United States
(New Orleans, Pittsburgh, and San Diego).  The target audience is environmental managers in the
oil and gas industry who are dealing with mercury contamination at gas metering sites.  The
workshop is expected to draw wider interest from regulators, consultants, and researchers that are
dealing with mercury contamination issues.  The workshops will provide a forum for the
researchers to interact with gas industry personnel and other interested parties that are applying
the research results to their specific facilities.<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

 These workshops are expected to benefit the attendees by summarizing a large body of current
research designed to address directly the specific issues that the industry is dealing with at its
sites.  The interactive forum of a workshop was chosen to provide a dialogue between the
researchers and the users of the research, which should benefit all parties involved.<p>

<h2>Recent Advances in Research on Ash Deposition in Utility Boilers:  Practical Applications for
the Electric
Power and Coal Industries </h2> </center> 
<hr>


<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Background</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Many of the operational problems encountered during coal combustion and utilization are
related to the inorganic constituents of the coal.  Ash-related problems encountered include the
formation of fine particulates that are difficult to collect, sulfur oxide emissions, corrosion and
erosion of boiler parts, and ash deposition.  Because of the economic impact of these
problems, volumes of literature are available on the subject.  Unfortunately, the information
flow between the researchers and engineers and managers who apply the technology to
industry is lacking.  To improve the communication between researchers and the utility
community, the EERC has organized this program to present 1-day short courses throughout
the United States on the topic of ash formation and deposition.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Objectives</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     This project is designed to facilitate better communication between researchers and industry
through a series of 1-day courses on the subject of ash formation and deposition.  The goal of
this course is to provide an overview of recent research that is increasing the understanding of
mineral behavior in coal utilization and leading to the advancement of methods to predict ash
behavior.  This course begins with a description of minerals in coals and discusses the physical
and chemical properties of the materials as they move through the boiler.  Emphasis is placed
on how these properties affect boiler operation.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>Results</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The course has been presented at three sites throughout the first half of 1995, with an additional
five courses planned over the next 18 months.  One course is currently scheduled for Petten,
Netherlands.  Because of the success of these programs in the United States, additional programs
are being designed for eastern European and Asian countries.  It is anticipated that approximately
60 participants from all branches of industry will attend this course in each year of its
presentation.<p>

<h2>Technology Commercialization and Education Center for Air Toxic Metals Program Area 5
</h2> </center> 
<hr>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Background</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center
(EERC) of the University of North Dakota (UND) emphasizes research, development,
demonstration, and commercialization of innovative environmental cleanup technologies through
partnerships between government, industry, and the EERC in the areas of applied science and
engineering.  CATM was established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is
focused on minimizing the effects of air toxic metal pollutants on the environment.  The Clean Air
Act Amendments of 1990 require regulatory actions addressing 189 substances, including air
toxic metals.  In order to develop regulations, CATM is working with industry and government to
develop sufficient information on air toxic metals to provide a scientific basis for preventing and
controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate and impacts of air toxic metals on plants and
animals, including humans.  CATM-related programs are focused on the development of methods
to minimize the release of air toxic metals via practical prevention and control methods based on
scientific understanding and principles.  To facilitate research efforts and dissemination of
information, CATM is organized into five integrated program areas:  Program Area 1 - Air Toxic
Metals Transformation Mechanisms, Program Area 2 - Analytical Methods Development,
Program Area 3 - Control Technologies, Program Area 4 - Modeling and Database, and Program
Area 5 - Technology Commercialization and Education.<p>

<p>

     Because of the time line that Congress has imposed on EPA, training, education, and
dissemination of up-to-date information to industry and government agencies (e.g., EPA, U.S.
Department of Energy) in a timely manner is critical.  Sharing and transferring the latest
research findings to industry and EPA will greatly assist in establishing scientifically based
regulatory standards.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Objectives</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     The goal of Program Area 5 is to transfer technical information concerning trace metals
produced by CATM to interested parties in research organizations and throughout the energy
and environment industry, as well as to provide training and educational opportunities for both
students and professionals.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h2> <b>Results</b> </h2></font> <p>

<p>

     Two major meetings were held:  the first annual meeting at the EERC in May 1994 and a
Program Affiliates (PA) meeting at Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, in December 1994. 
The Program Affiliates prospectus has been well received and has generated significant interest in
the CATM program.  To date, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), Otter Tail Power
Company, Northern States Power Company, Empire State Electric Energy Research Corporation,
and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. (Japan), are official members of the program.<p>

<p>

     Part of the mission of CATM involves contributing to improved environmental education
opportunities for students at UND.  As a step toward that goal, CATM provided summer funding
for UND faculty to develop stronger environmental education components in their courses.  Two
courses were selected for funding through  a competitive review process.  The courses are
"Advanced Chemical Engineering Kinetics," taught by Dr. Kirk Schulz of the Department of
Chemical Engineering, and "Values and the Environment," taught by Dr. Scott Lowe of the
Department of Philosophy and Religion and Dr. Dexter Perkins of the Department of Geology
and Geological Engineering.<p>

<p>

     A practical, 1-day short course on air toxic metals entitled "Trace Element Transformations in
Coal-Fired Power Plants" is under development for presentation to the coal-fired utility industry. 
The course will cover topic areas such as trace elements in coal, sampling and analyses, trace
element partitioning, control technologies, and a regulatory overview.<p>

<p>

     Two CATM newsletters were published and distributed to industry and other interested parties. 
The newsletter is designed to inform interested parties of CATM activities and encourage further
industrial participation.<p>

<p>

     Education efforts focused on outreach activities.  A voluntary Environmental Education
Committee (EEC) was formed to facilitate these activities and promote environmental awareness. 
The EEC assisted the Grand Forks Recycling Coordinator in planning the city's first-ever Waste
Reduction Week, consisting of numerous public events.  The EEC's contributions included
organizing a day of open-house public tours at the EERC, emphasizing pollution prevention
technologies, and helping to staff informational booths at local supermarkets.  The city of Grand
Forks plans to make this an annual event, and the EEC will continue to be available for future
assistance.

<font color="#990066"><h3>Background</h3></font> <p>

<p>

     Trace element emissions pose a problem to existing and emerging electricity-generating
technologies that utilize coal.  A problem associated with trace elements is the release to the
environment of trace elements that are considered air toxics.  As a result of amendments to the
Clean Air Act, the control of nearly 200 air toxics or chemical contaminants is required. 
Under the amendments, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has gained more
authority for regulating air toxics.  EPA will identify emitters and automatically require that
the source of the emitted toxic substance apply maximum achievable control technologies if 10
tons per year or more of any one of the 189 substances, or 25 tons of any combination of the
substances, is emitted.  In addition, the amendment directs EPA to evaluate the public health
risk after controls have been applied.  Therefore, emission control of these air toxics from
power-generating systems is likely to be required.  In order to develop effective technologies
to control trace element emissions within anticipated regulatory requirements, the type and
quantity of trace elements emitted from coal-fired systems must be determined as a function of
system, operating conditions, and coal composition.<p>

<p>

     The fate of trace elements in a coal-fired system is closely tied to how the trace elements are
associated in the coal as well as to system conditions.  Trace elements in coals are found in many
forms, including organic associations, such as salts of carboxylic acid groups and organic
coordination complexes, and mineral associations, such as sulfides, sulfates, silicates,
phosphates, and carbonates.  During combustion or gasification, these inorganic elements are
partitioned into inorganic gases, liquids, and solids.  The amount of these trace elements
transformed into the various states depends upon the characteristics of the elements and how they
are associated with minerals and coal particles.  Minerals that are not associated with coal particles
do not experience the same environment as minerals that are intimately associated with coal
particles during the gasification process.  System conditions such as reducing and oxidizing
environments, gas-phase composition, pressure, and temperature influence the partitioning of the
air toxics between various gases, liquids, and solid inorganic components as a function of location
in the system.  In order to predict the form of the inorganic species during combustion or
gasification, detailed information on the distribution of major mineral phases and organically
associated inorganic elements must be determined.  This information is critical since the
transformations and interactions partition the trace elements between various gases, liquids, and
solids.  Detailed knowledge of the reactions and transformations coupled with the ability to predict
trace element behavior accurately will provide essential information as to the form of the
inorganic species at any point in the combustion or gasification system.  This information is
essential in developing effective air toxic emission control technologies.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3>Objectives</h3></font> <p>

<p>

     The goal of the workshop was to identify key issues that would aid in the development of
technologies to control toxic trace element emissions.  The workshop focused on determining the
level of understanding of toxic trace element transformation mechanisms and of technologies used to
control their emission from coal-fired power plants.  The objectives of the workshop were 1) to
provide a forum that allowed for the interaction of international experts on toxic trace metals, 2)
to have presentations made on key aspects relative to the behavior and control of trace metals
classified as air toxics, 3) to have open forum discussions or working group meetings on key
issues, and 4) to produce a text that combines the papers presented and discussions held at the
workshop.<p>

     The workshop, entitled "Trace Element Transformations in Coal-Fired Power Systems," was held
in Scottsdale, Arizona, on April 19-22, 1993.  The goal of the workshop was to establish the
current state of scientific understanding of trace element transformations in combustion systems
and to provide a basis for the development of an integrated research and development program to
fill knowledge gaps applying to the control of toxic emissions.  A peer-reviewed proceedings was
published as a special issue of Elsevier's <i>Fuel Processing Technology</i> (<i>Trace
Element
Transformations in Coal-Fired Power Systems</i>; Benson, S.A.; Steadman, E.N.; Mehta, A.K.;
Schmidt, C.E., Eds.; Elsevier Science Publishers:  Amsterdam, Aug. 1994; Vol. 39, Nos. 1-3, 492
p.)  The proceedings combines the papers presented and discussions held at the workshop.  The
proceedings focuses on the state of understanding and research needs related to trace element
transformations.  A summary of the major findings based on the presentations and discussions was
listed in the proceedings.  The following lists the suggestions to be considered in future research
planning.<p>

<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Trace Elements in Coal</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">    Trace element databases should be developed that provide
quality data for predicting coal quality relative to trace metals.  Guidelines for database use should be
developed, and databases should include information on cleaned coals and commercially used
coals.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Analytical methods to determine trace metals should be
developed/enhanced to quantify the abundance, species, and mode of occurrence of trace metals in
coal.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">    Sorbents that are added to the coal should be characterized,
since sorbents such as limestones can vary significantly in trace element abundance.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">    Economics of coal cleaning as a precombustion removal method
of trace metals should be determined.<br>
</ul>
<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Trace Element Partitioning</b> </h3></font>
<p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">        Efforts need to be focused on the most volatile elements: 
selenium and mercury with the highest priority, followed by arsenic, cadmium, lead, antimony,
chlorine, and boron.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">    A better understanding of the fundamentals of trace metal
transformation mechanisms and pathways in power plants should be acquired.  Specifically,
information is needed on the influence of trace element mode of occurrence, effects of
combustion/gasification conditions, and coal composition on in-furnace partitioning and on
condensation, adsorption, coagulation, and chemisorption in postcombustion partitioning.<Br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">   More effective methods should be developed to predict
partitioning, condensation, and other reactions as a function of system configuration, operating
conditions, and coal composition.<br>
</ul>
<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Sampling and Analysis</b> </h3></font> <p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">   Simplified sampling and analytical procedures should be
developed for the collection and characterization of samples.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">    The application of current sampling techniques to
high-temperature, high-pressure, and reducing atmospheres should be investigated.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">   Real-time measurement through on-line extractive techniques
and in situ measurement is needed to monitor the levels of trace metals in process streams.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">    Analytical methods to speciate trace metals in combustion
products should be developed.<br>
</ul>
<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Control Technologies - In-Furnace Control</b>
</h3></font> <p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">        The use of in-furnace sorbents may provide an opportunity to
capture vapor-phase trace metals.  Research to understand the effects of sorbent characteristics, metal
speciation, and system conditions should be considered. <br>

<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif"> The optimization of fuel chemistry through blending needs to be
addressed in order to identify possible control technologies.<br>
</ul>
<p>

<font color="#990066"><h3> <b>  Control Technologies - Postcombustion Control</b>
</h3></font> <p>

<p>


<ul plain>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">        Efforts need to focus on vapor-phase species such as
mercury and selenium in the identification of methods to convert vapors to solids or on reactions with
activated carbon to allow for collection in pollution control systems.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="GIFS/bl_dot.gif">  Solid waste management should use correct methodology tailored
to the waste material and the disposal site.<br>
</ul>

       <center><h2>TASK 1 - TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT,
       AND DEMONSTRATION</h2></center>
<hr>

<p><strong>Background</strong>


<p>	The Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC) and AGVISE Laboratories are
committed to a team approach in the assessment, development, and demonstration of environmental
and process technologies.  Partnerships with industry and government allow for the wise and efficient
use of our critical resources.  Choosing the right technological options to solve water treatment and
supply issues is difficult for busy professionals.  Industry and government officials need a well
informed and objective partner to help make decisions that will affect the entire region for years to
come.  Too often we are forced to make decisions based primarily on the information provided by
technology vendors who have a vested interest in the technology to be implemented.


<p>	It is difficult for a single entity to master the broad range of skills needed to compete successfully
in the global marketplace.  The Red River Water Management Consortium (RRWMC) participants are
a synergistic team with a wide range of talents, disciplines, and organizational philosophies and the
ability to tackle complex technological issues.


<p><strong>Work Plan</strong>


<p>	This task will focus on solutions to problems involving water supply and water quality in the Red
River Basin.  Solutions may include the use of different operational practices or improved or alternate
technologies.
</strong>

<p><strong><strong>Subtasks</strong></strong>

<ul plain>
	<b>1.1</b>  Evaluation of Water Treatment Technologies (conventional and novel)
	<ul plain>	<b>-</b> To address specific needs of consortium members
	<ul plain>	<b>1.1a</b>  Freeze-thaw evaporation (FTE) - requested by ProGold and Minn-Dak Farmers 					Cooperative.
	<BR>		<b>1.1b</b>  Stormwater treatment options - requested by the city of Fargo
</ul></ul></ul>
<ul plain>	<b>1.2</b>  Technology Information Sharing
<ul plain>		<b>1.2a</b>  Technologies currently used or being developed by consortium members<br>
			<b>1.2b</b>  Innovative technologies
</ul></ul>
<ul plain>	<b>1.3</b>  Optimization of Water Use

			<b>-</b> Water reuse options
</ul></ul>
<ul plain>	<b>1.4</b>  Assessment of Water Conservation Options
	<ul>		<b>-</b> Limit peak usage
</ul></ul>

<p>	Work on Subtasks 1.1 and 1.2 will begin in the first year of the program.  Subtask 1.1 addresses
water treatment technological needs of individual consortium  members and includes problem
assessment, with potential technology solutions and recommendations.  Subtask 1.2 is directed
toward information sharing between consortium members.  Technologies currently being used or
considered by consortium members and other new or innovative technologies that are becoming
available will be addressed under this subtask.  Work on Subtasks 1.3 and 1.4 will be addressed later
in the program based on the results of Tasks 2 and 3.


<p><strong>Deliverables </strong>

<ul>
<li>		Project reports on work performed to address specific stakeholder problems.  These reports
will include an assessment of the problem and recommendations for potential options for
resolving the issue

                  <h2>TASK 2 - WATER RESOURCE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSES</h2>
    </center><hr>
 <p><strong>Background</strong>

<p>	A wealth of information is available on the water resources of the Red River drainage basin. 
Water quality and quantity data have been collected through the monitoring programs of the North
Dakota State Water Commission, the North Dakota State Health Department, the Minnesota
Department of Natural Resources, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, the United States Corps
of Engineers, the United States Geological Survey, and other federal and state agencies.  In addition,
results and data have been generated from more focused projects performed by the University of North
Dakota, North Dakota State University, the University of Minnesota, watershed districts, and other
local water groups within the basin.  Much of the information, however, is not readily available to
managers who need to access the data to make critical management decisions.  In addition, different
data sets are sometimes used by different parties when discussing issues, resulting in confusion and
conflicting conclusions.  This is partially because of a lack of sufficient documentation for determining
the quality of data and differences in data sets or the relevance of a certain data set to the specific
situation being discussed.  Finally, there is a need to standardize monitoring programs, including
sampling and analyses procedures, and to provide a mechanism for coordinating new monitoring
activities to avoid duplication of effort and inefficient use of limited funds.


<p><strong>Work Plan</strong>


<p>	Task 2 involves the establishment of a database that will include current and historical data on
water quality (surface water and groundwater), water quantity (discharge rates of rivers and streams,
storage capacity of aquifers), and industrial and municipal water usage and discharges (rates and
quality).


<p><strong>Subtasks</strong>


<ul plain>	<b>2.1 </b> Inventory of Surface and Groundwater Quantity and Quality Data

<ul plain>	<b>2.1a </b> Assessment of consortium member capabilities for on-line access of information
and data<br>

			<b>2.1b </b>	Data inventory and accessibility determination<br>

			<b>2.1c </b>	Database development

</ul></ul>
<ul plain>	<b>2.2 </b>	Review of Existing Basin Water Management Plans

<ul plain>	<b>- </b> Establishment of a repository or repositories of information and reports
<p>
</ul>
	<b>2.3 </b>	Assessment of Discharge and Water Quality Standards<p>


	<b>2.4 </b>	Standardization of Water Resource Data<p>


	<b>2.5 </b>	Determination of Data Gaps<p>

</ul>
<p>	Work on Task 2 will focus on Subtasks 2.1-2.3 during the first year, with the majority of the
effort directed towards Subtasks 2.1 and 2.2.  The goal of Subtask 2.1 is to provide the consortium
stakeholders with real-time access to data so that scientifically valid management decisions can made
on important issues that may impact the water resources of the basin. These data include current and
historical data on water quality (rivers, streams, lakes, and aquifers) and water quantity (discharge
rates of rivers and streams, storage capacity of aquifers).  Subtasks 2.2 and 2.3 involve a review and
assessment of information on previous watershed management planning activities in the basin and on
discharge and water quality standards and regulations affecting the stakeholders of the consortium. 
Work on Subtasks 2.4 and 2.5 is scheduled to begin in the second year of this program. 


<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>

<p>	
<ul>
  <li>Assistance to consortium members in developing on-line capabilities to access data and
information	
<br>
  <li>Establishment of a database of information relating to historic and current monitoring efforts
in the basin
<br>
   <li>Establishment of a repository for existing basin reports and documents
<br>
   <li>A database describing items contained in the repository
<br>
   <li>A report on the results of Subtask 2.2 at the end of the first 6 months
<br>
    <li>A report on the results of Subtask 2.3 at the end of the first year

        <h2>TASK 3 - AGRICULTURAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND MUNICIPAL
        IMPACTS ON WATER RESOURCES</h2></center>
<hr>
 <strong>Background</strong>

<P>
	Industry, municipalities, and agricultural groups often lack access, and the expertise
required, to deal with a wide range of environmental problems.  Persistent problems can become
expansive if not immediately addressed, compounding the time and money needed to resolve
them.  In many cases, solutions are sought from outside sources, thus bypassing local assistance.
This approach empowers local, multidisciplinary teams to brainstorm and respond to complex
issues identified by industrial, municipal, and agricultural members of the consortium.  Providing
local expertise will hasten the response time to these issues and provide a mechanism for assessing
other needed resources in a cost-effective manner.  

<P>
<strong>Work Plan</strong>
<P>

	Task 3 will focus on current and future water quality and quantity requirements for
agriculture, industry, and municipalities in the Red River Valley. 

<P>
<strong>Subtasks</strong>
<ul plain>

	<b>3.1</b>	Assessment of Water Quality and Quantity Requirements
			<b>-</b> Municipalities
	<ul plain>	<b>-</b> Industry</ul>
<p>
	<b>3.2</b>	Determination of Environmental Impacts on Water Resources
	<ul plain>	<b>-</b> Urban runoff/storm water<br>
			<b>- </b>Municipal and industrial discharges</ul>
<p>			
	<b>3.3</b>	Assessment of Agricultural Impacts on Water Resources
	<ul plain>		<b>-</b> Irrigation practices and permitting
<br>
		<b>-</b> Aquifer water quality<br>
		<b>-</b> Aquifer recharge<br>
			<b>-</b> Non-point-source discharges</ul>
<p>
	<b>3.4</b>	Use of Natural Processes for Improving Water Quality
	<ul plain>	<b>-</b> Sedimentation<br>
			<b>-</b> Stream bank erosion</ul>
<p>
	<b>3.5</b>	Emerging Water Resource Regulations

	<b>3.6</b>	Evaluation of Economic Development Opportunities
	<ul plain>	<b>-</b> Small communities<br>
  	 		<b>-</b> Industry<br>
			<b>-</b> Recreation</ul>

</ul>
<p>	Work on Task 3 will focus on Subtasks 3.1-3.5 during the first year, with the majority of the
effort directed towards Subtasks 3.1 and 3.3.  Water quality and quantity requirement information
for municipalities and industry (Subtask 3.1) will be collected in conjunction with work performed
under Subtask 2.1.  Information collected during the first year will be limited to the major industries
and cities within the basin, specifically those represented by consortium members.   Efforts in Subtask
3.2 will involve representation by Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center personnel on committees
as requested by consortium members (TMDL and low-flow modeling technical committees).  Subtask
3.3 will involve an assessment of agricultural impacts on water resources in the basin.  This will
include current and future potential water quality and quantity impacts and needs.  Subtask 3.4, which
focuses on natural processes for improving water quality, will involve an assessment of riparian areas
in the basin.  First-year efforts will be limited to the development of a strategy to inventory and to
assess the quality of these riparian zones.  Subtask 3.5 activities include a review of current and
proposed regulations that may impact muncipalities, industry, and agriculture within the basin.  First-year efforts will be directed toward wellhead protection and stormwater treatment and the approach
used in other basins to address these concerns.  Work on Subtask 3.6 will be initiated during the
second year of this program.

<center>                <h2>TASK 4 - WATER RESOURCE MONITORING PROGRAM</h2></center>
<hr>
<p><strong>Background</strong>
<p>
	Water resource monitoring is necessary to protect human health and to address water supply and
quality problems for sustained environmentally responsible economic development.  With the advent
of stricter environmental regulations regarding water pollution, water quality monitoring by public and
private entities has increased dramatically.  These monitoring programs address surface waters and
groundwater, as well as point and non-point sources of pollution.

<p>Currently, there is no basinwide strategy for monitoring water quality in the Red River of the North watershed.  Although there are numerous monitoring efforts under way, there is little or no
coordination of efforts, and sampling and analyses procedures are not standardized.  In addition, a lack
of documentation and inadequate quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) procedures may jeopardize
the usefulness of data obtained from certain studies.  The lack of a coordinated monitoring effort within
the basin may also result in duplication of effort and a waste of limited resources for collecting needed
data.  Because of differing goals for specific monitoring programs, the opportunity to collect
information easily at minimal additional cost may be lost.


<p><strong>Work Plan</strong>
<p>
	Task 4 development will be based on data collected for <a href="resource.html">Task 2</a>.  A monitoring plan will be
developed to determine long-term impacts to water quality in the watershed and to address short-term
problems identified by consortium members.

         <h2>TASK 6 - EDUCATION AND INFORMATION DISSEMINATION
         THROUGH MEETINGS, WORKSHOPS, AND SYMPOSIA</h2></center>
<hr>
<strong>Background</strong>
<p>
	An integral component of the proposed water management program for the Red River of the
North Basin is to provide a forum dedicated to identifying and discussing relevant water-related issues
in the Valley.  This forum will be structured towards the broader sharing of data, information,
experience, technology, and perspectives on key water issues targeted by consortium members.

<p>	Information dissemination and education fosters partnership and increases the awareness of the
water resource community.  A proactive water management strategy is maintained through education
and the open exchange of information and technical expertise.  These activities lead to informed
decision making and allow membership scrutinization as the project strives toward environmentally
sound water resources management.


<p><strong>Work Plan</strong>


<p>	Task 6 will be structured towards the broader sharing of data, information, experience,
technology, and perspectives on key water issues targeted by consortium members.  Activities will
include semiannual consortium meetings and combined meetings with other water resource agencies
(i.e., the International Coalition) in the basin.


<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>
<ul>

<li>		Scheduled semiannual consortium meetings
<br>

<li>		Annual symposia highlighting consortium progress and strategies used to address water
resource issues of the Red River Basin of the North</ul>

                        <h2> TASK 7 - DEVELOPMENT OF A WATERSHED
                                 MANAGEMENT STRATEGY</h2></center>
<hr>
    
<p><strong>Background</strong>


<p>	Based on the information developed during this program, we propose to create an overall
watershed strategy for the consortium participants.  Our emphasis is to create a strategy rather than
a plan.  The distinction is important if the goal of making tangible progress in solving present and
future basin issues is to be achieved.  Over the years, many plans have been developed for regions,
cities, and watersheds.  Indeed, the shelves of engineers, planners, and executives are filled with
reports.  While many of these planning exercises and documents are very useful and much information
has been gained, the plans often fall short of achieving their purposes, because even the best planner
cannot see into the future and anticipate changes in climate, technologies, economies, and seemingly
the most unpredictable factor of all, politics.  


<p>	In contrast to a plan, a strategy is flexible--it evolves.  Rather than trying to anticipate changes
and make decisions for stakeholders, our watershed strategy will provide the consortium participants
with the vital information they need to make informed decisions as new opportunities and challenges
arise.  The strategy will adjust to the changing conditions in the basin and will always include the latest
data and technologies.  Because the consortium participants will be directing the program, the
information we produce and the strategy we develop will fit their needs, now and in the future.


<p><strong>Work Plan</strong>


<p>	Task 7 is designed to provide consortium sponsors with the vital information needed to make
informed decisions as new opportunities and challenges arise.  Management strategies will be flexible,
allowing response to a wide range of water resource issues. 


<p> <strong>Issues</strong>
<ul>

<li>		Political concerns and processes

<li>		Canadian concerns

<li>		Compatibility between agriculture, industry, and municipalities

<li>		Cooperation with other agencies

<li>		Garrison diversion

<li>		Flood control

<li>		Water rights</ul>

<p>
<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>

<ul>
<li>A basinwide strategy report at the end of Year 1 summarizing activities of the consortium
and other activities in the basin including the following:

<ul>
<li>An annual summary of key political, economic, and environmental changes affecting the
basin


<li>A summary review of relevant activities conducted by other groups in the basin

</ul></ul>
<p>	
<ul>
  <li>A one-page technical summary of activities of the Red River Water Management
Consortium for distribution to key entities within the basin</li>

<HEAD><TITLE>Help on Making Queries</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

<title>American Crystal Sugar</title>
</head>
<body background="../gif/backgrnd.gif">

<p>American Crystal Sugar Company is a cooperative owned and controlled by approximately 2,300
sugarbeet growers in northwest Minnesota and eastern North Dakota in the valley of the Red
River of the North.  About two-thirds of these shareholders live and farm in Minnesota.  The
company's headquarters, research center and one of its five sugar factories are located in
Moorhead, Minnesota.  Its other four sugar factories are in Crookston and East Grand Forks,
Minnesota, and near Hillsboro and Drayton, North Dakota.


<p>With annual sales revenues of $600 million, American Crystal is among the largest businesses in
northern Minnesota.  According to a 1993 study by North Dakota State University, American
Crystal has an annual economic impact in its region of approximately $1 billion.


<p>American Crystal employs about 900 people full-time, year-round basis, and another 1,800 on a
full-time seasonal basis.  The cooperative's shareholders employ approximately 3,000 people full-time, about 6,000 to assist with the sugarbeet harvest, and about 5,000 for seasonal field labor.


<p>American Crystal produces 1.5 to 2.0 billion pounds of sugar per year, providing approximately
12-14 percent of the nation's total sugar consumption.  It's sugar is marketed together with two
other beet sugar cooperatives by United Sugars Corporation of Eden Prairie, Minnesota.


<p>In addition to its sugar, American Crystal produces sugarbeet pulp and molasses.  The pulp,
300,000 - 380,000 tons per year, is sold primarily for use as cattle feed.  The molasses, from
280,000 - 350,000 tons per year, is used in a wide array of products including pharmaceuticals,
brewing, yeast production and in livestock feeds.  Both the pulp and molasses are marketed for
American Crystal by another cooperative, Midwest Agri-Commodities with offices in California,
Washington, and St. Louis Park, Minnesota.

<h1>Developing Partnerships</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<img src = "../gif/wind4i.gif">
Partnerships are key to solving complex energy and environmental problems and developing innovative energy and environmental technologies.  To bring an idea through the rigorous stages of research, development, demonstration, and commercialization, a cohesive team of people possessing distinctive skills and disciplines is needed.
<p>
The EERC is committed to a philosophy of RDD&C. In partnership with private industry, government agencies, research organizations, and academic institutions, the EERC conducts research and development of practical, problem-solving technologies and processes--RD.  It demonstrates those technologies and processes in the field--the second D.  Finally, working with its industrial partners, it seeks to commercialize successful technologies and processes--C.
<p>
Developing energy and environmental technologies is neither quick nor inexpensive.  It can take several years to develop and then successfully demonstrate a technology.  The cost can reach well into the millions of dollars.  By the time an idea is commercialized, a project team often includes government and private research organizations, scientists, research managers, laboratory technicians, engineers, engineering technicians, venture capitalists, investors, market analysts, entrepreneurs, marketers, business managers, accountants, patent and copyright counsel, legal counsel, elected officials, and regulatory agencies.
<p>
Commercializing energy and environmental technologies holds the potential for significant returns, however.  The EERC is willing to make the long-term investment and take the risks to seize these opportunities.

The EERC extends an invitation for partnership ventures to anyone seeking research, development, demonstration, and commercialization opportunities focused on energy and environmental technologies.

<title>Pressurized Fluidized-Bed Combustion</title>
</head>
<body>
<center><center><img src="gifs/eerc_hd.gif"></center>
<h2>Pressurized Fluidized-Bed Combustion </h2> </center> 
<hr>
<h3>Background</h3>
     The impacts of variations in fuel properties on the performance of advanced power systems
must be understood if these systems are to be successfully commercialized.  In the case of
pressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC), the interaction of the fuel properties with the
bed chemistry (including ash, sorbent, and getters) may be more complicated than for other
systems where the fuel is burned in suspension.  Major uncertainties identified by industry as
critical areas for PFBC commercialization include hot-gas cleanup for gas turbine protection,
with particular reference to coal alkalies; trace element and nitrous oxide emissions; materials
survivability for heat exchanger, gas turbine, and solids-handling equipment improvement; and
combustion configuration.  To help resolve these uncertainties, fundamental studies on PFBC
are needed to understand and predict the performance of different coal types in relation to the
interaction of the coal and sorbent  properties and bed conditions.  To develop this
fundamental understanding in a cost-effective manner, small bench- and/or pilot-scale studies
need to be designed that will simulate the atmosphere in a full-scale PFBC.<p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
     The goal of the PFBC activity was to generate fundamental process information to further the
development of an economical and environmentally acceptable second-generation PFBC.  The
objectives of this project  focused on generic issues, including the fate of alkali, the sulfide
species in the carbonizer char, and the RCRA (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act)
heavy metals in PFBC.  A great deal of PFBC performance relates to the chemistry of the bed
and the gas-solids contacting that occur during combustion.  These factors can be studied in a
suitably designed bench-scale reactor.  Studies have focused on the emission control strategies
applying in the bed, rather than in hot-gas cleaning.  Emissions include alkali and heavy
metals in addition to SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O, and
CO.<p>
<h3>Results</h3>
     A 3-in.-ID pressurized fluidized-bed reactor was commissioned to be used for sorbent
characterization, the evaluation of gaseous emissions including testing for trace elements, and
agglomeration and hot-gas cleanup testing.  Initial results from the characterization of alkali
gettering indicate that in-bed getters can remove a significant amount of the alkali in the bed. 
Using kaolin as a sorbent, sodium levels in the flue gas were reduced from 3.6 ppm to less
than 0.22 ppm.  Future work will examine the impact of operating conditions and sorbent type
and size on the reduction of alkali.<p>
     Other testing focused on the characterization of sulfur sorbents.  The intent of the work was to
develop a reliable technique to predict the performance of sorbents in the PFBC.  One
limestone has been characterized to date, with testing on additional sorbents planned. 
Preliminary results indicated that although the total sulfur capture was significantly lower than
that observed in a full-scale PFBC, the emission trends tended to be similar.  The true test of
the small PFBR will come when additional sorbents are tested, the relative trends are ranked
against other sorbents, and the data from the small PFBR are compared to full-scale data. 
Additional data are being generated and can be obtained from the authors.<p>
    Tests were also performed on slurries made from hydrothermally treated refuse-derived fuel
(RDF) lignite and a mixture of RDF and lignite.  The RDF and RDF-lignite fuels combusted
very well in the PFBR combustion facility at the EERC, with combustion efficiencies exceeding
99.0% in all cases.  Sulfur dioxide emissions were significantly lower for the RDF-based fuels
than the levels seen for the lignite fuel alone.  The nitrogen oxide emissions were lower for the
RDF-based fuels than that experienced from the lignite fuel owing to the  lower fuel-bound
nitrogen for the RDF fuel.  Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions were well below current
federal regulations.  Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions appeared to be slightly higher
for the fuels containing RDF, but were below 9 ppm for the worst case (RDF alone).  Analysis of
volatile organic compound emissions does not indicate an emission problem for these fuels. 
Some differences were apparent in the amount of particulate matter exiting the primary cyclone
between the RDF-lignite blend and both the lignite fuel and the RDF slurry alone.  Chromium
appears to be the only RCRA metal that might present some disposal problem; however,
processing of the RDF with the wet resource recovery method should reduce the levels of
chromium to below those seen in the current test fuel.<p>

<h2>WATER MANAGEMENT - THE APPROACH</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
<a href="http://www.eerc.und.nodak.edu">The Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC)</a> and <a href="http://www.rrtrade.org/agvise/index.htm">AGVISE</a> Laboratories, Inc. have
    teamed to develop a water management program for the Red River of the North Basin. A major objective of
    the program will be to find technological solutions to water supply and water quality problems. This will be
    accomplished through optimizing and improving processes and practices currently being used, evaluating
    technology options, and identifying new or novel technologies to solve problems. Issues identified for the
    region will be addressed to find economical, practical, and timely solutions. The overall goal of the program
    will be to develop a long-term watershed management strategy focusing on water quantity and quality.
      <p>  
    The approach used to develop this program will include the establishment of a consortium of vested stakeholders
    on water management issues in the basin. The fees obtained from this consortium will be used to perform work
    on issues pertaining to the development of a long-term watershed management strategy, to solve problems facing
  industry and other participants in the program, and to obtain federal and state funds where a match is required.
    Sponsors of the program will be intricately involved in the structure and the direction of work.
        <p>
    Although it is expected that this program will evolve in response to issues identified by the consortium, an initial
    set of tasks has been developed to address long-term watershed management.

<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">In the United States, almost 40 percent

basic uses as fishing and swimming.  Contaminated water supplies
are an enormous problem in the world today.  They are also one
of its most perilous.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">The EERC, using its resource analysis

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">In its role as an adviser to industry,
research institutions, and governments, the EERC has a long history
of evaluating technologies and processes to clean contaminated
water. Increasingly, the Center is developing and commercializing
its own cleanup technologies and processes, too.<BR>

and evaporation in warm weather to purify contaminated water.
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">Huge volumes of brackish water are
routinely produced during oil and gas industry operations.  Current

<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">The freeze-thaw/evaporation process
has a number of other promising applications.   It can be used
to turn naturally salty groundwater and surface water into high-quality,

<title>Introduction</title>

<body background="../gif/backgrnd.gif">
<h2>WATER MANAGEMENT FOR THE RED RIVER OF THE NORTH</h2>
<hr>
<p>Intelligent use and management of water resources are required to ensure sufficient quantities of
quality water for public use and future development of industry and agriculture in the Red River
Valley.  This program will establish a consortium of industry, municipalities, and other entities in
partnership with state and federal governments to respond to important issues that may impact the
water resources of the area and to develop a long-term water management strategy for the Red
River Valley.  It is expected that this program will become a model for watershed management that
other areas of the United States can use to respond to environmental and water quantity concerns
while allowing for economic development.

<p>Upper midwest states, like North Dakota and Minnesota, have opportunities in the coming years to
provide more of the food staples to the American (U.S. and Canadian) public.  Our soils are the
best in a 12-state region, and the climate favors the culture of enumerable vegetable, cole, and
other specialty crops, some of which are currently grown in the region.  Water is a major concern,
and cropping systems require a stable source.  Available water is limited and comes mainly from
surface rivers and groundwater.  There is a great need to care for the supplies available and
identify management options to ensure sufficient quantities to meet agricultural needs and allow for
future development of industry and communities in the Red River Valley.

<br><br>
<p>Water quality is as important as the quantity.  Contamination of available water supplies must be
avoided.  Contamination may occur when water encounters either target or nontarget agricultural-applied pesticides or fertilizers.  In addition, industrial discharges, either agriculture- or
nonagriculture-related, may degrade water quality.  The quality of groundwater and surface water
must be determined with respect to potential contaminants, thus establishing a baseline for future
use.  Once a baseline is established, then the change in water quality can be monitored, and
solutions to problems encountered can be determined.


<p>Some of the important issues currently facing this watershed include the following:

<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">Preventing pollution is cheaper than
cleaning it up.  This fact is one the EERC well understands. Businesses
and municipalities produce billions of gallons of wastewater every
day.  By developing ways for them to use water more efficiently,
the EERC is helping businesses reduce the amount of water they
need and, in turn, the amount of wastewater they produce.  The
Center is also helping businesses and municipalities better dispose
of their wastewater by developing more effective ways for them
to treat it. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">At American Crystal Sugar Company,
recommendations from EERC water management researchers have enabled
the Minnesota-based sugar beet-processing company to improve its
wastewater treatment methods.  The EERC also is investigating
a novel means of helping the company to better control wastewater
odors.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">Each year in the United States, an
average of 800,000 wells are drilled to tap groundwater supplies
- a rate of almost 100 an hour.  One of the best methods for preventing
surface water and groundwater pollution is the establishment of
riparian zones - areas of trees, shrubs, and vegetation along
banks of streams and rivers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">Riparian zones act as a buffer, capturing
sediments, nutrients, and other pollutants before they can get
into the water.  The EERC is helping to restore a number of riparian
zones in eastern North Dakota as part of a broad research project.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3 FACE="Garamond">Changes in farming and ranching practices
combined with replanting of grasses and woody vegetation can help
reverse damage to riparian zones.  The goal of the riparian project,
which is being sponsored by several state and federal agencies,
including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is to identify
and demonstrate Best Management Practices and to transfer practical
methods and technology for establishing riparian zones to agricultural
producers and natural resource professionals throughout North
Dakota and the country.</FONT>

<h2><a href="/960828/mission.htm">Mission Statement</a></h2><p>
Converting energy resources cleanly and efficiently, cleaning up past environmental contamination, and preventing future 
environmental contamination will be some of the greatest challenges of the 21st century.
<p>
The EERC is recognized internationally as an expert in scientifically advanced energy systems and the prevention and 
cleanup of air, water, and soil pollution.
<p>
Established as a federal research and development facility in 1951, the EERC has been a part of the 
<a href="http://www.und.nodak.edu">University of North Dakota</a> (UND) since 1983. With a staff of more than 
<a href="/gif/staff.jpg">260 talented scientists, engineers, and support personnel</a>, the EERC is one of the 
leading developers of energy and environmental technologies in the world.
<p>
A thriving environment and sufficient energy are essential for a high quality of life. The future depends upon 
our ability to extract energy and other resources in a manner that does not jeopardize the integrity and stability 
of the environment.  To do that, we need to understand the complex network of connections between energy and 
environment.
<p>
"Knowledge has replaced raw material and labor as society's key resource. But even more important than knowledge 
is imagination," says EERC Director Gerald Groenewold. "The EERC is a model for interdisciplinary teamwork, 
partnership building, and the development of imaginative solutions to critical issues."<p>

	The <b>Council of Energy Resource Tribes</b> (CERT) is a not-for profit, multi-Tribal organization  composed of 53 American Indian Tribes and four Canadian Indian Nations.  Founded in 1975 by 25 resource-owning Tribes, CERT is governed by an elected Tribal leadership and, collectively, CERTs mission is <i>to support member Tribes as they develop their management capabilities and use their energy resources as the foundation for building stable, balanced self-governed economies.</i>  Currently <b>57 members</b> strong, the CERT member Tribes are committed to improving the quality of life in their communities so that they may enter -- and thrive -- in the 21st century on their own terms.
<p>
	The Council of Energy Resource Tribes (CERT) was founded in the midst of Americas energy crisis in the 1970s, when domestic interests condoned less reliance upon foreign oil and further exploration of U.S. energy resources.  Since most of the richest reserves were located on or near Indian Country, Indian Tribes demanded more active participation in the development and management of those resources.  Rightly so, since many laws then precluded Indian Tribes from developing natural resources on their own lands.  The founding Tribes of CERT were unwilling to continue to fall victim to Americas energy initiatives, unwilling to simply stand aside while their land was squandered.  They envisioned a time when  they no longer needed to rely on non-Tribal interests and expertise to assist in regulating or managing Tribal natural resources -- a time when Tribal culture would be reflected in the technology being applied by Tribal technical professionals to ensure the protection of the environment and their distinct, cultural communities.  Hence, the Council of Energy Resource Tribes was born.   
<p>
	CERT has organizational headquarters and professional staff located in Denver, Colorado.  CERT staff provides member Tribes with resource assistance and technical services in the following areas:

<h2>COUNCIL OF ENERGY RESOURCE TRIBES</h2>
<h3>Natural and Energy Resource Development</h3>
<img src="blu_bar.gif"></center>
<p>
	The CERT member Tribes own significant energy resources -- an estimated third of the United  States  low sulfur strippable coal, forty percent of its privately owned uranium, four percent of its oil and natural gas, and substantial quantities of oil shale and geothermal resources.  CERTs individual and collective membership have made strong impacts in the consumer and legal energy industry.  Crucial national environmental and energy-related legislation has been passed to grant Indian Tribes more authority in the development, administration , and preservation of their resources.  New relationships with energy corporations have been forged.  Coal leases have been renegotiated, oil and gas agreements have taken the form of joint ventures, and resource development agreements net millions of more dollars  for Tribes than ever before -- essential funds to provide housing, education, health programs, and Tribal government infrastructure. <p>
	Tribes are moving into the next century and preparing for the depletion of most non-renewable energy reserves by researching opportunities in alternative and renewable energy sources as well as energy efficiency and conservation technologies.  CERT is also entering into the new realm of energy marketing and brokering between Tribal energy producers and energy consumers.  In addition, the CERT member Tribes are committed to remediating Tribal lands damaged by past energy development, especially Tribal lands affected by nuclear power production and waste.  CERT also provides professional and technical assistance in the following areas:

<h2>COUNCIL OF ENERGY RESOURCE TRIBES</h2>
<h3>Tribal Environmental Program</h3>
<img src="blu_bar.gif"></center><p>


	Having gained increasing control of their energy and other natural resources since the mid 1970s, CERT member Tribes also have assumed increasing responsibility for their preservation and restoration.  At the direction of its Tribal membership, CERT has undertaken a comprehensive program of environmental protection services that include environmental audits and needs assessments, technical assistance in the development of environmental quality control systems (e.g., air and water quality), and solid and hazardous waste management systems. In addition to on-site assistance, CERT offers a variety of internships and training programs in environmental protection.
<p>
	The most recent -- and highly successful -- training program involves preparing Tribal environmental program managers in the application of Congressional funds appropriated to the Administration for Native Americans (ANA) for the mitigation of environmental damage caused by Department of Defense activities.  In the past two years, CERTs traveling workshop, the Mitigation of Environmental Impacts on Indian Lands Due to Department of Defense Activities,  has assisted over 100 Tribal environment program managers in five regions of the country.  The workshop provides technical assistance in determining applicable national environmental legislation, assessing DOD damages, reaching Tribal community consensus, formally applying for ANA funds, and discovering ways Tribes can utilize all possible Tribal and technical knowledge and resources in restoring their environment. 
<p>
	CERTs Tribal Environment Program provides assistance in the following areas:
<ul plain>

<p>

	An exciting new program at CERT, the Tribal Development Financing Program currently is exploring and paving new ground in the needs of Tribes for a variety of financial resources (including debt, equity, and venture capital) with which to develop business, community facilities, housing and public works projects.  In its initial phase, the program facilitates dialogues between Tribal people and diverse financial institutions, private foundations and government agencies.  Its overall objectives are (a) to determine how existing financing programs can address the needs of Indian communities more effectively, (b) to assess the need for innovative financing programs and vehicles, and (c) to facilitate the conceptualization and creation of  innovative financing programs and vehicles.
<p>
	The CERT Tribal Enterprise Services Program complements and strengthens other CERT programs while addressing the increasingly diverse business and economic needs of member Tribes, especially in areas of :

<h3>Comprehensive Education Program</h3>
<img src="blu_bar.gif"></center>
<p>
	Created in 1980, the CERT Comprehensive Education Program meets the demand for technically trained Tribal members within American Indian communities.  The American Indian leadership who guide CERT recognize that education is the key to unleash the potential of Indian youth  -- the potential for them to make a difference in Indian communities as well as in American society.  Tribal leaders believe that modern technology must work hand-in-hand with their cultural values.  The Indian way of life must not be sacrificed in the name of science or prosperity.  Thus, the CERT Comprehensive Education Program provides opportunities for American Indian people -- young and old alike -- to ensure they successfully enter and thrive in the 21st century on their own terms.  The CERT Comprehensive Education Program provides the following educational opportunities:
<ul plain>
<img src="bl_dot.gif"><a href="eas.htm">TRIBES</a> for American Indian graduating high school seniors<br>
<img src="bl_dot.gif"><a href="tip.htm">CERT Tribal Internships</a> for American Indian undergraduate and

The internships are designed to enhance Indian students academic knowledge in their fields as well as to provide invaluable work experience -- giving them tools to apply practical solutions to real situations in the community.  Students may train at CERT headquarters or local businesses in Denver, Colorado, or have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with Indian Tribes on critical projects.  The benefits of CERT Tribal Internships include paid salary, round-trip travel, and housing accommodations.  However, the experience the interns gain is immeasurable and tow work produced as a tremendous impact on Indian Tribes.

<title>Business Sponsorship Opportunities for the
CERT Tribal Internship Program</title>
</head>
<body><center><h2>Business Sponsorship Opportunities for the
CERT Tribal Internship Program</h2><img src="blu_bar.gif"><br>
</center>


	In these times of rapid economic and political changes in the global arena, American Indian Tribes are committed to developing professional and technical alliances that support their local initiatives as well as national and global interests.  Through the CERT <a href="cep.htm>Comprehensive Education Program</a>, Tribes have created a dynamic opportunity for the public and private sector to develop productive relationships with highly motivated American Indian undergraduate and graduate students participating in the <a href="ctip.htm>CERT Tribal Internship Program</a>.  Promoting the value for win-win relationships, the CERT Tribal Internship Program teams bright, young Indian students with companies for a hand-in-hand professional training experience.  In this working environment, students strengthen their technical skills while contributing to the cultural knowledge of their host companies and mentors.  
<p>
	Particularly, the CERT Summer Tribal Internship Program -- an intensive ten-week program -- provides Indian students with invaluable work experience while they explore potential career paths and finetune their technical skills to become a valuable resource for Tribes, and ultimately, the nation.  Sponsoring organizations gain energetic and committed summer employees -- and the opportunity to understand the Indian perspective on issues of mutual concern.  And, perhaps most importantly, sponsors assist talented  young Indian people -- who may otherwise never have the chance -- to discover productive and rewarding careers.
<p>
	Each interns receives a stipend equivalent to $10/hour, furnished living quarters, technical training, and round-trip travel to the internship site.  This broadbased support system for each intern is essential to enable students to participate.  Limited financial resources frequently preclude many capable Indian students from access to this type of professional training opportunity.  The burden of routine expenses (transportation, rental deposits, furniture, and household goods) become insurmountable obstacles.  These costs, in addition to a the of the programs administrative expenses, is approximately $16,000 per student per summer.  The CERT member Tribes -- and those organizations who work in partnership on these education initiatives -- have made a significant commitment to the future by providing access to all promising Indian students, regardless of their financial circumstances.
<p>
	If you wish to become a sponsor of the CERT Summer Tribal Internship Program, or want to contribute in other ways, contact the CERT Comprehensive Education Program.  In addition to summer internships, ten-week or year-long internships are also available for sponsorship throughout the year in some cases.  <b>Private and public businesses, energy and environment corporations, state and federal agencies, and Indian Tribes are especially encouraged to call or write for more details. </b>

<h3>Facilitation Services and Strategic Planning</h3>
<img src="blu_bar.gif"><br></center>


	
	Since 1990, the CERT Facilitation Program has provided facilitation for over 120 events with more than 60 Tribes, Indian organizations, and agencies that serve Tribes.  Strategic planning  assists Tribes in using participatory tools and techniques in Tribal management, organizational development, and community involvement.  Facilitation and training services currently available through the CERT Facilitation Services Program:<br><ul plain>

<img src="bl_dot.gif">Participatory Strategic Planning Sessions provide a
		participatory process for articulating the action priorities of
		an organization.  These two-day workshops have been held
		with boards, Tribal councils, management teams,
		communities, and Inter-Tribal organizations throughout the
		country.<br>

<img src="bl_dot.gif">Facilitation Methods Training are two-day intensive
		workshops to train participants in effective group
		communication skills, workshop methods, action planning
		techniques for launching group projects, and strategic
		planning methods.<br>

<img src="bl_dot.gif">Conference Facilitation Services help associations,
		networks, and regional  communities, plan and carry out
		lively conferences which use ToP (Technology of
		Participation) Methods to incorporate the wisdom and
		learnings of participants into the event itself.<br>

<img src="bl_dot.gif">Organizational and Management Development Services
		which offer opportunities for in-depth reflection on current
		organizational and management practices, and the
		development of skills and processes to enhance
		organizational effectiveness and productivity.</ul>

<TITLE>EERC and DOE Review Air Toxic Emissions Data from Advanced Power Systems
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<center><IMG SRC=../gif/catm.gif></center>
<P>
<HR>
<h2>EERC and DOE Review Air Toxic Emissions Data from Advanced Power System</h2>
<hr>
<P>
The EERC has entered into a program with
DOE to assemble and review available data relating to the emission
of trace elements considered toxic from advanced power coal-fired
systems (as mentioned in the Fall/Winter 1994 issue).  Although
much of the attention in the past year has been placed on emissions
from conventional technologies currently in operation, DOE recognizes
the need to plan for future technologies with the potential to
increase the efficiency of coal conversion.  The technologies
being examined include both advanced power systems (pressurized
fluid-bed combustion [PFBC] and integrated gasification combined
cycle [IGCC]) and high-temperature gas cleanup systems.
<P>
&quot;The performance of advanced hot-gas
cleanup systems appears promising for many metals.&quot;</B>
<P>
The objectives of this program are to:
<UL>
<LI>Evaluate the use of sampling and
analytical techniques.
<LI>Evaluate and manipulate the data
for inclusion in a summary reference.
<LI>Compare emissions from advanced
systems with those from conventional systems.
<LI>Evaluate future needs in relation
to potential regulations.
</UL>

<P>
 Two of the most promising advanced
power systems emerging in the world today are PFBC and entrained-flow
gasification.  These systems have the potential to increase the
efficiency of energy production while decreasing any harmful effects
on the environment.  Data from the Tidd PFBC, the Louisiana Gasification
Technology Institute entrained-flow gasifier and the Texaco Cool
Water entrained-flow gasifier have all been reviewed and are now
being compared to each other, as well as to conventional power
systems.  Trace metal emissions due entirely to the conversion
system  (ignoring the gas cleanup system) are typically lower
than that of a conventional system, producing less emissions for
the gas cleanup system to handle.
<P>
 The two hot-gas cleanup systems being
studied extensively are ceramic filters and sorbents.  Ceramic
filters are designed to remove particulate from the gas stream
at high temperatures, while sorbents concentrate on removing the
vapor-phase species (primarily sulfur) at higher temperatures.
 For trace metals, the ceramic filters perform extremely well
for nonvolatile components, while the ability of sorbent materials
to control trace metals is currently less effective.  The performance
of the advanced hot-gas cleanup systems when compared to conventional
systems appears promising for many metals.

<TITLE>Industry and Government Team to Test</TITLE>

<h3>Industry and Government Team to Test Methods to Mitigate Metal Emissions</h3>
<P>
<hr>
A team combining industry and government
was assembled by the Energy &amp; Environ-mental Research Center's
(EERC) Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) to test methods to mitigate
metal emissions from power plants.  The team includes the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE), the North Dakota Industrial Commission, Basin Electric
Power Cooperative, Cooperative Power Company, the Electric Power
Research Institute, Minnesota Power and Montana-Dakota Utilities
Co.
<P>
 Much of the work is focused on North
Dakota lignite, an intermediate between peat and subbituminous
coal.  It is used as the primary coal source for North Dakota's
coal-fired generating facilities, as well as for many other power
plants throughout the United States.  However, because lignite
coals are somewhat regional and unique (with high moisture, reactivity,
alkalinity, alkaline earth, inorganic content), they are not as
commonly used as subbituminous and bituminous coals.  Therefore,
their application has been limited to units specifically located
and designed to accommodate lignite's somewhat unusual characteristics.
 Consequently, recent research on lignite has not been as intensive
as research on subbituminous, bituminous and other coals.  However,
because of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and Congress's
mandate to control an additional 189 substances considered potentially
hazardous air pollutants, all fuel sources will need to be reevaluated
pertaining to air toxic emissions.  
<P>
 The Mitigation of Air Toxics from Lignite
Generation Facilities project is nearing completion to specifically
determine the emissions of 11 trace elements (antimony, arsenic,
beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, mercury,
nickel and selenium) that are of most concern for coal-fired power
plants and can vary significantly, depending on the coal source.
 In addition, two very important halogens, chlorine and fluorine,
are being measured.  Trace emissions from several North Dakota
lignites will be compared to a Powder River Basin coal.
<P>
 This project is unique in that it brings
together the more fundamental aspects of metals behavior with
the applied aspects of control.  Understanding the fundamental
mechanisms of toxic emissions is essential to developing successful
control strategies.  This research will enhance the under-standing
of the origin and mode of the occurrence of trace metals in coal,
the transformation and formation of toxic compounds during combustion,
the enrichment of various elements in fly ash and the application
of effective and practical control technologies to reduce toxic
emissions.
<P>
 This project will also reduce emissions
by developing low-cost reduction technologies or by enhancing
existing control devices.  Efforts will focus on developing sorbent-based
control technologies that are effective for lignite-fired generating
facilities.  Applicability of these control technologies to facilities
firing other coals will also be considered.  Sorbent-based tech-nology
consists of combining substances, such as activated carbon, clay
or calcium-based material, with the coal (precombustion) during
combustion (in-furnace) or after combustion (postcombustion).
 If the sorbent material is effective, it will sorb the toxic
element of concern and thereby reduce the levels that are released
into the atmosphere.

<P>
<h2>New Initiatives in CATM</h2><hr>
<P>
The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM)
responds to the needs of industry and government regarding understanding
and minimizing the impact of air toxic substances on the environment.
 Several new initiatives have begun that are cofunded by industry
and government.  These initiatives were peer-reviewed by the Science
Advisory Committee (SAC), which consists of a review and advisory
panel of nine experts on air toxic metals representing government,
industry and the academic research community.  Several projects
are described below.
<P>
<li>
<b> Process Impacts on Trace Metal Speciation</b></b> - The primary goal of
this project is to determine the impacts of fuel, combustion conditions,
gas-phase composition and entrained particulate characteristics
on trace metal speciation through experimental and modeling efforts.
 The primary focus initially will be on Hg speciation in combustion
flue gas; however, As, Ni, Pb, Cr, Se, Cd, Mn and B will also
be measured.
<p><li><b>Development and Demonstration of Trace Metals Database</b> - This project will demonstrate
the usefulness, benefits and capabilities of the database to industry,
government and other researchers.  The database incorporates information
from internal EERC projects and external projects on air toxic
metals.  The database can be used to correlate test results, examine
trends, identify information gaps and perform quality assurance/quality
control.
<p><li><b>Short Course:  Trace Elements in Industrial Applications</b> - The goal of this project is to
develop a one-day course to provide industry with an overview
of trace metal behavior and control in systems utilizing coal,
oil and natural gas.  This course will be presented in the United
States and possibly in other countries.
<p><li><b>Evaluation of On-Line Mercury Analyzer Performance in a Flue
Gas Environment</b> - This project is designed to test
and evaluate the performance of on-line mercury analyzers for
commercial application.  This project involves the participation
of manufacturers of on-line Hg monitoring equipment in both bench-
and pilot-scale coal combustion tests.
<p><li><b>Evaluation of Catalysts for the Conversion of Oxidized Mercury
Compounds to Elemental Mercury in Vapor Form</b> - The goal of this project
is to evaluate a series of catalysts for their potential to reduce
oxidized vapor-phase mercury compounds to vapor-phase elemental
form.  This work would significantly enhance development of a
total mercury analyzer and provide the ability to determine elemental
and oxidized forms of mercury.
<p>
<li><b>Trace Element Transformations During Combustion of Oil</b> - The
goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding
of the formation of significant levels of toxic metal species
during oil combustion.  The work will determine the quantities
and associations of Ni, Hg and Cr and associated species in the
oil; identify and quantify the concentrations of toxic trace metal
species emitted during combustion-selected oils and determine
the impacts of sulfur levels and excess air on the formation of
toxic Hg, Ni and Cr emissions.<p>
<li><b>Curriculum Enhancement at the University of North Dakota</b> - A request for proposal was submitted
to University of North Dakota faculty members to enhance curriculum.
 Of the five proposals received, two were selected for funding:
 &quot;Multidisciplinary Study of Pollution Prevention in an Experimental
Geology 101 Section&quot; and &quot;Environmental Communication:
 The Mass Media and the Community.&quot;

<h3>On-Line Analysis of Mercury</h3>
<P>
On-line analysis of mercury in power
plants has been an elusive goal for some time.  With the possibility
of increased regulatory control of mercury emissions from coal-fired
power plants in the near future, availability of a reliable on-line
analyzer has become even more critical.
<P>
Approaches to on-line mercury analysis
include ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectrometry and fluorescence
methods, such as atomic emission spectrometry and laser spectroscopy.
 Both absorbance and fluorescence techniques use the mercury radiation
line located at 253.7 nm.  The UV absorption method is the most
commonly used technique for on-line analyzers, owing to its relative
ease of use and its adaptability to a demanding environment, such
as that found in industrial applications.
<P>
On-line mercury monitors using UV absorption
typically work by first pretreating the sample gas to convert
all mercury to elemental vapor (Hg&#176;).
 The sample gas is often  heated prior to this pretreatment and
kept at an elevated temperature throughout the measurement process.
 The spectral source for the 253.7-nm mercury line may be a fluorescent
tube or a narrow band source.  A photometer is used to measure
the amount of Hg&#176;
in the pretreated gas.</FONT>
<P>
On-line UV absorption analyzers have
already been used as monitors in waste incinerators, mercury mines
and refineries, crematories and other high-mercury-level applications.
 They have also been used as ambient air monitors.  UV absorption
analyzers have not yet been applied successfully to monitoring
flue gas at power plants.  A flue gas environment presents the
difficulties of having interfering species present, as in the
high-mercury-level applications, while also typically having low
levels of mercury.  An on-line analyzer for use in a power plant
must thus be able to detect near-ambient mercury levels in a matrix
likely to contain SO<SUB>2</SUB>, H<SUB>2</SUB>O, and other substances
which can obscure the signal.  Another desirable attribute of
an on-line mercury analyzer for power plant applications is the
ability to discern different mercury species.  Most of the analyzers
developed to date are able to detect total mercury only, because
they use a gas pretreatment system to convert all mercury to Hg&#176;
<P>
Current programs at the EERC include
determining how to best adapt UV absorption analyzers for use
in power plant applications.  EERC researchers are testing a UV
absorption analyzer built in-house to optimize detection limits
and develop speciation capabilities.  A gas permeation tube is
used as a Hg&#176;
source, and repeated testing has shown that it can be calibrated
accurately and reliably.  Background correction is critical in
handling SO<SUB>2</SUB> interference and is a focal point of the
work at the EERC.
<P>
Future plans for the EERC in-house
analyzer include testing catalysts to adapt the flue gas pretreatment
system for mercury speciation.  In addition, the analyzer will
be used for monitoring mercury levels in the new Combustion and
Environmental Process Simulator (CEPS), an intermediate-scale
pilot plant combustor being built through CATM.</FONT>
<P>
A second component of the EERC's research
on mercury monitors involves evaluation of several analyzers under
development by commercial firms.  Each analyzer will be subjected
to a detailed test matrix conducted in the EERC's laboratory and
pilot plant facilities.  The analyzers will be adapted, if necessary,
for optimal performance in a flue gas environment.  The results
of the evaluation will be presented to CATM sponsors for their
use in selecting a mercury monitor to best suit their needs.</FONT>

<h3>On-Line Mercury Monitor</h3>
<P>
The EERC is seeking industrial participants
for its on-line mercury monitor evaluation program, which is tailored
for companies in the process of developing or marketing mercury
analyzers.  The goal is to find the best approach to monitoring
mercury on-line in industrial settings.  In exchange for a cash
contribution or an in-kind equivalent, such as the donation of
an analyzer, companies will receive a detailed evaluation of their
product, conducted in the EERC's controlled pilot plant and laboratory
facilities.

<h3>Mercury in the Environment:
  Soils </h3>
<P>
Mercury is widely distributed in the
natural environment, although usually not in concentrations that
are harmful to human health.  Understanding the distribution of
mercury in the natural environment provides key information in
determining the effects of mercury in air emissions, as well as
in other industrial sources.  Naturally occurring mercury may
be dissolved or suspended in water; occur as vapor or on particles
in air; be found within organisms or exist as solids, liquids
or vapors in soils, sediments and rocks.  The forms in which mercury
occurs in a given environment depend on the physical, chemical
and biological conditions at the site.
<P>
The
past and present use of mercury-filled flowmeters (mano-meters)
at gas industry metering stations has resulted in contamination
of soils with elemental mercury.  A research program sponsored
jointly by Gas Research Institute (GRI) and DOE was initiated
at the EERC to address this problem.  Program activities to date
have included an industry workshop with published proceedings,
the publication of a critical literature review and bibliographic
database, the publication of a document reviewing remediation
technologies, the development of a risk-based screening model
(HgSCREEN&trade; ) and a review of sampling and analytical techniques
for mercury (to be published).  Additional research activities
have included the characterization and monitoring of six field
research sites, a laboratory study on containers and preservation
techniques for mercury-contaminated samples and the testing of
four remediation technologies based on physical separation, thermal
desorption, chemical leaching and a combination of physical separation/chemical
leaching.  Two additional tasks have recently been initiated,
one that will evaluate four analytical techniques that could be
used for the field screening of mercury-contaminated soils and
another task that will evaluate two additional commercially available
remediation technologies.  Activities to date have indicated that
the Hg contamination is extremely localized and doesn't migrate
in shallow groundwater, that specific sampling and analytical
techniques must be adopted to provide meaningful data and that
various remediation technologies can be used to effectively remove
mercury from soils.

The EERC Environmental Education Committee
(EEC) sponsored two-day-long environmental education workshops
for K-12 teachers in January and June.  The workshops explored
uses of the &quot;Project Learning Tree&quot; curriculum, a package
of hands-on activities that focus on helping children develop
critical thinking skills so that they can learn to make wise decisions
about uses of our air, land and water resources.  A total of 46
area teachers attended the 15-hour, 1-credit workshops, which
were hosted by the EEC's 20 volunteers.  As a result of its involvement
with Project Learning Tree, the EERC has been invited to participate
in a two-day advisory meeting this September on integrating environmental
education into K-12 curricula across North Dakota.
<P>
In honor of the 25th anniversary of
Earth Day on April 22, the EEC conducted a poster contest for
local fifth-grade classes using the theme, &quot;Clean Energy
for a Clean Environment.&quot;  The winning class toured the EERC.

<h3>Trace Element Emissions
from a PFBC and an Advanced Particulate Filter</h3>
<hr>
<P>
A presentation will be made at the
upcoming &quot;Advanced Coal-Fired Power Systems '95, Review Meeting,&quot;
being held at the Morgantown Energy Technology Center, discussing
the results from the Tidd PFBC and advanced particulate filter
(APF) and their comparison with conventional systems.  The PFBC
demonstrated a slight reduction in the amount of particulate trace
metals arriving in the convective pass of the system with respect
to a conventional pc-fired boiler.  The APF system has shown a
large decrease in the total particulate through the system when
compared to a conventional electrostatic precipitator.  In both
systems, the amount of vapor-phase species (primarily mercury
and some selenium) passing through the systems was very similar
to that of a conventional system.

<H2>EERC Meets with Industry, EPA and DOE Representatives on Air Toxic Metals

</H2>
<HR SIZE=1>
<P>
Measuring and controlling emissions of mercury, selenium, lead and other air toxic metals from energy
generation systems was the focus of a meeting held at the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) combustion and environmental laboratory research facilities in Research Triangle Park, N.C., between government offficials, industry representatives andresearchers on December 8-9.
<P>
      Air toxic metal emissions from electric utility power plants are not currently regulated by the EPA. However, the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments require the agency to study the potential human health and environmental effects of these emissions. The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) is gathering and receiving data worldwide for this study,
which will help the EPA determine how air toxic metal emissions are regulated.
<P>                        
 "Our goal is to provide the EPA with the most objective scientific data available on air toxic metals," said Steve Benson, Director of the Center for Air Toxic Metals at the EERC. "Holding meetings in which industry, government and the research community are involved will assist in the development
of scientifically based regulations."
<P>                        
Attending the meeting was Karen Morehouse, Director of the EPA's Centers and Special Programs, Washington, D.C. During the meeting, researchers from the EPA's Research Triangle Park facility gave updates on air toxic regulations, metals monitoring and metals emission control. CATM staff gave presentations on the major program areas of CATM, which included air toxic metal transforma-
tions, control technologies, development of analytical methods, computer modeling and databases and technology commercialization and education.
                        
Karen Morehouse, EPA Directorfor Centers and Special Programs, Steve Benson, CATMDirector, and William Linak, EPA Technical Monitor for CATM, discuss highlights of the Aff liates meeting
<P>
Among the meeting participants were representatives of the U. S. Department of Energy
Morgantown (W. Va.) Energy Technology Center and Pittsburgh (Pa.) Energy
Technology Center. Industrial organizations represented were CSIRO Minerals Research Laboratories, North Ryde, Australia, Consolidated Edison, New York: New Binghampton, N.Y.; W.L. Gore & Associates, Inc., Elkton, Md.; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Yokohama, Japan; Electric Power Research Institute. Palo Alto, Calif.; Babcock & Wilcox Co., Barberton, Ohio; CONSOL Inc., Pittsburgh, Pa.; and Acurex Environmental Corp., Durham, N.C.
<P>                                                 
Benson said that he is working to have more industry participants in the CATM program, "It's an excellent opportunity for industry to participate in the process of developing the data that
will be used bv the reaulators "
<P>                                                 
The next CATM meeting is tentatively scheduled for June 1995 at the EERC in Grand Forks, N.Dak.

<H2>Director's Message</H2>


The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) is a part of the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) of the University of North Dakota (UND).  The EERC was established in 1951 as a Bureau of Mines facility and was transferred to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) in 1983, becoming part of  UND in 1983. In the early years, much of the EERC's work focused on coal.  Today, the EERC performs research related to energy and environmental issues that reach far beyond traditional coal combustion systems. With emphasis on new technologies and on developing and applying practical solutions, the EERC has grown to over 260 employees, with a budget that approaches $20 million annually. The mission of the EERC is to improve the global quality of life by providing  leadership in visionary, multidisciplinary and innovative research and training focused on the development of clean, efficient energy generation processes and environmental technologies. The EERC has a large number of projects, programs, clients and funding sources, all of which are dealt with on an individual basis with respect to proprietary issues. The EERC extends an invitation for partnership ventures to anyone seeking research, development, demonstration and commercialization opportunities focused on energy and environmental technologies.
<P>
CATM is a nationally coordinated program that is part of the EERC.  CATM's focus is understanding and
minimizing the effects of air toxic metals on the environment. The base level of funding for CATM is from the U.S. EPA and represents about 1/20 of the total EERC budget. Through CATM, a talented multidisciplinary team of experts at the EERC is focused on key issues that enhance the understanding, prevention and control of air toxic substances emitted from combustion and incineration systems.
<P>                         
CATM's management structure is illustrated to the right. The EPA program manager is Ms. Karen Morehouse, Director, Centers and Special Programs.  Ms. Morehouse is assisted by Dr. William Linak, who is a technical monitor from the EPA. Two committees assist in the selection and review of projects funded by the affiliates program, base EPA program or the EPA Jointly Sponsored Research Program (EPA JSRP). Related projects outside of CATM funding are not subject to the committee review process, but can take advantage of the programs offered through CATM if the project sponsors choose to do so.
<P>                         
CATM is structured and positioned within the EERC to facilitate the acquisition and sharing of information/data related to air toxic metals. That is, the EERC facilitates the assimilation, sharing and dissemination of information to outside agencies  such as DOE, EPA satellite offices, other EPA centers, universities worldwide, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and industry.
 <P>                        
CATM is designed to pool resources and research results in one centralized location. This arrangement, however, does not prevent the EERC from continuing to perform non-EPA-funded research in related areas such as air toxics. The EERC encourages other project sponsors to join and support CATM, but does not mandate or impose these requirements. If a client desires to have the EERC perform research specific to air toxic metals but does not wish to share information, then the EERC will honor such a request as contractually defined by the client. On the other hand, if the client wishes to solely fund a project and share the results with CATM, this can easily be accommodated within the existing infrastructure. If EPA shares in the cost of the project, the data and results must be publicly available, e.g., through CATM. Conversely, if EPA does not share in the cost of the project, then the project sponsors (and the EERC) must decide whether the findings are to remain confidential or be made available to CATM.
<P>                                                  
I hope this discussion clarifies the relationship between the EERC and CATM and better defines how projects are conducted and managed.

<H3> Research Points Way to Enhanced Air Toxics Control</H3>
 
Title III of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) requires the EPA to establish stationary source categories and to implement regulatory standards for 189 air toxics. However, Title III also requires that EPA study hazardous air pollutant emissions from utility boilers prior to promulgating any new regulations.
<P>
     Research funded by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is being conducted by the EERC to investigate the control of mercury and other trace elements in coal-fired boilers. Since most of the toxic metals present in coal will be in particulate form, a high level of fine-particle control appears to be the best approach to achieving a high level of air toxic control. However, over 50% of mercury and a portion of selenium emissions are in vapor form and are not typically collected in particulate control devices. Effective control of these vapor-phase metals by the use
of a sorbent would provide a method to control all metal air toxic emissions with minimal impact on existing boiler systems.
<P>                         
The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the potential to remove trace metal air toxic emissions from coal combustion gases in conventional particulate control devices. Specific goals of the work include the following:
<P>                         
Determine trace metal balances for arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel and selenium in a pilot-scale pulverized coal-fired combustion system for a minimum of two coals.
<P>
Evaluate the effect of particulate collector type (fabric filter or electrostatic precipitator) on trace element removal.
<P>
Determine the potential to enhance collection of mercury and selenium by injecting conditioning agents or sorbents upstream of the particulate collector.                                                    
 <P>                                                     
The level of mercury in raw coal is very small, typically only 0.05 to 0.1 ppm, which results in a trace mercury concentration at the stack of approximately 5 to 10 pg/m3 or about 1 ppb.  Special sampling and analysis techniques are required to quantify these low-level mercury concentrations under various test conditions. However, excellent agreement was observed when comparing the actual measured mercury concentrations at the inlet to the baghouse with expected concentrations based on the mercury in the
coal. Initial results indicate that over 90% mercury control can be achieved by injecting small amounts of activated carbon into the flue gas upstream of a fabric filter. The activated carbon effectiveness appears to be highly dependent upon the type of activated carbon, the type of coal being burned, inlet mercury speciation and temperature.
<P>                                                  
Future work planned for this project includes determining the most effective and economical sorbents to control mercury in an electrostatic precipitator or baghouse, the temperature range over which the sorbents are effective and the required sorbent concentrations to achieve various levels of mercury control.
 <P>

<H3>HAP Emissions from Advanced Power Systems: A Full-Scale Examination</H3>
<HR SIZE=1>
As part of the existing Trace Element Emissions program at the EERC, an additional focus has been added to review and correlate hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from advanced power systems.
 Numerous studies have been performed on advanced power demonstration systems that will be reviewed for consistency and accuracy. The data will then be correlated as a function of advanced power systems, feedstocks and operating parameters. Results from the correlations will be compared to those from conventional combustion systems which are being developed under a separate project at the EERC (see Summer 1994 issue). Data from these activities will be added to the Center for Air Toxic Metals database and flagged with appropriate confidential and proprietary security. Results from this study will be reported to the U.S. Department of Energy in the fall of 1995.

<H2>"Partnerships for a Better Quality of Life"</H2>
<H3>CATM Cosponsors Second International Conference in Czech Republic</H3>
<HR SIZE=1>

The urgent need for clean, efficient energy production and economical environmental technologies in Eastern and Central Europe were the issues addressed by a technical conference held November 1-5 in the
Czech Republic. "Energy and Environment: Transitions in East Central Europe," was cosponsored by the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) and the Power Research Institute of Prague (EGU) in
the Czech Republic. Financial sponsors included the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Electric Power Research Institute, Southern Electric International, Intera Information Technologies, Ltd., Kfx Atlantic Partners, North Dakota Department of Economic Development and Finance, NRG Energy Inc. and POWER International.  Additionally, the U.S. Department of Energy sponsored two preconference
workshops on "Production and Utilization of Ecological Fuels from East Central European Coals" and "Least Cost Economic Power Generation in East Central Europe." A projected outcome of the workshops was the formation of commercial ventures involving U.S. technologies and Eastern and Central European industries. The workshop and conference were attended by more than 300 industry representatives, government officials and researchers from 20 countries.
<P>                                                  
The conference mission was to provide a venue to identify and discuss cost-effective, environmentally acceptable energy and environmental technology options. The technical program was developed with the assistance of a 44-member Advisory Council that included members from Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, the Slovak Republic, the Czech Republic and the United States.
 <P>                                                 
Part One of the conference focused on immediate energy and environmental needs by addressing plant
rehabilitation, environmental remediation and related financing. Part Two shifted to a focus on long-term
problems involving energy supply, energy effficiency and improved environmental control.
<P>
The people in Eastern and Central Europe are clearly interested in applying the most advanced technologies to clean up and protect the environment. Many state-of-the-art technologies are being reviewed and applied to increase energy effficiency, minimize sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, clean up contaminated sites through bio remediation and separation technologies and develop ways to utilize waste materials.  The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) played an important role in the conference through providing information on the fate and behavior of potentially toxic metals in combustion and air pollution control devices. In addition, the National Network of U.S. EPA Environmental Centers, of which CATM is a member, was overviewed by Karen Morehouse, who described various ways this network functions through partners in academia, industry and government in Eastern and Central Europe.
<P>

<H2>CATM BRIEFS</H2>
<HR SIZE=1>                                                               
The EERC recently received an environmental award from the University of North Dakota.  UND Plant Services Director Leroy Sondrol presented the EERC with the John Meagher Ecology Award in recognition of the Center's recycling efforts and its environmental research program.
<P>
EERC Director Gerald Groenewold noted that employees were responsible for beginning the Center's recycling program. In 1989, Lucia Romuld initiated paper recycling at the EERC.  More recently, the EERC's Environmental Education Committee, headed by Karen Katrinak and Tina Strobel, began a Centerwide program to recycle mixed paper, aluminum cans and plastic materials.
<P>
Part of the mission of CATM involves contributing to improved environmental education opportunities for students at UND.  As a step toward that goal, CATM recently provided summer funding for UND faculty to develop stronger environmental education components in their courses. Two courses were selected for
funding through a competitive review process. The courses, to be offered in spring 1995, are "Advanced Chemical Engineering Kinetics," by Dr. Kirk Schulz of the Department of Chemical Engineering, and "Values and the Environment," to be taught by Dr. Scott Lowe of the Department of Philosophy and Religion and Dr. Dexter Perkins of the Department of Geology and Geological Engineering.
"Advanced Chemical Engineering Kinetics" is a graduate-level course required for all first-year graduate students in Chemical Engineering. Students from the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Chemistry also commonly enroll.
<P>                                                   
CATM funds were used to modify the course to include several lectures n the use of environmental catalysts and also to develop a student design project involving computer simulation of a simplified atmospheric ozone depletion model.
<P>
"Values and the Environment," an undergraduate-level course, was developed to be offered through the
Department of Philosophy and Religion. The focus is on understanding people's perceptions about the natural world and how human beings fit into it and determining how those perceptions affect the choices societies make regarding energy use. A wide variety of reading material will be used, including many writings concerning the possibility of integrating values from other cultures into our Western society as a
possible means for achieving sustainable development.

<H2>Energy Secretary O'Leary Dedicates New EERC Research and Laboratory Additions</H2>
<HR SIZE=1>
The work of the University of North Dakota's (UND) Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC)
points to future success for America, according to U.S. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, who spoke during a ceremony August 26 to dedicate the new Environmental Research Laboratory and Pilot Plant Additions at the EERC.
<P>
O'Leary, a former vice president with Northern States Power Co. in Minneapolis, was appointed Energy
Secretary by President Bill Clinton in 1993. During the dedication ceremony, O'Leary also presented the
1994 Department of Energy Innovation Award to UND and the North Dakota State College of Science at Wahpeton.
<P>
Also attending the event were Senator Kent Conrad, Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator Jocelyn Burdick,
Congressman Earl Pomeroy, Grand Forks Mayor Michael Polovitz and Earl Strinden, executive director of the UND Alumni Association and Foundation. UND President Kendall Baker presided.
<P>
"The EERC's new additions give the Center an opportunity to grow, something we couldn't do before
the expansion's completion," says EERC Director Gerald Groenewold. "The new facilities also enabled us to consolidate labs that were located across the UND campus and provide office space for the researchers and technicians who worked in those labs."
<P>                        
The expansion project was completed in two phases. The first phase was the four-level, 50,000-square-foot Environmental Research Laboratory Addition connected to the north side of the administrative building. The laboratories housed in this new facility include inorganic analysis, process chemistry, high-temperature materials, geoscience, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, process chemistry, paleontology, analytical research and biotechnology. The new laboratory and computer facilities are ideal for performing state-of-the-art research on air toxic metals
 <P>                                                
The second phase was the three-level, 7400-square-foot Pilot Plant Addition built immediately southeast of the administrative building. This addition provides increased space for the installation of new test equipment, such as the Combustion and Environmental Process Simulator (CEPS) being constructed through CATM, a staging area in which equipment can be built and room for equipment storage. It includes improved and expanded facilities for the EERC's pilot plant operations staff.
<P>                                                 
O'Leary said the EERC has a clear vision and understanding "that our future is tied into two basic, and often conflicting, concepts: energy and the environment." In addition, Secretary O'Leary called the EERC's vision and practice of blending entrepreneurial zeal and zest for scientific discovery and exploration a model that other energy research facilities should emulate

<H2>Verification Tests for Mercury Speciation Using EPA (Draft) Method 29</H2>
<HR SIZE=1>

The ultimate fate of mercury in the environment often depends on the form of mercury emitted from a source. It is also known that some mercury control methods will collect oxidized mercury efficiently, but not elemental mercury. Therefore, it is necessary to measure not only total mercury emissions, but also whether the mercury is in the elemental or oxidized form.  Currently, no universally accepted methods are available for measuring mercury speciation. U.S. EPA (Draft) Method 29 (multimetals train) has been proposed as being capable of speciating mercury, but it has not been accepted by the EPA as a valid method.
 <P>                        
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) are funding a project at the EERC to evaluate the ability of EPA (Draft) Method 29 to measure both speciated and total mercury accurately in coal-fired boilers. In addition, specific goals of the work are to determine the precision and accuracy of Method 29 as a function of process variables. Bench- and pilot-scale tests will be performed under a variety of conditions.

<h3>CATM Director's Message, Steven A. Benson, Ph.D.</h3><hr>
<h3>
CATM Second Annual Meeting</h3></center>
<hr>

<p>The second annual meeting of the Center for Air Toxic Metals was held at the Department of
Energy's Morgantown Energy Technology Center on September 28.  The purpose of the meeting was
to provide a forum by which industry, government and academia could exchange information on air
toxic metals and provide direction for CATM's research, development and commercialization
programs.  Approximately 53 people participated, representing the government (including the EPA,
the U.S. Geological Survey and DOE), industry and academic research organizations.

<p>	The presentations and discussion were initiated by EPA personnel who provided an overview
of the critical air toxic issues, regulatory perspective and status of regulations.  This was followed by
a summary of the results of DOE's program on "Utility Trace Element Emission Data from the DOE
Air Toxics Study."  The subsequent presentations involved the forms of the air toxic emission,
methods for sampling and speciating Hg, control of Hg and predicting the fate of metals in
combustion and incineration systems.  The meeting was wrapped up by presentations in areas in
which CATM has ongoing collaborative efforts.  These included DOE's Environmental Management
program, North Dakota Air Toxic Studies:  Review and Perspective and Hazardous Air Pollutants

<p>	Mr. Charles French of the EPA provided an overview of the critical air  toxic issues and
regulatory perspective and status in "Utility Air Toxics Study Report to Congress."  The "Utility Air
Toxics Study" will be submitted to Congress  on January 15, 1996.  The major components of the
report to Congress include characterization of the industry, emissions data analysis, health hazard risk
assessment, alternative control strategies, conclusions and findings.


<p>	The presentation on DOE's program "Utility Trace Element Emission Data from the DOE Air
Toxics Study" provided an overview of the key findings (see feature article in this issue).  Key
findings included the variability in data on metals measurement, demonstrating the difficulty in
quantifying trace element emissions from coal-fired power plants.  The potential to control mercury
emissions from coal-fired utility boilers using existing emission control technologies is unclear, since
penetration values for total Hg ranged from 6% to 120%.  Measurement of total Hg levels is not
adequate because Hg speciation may influence the degree of metal control.  Control of nonvolatile
trace elements was &gt;90% for all nine DOE sites.  Annual emission rates at each plant for combined
trace element hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) ranged from 0.06 to 5.65 ton/yr.  The DOE Phase I
data demonstrate that the combined trace element HAP emissions are well below the individual HAP
limit of 10 ton/yr defined in Title III of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.


<p>	The behavior of trace metals in conversion and pollution control systems was the focus of several
of the subsequent discussions.  Emphasis is being placed on Hg, with work being performed to
determine the way in which Hg is associated in fuels and how it is transformed in energy-producing
and environmental control systems.  Based on much of the work, the fate of Hg in an air pollution
control system is directly related to the form of Hg in the gas phase.  Its form is related to flue gas
composition and temperature, which is dictated by fuel composition and conversion conditions. 
Efforts to test the ability to sample and speciate Hg in the gas phase are currently being conducted. 
Findings are indicating that flue gas composition has a significant effect on Hg speciation and,
therefore, on the fate of Hg.  These issues are important for both conventional and advanced power
systems.


<p>	The final session of the meeting provided the opportunity to discuss collaborative activities. 
Three presentations were given that involved a discussion of DOE's Environmental Management
program designed to clean up weapons sites, a perspective on North Dakota research activities in the
area of air toxics and the behavior of air toxic metals in advanced power systems.  


<p>	The meeting was a tremendous success, and we thank those of you who participated.  If you
were unable to attend this year, we strongly recommend you consider participating in the meeting
next year.

<h3>Hazardous Air Pollutant Correlations Evaluated for DOE</h3><hr>
</center>
<p>As part of the effort in reviewing and summarizing the DOE Phase I Toxic Emissions field reports,
the EERC examined the data for potential correlations between stack emissions of trace element
species and coal, operating and process parameters.  Such relationships are useful in identifying
factors that affect the removal/control of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). 

<p> 	The number of possible variables used in developing the empirical models were systematically
reduced by applying the multiple linear regression procedure (REG) described in the SAS statistical
software package.  Significant variables were identified using the criterion of maximizing the
correlation coefficient.  Further evaluation and reduction in variables were made based on the 95%
confidence level for the probability of significance of individual parameters in the model  (t-statistic).<br>

<p>	Empirical models describing the emissions of trace metal species were developed from the
statistical evaluation of data from the DOE Phase I field tests combined with the available data from
the EPRI Field Chemical Emissions Monitoring (FCEM) project.  The data extracted from the
DOE/EPRI field sampling efforts were essentially observational in nature and, as such, were not
readily suitable for proving cause and effect relationships among the variables.  However, the models
derived from this database describe the average change in the response (species emitted) that was
observed with a change in a value of a modeling variable.  Although there may be other (additional)
parameters that affect trace element emissions, the variables identified by these correlations provide
a good starting point by which in-depth pilot-scale research programs can be structured to further
define, refine or determine the impact of these parameters.

<p><center>
<IMG SRC="sb12531a.jpg"></center><p>
As an example correlation, the data in the accompanying figure show the measured versus
predicted Hg emissions (lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu), where coal and process parameter estimates were obtained
using a weighted regression.  Note that the weights used for modeling are inversely proportional to
the lengths of the error bars squared.  In this particular model, the Hg emissions were predicted to
increase with increasing coal-mercury (Hg) and coal-ash (ash) concentration and be reduced by
increasing coal-sulfur (S) concentration.  In addition, the sulfur control (SC) process parameter
indicates that wet scrubbers reduced emissions to a greater extent than systems not utilizing any sulfur
control, while Hg emissions tended to increase with increasing stack particulate emissions (PM).

<p>	In the case of coal-Hg in the above correlation, the positive exponent clearly shows the
anticipated increase in Hg emissions with increasing coal-Hg levels.  Likewise, the model predicts
that a scrubber will reduce the expected Hg emissions by a factor of 2.8 (SC can only have values of
1 or -1, with 1 equating to a wet scrubber).  Wet scrubbers have been observed to exhibit limited and
often inconsistent Hg capture in full-scale systems.  The remaining parameters are not as obvious, but

<p>it may be speculated that coal-ash may be indirectly related to coal rank or plant configuration; e.g.,
lower-rank coals would be less likely to utilize a wet scrubber for SO<sub>2</sub> control, and coal-S could be
related to wet scrubbers or homogeneous gas-phase reactions influencing Hg oxidation.  Properly
designed and controlled experiments are needed to verify or discount the true nature and value of
these correlations.

<h2>Mercury Workshops Sponsored by GRI and DOE</h2>
</center><hr>
<br><br>
<p>Mercury contamination at oil and gas industry sites was the focus of three 1-day workshops
conducted by researchers at the EERC.  The workshops were sponsored by Gas Research Institute
(GRI) and DOE.  The first two workshops were held in New Orleans on June 23 and in Pittsburgh
on September 22.  The third workshop was held in San Diego on November 16 in conjunction with
the annual meeting of the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA).

<br><br>
<p>	The workshops are the culmination of 4 years of research investigating mercury contamination
at gas metering stations.  For many decades, mercury manometers have been used throughout the
industry in the measurement of the flow of gas at wellhead sites, along pipelines, at gas processing
plants and within gas distribution systems.  Soils in the immediate vicinity of the gas meters have
elevated levels of mercury resulting from occasional spills or leaks from the manometers.

<br><br>
<p>	The multidisciplinary research program included the integration of field and laboratory studies
associated with six field sites in New Mexico, Louisiana and Pennsylvania.  Another major task of
the research program was the selection and testing of several technologies applied to the treatment
of mercury-contaminated soils from gas metering sites.  A risk-based model, called HgSCREEN,
was developed under a subcontract to Roy F. Weston, Inc., for the prioritization of mercury-contaminated sites for remediation.

<br><br>
<p>	Presentations at the workshop were made by the principal EERC researchers involved in the
research tasks, and the appropriate bound GRI topical reports were distributed to the participants. 
The regulations were reviewed by the director of environmental affairs for a major natural gas
company.  As an added feature at the Pittsburgh and San Diego workshops, short presentations were
given by representatives of four or five remediation companies, who also participated in a panel
discussion.

<br><br>
<p>	A total of 145 participants attended the three workshops.  The majority of the participants were
from gas pipeline companies, the oil and gas industry and environmental consulting companies.  Also
represented were state and federal regulatory agencies and universities.

<p>The EERC participated in an environmental education strategy-planning session held in Bismarck,
North Dakota, September 19-20.  Over 60 educators and agency representatives from throughout
North Dakota attended.  The goal of the meeting was to formulate a plan to develop a comprehensive
environmental education program in North Dakota's public schools.  Many excellent environmental
education resources for grades K-12 are available for free or at low cost, but their use is entirely at
the discretion of individual teachers.  The amount and type of environmental education material
currently presented in North Dakota's public schools thus vary greatly.  Participants at the Bismarck
meeting were divided into small groups to brainstorm ideas for better integration of environmental
education into K-12 schools.  Case studies of other states with mandatory environmental education
programs were reviewed.  The need for better teacher training in environmental education was
discussed at length.  Optional in-service training for current teachers is available, but widespread use
of environmental education materials will probably not occur until undergraduate education majors
are required to cover this topic.


<p>	Several action items resulted from the meeting.  The group opted not to promote a mandatory
statewide environmental education program at this time, but rather to actively seek grassroots-level
support from as many individuals and organizations as possible.  Toward this end, a Memorandum
of Understanding was drafted and is currently being circulated to state and tribal agencies, educational
facilities and other organizations.  A comprehensive booklet of environmental education materials
available to teachers will be prepared and distributed free to all North Dakota public schools.  An
Environmental Education Steering Committee was organized to guide future activities in this area. <p><hr>

<h3>Construction of New Intermediate-Scale Combustion Test Facility Nears Completion </h3></center>
<hr>
<p>For several years now, the EERC has been performing controlled combustion tests using bench- and
pilot-scale test combustors designed to simulate full-scale combustion conditions.  Initially, these
small-scale systems were used for assessing emissions control, fouling, slagging and combustion
reactivity of coals of varying rank.  More recently these systems have been configured to evaluate air
toxic emissions from combustion systems that burn fossil and waste fuels.  The types of test facilities
available at the EERC used for solid or liquid fuel combustion include drop-tube furnace systems
(atmospheric and pressurized), which burn several grams of fuel per minute, and pilot-scale units,
which burn 50 to 75 lb fuel/hr.  The EERC has recently finished constructing and testing an intermediate-scale combustor--termed the Conversion and Environmental Process Simulator
(CEPS)--that will effectively operate at 4-6 lb fuel/hr.
<br>
<center><IMG SRC="cz11965.jpg"></center>
<p>	The CEPS is an extremely versatile system that can generate realistic combustion test results for
a variety of fuels and combustion conditions.  Specific applications for this system include fuel and
combustion system impacts on air pollutant formation and prevention, residual ash disposal and reuse,
combustion rates and efficiencies, furnace slagging and fouling and emissions and control technologies.  The CEPS is especially designed for sensitive measurement of trace element species in flue
gas with detection limits of less than one part per million.  Special design considerations have been
taken into account to minimize the introduction of contaminants from system surfaces to process
flows.  Much of the anticipated testing will be conducted using coal; however, other fuels to be tested
include oil, petroleum coke, oremulsion, black liquor, biomass such as wood pellets, hay, alfalfa or
tree bark and waste materials such as sludge and municipal solid waste.  For pollution control, the
CEPS is equipped with a baghouse and will have an option for placing a small wet scrubber system
in series with the baghouse.


<p>	The CEPS has a downfired design for nominally firing 4.4 lb/hr (2 kg/hr) of pulverized coal with
a heat output of 40,000 Btu/hr.  The combustion air is split and fed as primary and secondary air, with
the secondary air introduced into the CEPS vertically or tangentially.  The furnace system is a
modular system capable of simulating conditions of both the radiant and convective sections of a full-scale utility boiler.  The vertical radiant furnace consists of 13 feet of furnace, beginning with a 6-inch-inner diameter section that is reduced to 3 inches in the final heated section and, finally, to 2
inches in the furnace exit section prior to the convective section.  The five furnace sections comprise
the radiant furnace section and are constructed using a combination of ceramic tubes set into cast
abrasion-resistant refractory containing sight and sampling ports.  The ceramic tubes are exposed to
molybdenum disilicide heating elements allowing operation to 1600C.  The convective pass is about
4 feet in length and constructed of similar materials as the main furnace.  The convective pass is
equipped with two in-series highly instrumented air-cooled probes for measuring ash deposition
propensity.


<p>	From the convective section, flue gas flows through a heat exchange section and then on to the
particulate control device.  Flue gas temperatures are controlled going into the pollution control
device section for typical operation between 250-350F, and flexibility has been built into the
system to allow experimentation at even higher flue gas temperatures.  Several access ports that
penetrate through the ceramic tube reaction zones provide access to the inside of the CEPS for
sampling, observation and optical diagnostics.


<p>	Unlike many similar intermediate-scale furnaces currently in operation, attaining and maintaining
accurate control of gas temperatures throughout the CEPS furnace is possible through the use of
external heating elements that are linked to flue gas temperature controllers.  Temperatures of the flue
gas can attain a maximum of 1500-1600C (2732-2912F) in the radiant section and can be
maintained at 760-1200C (1400-2200F) in the convective pass section.  Flue gas flow rates can
be maintained at approximately 8 scfm.

<title>Phase I Trace Element</title>
</head>
<center>
<h3>Phase I Trace Element Results from the
DOE Toxic Emissions Field Study</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>In response to Title III, Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments
(CAAA), the U.S. Department of Energy <a href="http://www.doe.gov">(DOE)</a> has participated in a collaborative effort with the
Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency <a href ="http://www.epa.gov">(EPA)</a> and the
Electric Power Research Institute <a href="http://www.epri.com">(EPRI)</a> to establish information upon which future regulatory
activities can be based.  The field sampling efforts have been led primarily by DOE and EPRI.  The
DOE Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center <a href="http://www.petc.doe.gov">(PETC)</a> has completed HAP emission sampling activities
at eight utility sites representing nine process configurations.  The purpose of the Phase I field
sampling activities was to document the type and concentration of potential HAPs from a select
group of utility stations representing a cross section of U.S. coal-fired utility boilers.  The DOE
financial investment required to complete the Phase I effort was $8,600,000.


<p>	The University of North Dakota Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center <a href="http://www.eerc.und.nodak.edu">(EERC)</a>, at the
request of PETC, reviewed the contractor reports documenting the results from Phase I sampling
activities and prepared a draft summary report.  That report is currently under review and should be
available from DOE in early 1996.  This article briefly discusses results related to trace element
emission factor data.


<p>	Emission factor data, reported on a lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu of heat input basis, were generated for 25
elements, including 9 major elements and 16 minor, or trace, elements.  The primary purpose for
including a number of major elements in the study was to permit a better assessment of material
balance results.  Minor or trace elements included Sb, As, Ba, Be, B, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Hg,
Mo, Ni, Se and V.  Eleven of the trace elements (Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Mn, Hg, Ni and Se)
included in the DOE Phase I study are found on the list of 189 HAPs identified in Title III of the
CAAA of 1990.

<center><IMG SRC="10711gwb.jpg" ></center>
<p>	The data in the accompanying figure show that the emission factor range for a given element was
as small as one order of magnitude for Mn (2.6 to 30 lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu) to four orders of magnitude for Se
(&lt;0.022 to 193 lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu).  The trace element listed as a HAP having the highest median emission
factor was Se (26.5 lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu), followed closely by Mn (11 lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu).  Sb and Be were observed
to have the lowest median emission factors, 0.36 and 0.13 lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu, respectively.


<p>	Emission factors for total Hg ranged from 0.44 to 22 lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu, based on mean stack
concentrations of 0.6 to 30 g/Nm<sup>3</sup> (Nm<sup>3</sup> is based on 0C and 1 atmosphere).  Emission factor and
stack concentration data correlated somewhat with the Hg concentration in the coal (mean values of
0.04 to 0.28 ppm on a mass basis).  Typical mean Hg values of about 0.1 ppm were reported for six
of the nine fuels.  Calculated percent penetration values for total Hg ranged from about 6% to nearly
120%.  From the DOE Phase I data, the potential to control Hg emissions from coal-fired utility
boilers using existing emission control technologies is unclear.  Therefore, if Hg regulation is
determined to be necessary, there will be a need to augment existing control technologies and develop
alternative control technology options.  Also, evaluating emission control technology performance
based on total Hg concentration alone is not appropriate, since Hg speciation may affect the degree
of control observed.  This effect currently cannot be quantified adequately, since methods to speciate
Hg are still unproven.  Based on the DOE Phase I Hg data, future Hg sampling efforts must
emphasize accurate Hg speciation in order to properly evaluate the performance of emission control
technologies.

<br><br>
<p>	The data for the nonvolatile trace element (Sb, As, Ba, Be, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Mo, Ni and
V) emission factors indicate that emission control is directly related to overall particulate control for
the individual field sites.  Emission control for the 13 nonvolatile trace elements was &gt;90% for all nine
sites.  Particulate control alone (ESP or fabric filtration) limited penetration to 5% or less (&gt;95%
control) for 10 (Sb, Ba, Be, Cr, Co, Cu, Pb, Mn, Ni and V) of the 13 trace elements.  A combination
of particulate control and dry or wet FGD demonstrated &gt;99% control for 8 (Sb, As, Ba, Co, Cu,
Pb, Mn and V) of the 13 trace elements.  The exceptions noted appear to be the result of high
reported nondetect concentrations, failed blanks and/or spike recoveries and other factors affecting
data variability.  Therefore, the DOE Phase I data indicate that the emission of the 13 nonvolatile
trace elements was effectively controlled (&gt;99%) by highly efficient particulate control technology
or technology combinations (ESP plus scrubber or spray dryer absorber-fabric filter (SDA-FF)) currently being used by the U.S. utility industry.

<br><br>
<p>	Estimates of total trace element HAP emission factors ranged from 17 to 284 lb/10<sup>12</sup> Btu for the
nine individual process configurations.  Based on fuel feed rates and analyses reported for the nine
field sites, the total annual emission rates at each plant for individual trace element HAPs (Sb, As, Be,
Cd, Cr, Co, Pb, Mn, Hg, Ni and Se) were all estimated to be &lt;3 ton/yr.  Most emission estimates
were substantially &lt;0.5 ton/yr, based on an overall capacity factor of 0.7.  The estimated combined
trace element HAP annual emission rates for each of the nine sites ranged from 0.06 to 5.7 tons/yr. 
Although the results of the DOE Phase I air toxics study do not answer all of the questions
concerning the emission of trace metal HAPs from coal-fired boilers, these data establish a good basis
of information and will help to focus future activities on the most pertinent issues, such as Hg.

<h3>CATM Director's Message, Steven A. Benson, Ph.D.</h3>

<h2>Where We're Going in 1997</h2>
</center><hr>
<p>The Center for Air Toxic Metals programs in 1997 will focus on projects that are of direct benefit
to preventing and controlling the emission of potentially toxic trace metals in thermal processes.  The
projects that are planned to be conducted are as follows.


<p><em><strong>  	Process Impacts on Trace Metal Speciation -- </em></strong>The current understanding of Hg speciation in
combustion flue gases is that the Hg is initially transformed to gaseous elemental mercury,
Hg<sup>0</sup>(g), during the combustion process.  Subsequent oxidation reactions with flue gas
components at lower temperatures produce inorganic mercuric compounds [Hg<sup>2+</sup>X<sub>(s,g)</sub>, where
X is Cl<sub>2</sub>, O, SO<sub>4</sub>, etc.].  Data and speciation analysis results indicate, however, that not all of the
Hg<sup>0</sup>(g) is oxidized.  The Hg<sup>0</sup>(g) is difficult to capture in control systems and is apt to enter the
global atmospheric cycle because of its high vapor pressure and low water solubility.  The
specific objectives of the project are to identify and quantify the primary chemical forms of Hg
and other selected trace elements present as a function of the gas composition and temperature.


<p>  	<strong>Elucidation of Reactivity Parameters and Processes for Mercury Sorption on Fly Ash</strong> --
Investigations to determine the interaction of Hg species with fly ash and associated carbon are
needed in order to design more effective control technologies.  The Hg sorption processes that
occur at moderate temperatures (100-300C) between elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>) and mercuric
chloride (HgCl<sub>2</sub>) and fly ash carbon and inorganic surfaces will be identified.  Specific objectives
include developing and investigating advanced analytical methods to identify ash properties
contributing to sorption and determining fly ash surface characteristics.


<p><em><strong>  	Addition of a Wet Scrubber System for Incorporation into the CEPS Flue Gas Cleanup
System -- </em></strong>A state-of-the-art intermediate-scale conversion and environmental process simulator
(CEPS) has been constructed to provide an extremely well-controlled system for determining
the impacts of combustion conditions and fuel properties on toxic element speciation and
control.  Currently, the CEPS can only test the control and behavior of  trace elements across
a baghouse.  The behavior of metals in wet scrubbing systems needs to be addressed under
closely controlled conditions.  This project involves the design, construction and testing of a wet
scrubbing system for the CEPS.  The goal of the proposed project is to develop improved
methods to control the capture of toxic trace metal species by wet scrubbing the flue gas
generated by the combustion of selected coals.


<p><em><strong>  	Database and Modeling -- </em></strong>The database and modeling efforts will continue to focus on the
development of computer-based tools for use in assessing the fate of trace metals during
combustion, gasification, and waste incineration.  Currently, the CATM database provides
advanced methods of data storage, manipulation, and retrieval.  These database features offer
industry, government, and research personnel efficient and economical access to a wealth of data
on air toxic substances.  Models developed in this project are being used to predict the fate of
trace metals as a function of fuel composition and operating conditions of thermal processes and
associated air pollution control devices.  The goal of the work in 1997 is to enhance the database
through incorporation of new data and to test thermochemical equilibrium models.


<p><em><strong>  	Seminars on Trace Metals and Their Impact on Industrial Processes -- </em></strong>A practical 1-day
seminar entitled "Trace Metals in Industrial Applications" has been developed through the
CATM program and will be offered at several locations in the United States.  The goal of the
seminar is to provide an overview of regulatory issues as well as trace element behavior and
control in systems utilizing coal, oil, and natural gas or alternative fuels such as biomass,
municipal solid waste, and refuse-derived fuels.

<h2>CATM Air Toxic Metals Database Available</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>One of the ways in which CATM is meeting its mission has been the development of a relational
database and a user-friendly interface.  The database is capable of storing and manipulating large
volumes of data regarding air toxic metals.  Advanced features for data retrieval and display are built
into the user interface.  Together, these components provide information to researchers, managers,
and operations personnel to aid in their decision making and long-term planning of issues related to
air toxic metals.


<p>	Currently, the database contains over 3000 analytical measurements from many sources,
including data from nine full-scale field tests from the "Comprehensive Assessment of Toxic
Emissions from Coal-Fired Power Plants" project sponsored by the U.S. DOE through the Pittsburgh
Energy Technology Center (PETC).  Data are available on gaseous, solid, and liquid stream samples
as well as on relevant engineering parameters, including process data.  Additional data will be added
on an ongoing basis from  bench-, pilot-, and full-scale sources in the areas of coal gasification and
combustion, oil combustion, waste incineration, and environmental management.
<br><center><img src="sb12853.jpg"></center>
<p>	The database has many practical applications.  For example, a utility may be considering a change
in the source of its coal supply to meet the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.  The database can be
queried for raw coals that meet or exceed a certain trace metal content (see Figure A), allowing a
fuels/plant engineer to compare emission levels from plants of various design, configurations, and
operating parameters.  Other databases are available that provide analytical data on raw coal to assist
in the selection of coals meeting certain criteria; however, these databases do not provide important
details as to the performance of the coals in relationship to systems design and operating conditions.

<br><center><img src="sb12854.jpg"></center>
<p>	 Another example of the applicability of the database is in the performance evaluation of various
system devices such as boilers, electrostatic precipitators, and baghouses and their impact on trace
metal emissions.  The database makes it easy to compare the collection efficiency for trace metals
(arsenic, mercury, and selenium in this example) of a baghouse in one plant against that of a baghouse
in another plant (see Figure B).


<p>	The database resides on a UNIX workstation at the EERC that is accessed via a graphical user
interface on personal computers.  With security codes and software issued by the EERC and an
Internet service provider in place, the database can be accessed externally through the Internet.

<h2>DOE Addresses Industry Needs Regarding Air Toxic Issues</h2>
</center><hr>
Chuck Schmidt, Program Coordinator, and Tom Brown, Subprogram Manager, at the Department
of Energy (DOE) Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center (PETC), were asked to comment on current
and future issues facing industry regarding hazardous air pollutants (HAPs).


<p>	Schmidt and Brown define the main objectives of the DOE Air Toxics Program as follows:

<ul>
<li>To develop information to guide future research efforts.
<p>
<li>To acquire accurate data for the EPA Utility HAPs Study.
<p>
<li>To develop cost-effective technologies for compliance with CAAA provisions.
<p>
<li>To direct research efforts that meet the needs of industry.
</ul>
<p>	EPA relies on DOE and EPRI air toxic data, and accordingly, DOE coordinates with EPA to
assist industry in responding to Title III of the CAAA by facilitating the transfer of needed
information on HAP emissions and the effectiveness of current and emerging technologies designed
to control criteria pollutants and fine particulate.


<p>	With regard to electric utilities, EPA has indicated that a regulatory determination will be
provided to Congress by December 1996.  Depending on the specific HAPs and the degree of control
required, this mandate could have significant impact on the coal and electric utility industries:  $2 to
$12 billion annually, according to EPRI projections. 


<p>	Technologies being investigated by DOE include the development of carbon-based and other
novel sorbents.  In addition, innovative techniques to remove mercury across wet flue gas
desulfurization (FGD) systems are being explored.  Various metal catalysts and fly ashes have the
potential to convert elemental mercury to an oxidized form, allowing an increase in mercury capture
across wet FGD systems.  A considerable amount of laboratory testing has shown excellent results
to date with certain catalysts and fly ashes. 


<p>	Results of the Phase I DOE field study of power plant emissions indicate that nine of the eleven
trace elements listed on the CAAA HAPs list are controlled from 95% to 99.9% by conventional and
advanced pollution control devices presently used in the utility industry. 


<p>	Several conclusions were drawn from the Phase I DOE study: 
<ul>

<li>Nine of the eleven trace elements and compounds of these elements, as mentioned above,
are emitted in very low levels due to their association with the particulate phase of the flue
gas.
<p>

<li>Volatile and semivolatile organics (including chlorinated dioxins and furans) and aldehydes
and ketones were determined to be near or below the detection limits of the sampling and
analytical equipment used. 
<p>

<li>Radionuclides, because they are associated with the particulate phase, are effectively
controlled by particulate control devices. 
<p>
<li>HF and HCl are effectively removed when either a dry or wet FGD system is utilized;
without FGD, little removal is indicated for either HAP.  Although these two HAPs are
emitted in the largest quantities, their associated risk is considered by EPA to be very small.
<p>
<li>Removals for mercury vary from less than 5% to 60% and for selenium from less than 5%
to 99%. 


<br>
<li>Mercury (elemental and speciated) and specific trace elements must be investigated further
in Phase II. 
</ul>

<p>	While Schmidt and Brown do not anticipate regulations for the majority of trace elements, there
is one exception--mercury.  Schmidt suggests that additional research be done on specific issues
related to mercury deposition and subsequent methylation and bioaccumulation in fish.  Methods must
be developed to measure mercury accurately and continuously while focusing on measuring all forms
of mercury.


<p>	While Brown expresses confidence in the accuracy of total mercury measurements taken across
pollution control devices using EPA Method 29 and sometimes other methods, he says, "The mercury
speciation data collected to date are inconsistent, owing to difficulties in measuring the forms of
mercury in coal-fired flue gas.  Mercury sampling methods must be rigorously tested and validated
under a variety of utility flue gas conditions in order to measure both total elemental and total
speciated form(s) of mercury."


<p>	The DOE Office of Fossil Energy is conducting strategic planning involving the Morgantown
and Pittsburgh Energy Technology Centers and DOE Headquarters to determine federal research
priorities for the next 15-20 years.  For environmental control technologies, Schmidt and Brown feel
that mercury will remain an issue.  "And that forms the basis for some of our planning," Schmidt
states, "to deal with mercury control issues."  Additionally, fine particulate control may also be an
issue in the future, with EPA looking at a possible PM2.5 standard to replace the present PM10. 


<p>	The next issue of the <em>CATM Newsletter </em>will feature an article on the future direction of DOE's
air toxic programs.

<h2>CATM Communiqu&eacute</h2></center>
<hr>

<p>Two University of North Dakota professors have received CATM grants of $1500 each for
environmental enhancement of existing courses and curricula during the 1996-97 academic year.  Dr.
Theron Nelson of UND's Department of Finance was awarded funds to help establish an
Environmental Issues minor for students throughout the College of Business and Public
Administration.  Dr. Douglas Ludlow of the Department of Chemical Engineering will use the grant
funds to incorporate pollution prevention and remediation issues into a freshman-level chemical
engineering course.  Both of these programs are expected to reach a large number of undergraduate
students.


<p>The EERC has also been active in environmental education for K-12 students.  A "Kids' Booth" has
been designed and made its debut at the "Marketplace for Kids" held in Jamestown, North Dakota,
on May 3, 1996.  Targeted at 4th, 5th, and 6th graders from throughout North Dakota, Marketplace
provided an opportunity to share innovative ideas related to economic development.  The EERC
exhibit included demonstrations of groundwater hydrology, coal ash utilization, and trace metal
chemistry.  The EERC Kids' Booth focuses on alternative fuels, renewable energy sources, and
innovative technologies for environmental cleanup.  Plans are to incorporate the booth into the tours
given to the hundreds of schoolchildren who visit the EERC each year.


<p>CATM's Environmental Education Committee conducted its third annual waste audit in February. 
Thirteen volunteers sorted 210 pounds of material, representing 2 days' worth of EERC trash.  The
amount of garbage produced on a per-person basis has decreased by 50% since the first waste audit
in December 1993, reflecting the success of EERC's greatly expanded in-house recycling program.<p>

<h2>EERC's New Mercury Laboratory Supports Multiple Projects</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>An EERC laboratory was recently renovated and turned into a hub of activity for Hg research.  The
laboratory has the capability to provide precise mixtures of flue gas containing carbon monoxide,
sulfur dioxide, sulfur trioxide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen chloride, chlorine, and
hydrogen fluoride.  However, even more critical is the ability to provide exact levels of trace Hg
species either as elemental metallic Hg vapor or in an oxidized form such as mercuric chloride. 
Mercury concentrations as low as 1 g/m<sup>3</sup> (which is about 0.1 part per billion) to over 100 g/m<sup>3</sup> can
be delivered to a variety of reactors or process streams to evaluate various aspects of Hg behavior.

<p>	The lab is ideally equipped to evaluate promising methods for continuous measurement of total
and speciated Hg.  To date, four different types of Hg analyzers have been extensively evaluated
along with several configurations of sample pretreatment to facilitate Hg speciation.  At low Hg
concentrations in the range from 1 to 20 g/m<sup>3</sup>, continuous measurement is challenging because this
is near the detection limit for the conventional analytical approach using atomic absorption at 253.7
nm.  Sample constituents such as SO<sub>2</sub> cause significant interference at this wavelength, so the
offending gas must either be removed before analysis or the instrument must have interference compensation capability.  The lab has proven to be invaluable in quantifying the level of interference
caused by individual gases or complex mixtures of gases and assessing whether instrument interference compensation is adequate.  Currently, the lab is equipped with three continuous Hg analyzers
with pretreatment capability to measure both total and speciated Hg.

<p>	A second area of research supported by the Hg lab is the evaluation and development of standard
methods for Hg speciation measurement (see related article on front page).  A number of key interference effects have been identified through a systematic approach to evaluate the effects of various
flue gas constituents on these methods.  Many of these effects, including several two-factor
interactions, would not have been detected by sampling combustion flue gases, but were verified only
after completing test matrices designed to identify and quantify effects with a known level of
precision.

<p>	A third area of Hg research supported by the lab is the evaluation and development of Hg control
methods.  Activated carbon works well for Hg control at low temperatures and for streams with a
high Hg content.  However, a goal of the work is to identify sorbents that could capture Hg from
coal-fired boilers where the Hg concentration is low, typically in the range from 5 to 10 g/m<sup>3</sup>. 
Ideally, the sorbents should also be effective at baghouse or electrostatic precipitator temperatures
ranging from 275 to 350F.

<p>	The laboratory has the capability to measure Hg capture by three different methods.  In the first
case, a microvial of carbon is exposed to a high concentration of Hg under carefully controlled conditions of temperature and flue gas constituents.  The carbon sample is subsequently analyzed for Hg
to determine total Hg capacity.  A second level of screening consists of establishing breakthrough
curves for a thin fixed bed of powdered sorbent exposed to simulated flue gas.  Using this approach,
Hg is measured continuously with an analyzer at the outlet of the sorbent bed to establish times for
initial and 100% breakthrough.  A third level of sorbent screening is conducted with a bench-scale
continuous injection reactor designed to simulate Hg capture with sorbents in a baghouse.  The
EERC Hg laboratory is available as an independent source to evaluate commercially available or
newly developed sorbents.

<title>Update</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Update on Status of EPA "Reports to Congress"</h2>

</center>
<p>	The EPA report on risk from mercury air emissions will be delayed for one or two more years,
according to EPA officials.  The mercury report, mandated under the Clean Air Act Amendments of
1990, will include the emission rate, health impacts, and control technologies for sources of mercury
air emissions.  EPA is now expected to send the draft report to the EPA Science Advisory Board and
a Food and Drug Administration panel for review and will await release of other mercury studies. 


<p>	The EPA Utility HAP Study, a related congressional report that outlines a regulatory strategy
for a range of toxic emissions from electric utilities (including mercury), is currently under a court-ordered deadline to be issued as an interim report on June 28.  However, with unresolved issues
pertaining to mercury, EPA is having discussions with various parties to release the Utility Report
at the same time as the Mercury Air Toxics Report is sent to Congress.

<title>Mercury Speciation Measurment</title>
</head>
<center>
<img src="../../gif/catm.gif">
<h2>Mercury Speciation Measurement Project Continuing at the EERC</h2>
<hr></center>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) have
contracted with the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC) to evaluate EPA Method 29
and other Hg sampling methods for their ability to speciate Hg.  Results from these tests showed that
when elemental mercury (Hg<sup>0</sup>) was injected into the flue gas duct of a pilot-scale combustor firing
a bituminous coal, there appeared to be at least a partial conversion of the spiked Hg<sup>0</sup> to other Hg
species.  The question still remains whether the conversion of Hg<sup>0</sup> is occurring in the flue gas stream
or in the traps of the sampling methods.  Based on these observations, more fundamental bench-scale
studies were initiated to determine what flue gas components influence Hg speciation for the different
sampling methods.

<p><em><strong>Pilot-Scale Results</em></strong>

To date, four different Hg sampling methods have been tested for their ability to speciate.  In
addition to EPA Method 29, these methods include the Ontario Hydro method developed by Keith
Curtis, an acetate buffer method developed by Radian Corp., and the Mercury Speciation Adsorption
(MESA) method developed by Frontier Geosciences.


<p>	For EPA Method 29, the conversion of the injected Hg<sup>0</sup>, measured as "oxidized" Hg, is clearly
shown in the accompanying diagram.  Other methods had similar observations, with the exception
of the MESA method, which indicated a higher percentage of Hg as "oxidized" than the other
methods.

<br><br>
<p><em><strong>Bench-Scale Results</em></strong>

<p>	EPRI, DOE, and the Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) established a bench-scale test
program designed to address some of the questions that were raised during the pilot-scale tests. 
Elemental mercury was added to a simulated flue gas that had the same approximate concentrations
of major gases (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and N<sub>2</sub>) as in the previous pilot-scale tests.  Additional gases (SO<sub>2</sub>,
Cl<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>x</sub>, HCl, Hg<sup>0</sup>, or HgCl<sub>2</sub>) were evaluated as part of a full-factorial design to answer the
questions:  "Why are the MESA results different from the other methods?" and "What flue gas
components affect the speciation ability of the MESA method and EPA Method 29?"  Results from
the statistical analyses of the bench-scale tests show that the addition of SO<sub>2</sub> (1500 ppm) and Cl<sub>2</sub> (10
ppm) result in a portion of the injected Hg<sup>0</sup> being measured as "oxidized" Hg by EPA Method 29.
However, HCl does not appear to affect the speciation ability of EPA Method 29.


<p>	The statistical results for the MESA bench-scale tests indicate that the addition of SO<sub>2</sub> and HCl
and Cl<sub>2</sub> does not appear to significantly affect the ability of the MESA method to speciate Hg. 
However, NO<sub>x</sub> in the presence of SO<sub>2</sub> has a significant effect.  In this case, over 95% of the injected
Hg<sup>0</sup> was measured as Hg<sup>+2</sup>.  This may help to explain why the MESA method resulted in higher levels
of "oxidized" mercury in the pilot-scale tests as compared to EPA Method 29.


<p><em><strong>Preliminary Observations</em></strong><br>
<center><img src="dl12851.jpg"></center>

<p>	A substantial portion of spiked Hg<sup>0</sup> collects in the peroxide impingers of EPA Method 29 for
both the bituminous and subbituminous coals that were fired in the combustor.  However, it is still
unknown whether Hg<sup>0</sup> converts in the flue gas or in the sampling solutions of EPA Method 29.


<p>	Good Hg speciation agreement exists among the different methods, with the exception of the
MESA method, which measured a higher Hg<sup>+2</sup> to Hg<sup>0</sup> ratio than the other methods tested.


<p>	For all of the methods, the ratio of Hg<sup>+2</sup> to total measured vapor mercury was observed to be
the same whether or not Hg<sup>0</sup> was spiked into the flue gas.


<p>	For EPA Method 29, the addition of SO<sub>2</sub> (&gt;1500 ppm) results in a portion (10%-20%) of the
Hg<sup>0</sup> being measured as "oxidized" Hg.  Although HCl has no effect, the addition of 10 ppm Cl<sub>2</sub>
results in up to 50% of the Hg<sup>0</sup> being collected in the peroxide solution.


<p>	Although it does not appear that Hg speciation by the MESA method is greatly affected by SO<sub>2</sub>,
HCl, or Cl<sub>2</sub>, there is a major effect due to NO<sub>x</sub> when SO<sub>2</sub> is present. 


<p><em><strong>Future Efforts</em></strong>

<p>	The focus of the project will continue to be determining what Hg sampling methods, if any, can
be used to speciate Hg.  Future Hg measurement tests will be supplemented with the aid of
continuous-emission Hg instruments.  Work is currently being conducted at the EERC to incorporate
total Hg emission monitors into both bench- and pilot-scale testing.

Mr. McCabe recently came to CERT from Bechtel Petroleum Operations, Inc., where he was a production engineer for the Elk Hills Oil Field in Bakersfield, California.  Although the majority of Mr. McCabes accomplishments point to his technical competence in the oil and gas fields, Mr. McCabes interest and understanding of the economic impacts on natural resource development and marketing has brought him to be a part of CERT as Director of the CERT Natural Gas Marketing Program.  Mr. McCabes keen interest in gas marketing contracts between the US Department of Energy and local buyers make him an asset to the technical base which CERT provides to its 57 member Tribes.  Mr. McCabe is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

          <B><H3> EERC Helps Venezuelan Refinery Recover Valuable Element</H3></B>
<P>
GRAND FORKS, N.D. -- The University of North Dakota's Energy & Environmental Research
Center (EERC) is assisting a Venezuelan oil refinery in recovering vanadium, a valuable element
found in unusually high concentrations in the crude petroleum of northern South America.
<P>    The Center began working in September with the Lagoven Amuay Refinery in Judibana,
Venezuela, one of the world's largest refineries.  Currently, the refinery produces petroleum coke 
a solid material with a relatively high sulfur content and high heating value as a by-product during
the refining process.  
<P>    Three-fourths of the ash produced when the coke is burned is composed of vanadium which,
in the form of vanadium pentoxide, is a highly reactive element.  Because vanadium is more valuable
than the coke, the refinery plans to burn the coke in specially designed boilers, then capture the ash
in a "baghouse," a system that uses fabric bags to filter the ash out of the exhaust gases produced
when the coke is burned.  The heat generated in the boilers will be used to create steam for the
refining process.
<P>    The refinery plans to recover the vanadium from the ash and market it worldwide.  Vanadium
is used in rust-resistant high-speed tools, as an alloy to improve steel's strength, hardness and
temperature stability, and as a commercial catalyst because of its reactive nature.  The utility
industry uses vanadium as a catalyst in power plant air pollution control systems.
<P> Tests conducted in the EERC's combustion pilot plant facilities showed that the high
vanadium content of the ash causes a reaction resulting in the formation of SO3, a highly corrosive
acid gas.  Jay Gunderson, an EERC research engineer and the project's principal investigator, said
that researchers observed high concentrations of SO3 when the petroleum coke was burned.
<P>    "SO3 produces sulfuric acid in the presence of moisture," Gunderson said.  "There was
concern that this would condense on and corrode metal components in the baghouse.  The presence
of acid in the exhaust gas and on ash particles would also affect the integrity of the ductwork and
ash-handling systems."
<P>    The EERC's role in the project was to study the formation of SO3 in the combustion system
and baghouse and then develop a way to alleviate its damaging effect.  Gunderson said that by using
a dry calcium sorbent to coat the fabric filters in the baghouse, researchers found they could greatly
reduce the SO3 concentration in the flue gas.

	Mr. Shields was elected Chairman of CERT in 1994 and Chairman of  Fort Peck Indian Reservation in 1991.  He has also served consecutive two-year terms on the Fort Peck Tribal Executive Board since 1975.    He spent six years in the Navy as an Interior Communications Electrician, and with the Navy Sea-Bees.  He attended the Western College of Engineering in Los Angeles.  Mr. Shields worked for Vanguard Electronics, an aerospace firm, and was Operations Manager there before his return to Montana in 1974.
	<p>Over the years, Mr. Shields involvement with political issues has brought to the forefront concerns between Tribes, states, and the federal government.  In 1985, for instance, he was chief negotiator for his Tribe in a water rights dispute that resulted in the Montana-Fort Peck Water Compact.  Fort Peck now receives the largest water quantification in the United States -- one million acre-feet of water annually.  Mr. Shields actively articulates state and federal issues concerning American Indians and has testified in both forums.
<p>	Chairman Shields has long demonstrated an unwavering commitment to improving the health of Indian people. In 1994, he received a distinguished award from Dr. Everett Rhoades, the previous Director of the Indian Health Service, for his contribution to the health care of American Indians.  He was recently nominated to the National Indian Health Design Team and has been appointed by the Governor to serve on the Montana Consensus Council.
	<p>In his leadership roles, Mr. Shields believes that partnerships with industry, state and federal governments are crucial to support Tribal self-determination.

<HR SIZE=1>
<H2><B> What's News at the EERC?</B></H2>
<P> 
<HR SIZE =1> 
<H4>  An update on Energy & Environmental Research Center projects and activities</H4> 
<HR SIZE =1> 
<H3>  EERC provides examples of how university research benefits communities</H3>
 <P>
           Practical, market-driven university research can be a springboard for creating jobs and economic
 growth within North Dakota communities. University research can also help these communities deal
 effectively with the energy and environmental issues they face.
 <P>
           Those messages were conveyed by Michael Jones, EERC associate director, during two workshops he
 conducted at Marketplace '95 earlier this month in Bismarck, ND Jones' workshops were entitled, "Case
 History: High Tech Jobs from University Research" and "Garbage Stew: Fuel for the Future?"
<P> 
           Jones discussed the EERC's success at using research and technology developed by the Center's staff
 to spur the growth of small businesses that create jobs and economic growth in the surrounding region.
 "Higher education looks at the EERC as a prototype of what universities should be doing," Jones says. "We
 are the incubator that enables small businesses to hatch."
<P> 
           To emphasize this point, Jones was joined by Steven Benson, president of Microbeam Technologies
 Inc. (MTI), one of eight business groups that has sprung from EERC research and technologies. MTI uses a
 scanning electron microscope and analytical techniques developed at the EERC to analyze coal and ash
 samples for utilities and government agencies.
<P> 
           "The EERC isn't interested in doing routine work," Jones says. "As soon as we develop a technology
 or process to the point where it becomes routine, we want it commercialized. Our goal is to move research
 from the laboratory into the marketplace where it can benefit society and create high-tech jobs."
 <P>
           In his "garbage stew" workshop, Jones discussed a process the EERC is developing with EnerTech
 Inc., a small company in Atlanta, Ga., that turns municipal solid waste into a clean-burning liquid fuel. The
 Center is currently working with Grand Forks city officials on the possibility of conducting a demonstration
 project that will assist the city in solving its landfill problem.
 <P>
           US Senator Kent Conrad and North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner Sarah Vogel are the
 organizing sponsors of Marketplace '95, which is in its sixth year. The conference is aimed at boosting
 economic development in North Dakota by providing an opportunity for entrepreneurs, inventors and
 businesses to exchange ideas and share information.

 <H3>EERC research associate awarded Penn State fellowship</H3>
 
           Bruce Folkedahl, an EERC research associate in materials science engineering, has been awarded the
 Russinko Graduate Fellowship, receiving first place of the three awards issued by Pennsylvania State
 University. The fellowship recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in materials science and
 engineering.
 <P>
           With the EERC's support, Folkedahd is currently pursuing his doctorate degree in materials science
 and engineering at Penn State. He is the third EERC researcher to study there for a Ph.D. Past participants
 include Steve Benson, deputy associate director, in 1983, and John Hurley, senior research manager, in 1986.
 The program provides a stipend and paid tuition. Folkedahl is expected to return to the EERC within the next
 year and a half after he completes his studies.

<H3>EERC hosts Project Learning Tree environmental education workshop</H3>

           More than 30 teachers, youth group leaders and natural resource professionals from North Dakota
attended a workshop Jan. 20-21 at the EERC as part of Project Learning Tree, a nationwide environmental
education program. Karen Katrinak, EERC research associate and chair of the Center's Environmental
Education Committee, arranged for the workshop to be held at the EERC and took part in the activities.
<P>
           "The workshop provided an opportunity for the EERC to become more active in community outreach
programs involving environmental education," said Katrinak. "It's a good way for the Center to coordinate its
environmental education efforts with outside organizations. It also provides an opportunity for professionals
from a variety of backgrounds to become acquainted with resources available at the EERC."
<P>
           Workshop participants were encouraged to approach learning and teaching from an environmental
perspective. The agenda included activities showing the limitations of the earth's resources, the cost of
extracting those resources and other interactive approaches to environmental education.
<P>
           Introduced in the early 1970s, Project Learning Tree is recognized as one of the premier
environmental education programs in the nation. It is active in all 50 states, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Sweden
and Finland. North Dakota's program is funded by the North Dakota Forest Service, the North Dakota
Society of American Foresters and the North Dakota Association of Soil Conservation Districts.

<H3>American Coal Ash Association representatives visit EERC</H3>

           Top executives of the American Coal Ash Association (ACAA) in Alexandria, Va., visited the EERC
last month to review drafts of two EERC studies on the use of fly ash, a by-product produced by coal-fired
power plants. ACAA Executive Director Sam Tyson and Technical Director Tom Blackstone were briefed by
EERC research associates Debra Pflughoeft-Hassett and Kurt Eylands on their research involving fly ash
utilization for waste stabilization and solidification and sulfate-resistant fly ash concrete.
<P>
           Fly ash can be used as an additive in concrete to increase durability. It's also a versatile engineering
material that can be used in road building, general construction, agriculture, mine reclamation, land
development, mining applications and as a filler in composite materials. Information on the use and potential
application of fly ash is limited and sometimes contains conflicting data. The ACAA hopes to use the EERC
studies to facilitate the marketing of coal ash for current and developing applications.
<P>

<H3>Industrial development group recognizes EERC publication</H3>

           An EERC publication received two awards in the 1994 Annual Development Awards Competition
sponsored by the North Dakota Industrial Development Association. The competition's purpose is to
recognize the quality of materials used by economic development organizations in promoting North Dakota
communities. The EERC's Center for Air Toxic Metals brochure was entered in the potpourri category. The
brochure was awarded "Best of Class" in the category for targeted industry material and also received an
overall "Best of Show" special award. The brochure was designed and produced by the EERC's Graphics
Department and the Center for Air Toxic Metals staff.

<b>Events Highlight Anticipated Clean Cities Designation for Red River Valley</b>
<p>
GRAND FORKS, N.D.   The Red River Valley region will soon receive the U.S. Department of
Energy's (DOE) Clean Cities designation.<p>
    Extending south from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, southward along Interstate 29 through
Grand Forks to the cities of Fargo, N.D., and Moorhead, Minn., the Red River Valley Clean Cities
region will be one of the first to span international borders.  There are currently 48 official Clean
Cities areas in the United States.  <p>
    The DOE Clean Cities designation will recognize the region's efforts   led by the University
of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC)   to maintain its clean air and
reduce dependence on Middle East oil through the use of vehicles powered by alternative fuels such as
ethanol, compressed natural gas, propane and electricity.  Beginning Sept. 19 in Winnipeg, the Red
River Valley Clean Cities Program will hold a series of events to highlight its efforts.<p>
    "Within the Red River Valley, this program has attracted businesses and government agencies
interested in converting the vehicle fleets they operate to run on alternative fuels," says Tim Gerlach,
an EERC research associate who coordinates the Red River Valley Clean Cities coalition.  "Another
important goal is to make alternative fuel vehicles attractive to the public by expanding distribution
sites for these types of fuels."
                                (MORE)         
    Invited guests and the 21 business and government stakeholder members of the Red River
Valley Clean Cities coalition will meet in Winnipeg on Sept. 19.  Participating in the meeting will be
Canadian Senator Mira Spizak, cosponsor of a bill that mandates the conversion of federal vehicle
fleets to alternative fuels.  Several alternative fuel vehicles will be displayed and demonstrated.<p>
    During the Manitoba meeting, a traveling scrapbook will begin a journey that ends Nov.21 in
Monterrey, Mexico.  Following a route known as the NAFTA (North American Free Trade
Agreement) Superhighway, the scrapbook will be transported by vehicles powered with alternative
fuels.  Along the route, Clean Cities participants are invited to add to the book, which will be
presented to Monterrey Mayor Jesus Hinojosa Tijerina and Benjamin Clariond Reyes Retana,
governor of Nuevo Leon, Mexico, and displayed at Border Energy Forum III in Monterrey as part of
an alternative fuels exposition.  <p>
    The scrapbook will cross the border from Canada into the United States on Sept. 24.  An 
11 a.m. ceremony will be held at the border with Mayor Wayne Arseny of Emerson, Manitoba, and
Mayor Hetty Walker of Pembina, N.D.  From there, the book will travel to Suburban Propane's
refueling site in Grand Forks and then to the dedication of North Dakota's first public refueling site
for E85 (85 percent ethanol) vehicles.  The 3 p.m. ceremony will take place at the Stamart store
located at the intersection of Interstate 29 and Highway 2.<p>
    On Sept. 26, representatives of the EERC and the North Dakota Office of Intergovernmental
Assistance will deliver the scrapbook to the Fargo Moorhead area using a flexible fuel Ford Taurus
powered by E85.  The book will be taken through South Dakota by Tri-State Corn Processors,
Rosholt, S.D., and the American Coalition for Ethanol.  The EERC is coordinating the scrapbook trip
from Winnipeg to Nebraska, and the Texas General Land Office is handling the arrangements from
Nebraska to Mexico.<p>

<b> High Level Environmental Protection Agency Official To Visit EERC Thursday</b><p>

GRAND FORKS, N.D.   Dr. Robert J. Huggett, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) assistant administrator for research and development, will be in Grand Forks on Thursday to visit the University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC).<p>
    Huggett, an assistant to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, was nominated to his post by President Bill Clinton in May 1994 and is responsible for EPA's national network of research laboratories.  Accompanying Huggett on his visit to the EERC will be U.S. Senator Kent Conrad.<p>
    The EERC currently has a number of active projects funded by EPA, including the Center for Air Toxic Metals, a partnership effort involving private industry, federal government agencies and research organizations.  This program develops analytical techniques to measure power plant hazardous air pollutants, such as mercury and lead, and the technologies to capture these pollutants.  In addition, the EPA partially funded the low temperature plasma soil cleanup technology developed by the EERC and currently being developed for commercial applications by AGSCO, Inc., of Grand Forks.<p>
    Before joining EPA, Huggett was chairman of the Department of Environmental Sciences at the Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences at the College of William and Mary.  He has 23 years of research experience in ecosystem management and environmental chemistry.  He specializes in research involving the transport, fate and effect of toxic chemicals in water resources.  His research includes the use of biological markers to detect environmental stress and assess risks.<p>

    "Water is the critical issue facing the world, and Dr. Huggett is well known and respected in the research community for his work on the contamination of water resources," says EERC Director Gerald Groenwold.  "We will emphasize the EERC's cutting edge research in water resource assessment and analysis, as well as innovative technologies developed here in partnership with government and industry to clean up contamination and prevent pollution."<p>
    Huggett will arrive at the EERC for a 9:30 a.m. meeting with Conrad and members of the EERC's management team.  Following a tour of the EERC's facilities from 10:30 a.m. to 11:45 a.m., a news conference will be held.  After lunch, Huggett will visit additional EERC labs and facilities.  <p>
    Other EPA-funded projects at the EERC include pollution control technologies for coal-fired power plants; the development of mercury analysis methods for power plant emissions; database modeling of hazardous air pollutants; analytical techniques for measuring contaminants in air, soil and water; the thermal recycling of plastics; and environmental education courses.<p>
    "This is a significant opportunity to highlight the EERC as a model for developing partnerships between government, industry and the research community," says Groenewold.  "The EERC has evolved from a regional federal facility that focused on low-rank coal to an internationally known center that develops, demonstrates and commercializes environmental technologies, alternative fuels and clean, efficient energy generation systems.  Our success in creating partnerships brings innovative energy and environmental technologies out of the laboratory and into the marketplace."

<b>EERC Assisting Three American Indian Tribes with Wind Energy Projects</b>
<p>
GRAND FORKS, N.D.   Two American Indian tribes in North Dakota will begin producing electricity from wind this summer, and a third will conduct a study of its wind energy resources.<p>
    Researchers from the University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) will take to the field in June to assist the three tribes with the wind energy research projects.  Work will begin on the construction of wind monitoring systems on the Turtle Mountain Chippewa, Devils Lake Sioux and Standing Rock Sioux reservations.  Also beginning will be the erection of two utility grade wind turbines, one each at the Devils Lake and Turtle Mountain reservations.<p>
    The project on the Standing Rock Reservation, located in south central North Dakota and north central South Dakota, is the third for the EERC, which is participating as a subcontractor to  Xenergy, Burlington, Mass.  Xenergy is conducting an integrated evaluation of the reservation's energy resources aimed at improving energy efficiency and evaluating potential new energy sources, such as wind.<p>
    EERC research engineer Jay Haley and representatives of the Devils Lake Sioux and Turtle Mountain Chippewa tribes last month attended windsmith training in Palm Springs, Calif.  The training was conducted by the Foras Company, which owns and operates wind farms near Palm Springs and is supplying the wind turbines purchased by the Devils Lake and Turtle Mountain tribes.  Tribal windsmiths will be responsible for operating and maintaining the turbines and gathering research data.<p>
    Haley says the turbines on the two reservations will not only supply power for tribal businesses, but also will provide the tribes with valuable experience in operating and maintaining wind turbines.  Data collected from the turbines will be used to determine the economic feasibility of building wind farms to produce electricity for the reservations.  With 36 percent of America's potential wind energy, North Dakota is sometimes referred to as "the Saudi Arabia of wind energy."<p>
    All three projects are being funded by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, Colo., under the 1992 Energy Policy Act.  They are part of a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) program coordinated by NREL to develop Native American energy resources.  As a branch of DOE, NREL is the nation's primary federal laboratory for renewable energy research and developmental testing.<p>
    The EERC is also working with the Devils Lake Sioux and Turtle Mountain Chippewa to assess their reservations' wind resources and to conduct environmental impact studies examining local wildlife populations that could be affected by wind farm development.  According to Haley, the goal is to develop wind programs for all three reservations that enable the tribes to meet their electricity needs and encourage economic development.<p>

<b>EERC Proves that University Research Doesn't Have to Increase Tuition Fees</b>
<p>
GRAND FORKS, N.D.  Federally funded university-based research can be a boon to universities rather than an activity heavily subsidized by student tuition fees.
<p>	Recent reports based on a University of Rhode Island study suggest that college students nationwide are bailing out federally funded university research programs that actually cost more than they bring in.  However, at the University of North Dakota (UND) Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC), research pays for itself and provides students with an opportunity to gain valuable experience in science and engineering.
	<p>Although many of the research projects and programs at the EERC involve some federal funding, they have no impact on UND's tuition.  In fact, the EERC pays UND approximately $700,000 annually for support services.  Furthermore, the Center's $7.6 million expansion project in 1994 added two new buildingsan environmental laboratory addition and technology demonstration facilityto the university campus, at no cost to UND or the state of North Dakota.
<p>	Most universities that pursue federal research dollars usually agree to provide the personnel to conduct research at state expense, while the federal funds are used to pay for the research itself.  As a result, professors conducting research spend less time in the classroom.  Graduate students or part time instructors are hired to help out with teaching duties.  Universities must also cover the expense of administering federal research projects and maintaining labs.  In this manner, the Rhode Island study found that many research programs actually cost universities more than they bring in and that the deficits generated are usually covered by increases in undergraduate tuition.  

<p>
	At the EERC, however, fewer than five researchers teach and the Center receives almost no direct state-appropriated funding (only $40,000 of its $22 million budget in fiscal year 1995).  In contrast to most university-based research, the EERC leverages the federal dollars it receives by forming joint venture partnerships and consortiums with business and industry.
	<p>"The bottom line," says EERC Director Gerald Groenewold, "is that we operate as a business within a university.  We have to."
<p>	To illustrate the point, Groenewold notes that 70 percent of the EERC's 170-plus contracts are with industry.  The Center, which employs 260 people, is an international leader in energy and environmental research, conducting projects for clients from throughout the United States. and the world.
<p>	The EERC became part of UND in 1983 when it was one of three energy technology centers defederalized by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).  Since then, the Center has evolved beyond its origin as a federally funded research center focused on low-rank coals to include all forms of energy, as well as technologies designed to prevent pollution and clean up contaminated soil and water.  The EERC also broadened its approach to include not only research and development, but also technology demonstration and commercialization.
	<p>The emphasis on moving technologies out of the laboratory and into the marketplace has attracted private industry dollars to the EERC.  Typically, industry funds from 50 to 60 percent of the cost of jointly sponsored research projects.  In the course of a year, about 100 university students are employed at the Center where they work closely with the researchers.
<p>	At a time when Congress is questioning why tuition rates have increased 232 percent in the past 15 yearsfaster than the cost of health carewithout corresponding improvements in the quality of education, Groenewold believes that the EERC provides a successful funding model for university-based research, a model that higher education can and should replicate.
	<p>"Students and taxpayers are the clients of universities," he says. "Higher education must evolve to provide its clients with training and education that meet society's needs."

<h3>EERC Leads Effort for Grand Forks Red River Valley Clean Cities Designation</h3>

GRAND FORKS, N.D.   Efforts to designate the Red River Valley as a Clean Cities region took a major step forward Tuesday when program participants met at the University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC).
<p>	The EERC is the regional coordinator for a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Clean Cities Program, which is aimed at improving air quality in cities by encouraging the use of clean, alternative fuels such as ethanol, natural gas, propane and electricity.  The EERC's objective is to obtain the Clean Cities designation from DOE for the Grand Forks Red River Valley Region by increasing alternative fuel use in the cities of Winnipeg, Grand Forks, East Grand Forks, Fargo and Moorhead.
<p>	Stakeholders in the Clean Cities Program include the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, Northern States Power Company, the U.S. Postal Service, the Grand Forks Air Force Base, the Grand Forks Chamber of Commerce, the North Dakota Corn Utilization Council, the North Dakota State Energy Conservation Program, the EERC and the Center's National Alternative Fuels Laboratory (NAFL).
<p>	During the Tuesday meeting, stakeholders and other interested participants discussed development of a five year plan for the region and heard a presentation by Randy Martin, Iowa Association of Municipal Utilities, who provided an overview of DOE's national program.  Other speakers included EERC Director Gerald Groenewold, John Pavlish, manager of the EERC's Development and Utilization of Alternative Fuels (DUALFUEL) Program, and Tim Gerlach, the regional Clean Cities coordinator.
<p>	Gerlach, a research associate at the EERC, says that initially, the program will focus on converting fleet vehicles to alternative fuels, but the long term goal is to develop refueling facilities at the local level that will enable the public to take advantage of alternative fuel vehicles as well.  American automakers are already planning to increase the production of alternative fuel vehicles in the next few years, he says.
<p>	On display in front of the EERC's main offices during the meeting were a Flexible Fuel Ford Taurus capable of using 85 percent ethanol, fueling equipment and a natural gas vehicle from Kraus Alternative Fuels (NG) Inc. of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and a propane powered vehicle from Suburban Propane, Grand Forks and Grafton.
<p>	Unlike other federal initiatives, the DOE's Clean Cities Program is a locally based partnership between government and industry that focuses on expanding the use of alternative transportation fuels.  By combining local decision making with the voluntary action of partners, the program uses a "grassroots" approach to develop plans at the local level for creating a sustainable, nationwide market for alternative fuels, reducing the need for imported oil.
<p>	Lonnie Laffen, chairman of the Grand Forks Chamber of Commerce, says the increased use of alternative fuels will not only improve the region's air quality, but also create new jobs and economic growth opportunities.  "New businesses considering locations in the Red River Valley region will look at the Clean Cities designation as a real plus," he says.
<p>	Doug Foy, NSP supervisor of gas operations, says, "NSP has always supported alternate fuels programs that can lead to a cleaner environment.  We continue to look at the possibility of adding  vehicles that use compressed natural gas to our fleet."

<h3>AGSCO to Commercialize EERC Soil Cleanup Technology</h3>

GRAND FORKS, N.D. - From out of the laboratory and into the marketplace, a new process that cleans soil at chemically contaminated sites provides a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution than technologies currently in use. 
<p>	The University of North Dakota (UND) Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) Foundation and AGSCO Inc. today announced an agreement that grants AGSCO a license to market the new soil decontamination system.  The announcement was made in Grand Forks, N.D., at the EERC's Technology Demonstration Facility and was attended by business and government leaders from around the state.
<p>	Development of the soil decontamination technology began at the EERC in the 1980s.  This low-cost remediation system removes organic contaminants such as pesticides, petroleum products and chemical wastes from soils without producing hazardous by-products.  Unlike high-temperature incineration processes, the EERC technology operates at low temperatures to convert organic chemical compounds into water and carbon dioxide.
	<p>AGSCO is a North Dakota-based, nationally known agricultural chemical company that sells an assortment of seed treatments, herbicides and adjuvants.  The EERC Foundation houses the Center's intellectual property and fosters the development, demonstration and commercialization of EERC-developed knowledge, discoveries and inventions. 
<p>
	The EERC is one of UND's major sources of research funding, attracting more than $22 million in fiscal year 1995 in federal, state and private contracts.  The Center, which employs 260 people, is an international leader in energy and environmental research, conducting projects for clients from throughout the U.S. and the world.
<p>	AGSCO has created a new division called EnBDyn (pronounced enBdine) to market the remediation technology, which uses a lowBtemperature plasma process and is currently being patented.  EnBDyn has exclusive rights to use the process to clean up sites contaminated by agricultural chemicals and other substances.  
<p>	Typically, soil from contaminated sites is dug up and shipped to hazardous waste facilities for storageCexpensive and unsatisfactory in the long term.  The low-temperature plasma reactor can be mounted on a truck or trailer and driven to the contaminated site where the soil is then cleaned.    Unlike incineration or other high-temperature processes, low-temperature plasma does not alter inorganic soil properties.  The resulting clean, inorganic material can be mixed with organic matter such as soil, manure or sewage sludge to restore the material to its original fertility.
<p>	A team of researchers led by John Rindt, an EERC research manager, initiated development of the decontamination process with in-house EERC funding.  The Center was later awarded a grant by NASA to study purification of waste in space capsules using plasma technology.  Further support for the project has been provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency.  
<p>	The impetus for the AGSCO-EERC partnership began about four years ago when Bruce Gjovig, director of the UND Center for Innovation and Business Development, suggested to Russ Brown, chief executive officer of AGSCO, that his company take a look at some of the technologies being developed by the EERC.  
	<p>Brown says the soil cleanup technology was an excellent fit for AGSCO.  "We recognized that there are numerous sites around the world where soil was contaminated and that they would have to be cleaned up," he explains.
<p>	EERC Director Gerald Groenewold says that AGSCO was a logical choice.  "We found a quality partner to commercialize a quality product.  We were pleased that the partner was right here in Grand Forks."  
	<p>Brown notes that taking contaminated soil somewhere else to be stored doesn't make sense, and air emissions from incineration create additional environmental problems.  "Because AGSCO is an agricultural chemical manufacturer, we can bring some sensitivity and economic sanity to the process," he says.  "The EERC's cleanup technology provides an avenue for the agricultural chemical industry to start developing good remediation programs."
	<p>Brown says AGSCO will initially focus on providing its service to the agricultural chemical industry, but will eventually branch out to clean up contaminated sites for the petroleum and munitions industries, among others.  Brown plans to have AGSCO manufacture the low-temperature plasma systems at its Grand Forks plant and mount them on a fleet of trucks.
<p>	"The EERC-AGSCO partnership and the commercialization of an innovative new cleanup process provides a perfect example of how new wealth and job opportunities can be created from spin-off technologies developed at the EERC," Groenewold says.

<b>EERC Freeze-Thaw Evaporation Process Could Make Salty Water Useful</b>
<p>
GRAND FORKS, N.D. - Two things that northeastern North Dakota has in abundance -- cold weather and brackish (salty) water -- could be a key to meeting the area's water needs and creating opportunities for economic growth.<p>
	Using a process called freeze-thaw evaporation (FTE), salty water in marshy areas west of Grand Forks, N.D., could be transformed economically into high-quality water that's usable for drinking, irrigation or agricultural processing.  The process relies on evaporation in warm weather and ice crystallization in below-freezing temperatures to separate salts, organic material and other contaminants from brackish water to make it a source of potable water.  As opposed to other biologically based methods that remove organics from contaminated water, the FTE process also removes salts, the primary problematic contaminants in the brackish water.<p>
	John Harju, a senior research manager at the University of North Dakota Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC), says one of the most efficient and reliable methods of water purification is crystallization, which produces a high-purity chemical solid from an impure solution.  "Natural subfreezing temperatures occur over significant periods of time throughout vast areas of North America, which indicates that this process could be used under natural conditions to produce quality water from contaminated sources in an extremely economic manner," he says.<p>  
	Joint development of the FTE process was begun in 1992 by researchers at the EERC and John Boysen, president of B.C. Technologies, Laramie, Wyo., with the support of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Gas Research Institute (GRI), Chicago.<p>
	Although the initial research focused on the application of the technology to help reduce the cost of disposing of brackish water produced during oil and gas industry operations, it also has the potential to turn naturally salty groundwater and surface water into large quantities of high-quality water.  In the Red River drainage basin, covering parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Manitoba, lack of freshwater threatens to limit population growth and economic development.<p>
	Beginning this winter in northern New Mexico, an $800,000 project will be conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the FTE technology on oil and gas industry produced waters (brines).  The project will take place at existing Amoco facilities and will be jointly conducted by the EERC, B.C. Technologies and Amoco.  Funding for the 17-month project is being provided by DOE, GRI and Amoco.<p>
	The EERC and the city of Grand Forks are also conducting a joint project funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on using the FTE process to produce potable water from the Dakota Aquifer which feeds a marshy area west of the city. <p> The city of Grand Forks is providing $25,000 for the project, which is being matched by $25,000 from the Bureau of Reclamation.

<b> Control of Mercury Emissions from Coal-Fired Power Plants Studied</b>
<P>
GRAND FORKS, N.D. --  Modifications to pollution control equipment
currently installed on U.S. coal-fired power plants have the potential
to capture mercury, preventing its emission to the atmosphere,
according to researchers at the University of North Dakota's Energy
&amp; Environmental  Research Center (EERC).
<P>
&quot;The ability to remove mercury from power plant flue gas
emissions is important because the Clean Air Act Amendments passed
in 1990 require the Environmental Protection Agency to assess
the health risks associated with these emissions,&quot; says Stanley
Miller, EERC senior research manager.  &quot;The EPA report to
Congress is due in early 1996 and will help determine whether
U.S. utilities will be required to reduce mercury emissions from
their coal-burning power plants.&quot;
<P>
In the United States, coal-fired power plants are required to
have pollution control equipment that removes fly ash from their
stack emissions.  This ash is a very fine, powdery mineral material
produced during coal combustion.  Most plants use either a baghouse
to filter out the ash or electrostatic precipitators to capture
charged ash particles on grounded metal plates.
<P>
One approach for mercury removal, which Miller says could be relatively
straightforward to retrofit on power plants, is to inject activated
carbon into the flue gas before it enters the plant's particulate
control system.  In a research project funded by the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI), Palo Alto, Calif., and the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE), three types of coal and two types
of activated carbon were tested in the EERC's combustion pilot
plant facility.
<P>
Coal used for the research project included subbituminous from
two mines in Wyoming and bituminous from Pennsylvania.  Two types
of activated carbon were also tested.  One was made from lignite
coal and the other was made from activated carbon impregnated with iodine.
 To simulate operating conditions in a power plant, researchers
used a pilot-scale, pulverized coal combustor equipped with a
baghouse.   
<P>
Test results showed that the lignite-based activated carbon did
well in removing mercury from all three coal types when temperatures
in the baghouse were at 250 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.  Under
these conditions, 80 percent or more of the mercury was removed
from the combustor's flue gas.  However, its effectiveness fell
off sharply at higher temperatures.  The iodine-impregnated activated
carbon removed 80 percent or more mercury when temperatures in
the baghouse were between 300 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit with
one subbituminous coal.  The carbon was ineffective in this temperature
range with the bituminous coal and a second type of subbituminous
coal, demonstrating that control strategy is coal dependent.
<P>
Miller notes that many questions concerning the optimization of
the process must be answered before the technology is commercialized
for widespread use.  Development work is continuing at the EERC,
he says.
<P>
The results of this research are available in a paper entitled
&quot;Pilot-Scale Investigation of Mercury Control in Baghouses&quot;
which was prepared by Miller, Dennis Laudal and Grant Dunham of
the EERC; Ramsay Chang of EPRI; and Perry Bergman of DOE's Pittsburgh
Energy Technology Center (PETC).  The paper was presented by Miller
at the EPRI/DOE International Conference on Managing Hazardous
and Particulate Air Pollutants in Toronto, Ontario.

<B>Riparian Zone Workshop Focuses on Natural Water Pollution Prevention</B>
<P>
GRAND FORKS, N.D.  The establishment of riparian zonesareas of trees, shrubs and vegetation that line the banks of streams and riversis
 one of the best methods for preventing surface water and groundwater pollution.<P>
	To assist in the restoration of riparian zones in the Red River basin, a workshop will be held Oct. 3 4 at the University of North 
Dakota (UND), Grand Forks.  Participants will be updated on the Red River Basin Riparian Demonstration project which is aimed at 
restoring riparian areas and improving surface water and groundwater in eastern North Dakota.<P>
	"Riparian zones are vital because they provide natural buffers that reduce the amount of contaminants and soil sediments 
flowing into waterways," says Linda Kingery, riparian project coordinator for the Red River Regional Planning Council.  "They also 
provide bank stabilization and wildlife habitat."<P>
	The workshop will include discussions on issues and techniques for managing forested riparian areas; a bioengineering 
workshop on stream bank stabilization conducted by the Michigan State Natural Resources Conservation Service Riparian Team;  
and a field demonstration of stream bank stabilization using bioengineering practices.<P>
	"Only two percent of the length of all rivers in the United States is adequately protected by riparian buffers," says Kingery.  
"If nutrient loading occurs, the average family will pay $10-15 a month to remove contaminants from water, which is very expensive 
compared to the one-time cost of establishing riparian zones."<P>

	Kingery says that working with landowners and educating them about the value and benefits of riparian zones has led
 many farmers and ranchers to voluntarily restore riparian areas on their land.  Changes in farming and ranching practices, along 
with the replanting of grasses and woody vegetation along stream and river banks, can help reverse damage to riparian areas.<P>
	The riparian workshop is being organized by the UND Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC) in cooperation with 
the Red River Conservation and Development Committee, the Red River Regional Council, the North Dakota Society of American 
Foresters, the North Dakota Forest Service and the Glacial Lake Agassiz Interbeach Committee.<P>

<B>EERC to Assist North Dakota Tribe in Conducting Wind Energy
Research</B>
<P>
GRAND FORKS, N.D. -- In an effort to harness some of the enormous
energy potential of North Dakota's windswept prairies, the Turtle
Mountain Band of Chippewa is working to develop its wind energy
resources in partnership with the University of North Dakota's
Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC).
<P>
With 36 percent of America's potential wind energy, North Dakota
is sometimes referred to as the Saudi Arabia of wind energy. 
The project began in May and will be conducted in three phases
on the 36-square-mile Turtle Mountain Reservation in north central
North Dakota. The goals are to develop a model wind program for
the Chippewa Tribe and determine the feasibility of building a
larger-scale wind power plant to produce the reservation's electricity.
<P>
 
<P>
According to Jay Haley, an EERC research engineer and the project's
technical manager, the Chippewa Tribe is receiving $248,000 from
the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, Colo.,
under the 1992 Energy Policy Act.  The project is part of a U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) program coordinated by NREL to develop
Native American energy resources.  As a branch of DOE, NREL is
the nation's primary federal laboratory for renewable energy research
and developmental testing.
<P>
 
<P>
Anita Blue, Turtle Mountain tribal planner and project manager,
said that the tribe sought the EERC's assistance to develop the
reservation's wind energy resources for the benefit of its members.
The Center is providing project technical management, assessments
and reports on wind data collected, and an economic assessment
of a larger-scale wind farm, she said.
<P>
 
<P>
The project's first phase is an environmental impact assessment
conducted by the Wildlife Management Department at Turtle Mountain
Community College in Belcourt, N.D., to examine local wildlife
populations that might be affected by the development of a wind
plant.  The second phase is an assessment of the reservation's
wind resources, which will examine wind speed and direction at
five different sites.  
<P>
 
<P>
The third phase will be the installation of a utility-grade wind
turbine to help acquaint the tribe with wind energy technology.
 Power from the wind turbine will be used by the tribal industries.
 The turbine will be acquired from Zond Systems, Tehachapi, Calif.,
which will provide training for Haley and an EERC electrical technician.
 In addition, Zond will train a tribal member as a windsmith who
will be responsible for operating and maintaining the turbine
and gathering data at the five sites.

<h2>What's News at the EERC?</h2>
<hr>
<h4>An update on Energy & Environmental Research Center projects and activities
</h4><hr>
<h3>Wind energy project with Devils Lake Sioux is second for EERC</h3> 
	The EERC has entered into a contract with the Devils Lake Sioux to conduct a wind energy research project with the goal of building a large-scale wind farm on the reservation.   Last year, the Center started a similar project with the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa.<p>
	According to Jay Haley, an EERC research engineer and technical manager for both projects, the Devils Lake tribe will receive $200,000 from the <A HREF = "http://www.nrel.gov/">National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)</a>, Golden, Colo., under the 1992 Energy Policy Act.  The project is part of a <A HREF = "http://www.doel.gov/">U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)</a> program coordinated by NREL to develop Native American energy resources.<p>
	Haley says the Devils Lake Sioux have been monitoring wind energy resources on the reservation for the past two years.  Sometime this spring, a wind turbine will be installed at a suitable site on the reservation.  Electricity generated by the turbine will be used by a tribally owned business.  A member of the tribe will be trained as a windsmith to operate and maintain the turbine.<p>
	The turbine will not only give the tribe experience in wind energy technology, but will also help determine the economic feasibility of developing a larger wind farm, Haley says.  In addition, he says, an avian study will be conducted to determine the impact of wind energy on the local bird population.<p>

<h3>Thailand looks to EERC for clean low-rank coal technologies</h3>
	The EERC is currently involved in two projects exploring the use of Thailand's lignite coal resources to provide cleaner, more efficient energy to fuel the country's growing economy.  The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is studying the potential of underground coal gasification (UCG) and the Thai Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) is evaluating coal water fuels, briquetting and gasification.<p>
	On the EGAT project, EERC researchers recently completed two months of field work in Thailand where they supervised the drilling of wells by EGAT personnel.  The purpose of this field work is to determine the geologic and hydrologic characteristics of a site near Krabi in southern Thailand.  Over the next several months, the EERC will be analyzing coal, overburden and underburden from the site and studying the geologic setting to determine its suitability for a UCG project.<p>
	A report on the feasibility of conducting a UCG project will be completed by the end of the year. The UCG project team also includes John Boysen, B.C. Technologies, Ltd., Laramie, Wyo., and Radko K hnel, International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Sciences, Delft, The Netherlands. <p>
	In February, three representatives of Thailand's Department of Mineral Resources participated in training and discussions at the EERC, where they reviewed low-rank coal technologies.  The three DMR officials were Kriangkrai Trisarn, senior petroleum engineer, and Somchai Poom-Im, senior geologist, both with DMR's Mineral Fuels Division, and Wisanu Tabtieng, senior mining engineer, Mining Technology Division.  <p>
	The EERC also has proposed a third project in Thailand.  Discussions have been initiated with Thai representatives on a project to remove mercury from natural gas and water produced during oil well drilling operations in the Gulf of Thailand.<p>

<h3>Red River Water Management Consortium gets under way</h3>
	Members of the Red River Water Management Consortium met at the EERC March 8 to begin work on a plan that will guide the group's activities for the next year.  The consortium met again on March 22 to finalize the plan.<p>
	Represented at the meetings were ProGold, American Crystal Sugar Company, J.R. Simplot Company, Simplot Soil Builders, Minn-Dak Farmers Cooperative, the Red River Resource Conservation and Development Committee and the cities of Grand Forks and Fargo.<p>
	Presentations were made on the capabilities of the EERC and AGVISE.  EERC researchers also discussed water-related projects, such as freeze thaw technology to clean salty water, wastewater odor control, sulfate increases in aquifers and the impact of agricultural chemicals on groundwater. <p>
	The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the industrial and municipal stakeholders who determine the direction and scope of its activities.  The water management consortium is a technical program focused on providing solutions to water-related issues in the Red River drainage basin, such as water resource availability, wastewater treatment and groundwater contamination.<p>
	The consortium was formed last year by the EERC and AGVISE Laboratories, Inc., Northwood, N.D., as a partnership between key industry, government and research organizations.  Ed Lloyd, president of AGVISE, and Gale Mayer, a senior research manager at the EERC, are the program's coordinators.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Canadian firm joins EERC-led Clean Cities effort </h3>
	Kraus Industries Ltd. of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, has joined the EERC's efforts to have the Red River Valley corridor designated as the first international Clean Cities Region.  Currently, the U.S. Department of Energy has designated 43 Clean Cities across the country.<p>
	Tim Gerlach, EERC research associate and Clean Cities coordinator, says that Kraus' involvement as a charter member in the program should help attract Canadian government and business support for the program.  Kraus Industries is a leader in the manufacturing of compressed natural gas and propane vehicle refueling systems, as well as equipment for the petroleum industry.<p>
	Other stakeholder members in the Clean Cities Program include the EERC, the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, Northern States Power Company, the U.S. Postal Service, the North Dakota Corn Utilization Council, the National Alternative Fuels Laboratory at the EERC, the Grand Forks Chamber of Commerce, the Grand Forks Air Force Base, the U.S. Department of Energy, the North Dakota State Energy Conservation Program and the U.S. Department of Agriculture<p>
	The EERC is the regional coordinator for DOE's Clean Cities Program, which is aimed at improving air quality and reducing oil imports by encouraging the use of clean, alternative fuels such as ethanol, natural gas, propane and electricity.  <p>

<hr>
<h3>EERC to host riparian restoration workshop in June</h3>
	The EERC and the Red River Regional Council will host a workshop on the restoration of riparian zones June 10 14 at the Center.  Riparian zones are areas of plant growth along stream and river banks that help to naturally filter pollutants from runoff water.  Dave Rosgen of Wildland Hydrology Consultants, a leading authority on stream classification and riparian restoration, will be the featured speaker.  The workshop will include two and a half days of classroom instruction followed by two days of field work.  Topics covered include watershed management techniques, stream restoration, non-point source pollution and the integration of ecosystem concepts in watershed management.<p>
	<i>For more information, contact:  Gale Mayer/<a href=mailto:gmayer@eerc.und.nodak.edu>gmayer@eerc.und.nodak.edu</a>, EERC senior research manager, at (701) 777-5108.
<hr></i>
<h3>Research reveals yet another use for newspapers</h3>
	People often joke about using their newspapers to line bird cages or wrap fish.  Now EERC researchers have come up with another use for newspapers:  turn them into fuel.  <p>
	The EERC tested wastepaper fuel pellets in a residential-scale wood pellet stove to determine which make the best fuel.  Pellets made from newsprint, corrugated cardboard, paperboard, white office paper, mixed office paper, glossy paper and a mix of all paper types were analyzed to determine their suitability as a pellet stove fuel.<p>
	Corrugated cardboard and newsprint were selected for test burns in the pellet stove because of their low ash characteristics.  Of the two fuel types, newsprint showed the most promise because it produced fewer clinkers and significantly reduced emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and ash particles.<p>
	Although the newsprint pellets didn't perform as well as wood-based pellets made from oak, researchers concluded that blending newsprint pellets with premium-grade wood pellet fuel should result in reduced pollution and greater efficiency without affecting the stove's operation or heat output. <p>
	The project was funded by the Western Regional Biomass Energy Program (WRBEP), a U.S. Department of Energy project administered by the Western Area Power Administration.  WRBEP is one of five DOE regional biomass research programs in the nation and covers 13 western states.<p>

<h2>What's News at the EERC?</h2>
<hr>
<b>An update on Energy & Environmental Research Center projects and activities</b>
<hr>
<h3>EPA official stresses importance of EERC's mercury research</h3>
	Robert Huggett, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assistant administrator for research and development, says that the EERC's evaluation of methods to accurately measure mercury emissions from coalBfired power plants could play a key role in the regulation of those emissions.<p>
	Huggett, an assistant to EPA Administrator Carol Browner, visited the EERC on Aug. 22 with U.S. Senator Kent Conrad (D-N.D.).  He and Conrad met with the EERC's management team and then toured laboratories and technology demonstration facilities.  <p>
	Much of Huggett's visit was focused on the EERC's Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM), a program funded by EPA in partnership with private industry, research organizations and other federal agencies.  This program develops analytical techniques to measure hazardous air pollutants, such as mercury and selenium, and the technologies to capture these pollutants.  <p>
	The EERC is conducting an evaluation of an EPA analytical technique known as Method 29 to assess whether it can accurately measure different forms of mercury as it's transformed during coal combustion.  The project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Electric Power Research Institute.  Huggett told reporters during a news conference that this research will assist in determining whether it is necessary to regulate mercury emissions from power plants and, if so, how those emissions will be regulated.<p>
	Huggett noted the Center's success in forming research partnerships between government, industry and research organizations.  "I've never seen this model before," he said.  "You hear it discussed, but you don't see it in practice.  I think it's a pretty exciting model.  It makes an awful lot of sense."<p>

<h3>Wind turbines installed on two North Dakota reservations</h3>
	With assistance from the EERC, two North Dakota American Indian tribes are producing electricity from wind turbines to help power reservation facilities.<p>
	On Aug. 9, a 100Bkilowatt wind turbine began generating electricity for the Spirit Lake Casino, which is owned and operated by the Spirit Lake Nation and located south of Devils Lake, N.D.  An identical wind turbine west of Belcourt, N.D., began generating electricity Sept. 10 for a water treatment plant that serves the Turtle Mountain Chippewa Reservation and neighboring communities.  Formal dedication ceremonies are planned at each site during October.<p>
	The Spirit Lake wind turbine is expected to provide about one-quarter of the casino's electricity needs.  The Turtle Mountain wind turbine should provide about 30 percent of the water treatment plant's electricity needs.  The utility-scale wind turbines, previously owned and operated by the Foras Company, Palm Springs, Calif., are 80 feet tall with blades 65 feet in diameter.  Each wind turbine can generate enough electricity to serve at least 50 homes. Both turbines were erected between July 22 and Aug. 9 under the supervision of Joe Kolbach, operations manager for Micon Wind Turbines Inc.<p>
	Jay Haley, an EERC senior research engineer and technical manager for the projects, says the wind turbines will provide both tribes with experience in operating and maintaining the technology.  Tribal windsmiths, who received training at a Foras wind farm in California earlier this year, will be responsible for operating and maintaining the turbines and gathering research data.<p>
	Haley says that data collected from the turbines will be used to determine the economic feasibility of building wind farms to produce electricity for the reservations.  With 36 percent of America's potential wind energy, North Dakota is sometimes referred to as "the Saudi Arabia of wind energy."<p>
	The EERC is also involved in the assessment of wind energy resources on the Standing Rock Reservation, located in south central North Dakota and north central South Dakota.  The Center is a subcontractor to Xenergy, Burlington, Mass., which is conducting an integrated evaluation of the reservation's energy resources aimed at improving energy efficiency and evaluating potential new energy sources.<p>
	All three projects are being funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) under the 1992 Energy Policy Act.  They are part of a DOE program coordinated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, Colo., to develop Native American energy resources.  <p>

EERC-led Clean Cities program gains momentum</h3>
	Six more organizationsCtwo of them CanadianChave joined the effort coordinated by the EERC to have the Red River Valley designated an international Clean Cities region.  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has currently designated 48 Clean City areas in the United States.<p>
	The new stakeholders in the program are Centra Energy Services and the Canadian Forces Base, both in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and the East Grand Forks Public Schools, Northwest Technical College, Suburban Propane and the Minnesota Corn Growers Association.  The Red River Valley Clean Cities (RRVCC) Program is aimed at expanding the use of alternative fuels and the infrastructure to distribute them.  RRVCC anticipates receiving the Clean Cities designation in the fall of 1996.<p>
	Centra is currently working with several school divisions in the Winnipeg area in converting buses to compressed natural gas and establishing refueling sites.  The East Grand Forks Public Schools operates a fleet of 25 buses and may consider converting them to alternative fuels.  The Canadian Forces Base operates a 325-vehicle fleet and may convert 225 to alternative fuels by the year 2000.  Northwest Technical College is interested in training technicians to repair and maintain alternative fuel vehicles.  <p>
	Suburban Propane, headquartered in New Brighton, Minn., is working with the EERC on a proposed refueling site in Grand Forks for propaneBpowered vehicles.  The Minnesota Corn Growers Association is promoting the use of ethanol-powered vehicles.<p>
	The program currently has 21 stakeholder members and will be one of the first international Clean Cities Regions to receive the DOE designation.  Program Coordinator Tim Gerlach, who attended the Second National Clean Cities Meeting in Atlanta, Ga., said that the Red River Valley region is making significant commitments to alternative fuels.<p>

<h3><hr>
Atlases produced by EERC for gas industry have $40-80 million impact</h3>
	A report completed by the Gas Research Institute (GRI) and the University of Illinois estimates that atlases produced by the EERC for the U.S. oil and gas industry have created an economic impact of between $40 million and $80 million.  The report measures the economic benefits of 88 items commercialized by GRI between 1991 and 1995 that are known to have produced significant economic benefits for users.<p>
	The atlases, funded by DOE and GRI, are reference works on the environmental effects of gas exploration and production operations throughout the United States.  They include information on gas-related produced water, drilling waste volumes, chemical characteristics and disposal options.  The report says the atlases are, "Ideal as a planning tool for environmental managers.  There has never before been a reference published with such extensive information.  The main benefit is as time savings which allows the user to readily have information available for planning purposes such as impact assessments, drilling and production." <p>

<h3>Improve soil, finish a house with power plant scrubber sludge</h3>
	The power plant scrubber sludge that today is treated as a waste product could someday be found in the wallboard of homes or in farmers' fields to improve crop growth in high-sodium (sodic) soils.<p>
	The EERC is working on a research project with Cooperative Power, Eden Prairie, Minn., that studies the use of scrubber sludge from the cooperative's Coal Creek Station near Underwood, N.D.  Researchers are exploring the feasibility of using the sludge to produce a soil amendment for agricultural purposes and gypsum for wallboard and other gypsum products.<p>
	"Because these two uses are so different, an important part of the project is to establish quality criteria for agriculture and construction," says David Hassett, an EERC senior research advisor and the project's principal investigator.<p>
	The sludge comes from Coal Creek's scrubber, which is used to remove sulfur dioxide from the plant's stack emissions, and is composed primarily of a wet calcium sulfite.  In this form, the sludge is of little use, but the EERC is looking at ways to economically dry the material and oxidize the calcium sulfite to form calcium sulfate.<p>
	Calcium sulfate in a granular or pellet form can be used as an agricultural soil amendment to treat the sodic soils found in North Dakota and South Dakota.  If an economical process can be found to produce the soil amendment, a second phase of research will be conducted to develop an oxidation process that produces high-quality gypsum for use in wallboard manufacturing.  The project will also develop a standardized field test to assure quality control.<p>
	The $120,000 project is being funded by the North Dakota State Industrial Commission ($40,000), Cooperative Power ($40,000) and the U.S. Department of Energy ($40,000).<p>
	For more information, contact:  David Hassett/<a href=mailto:dhassett@eerc.und.nodak.edu>dhassett@eerc.und.nodak.edu</a>, EERC senior research advisor, at (701) 777-5192.

<h3> EERC offers courses, workshop on coal ash behavior and utilization</h3> 
	The EERC will be conducting two short courses on ash behavior in coal-fired power plants and four workshops on the use of coal ash and other coal combustion by-products.<p>
	The EERC will sponsor workshops entitled "Coal Combustion By-Products Utilization" Oct. 10B11 in Bismarck, N.D., Jan. 8B9 in Albuquerque, N.M., March 20B21 in Colorado Springs, Colo., and May 8B9 in Minneapolis, Minn.   It is intended for environmental specialists, architects, engineers, state agency representatives, construction contractors and electric power utility engineers.  Participants can receive one and a half continuing education credits for completing the workshop.<p>
	A course entitled "Coal Ash Behavior and Deposition" is designed to meet the needs of engineers and other professionals who deal with ash problems in coal-fired power plants.  The courses will be held Dec. 5 in Phoenix, Ariz., and March 3, in Clearwater, Fla.  The courses are funded by DOE.<p>

 <H3><B>University Research Center's Businesslike Approach Creates Regional Jobs</B></H3>

GRAND FORKS, N.D. -- With virtually no state dollars and no guaranteed federal appropriations,
the University of North Dakota's (UND) Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC)
succeeds the same way most businesses do by providing products and services people want.
<P>    As a scientific, multidisciplinary research center within UND, the EERC provides research
and training for more than 200 sponsors a year, generating $20 million annually in contract activity. 
The Center specializes in clean, efficient energy technologies and environmental systems that prevent
pollution and clean up contaminated air, soil and water.
<P>    "The EERC is a unique organization," says EERC Director Gerald Groenewold.  "We
operate like a business that attracts customers by being sensitive to the marketplace and recognizing
the needs of society.  We form working partnerships with government and industry to create jointly
sponsored research programs and consortia projects that deal with real-world issues."
<P>    Nearly 70 percent of the Center's contracts are with industrial clients, a success Groenewold
attributes to the EERC's emphasis on moving technology out of the laboratory and into the
marketplace.  By stressing that the research and development of innovative energy and environmental
technologies must lead to their demonstration and commercialization, the EERC is attracting an ever-
increasing number of clients from throughout the United States and around the world.  
<P> Groenewold sees the EERC as a prototype for job opportunities that he thinks should be
duplicated at other universities around the nation.  "Using a market-oriented approach enables the
EERC to build partnerships with key industries," he says.  "That leads to opportunities for
technology commercialization and export, as well as the creation of spin-off businesses that hire
more people and foster growth, multiplying the economic benefits to local communities and the
surrounding region."
<P>    North Dakotans and Minnesotans benefit the most from research dollars brought into the
northern plains region from across the country and around the world by the EERC.       More than two-
thirds of the EERC's 260 employees are from North Dakota and Minnesota, with 112 from 45
communities in North Dakota and 62 from 40 communities in Minnesota.  Forty-four of the Center's
North Dakota employees are from Grand Forks, 90 are graduates of UND and 44 people from the
North Dakota-Minnesota region are nondegreed employees holding technical and support positions.
<P>The total salary and benefits for EERC employees in 1994 was $9.23 million, or an average
of $35,500 per employee.  As a result of a recently completed $7.5 million expansion project (aided
by a $1 million grant from the Grand Forks Growth Fund), the Center is positioned for future
growth.  Projections for 1995 show a continued steady growth in research contract awards, increases
in employment and a 5 6 percent increase in overall salaries and benefits.
<P>"The EERC is an excellent example of how a university can create job opportunities locally
and regionally," says Groenewold.  "The Center provides high-paying jobs on the cutting edge of
technology for talented people within North Dakota and Minnesota.  We give them a good reason to
stay in this area instead of looking for opportunities elsewhere."<P>

<h1>Center for Air Toxic Metals</h1></center>
<hr>
<h2> Background</h2>
     The Center for Air Toxic Metals (CATM) at the <a href="http://www.eerc.und.nodak.edu">EERC</a> exemplifies international
research, development, demonstration, and commercialization partnerships between
government, industry, and applied science and engineering at a university research
center.  CATM receives funding from the <a href="http://www.epa.gov">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>
(EPA) and industry, and EPA coordinates CATM efforts with other government- and
industry-funded programs on air toxic metals.  CATM is focused on minimizing the
effects of air toxic metal pollutants on the environment.  The Clean Air Act
Amendments of 1990 require regulatory actions addressing 189 substances, including
air toxic metals.  In order to develop regulations, CATM is working with industry and
government to develop sufficient information on air toxic metals to provide a
theoretical basis for preventing and controlling the emissions and evaluating the fate
and impacts of air toxic metals on plants and animals, including humans.  Regulation of
air toxic metals is being considered and implemented in Europe and elsewhere globally. 
CATM invites international participation in the program.  CATM programs are focused
on the development of methods to minimize the release of air toxic metals via practical
prevention and control methods based on scientific understanding and principles.<p>

<p>
 <h2>  Role and Activities</h2>

     The role of CATM is to act as a hub or focal point of activities for air toxic metal
research, working closely with the gas, oil, utility, and waste-to-energy industries and
regulatory agencies.  CATM plays a vital role in the process of integrating reliable
information related to preventing and controlling air toxic metal pollution.  CATM
activities are peer-reviewed annually by experts from industry, academia, and
government.  Current activities include the following:<p>

<Ul plain>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Identifying sources of toxic metals in the oil, gas, utility, and waste-to-energy
industries.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Examining all options to prevent the release of air toxic metals.</li>
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Determining the partitioning of metals in process streams and determining the
amount, form, and ultimate fate.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing, demonstrating, and commercializing technologies and processes that
mitigate the release/toxicity of potentially toxic metals.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing techniques to sample and measure air toxic metals in feedstocks and
process streams effectively.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing computer-based technologies to compile the vast quantities of data
and
to predict the fate of air toxic metals.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Developing educational programs to foster environmental literacy in students.
<p>
<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> Facilitating the development of mechanisms by which industry and government are
cooperatively working to solve air toxic metal problems through industrial affiliate
programs and jointly sponsored research programs that will lead to commercialization
of technologies and, hence, economic development.
</ul>
<p>
<h2> Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
     A closely coupled relationship between fundamental scientific knowledge and
technology development and commercialization is vital for maintaining a high standard
of living through environmental protection and economic development in the United
States.  The EERC is very proud of its success through CATM in applying scientific
and engineering principles to developmental issues faced by industry, government, and
regulatory agencies.  The primary accomplishments of CATM include the following:<p>
<p>

<ul>
  <IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM coordinated an international workshop on the fate of trace elements in
power plants, which was cosponsored by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE).  The peer-reviewed papers and discussion have been published by Elsevier Science Publishers
for worldwide distribution.
<p>

   <IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM is currently working on a project in cooperation with DOE to determine the
fate of air toxic metals in gasification systems and to develop a computer model to predict the fate of air toxic
metals.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> <a href="http://www.doe.gov">DOE</a> has conducted testing at ten power plants in the United States and measured
the emissions of 189 potentially toxic substances.  The EERC, through CATM, has been
asked by DOE and EPRI to be a third-party reviewer of the data on air toxic substances.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM has a jointly sponsored research project with six industry partners to
develop methods to prevent and control the emissions of air toxic metals through fuel selection
and the enhancement of air pollution control systems.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM participates in Project Mercury, a coordinated effort focused on determining
the fate of mercury in air, water, and soil as it relates to gas, oil, utility, and waste-to-energy systems.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM is reviewing and evaluating data obtained on air toxic metal emissions and
behavior for DOE's advanced coal conversion technologies demonstration programs. 
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM is working with DOE and <a href="www.epri.com">EPRI</a> to validate EPA's (Draft) Method 29 sampling
and speciation train for mercury. On-line mercury-monitoring equipment is also being
tested in conjunction with this program.
<p>

<IMG SRC="../misc/bull.gif"> CATM, through cosponsorship with DOE and industry, coordinated an international
conference in Prague, Czech Republic, entitled "Energy and Environment:  Transitions
in East Central Europe," which focused on energy and environmental problems, including the effects of air toxic
metals.
<p>
</ul>
CATM performs basic and applied research to identify new technologies.  These new
technologies are demonstrated through cost-shared programs funded by industry and
EPA.  This combined funding provides for a smooth transition from the idea to the
commercial product or process.  CATM is a working model of how industry,
government, and research organizations can work together to develop and
commercialize technologies internationally to address critical environmental issues.<br><br>

<H3>Former EERC Director Everett Sondreal Receives Energy Champion
Award</H3>

<P>
GRAND FORKS, N.D. -- For 40 years, Everett Sondreal devoted his
life to research aimed at producing energy more cleanly and efficiently,
but one of the achievements he considers most significant in his
career came from a typewriter rather than a laboratory.
<P>
Sondreal was director of the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE)
Grand Forks Energy Technology Center when DOE defederalized it
in 1983.  He was the primary author of a written agreement with
DOE that transferred control and ownership of the Center from
DOE to the University of North Dakota (UND).  Now known as the
Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC), Sondreal's
work on the agreement laid the foundation for a research facility
that today employs 260 people, conducts research for clients around
the world and generates $20 million in contract activity annually.

<P>
&quot;Everett's efforts not only smoothed the transition from
federal to state ownership, they also avoided harmful impacts
on the Center's staff,&quot; says current EERC Director Gerald
Groenewold.  &quot;The facility retained its capability as the
leading authority on low-rank coal technology, enabling it to
develop a more diversified program of energy and environmental
research, testing and evaluation.&quot;
<P>
The EERC honored Sondreal as the sixth recipient of the Energy
Champion Award during a ceremony and reception at the EERC on
May 12.  Past recipients include former Sen. Mark Andrews (1985),
Conrad Aas, former assistant manager of research for Northern
States Power Co. (1986), John MacFarlane, president and CEO of
Otter Tail Power Co. (1990), Sen. Kent Conrad (1992) and Thomas
Clifford, former UND president (1993).  The award was created
to honor individuals who have demonstrated extraordinary personal
commitment to energy and environmental research and development
programs.
<P>
Sondreal, a Grand Forks native, first worked at the EERC in 1955
as a UND student studying chemical engineering.  After graduating,
serving in the U.S. Air Force and working as a development engineer
for DuPont, he returned to UND where he received his master's
degree and worked at the EERC as a graduate student.  Sondreal
joined the EERC's full-time staff in 1962 as a research engineer
and currently serves as a principal research advisor at the Center.
<P>
 
<P>
After receiving a U.S. Department of Interior training award,
Sondreal attended the University of Michigan from 1969 to 1972,
where he earned his Ph.D.  He returned to the EERC in 1972 and
served as its deputy director from 1978 to 1980 and its director
from 1980 to 1983.  From 1984 to 1991, Sondreal served as president
of Coal Energy Technology Consultants, Inc., Grand Forks.  He
returned to the EERC in 1987 on a part-time basis as a senior
research advisor.
<P>
 
<P>
Sondreal says that some of the most exciting and interesting times
during his career at the EERC came during the 1973 oil embargo
which created an energy crisis and forced America to capitalize
on its abundant coal resources.  He spearheaded efforts to expand
the EERC's programs in coal gasification, liquefaction and emissions
controls, resulting in significant growth in the Center's staff
and budget.
<P>
 
<P>
Sondreal has authored or co-authored more than 60 publications
and holds a U.S. patent for the continuous liquefaction of coal.
 Computer models he developed on the after-burning of auto emissions
were used by Ford and General Motors in the early 1970s to design
emission control systems for their cars and trucks.
<P>
 
<P>
Of Sondreal's scientific research, Groenewold says, &quot;I know
of no person in the United States who has dedicated more quality
time to providing answers on critical energy and environmental
issues.  He possesses incredible knowledge and is absolutely committed
to doing the best job possible.  His practical, focused approach
to solving real-world problems embodies what the EERC stands for
today.&quot;

Human activities are increasing the concentrations of naturally-occurring
"greenhouse gases" in the atmosphere.  These gases, which include
carbon dioxide (CO2), trap solar heat in the atmosphere, thus warming
the surface of the planet.  The main human source of greenhouse gases
is the burning of fossils fuels, such as coal oil , and gas for energy and
transportation.  Carbon dioxide, the main man-made greenhouse gas, has
a lifetime in the atmosphere of a century or more.

<b>Location</b>
<p>
Siberia.  North-central Russia on the Arctic Ocean.
<p>
The Republic of Sakha, also referred to as Yakutia, is a region of 
superlatives.  The Republic covers one-fifth of the Russian Federation, 
an area comparable to the size of India.  Forty percent of its territory 
falls within the Arctic circle, and it has the coldest place on the 
planet: -68oC.  The difference between winter and summer temperatures can 
reach 100oC.
<p>
Yakutia has over 700,000 rivers with a total length of 1.5 million 
kilometers.  The largest is the Lena River, which flows for 4,400 
kilometers.  There are more than 700,000 lakes in the Republic.
<p>
In October 1995 President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree which approved a 
revised program for protected areas in Russia.  This program mentions 
only one non-governmental organization  WWF.  The decree supports WWFs 
position that up to 50 percent of the Arctic should be placed under 
strict governmental protection.
<p>
In a dramatic follow-up, the President of Yakutia, Mikhail Nikolaev, 
decided to extend the Republics system of protected areas and pledged the 
complete protection of 700,000 square kilometers of virgin territory, an 
area roughly twice the size of Germany, by the year 2000.

Nature and the government of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian

contemplates the creation of a network of protected areas covering some

700,000 square kilometres of land -  
 a combined area about one and a half
times the size of France - and the allocation by WWF of 500,000 Swiss 
francs to start a number of conservation initiatives in the country. 
<p>
"Yakutia is a unique place, with a vulnerable Arctic ecosystem and 
tough, spirited people.  But, as in so many other parts of the world, 
mistakes made in previous years have left us with a heritage of severe 
environmental degradation," explained President Nikolaev, in reference 
to the mismanagement of Yakutia's rich mining resources during the 
Soviet era.  "But we want this to change.  To make a start, we have 
created and want to expand a unique system of reserved territories that 
are protected not only by my government, but also by my people."

WWF commended the Sakha Republic for its basic policy of integrating 
conservation and traditional use for the benefit of its people.  
According to Dr. Hartmut Jungius, Director for Eastern Europe and 
Central Asia at WWF International, "most of the protected areas we are 
going to support will have people living in them.  Even if the 
population density is  very low, these people depend on natural 
resources, such as timber, wildlife, forest products and so on;  the 
objective of the Yakutian authorities is to secure the life support 
system for these people through establishing these multiple-use 
protected areas."
<p>
Yakutia's environment sustains many important species like polar bears, 
walrus, and the highly endangered Siberian cranes.  Comprising mostly 
boreal forests and Arctic tundra, Yakutia is also home to important 
contingents of wild reindeer, wolves, wolverines, moose and sable.
<p>
The funds allocated by WWF's will be used in a variety of ways that 
include:
<p>
<ul type circle>
<li> Assisting the Yakutian authorities in the creation of new protected 
areas, producing adequate management plans and ensure  also good 
implementation
<p>
<li> Supporting conservation and management of endangered species of the 
marine environment and in the tundra and forest zones of the country
<p>
<li> Helping to promote conservation education and developing local 
knowledge of conservation, including integrating conservation into 
various land-use practices.
<p>
<li> Training of conservation staff in various conservation-related skills, 
especially building up protected area management and communications 
skills.
</ul>
<p>
WWF first established collaboration with the Yakutian authorities in 
1993, when it became involved with a project to protect the Lena River 
Delta.

"Our first objective is to help the authorities of the Sakha Republic to 
reach the aim they have set for the year 2000," said Dr. Jungius.  "We 
believe that this is a major contribution towards our global goal of 
protecting 10 percent of all types of forests by the year 2000."

<b>Ottawa, 10 February--</b>Spurred by recent findings, The World Wide Fund 
For Nature (WWF) today urged the Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety 
(IFCS) to  take immediate action  in developing a worldwide, multi-sector 
effort to tackle endocrine disrupting chemicals, and  called on the IFCS 
to generate a report laying the groundwork for an industry, government 
and non-governmental organization initiative.
<p>
WWF is proposing an IFCS "working group" to integrate global endocrine 
disruptor activities.  The working group would set up an  informational 
clearing house, and provide a report at the end of six months detailing 
options for mobilizing government and private sector resources and 
developing a credible research agenda.  This new research plan would move 
beyond the duelling data and "science for compliance" that currently 
characterize discussions about endocrine disrupting chemicals.  Needed  
now is prevention-based science based on multi-sector cooperative work.  
<p>
The rapid pace of research on hormone disrupting chemicals has produced 
an impressive number of new findings, corroborating concerns raised by 
WWF scientists and others.  Key studies show:  higher birth defect rates 
in children of farmers that use pesticides; IQ deficits in offspring of 
women who ate Great Lakes fish; and higher than expected concentrations 
of a suite of chemicals in mid-ocean feeding albatrosses.  The United 
States and the OECD are in the earliest stages of developing screening 
and testing regimes for endocrine disruptors.
<p>
"Awareness and concerns about hormone-disrupting chemicals have never 
been higher, but the nitty-gritty work to identify the culprit chemicals 
and ensure their phase-out and replacement is piecemeal and underfunded 
at best," said Peter Hurst, Manager of Consumption and Pollution Program 
at WWF.  "The IFCS, by nature of its international, multi-sector make-up, 
is the ideal organization to launch an all-out effort to reduce the 
threat of endocrine disruptors to the health of humans and wildlife."
<p>
The issue of hormone-disruptors comes up for the first time ever on the 
IFCS agenda this year as an "emerging issue".    Chemicals considered to 
have hormone-disrupting effects include a large number of pesticides, 
dioxins and furans, constituents of plastics, a commonly-used detergent 
ingredient and various metals.
<p>
Evidence of hormone disruption, even at low levels of exposure, is 
reinforcing the need for more aggressive action on a wide variety of 
toxic chemicals.  WWF is calling for the IFCS to recommend action for  
developing  pesticide reduction programs and improve community 
"right-to-know" programs about chemical hazards.

During 1995, WWF emerged as an authority in the field of green economics. In June, with the European Commission and the Club of Rome, WWF organized "Taking Nature into Account" at the European Parliament in Brussels. This conference, which urged that the value of nature be incorporated into the System of National Accounts (see opposite), was reported by newspapers around the world, and caught the eye of the President of the World Bank James D Wolfensohn and US Vice-President Al Gore.
<p>

The result: four months later, WWF, this time with the World Bank, IUCN1, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Bank Information Center, organized "Accounting for the Future", which expanded the Brussels message into an international initiative on new indicators of economic progress.
<p>

The campaign provides a solution to a problem: the world still uses an outdated accounting system that fails to place a value on the steady diminution of its natural resources.
<p>

This process encapsulates the way WWF works today. The organization searches for solutions and paves the way for them to be put into practice. WWF has, over the past two years, restructured its activities and operations. It now directs 80 per cent of its effort towards preserving the three areas that are home to the greatest concentrations of the world's biological diversity - forests, oceans and coasts, and freshwater ecosystems - and towards fighting the causes of climate change.
<p>

There is no longer any doubt that climate change is a reality caused by emissions of greenhouse gases. WWF alerted the world to the threat that climate change poses to species and habitats, and we remain at the forefront of research into minimizing its effects.
<p>

But we are keenly aware that any improvements in the western industrialized world could be cancelled out by an increasing demand for energy in China and eastern Europe. In some of these countries WWF is reviewing current energy production and supporting energy-efficiency centres which promote best practice to government, industry - including foreign corporations wishing to invest - and the general public.
<p>

But one conservation organization, however dynamic, cannot save the natural world single-handed. In the long term, environmental problems will only be solved by the people directly affected by them. WWF's role is to show what can be done, help draw up action plans, and make sure there is enough local capacity to carry them through. That is why practically every WWF project works to increase the local people's ability to manage their natural resources sustainably. And most importantly, WWF, through formal and informal education programmes, reinforces the need for humans to live in harmony with nature. It is my passionate belief that if we can instil this imperative in the younger generation, our efforts will not have been in vain.

<p>

WWF's mission is to conserve nature and ecological processes by:
<p>

<ul>
<li>preserving genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity
<p>

<li>ensuring that the use of renewable natural resources is sustainable now and in the longer term, for the benefit of all life on Earth
<p>

<li>promoting actions to reduce to a 
minimum pollution and the wasteful exploitation and consumption of resources and energy.
</ul>
<p>

WWF's ultimate goal is to stop, and 
eventually reverse, the accelerating degradation of our planet's natural 
environment, and to help build a future in which humans live in harmony 
with nature. WWF is known as the  World Wildlife  Fund in the USA and 
Canada.<p> <br>

<b><font size=6>WWF</font></b> is the world's largest and most experienced independent conservation organization, with over 4.7 million supporters and a global network of 24 National Organizations, 5 Associates, and 26 Programme Offices.
<p>

WWF combines fieldwork and policy to achieve credible results based on broad expertise and experience in all areas of conservation.
<p>

WWF provides high quality conservation services by using the best scientific information available, seeking dialogue to build bridges, and taking a responsible, long-term view.
<p>

WWF aims at all times to be trustworthy, transparent, and solution oriented.
<p>

<b>The WWF Network</b>, made up of more than 3,500 dedicated professionals, invested US$252 million in 1995 in its action-oriented conservation programme and support services in 96 countries. WWF draws its strength from being global in outreach and local 


in implementation.
<p>
<br>

<ul>
<li><b>WWF's National Organizations</b> carry out conservation activities in their own countries and contribute technical expertise and funding to WWF's international conservation programme.
<p>

<li><b>WWF's Programme Offices</b> implement WWF's fieldwork, advise national and local governments, and raise public understanding of conservation issues. Two specialist offices work to influence the policies and activities of the European Union and international institutions based in the United States, such as the World Bank. In 1995, WWF strengthened its network by establishing Programme Offices in the Central African Republic and Peru, giving the organization an institutional presence in 53 countries.


 
<p>

<li><b>WWF International</b>, the network's Secretariat, based in Gland, Switzerland, leads the network, develops joint policies and standards, coordinates activities, fosters global partnerships, and provides services to the National Organizations.
</ul>
<p>
<br>

In addition, <b>WWF's Associates</b> are independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) who work closely with WWF and promote shared conservation objectives, but who do not contribute to WWF's international conservation programme.

<p>
<br>

<dd><font size=5>Seeking Partnership</font>
<p>


Building partnerships with the public, community groups, other conservation organizations, corporations, governments, and international institutions is essential to achieving lasting conservation results.

<p>
<br>

<p>
<br>

<b>At grassroots</b>

<p>

Whenever possible, WWF works through and with local community groups and environmental organizations. Where such structures do not exist, WWF helps to establish them.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>

<b>Nationally</b>
<p>
<br>
Wherever WWF works, it seeks approval from the government in place, as well as cooperating with national NGOs who share common conservation goals.
<p>
<br>

<b>Internationally</b>
<p>
In pursuing its aims of establishing, strengthening, or changing international treaties and agreements, WWF works with such bodies as the European Union, IUCN, the United Nations Environment Programme, UNICEF, and the World Bank, as well as other internat


ional NGOs.
<p>
<br>

<b>Aid agencies</b>
<p>
Exemplary WWF projects attract funds from the international donor community. The organization is 
currently working with 37 aid agencies, including Britain's Overseas Development Administration, the Japanese International Cooperation Agency, USAID, and the Danish International Development Agency.

<p>
<br>

<p>

WWF's overriding concern is the preservation of the world's biological diversity on which humankind depends for such essentials as food, clothing, building materials, and many medicines. To achieve this, WWF has defined six action-based strategies, each d
rawing on WWF's solution-oriented fieldwork and each adhering to the principle of listening carefully to all those involved in or affected by conservation activities to ensure that their needs are adequately addressed.

<p>

<font size=4> PROTECTED AREAS</font>

<p>

WWF creates and maintains effective and 
sustainable protected areas throughout the world to safeguard species, habitats, and 
ecosystems. WWF monitors threats to these protected areas, develops plans for their 
management, and trains local people to maintain them.

<p>

<font size=4>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</font>

<p>

WWF promotes the sustainable use of all 
natural resources. The organization involves local communities in the management of these and makes sure they benefit from them. At the same time, WWF is introducing the concept of sustainability into the development plans and activities of governments, i
nternational agencies, and the private sector.

<p>

WWF protects species - plants and animals - whose survival is threatened by the destruction of their habitat or other human activities. The organization pays particular attention to species such as elephants, rhinos, whales, and tigers, around which major
 ecosystem conservation programmes can be built; to species that serve as indicators of ecosystem health, such as coral; and to species found in one country only such as the ploughshare tortoise and the golden-headed lion-tamarin. Species protection progr
ammes always include an education component to inform local communities about the benefits of conservation.

Our survival is increasingly threatened by climate change, pollution, and the overconsumption of natural resources. WWF works with consumers, governments, business, and industry to eliminate pollution and the wasteful use of resources, while improving the
 quality of life.

 <h2> WWF 's PRIORITIES </h2>

<p>
<br>

WWF's overriding concern is the preservation of the world's biological diversity. To achieve this, the organization focuses its six conservation strategies on three priority areas of the world:

<br>

</td></tr>
<tr><td align=left>

<ul>

 <li> <a href="/wwf/annual/page15-17.htm">forests</a>
<p>

<p>
 <li><a href="/wwf/annual/page21-23.htm"> freshwater ecosystems.</a>

</ul>

<p>
<br>

These are home to the majority of the world's biological diversity and are vital to the continuation of the planet's natural systems, on which all life depends.

<p>

WWF aims to concentrate 80 per cent of its conservation effort and resources in these three priority areas, and to work diligently to reduce <a href="/wwf/annual/page24-25.htm">the threat of climate change which could affect all life on Earth.</a>

<p>
<br>

 All those concerned know that WWF's conservation  solutions come from practical experience:

<p>
<br>

<ul>

 <li> WWF's fieldwork is based on the best scientific information available

<p>

  <li>WWF understands the need to involve local communities in every aspect of its work

<p>

  <li>WWF appreciates the constraints of national and international governance

<p>

<li> WWF is well versed in the techniques of communicating conservation messages around the world

<p>

 <li>WWF is experienced in providing environmental education and training at every level.

</ul>

<p>
<br>

In all its work, WWF aims to engage in dialogue and avoid unnecessary confrontation. This means that the organization listens carefully to all those affected by conservation actions, respects their positions, and endeavours to meet their needs. However, WWF never abandons its role as a principal advocate for the environment.

<p>

WWF's network of National Organizations, Affiliates, and Programme Offices means the organization has people on the ground who really understand local conditions and susceptibilities. The appreciation of different cultures and approaches that this brings is invaluable when working with governments, establishing protected areas, strengthening local NGOs, or training teachers.

<p>

Much has already been achieved, but there remains much to be done - after all, conservation is about life itself. For example:

<p>
<br>
<ul>

 <li>protected areas must be maintained

<p>

 <li>species rescued from the brink of extinction must  be nurtured 

<p>

 <li> international agreements must be monitored or strengthened 

<p>

  <li>education and training must continue with every new generation.

</ul>
<p>
<br>

WWF's work of containing, and eventually reversing, the steady degradation of the world's natural resources demands constant vigilance.

<p>

WWF's 4.7 million supporters are vital to this process as they provide the majority of the funds that sustain the organization's work. In addition, their voices add indispensable weight to WWF's message in boardrooms, at international conferences, and in the corridors of power.

<h2><center>Executive Summary</h2></center>
<P>
The world faces so many and such complex environmental problems
that WWF asked itself a simple but basic question:
<P>
<I>How and where should WWF devote its limited resources in order
to achieve maximum conservation?</I>
<P>
In defining WWF's global priorities to the year 2000, the organization
considered the issues that affect nature - particularly the role
of people - and identified the key problems it should tackle.
 It examined ways in which WWF should harness the necessary resources
and develop the requisite cooperation within the WWF Family and
with the organization's partners.
<P>
The global priorities are based on WWF's Mission and Strategy
as well as an analysis of the specific role WWF can play in fulfilling
important objectives laid out in Caring for the Earth A Strategy
for Sustainable Living, published by WWF, IUCN, and UNEP in 1991.
<P>
The priorities have been developed through wide consultation and
collaboration within the WWF family, and constitute the core element
of the organization's Strategic Plan.
<P>
<B>WWF's Global Priorities to the Year 2000</B> 
<P>
To achieve the conservation of nature and ecological processes,
WWF will:
<P>
1. Concentrate its activities in three priority biomes:<br>
a) Forests<br>
b) Freshwater Ecosystems<br>
c) Oceans and Coasts<br>
<p>
2. Focus and operationalize its programme through six strategies:<br>
i)  Creating and maintaining systems of effective and sustainable
protected areas<br>
ii) Promoting sustainable development practices, thereby linking
conservation with human needs<br>
iii) Conserving species of special concern<br>
iv) Reducing consumption and pollution by influencing public policy
and the practices of consumers and  business/industry<br>
v)Promoting the establishment and implementation of international
treaties, national policies, and legislation <br>
vi) Promoting environmental education and building capacity to
enable people to sustainably manage the natural resources on which
life depends.<br>
<P>
3. Strive to focus at least 80 per cent of its pro gramme resources,
including those of WWF International and all National Organizations
(NOs), on the three priority biomes and the six strategies.
<P>
4. Coordinate all work on the priority biomes and strategies through
the Programme Committee and its subcommittees, using the expertise
of six advisory groups.
<P>
5. Establish a forest task force to implement a forest campaign
plan.

<blockquote><blockquote>
<P>
In just over three decades, WWF-World Wide Fund For Nature (formerly known 
as the World Wildlife Fund) has become the world's largest and most 
respected independent conservation organization. With almost five 
million supporters distributed throughout five continents, 24 National 
Organizations (NOs), 5 Associates, and 26 Programme Offices, WWF can 
safely claim to have played a major role in the evolution of the 
international conservation movement.
<p>
Since 1985, WWF has invested over US$1,165 million in more than 11,000 
projects in 130 countries. All these play a part in the campaign to 
stop the accelerating degradation of Earth's natural environment, and 
to help its human inhabitants live in greater harmony with nature.
<p>
This booklet explains how the organization grew from being a small 
group of committed wildlife enthusiasts into a global network, 
supported by people from all walks of life, who, like WWF, care about 
the welfare of our planet.

<img src="/graphics/duke.jpg" align=left><img src="/graphics/texthd1.gif" alt="It is impossible "align=bottom>for any intelligent person to ignore the mounting evidence of destruction, degradation, and extinction in the world's natural environment. Global deforestation and over-exploitation of ocean fisheries, desertification, and trans boundary air and water pollution are affecting all life on earth. With the human population continuing to increase at an alarming rate, these problems are only going to get more urgent. <p>

It is much too late, and anyway fruitless, to try to find people and organizations to blame for the present predicament. In any case, WWF believes that, in terms of conserving the nat ural environment, most business executives want to do the right thing. We are committed to persuasion and cooperation, rather than confrontation; dialogue rather than conflict, as the way to achieve practical results. <p>   

This global ecological crisis can only begin to be solved by a united and coordinated effort by people with authority and influ ence and who are actively concerned about the situation. WWF believes strongly that there is very great potential in much closer collab oration between business executives and conservation leaders. Both appreciate that good science is the basis to solving any prob lem; both recognize that practical conserva tion is not a party-political issue and that the sustainable use of natural resources is the only practical and realistic way to ensure the welfare of future generations. <p>   

During my long association with WWF, I have come to know many far-sighted business leaders working in various kinds of partner ships with WWF. Many have given their time and experience as members of Boards of Trustees and advisory councils and as effective fund raisers. I believe that they have done this, not just because they have a personal interest and concern for conservation, but because they see it as a good and sensible pol icy for their corporations and a responsible attitude towards the future.<p>    

We at WWF hope that many more such concerned leaders will help us in our mission to halt and eventually reverse the present degradation of the Earth's natural environ ment, and to work for a future where humans can live in harmony with nature.<p>

<img src="/graphics/lettert.gif" alt="T" align=left>he 1980s was the hottest decade in a century and the 1990s may turn out to be hotter still. As the world swelters and global weather patterns seem on the verge of spiraling out of control, scientists believe the climate is changing faster than at any time in the last 10,000 years. 
<p>
The situation is so serious, and the threat to many of the worlds most precious species and ecosystems so grave, that WWF has launched a major new campaign to try and halt climate change. 
<p>
The greenhouse effect is real, and its happening now. Scientists are certain that emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil are causing climate change. We need your help to persuade Washington bureaucrats to stop delaying and take the steps necessary to prevent a climate catastrophe.

<li>Promotion and widespread utilization of energy-efficient technologies in China, India, and eastern Europe.

vspace=3> <font size=2>
The Anemone is an invertebrate creature of the sea.  It is part of the Cnidaria (with a silent "c") or Coelenterata phylum.  The Anemone uses its poisonous tentacles to capture food and help transport it through water.  They are commonly found in coral reefs where small fish and debris are abundantly available for feeding.  Their vibrant colors and plethora of shapes and sizes add to the beauty of the seas all over the world.<br>

<font size=2>
An ancient and diverse group of animals, the first sharks appear in the 
fossil record in deposits that date back to over 400 million 
years ago. At least 370 different species of sharks live in the oceans, 
with a few like the Zambezi shark, that can live in fresh water as well. 
Most sharks live in tropical and temperate inshore waters. Relatively few 
live in Arctic and sub-Antarctic waters, the open sea and 
water deeper than 2km.

2. The blue whale is the largest animal ever to have lived on earth.  It weighs up to 130,000 kilograms--as much as 1,600 people--and can be as long as 33 meters, or the length of three railway carriages.  Before humans hunted whales, there were probably 








about 250,000 blue whales.  Today, about how many <STRONG>blue whales</STRONG> are left on earth?

4.The five rhinoceros species existing today are descendants of the more than 30 rhino species that lived on earth over 60 million years ago.  Today, the rhino is found only in Africa and Asia and all five species are threatened with extinction.  Man's de




mand for rhino horn as a traditional Oriental medicine and for use as intricately carved dagger handles in North Yemen has fuelled poaching in Africa and Asia.  In the late 1960s, an estimated 70,000 of one of the five rhino species alone, the black rhino




s, existed in Africa.  Today, about how many of the five species of <STRONG>rhinos</STRONG> are left on earth?

Le destin des r&eacute;serves naturelles indiennes est incertain

Par Daman Singh

Les communaut&eacute;s locales exigent d'avoir leur mot &agrave;
dire dans l'am&eacute;nagement et la gestion des r&eacute;serves
naturelles, ce qui provoque l'ire des environnementalistes. Mais
c'est bien l'inestimable tr&eacute;sor de faune et de flore sauvage

malvenue. <I>(1491 mots. Photos de collecte de bois de feu, de

COMMENTAIRE
<p>
<a href="story5.htm"><I>
A la p&ecirc;che au d&eacute;sastre!
</I></a>
<p>
Par Claude Martin
<p>
Gouvernements et industrie de la p&ecirc;che poursuivent leur
marche suicidaire sur la route de la surexploitation des mers,
en d&eacute;pit de la diminution rapide des stocks de poissons
et de la crise de l'emploi qu'elle induit. Seule une r&eacute;duction
des activit&eacute;s et la mise place de pratiques qui respectent
les &eacute;quilibres naturels peuvent &eacute;viter une catastrophe.

L'exploitation excessive des for&ecirc;ts a dramatiquement r&eacute;duit l'habitat de l'&eacute;l&eacute;phant, conduit &agrave; des conflits avec l'homme et produit des trag&eacute;dies qui auraient pu &ecirc;tre &eacute;vit&eacute;es. Sans un rapide et

Pollution threatens life on this planet. Every ocean, every continent,
from the tropics to the once-pristine polar regions, is contaminated.
Wildlife everywhere - seals, whales, alligators, panthers, polar
bears - is seriously, often fatally, affected. The world's biodiversity
- the basis of its complex and vital ecosystems - is at risk as
never before.

<font size=6 color=00639c><b>The Anemone</b></font><br>
<font size=2>
The Anemone is an invertebrate creature of the sea.  It is part of the 
Cnidaria (with a silent "c") or Coelenterata phylum.  The Anemone uses 
its poisonous tentacles to capture food and help transport it through 
water.  They are commonly found in coral reefs where small fish and debris 
are abundantly available for feeding.  Their vibrant colors and plethora of 
shapes and sizes add to the beauty of the seas all over the world.

<b>Biological Diversity</b>

<p>
Yakutia has always supported a huge biomass; its  permafrost has yielded 
so many perfectly preserved specimens of the 10,000 year-old woolly 
mammoth that a mini-ivory industry has sprung up.
<p>
Yakutias fauna is represented by 64 mammal species.  The territory 
includes an estimated 75,000 to 80,000 moose (<i>Alces alces</i>) , 
45,000 to 50,000 Siberian bighorn sheep (<i>Ovis nivicola</i>), and about 
250,000 wild reindeer (<i>Rangifer tarandus</i>). It is also home to scores 
of endangered species such as polar bears (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>) and 
bearded walruses (<i>Odobenus rosmarus</i>), which live alongside wolves 
(<i>Canis lupus</i>), wolverine (<i>Gulo gulo</i>) and sable (<i>Martes 
zibellina</i>).
<p>
Some 280 bird species have been recorded, with many rare and endangered 
species represented.  It is the only habitat of Rosss gull (Rhodostethia 
rosea) in the world, and also has important populations of the endangered 
Siberian crane (<i>Grus leucogeranus</i>). Other species include: bean goose 
(<i>Anser fabalis</i>), Eurasian widgeon (<i>Anas penelope</i>), northern 
hazlehen (<i>Tetrastes bonasia</i>), northern black grouse 
(<i>Lyrurus tetrix</i>) and partridge (<i>Perdix perdix</i>).
<p>
Among the regions other  treasures is the sakha, a small woolly horse 
which is a throwback to the Ice Age. It lives in the open all year round 
and uses its hooves to dig through deep snow to reach its food.
<p>
Although permafrost covers the entire region and reaches a depth of over 
1,5000 meters, the upper layers thaw sufficiently in summer to ensure 
vigorous growth. Almost half of the territory is covered in forest, 
mostly larch. Researchers have already identified 650 species of vascular 
plants, 34 of which are considered rare or endangered.  The Lena Delta 
Reserve alone contains 24 species listed as endangered or rare in the Red 
Data Book of the Republic of Sakha, including: Komarovs daisy (<i>Erigeron 
komarovii</i>), the Lena dandelion (<i>Taraxacum lenaense</i>), Chekanovskys 
poppy (<i>papaver czekanowskii</i>), and the snowdon rose (<i>Rhodiola 
rosea</i>). More than 300 algae taxa have been identified in the Reserve, 
together with 106 moss species and 74 lichens.

<b>The People/The Culture</b>
<p>
Human settlements have been found in Yakutia which date from 2.5 million 
to 1.8 million years ago.  Russian scientists claim the worlds oldest 
cave paintings can be found in Yakutia.
<p>
The permanent population of the Sakha Republic is about one million, 
including representatives of over 80 nationalities.  Ethnic Russians 
represent over half of the population, the Sakha-Yakuts one-third.  Other 
nationalities include Ukrainians, Tartars, Evenks, Belorussians, Evens, 
Buryats, Yukagirs and several small groups of northern races.  
<p>
The people of Sakha celebrate the Ysyakh festival every year on the 
summer solstice, from 21 to 22 June. This festival is associated with the 
cult of fertility, and nature revival and renewal.
<p>
Entrepreneurs are hoping to develop an export market for the national 
drink, kumiss, made from fermented horse milk.

<b>The Threat</b>
<p>
The main threat to the extremely fragile Arctic tundra, wetland and taiga 
ecosystems comes from logging and mining companies eager to exploit 
Yakutias huge timber, oil, gas, coal, gold and silver resources. 
<p>
Oil reserves are extensive  the region has been dubbed the "Saudi Arabia 
of the North"  and oil exploration threatens many important natural sites.
<p>
Over a hundred various kinds of minerals have been discovered in 
Yakutia.  These include coal, non-ferrous metals such as tin and 
antimony, and polymetallic ores such as lead, zinc, germanium and 
cadmium.  Rare metals include niobium, silver, phosphate and gold.  
Yakutia produces one-quarter of the worlds diamonds.
<p>
Other environmental problems include overgrazing by reindeer herds, 
uncontrolled forest fires, unsustainable timber harvesting, and 
increasing urbanization.

<b>The Response</b>
<p>
During the period of WWF's involvement in the Russian Arctic, the area of 
Arctic nature reserves has increased by more than 200 percent.
<p>
One of WWF's major achievements to date has been to assist with the 
enlargement of the Lena Delta Reserve (to an area of more than 100,000 
square kilometers), a site that includes a large area of the Laptev Sea 
with its rich marine resources, and the New Siberian Islands, a 
poorly-known group of islands. Conservation of the delta and the 
surrounding region is of global importance. Water flowing from the delta 
helps create polynias  year round open patches in the sea ice  which are 
important feeding sites for whales and walruses. Large volumes of pack 
ice also originate from this region; as they drift over the Pole, these 
have considerable influence on the global climate. 
<p>
WWF has also helped establish a new protected area, the Kytalyk Resource 
Reserve, in the Yana Indigirka region in north-eastern Yakutia.  The 
Reserve comprises a number of zones which offer varying degrees of 
protection. The word "Kytalyk" means Siberian crane in the Yakutian 
language, and the Reserve is so called on account of the 800 cranes that 
nest here, a significant proportion of the worlds population of this 
threatened species. Almost 80 percent of the cranes breeding habitat will 
be protected through the creation of this Reserve.
<p>
Cranes, however, were not the only reason for this initiative. An 
important feature of the Kytalyk project is the involvement of indigenous 
peoples in its establishment and future management. The land included in 
the Reserve is a zone of traditional activities of three communities of 
Evenk reindeer breeders, whose traditional forms of resource use include 
fishing, hunting for polar fox and wild reindeer, and domestic reindeer 
breeding. WWF's goal is to help these communities preserve the tundra 
ecosystems of the Yana-Indigirka lowlands in the interest of developing 
traditional and other ecologically favorable uses of the natural 
resources of this region. The voluntary cooperation of the Evenk, 
together with support from leaders of tribal communities and district 
administrations, has played a key role in facilitating the development of 
this project.
<p>
WWF is currently providing additional support to the government with the 
development of other new reserves.

International's 20-year old office building is undergoing a major
renovation. The new secretariat, scheduled for completion by the fall
of 1997, will use low-cost solutions and proven technologies to
create earth-friendly offices. The organization is seeking funds to
help cover the costs of some of its model projects, including solar
electricity generation and rainwater recuperation.

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>

In financial year (FY) 1995, the WWF Network's income reached US$270 million. Of this, National Organizations raised US$259 million within their own countries while WWF International raised another US$11 million from other sources.

<p>

Of all the monies raised, US$100 million was used for domestic conservation by National Organizations and US$93 million for the international conservation programme. US$59 million was used in fundraising and administration, leaving US$18 million to support the network's future activities.

<p>
<br>

<dl>

<dt><font size=3><b>Individuals</b></font>

<p>

<dd>WWF relies on the generosity of individuals for the majority of its funds. In FY 1995, 65 per cent of the organization's income came either from personal donations (53 per cent), from trusts and foundations (4 per cent), or from legacies and bequests (8 per cent) - lasting gifts to nature. 

<p>
<br>

<dt><font size=3><b>Governments and aid agencies</b></font>

<p>

<dd>WWF derives a large part of its income from government grants and aid agencies. Very often these funds, which in FY 1995 amounted to 17 per cent of the network's income, come as either "matched" funds, made available only when WWF has itself raised a specified amount, or as "restricted" for use on one specific project, or in a particular country. 

<p>
<br>

<dt><font size=3><b>Business and industry</b></font>

<p>

<dd>WWF works in creative and innovative ways with business and industry to raise funds and spread the conservation 
message. These "mutual benefit marketing" relationships include licensing WWF's Panda logo to companies in exchange for a royalty. The companies benefit through a visible link with the world's most recognizable conservation organization, while the natural world benefits from the funds raised.

<p>

In Italy, for example, Electrolux has joined WWF in its promotion of environmentally responsible lifestyles. The 
company, which produces an energy-efficient CFC-free refrigerator and a washing machine that reduces both energy and water consumption, has recently financed WWF's Eco-guide to using electrical home appliances. Electrolux is also funding a series of WWF booklets for use in Italian schools, and "Cities on Foot", a convention for city planners, psychologists, politicians, and other experts.

<p>
<br>

<dt><font size=3><b>The 1001: A Nature Trust</b></font>

<p>

<dd>WWF International can assure its donors that their contributions will be used effectively for conservation. Key to making this possible is The 1001: A Nature Trust, a fund established in 1971 by HRH Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands when he invited 1,000 men and women to join him in making a substantial financial contribution to protect nature. The interest from the trust, the capital of which is currently US$11.7 million, helps meet WWF International's basic administration costs. When vacancies occur, new members, often nominated by existing 1001 members, are invited to join for a contribution of US$25,000.

<h2>Conservation and research in Malawi</h2>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>

For 2 million years, over 600 species of cichlid fish have evolved in Lake Malawi. The need to conserve the fish - in great demand by collectors - led to the establishment of the world's first park dedicated to the protection of deep lake fish.

<p>

Lake Malawi National Park was declared a World Heritage Site in 1984. Today, with the support of WWF-South Africa, foreign and Malawian scientists - led by Dr Tony Ribbink, who was instrumental in setting up the park - work with ranger-divers to study the fish and determine how best to manage the park without depriving the ever-growing lakeside population of their main staple.

<p>

The team is currently researching the impact of cichlid species introduced from the north of the lake to the 
south before it was known that different species were endemic to certain parts of the lake. "We are dealing with problems at the cutting edge of aquatic conservation," says Ribbink. "For the first time, we are considering underwater culling to ensure the park's long-term integrity."
<p>

A 100-metre zone from the lakeshore has been declared out of bounds for fishing. Outside this area, 
people living in the park's six villages have retained traditional fishing rights. One village alone has a population of 6,000, so an important part of the park officials' work is to persuade the communities that protecting the fish is in their own interest. 

<p>

"We see the local people as an integral part of the park," concludes Ribbink. "It is therefore essential that we involve them in all our plans."

<h2>Striking a balance in Papua New Guinea</h2>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>


Ninety seven per cent of the land and natural resources of Papua New Guinea are tribally owned. For centuries, local communities managed their area's natural resources in ways which provided them with enough food, shelter, and clothing while conserving the environment. But now people are seeking cash and losing their traditional ways of living in harmony with their surroundings.

<p>

The Kikori River Basin is a large area of unspoiled tropical forest, rich in species and populated by around 10,000 villagers - predominantly hunters and subsistence farmers. When the Kitubu Joint Venture (KJV), an oil and gas consortium led by the Chevron Corporation, won a concession within a large tract of pristine forest, they decided to work with the local people and WWF to manage the social and environmental issues triggered by their presence.

<p>

WWF developed a precedent-setting agreement with the consortium for integrating development and conservation in the area. The project, financed to the tune of CHF4.9 million (US$3.4 million) by the KJV but designed and independently managed by WWF,

<img align=right src="botanists.jpeg" alt="Picture of botanists">

aims to help the local people improve their standard of living through a mixture of sustainable activities including ecologically sound agriculture, fish farming, ecotourism, development of non-wood forest product ventures such as the harvesting and sale of butterflies, and protected-area management. WWF is also developing a sustainable forestry plan for the region, and actively exploring the private sector for investment and management partners.

<p>

Ultimately the success of the project will depend on the willingness and ability of the local people to manage these sustainable activities on their own.

"Vehicles with well-armed poachers are common in the Amur region," reports Dr Ilse Storch of WWF's Russian Far East project office, "As they can get CHF7,500 (US$5,000) for a tiger pelt or CHF4,500 per kilo for tiger bones, they are taking tigers, and wil



d boars and bear."

<p>

The region is home to many species found nowhere else: Siberian tigers, Amur leopards and Himalayan black bears are all found here,<img align=right src="tiger.jpeg" alt="Picture of a Siberian Tiger"> alongside reindeer, sable, wild boar, brown bear, lynx,



 and salmon. The forests contain Siberian pine nuts, wild ginseng, and numerous other edible and medicinal plants and mushrooms. But the wildlife is now declining rapidly.

<p>

The pace of economic deregulation and the lack of long-term resource management plans threaten the whole region. The remaining 200 to 300 Siberian tigers are not only threatened by poachers. Timber harvesting, mining, and other unplanned industrial develo



pment are destroying their habitat. Unless these animals are properly protected they may become extinct. 

<p>

WWF is providing emergency support, as well as equipping and training anti-poaching brigades and community game guards. "Our long-term aim," says Dr Storch, "is to conserve enough of the natural habitat for the tigers to thrive."

<p>

WWF has also conducted a number of workshops, canvassing opinion for the development of a regional conservation strategy. "If we are to succeed," concludes Dr Storch, "we must include plans for local development as well as conservation. Of course there wi



ll have to be areas completely set aside for conservation, and corridors between them to allow the tigers and their prey to move from one to another. But we must also establish areas where local people can exploit the forest's rich natural resources in su



stainable ways."

<h2>THE 2005 ENERGY CIRCLE</h2>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>

WWF is working to ensure that industrialized countries reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, to a level at least 20 per cent below that of 1990 by the year 2005.

<p>

"Many companies have already introduced major energy-saving programmes," reports Dr Bernhard Bauske of WWF-Germany, "and we need to learn from them. The 2005 Circle brings some outstanding performers together, so that we can share their knowledge with oth

ers and through their example demonstrate that WWF's goal is realistic." 

<p>
<br>

The Circle currently links six German companies : 

<p>
<br>

<ul>

<li> publisher Axel Springer, which has reduced energy use in its Berlin plant and is recycling the heat generated by its printing machines

<p>

<li>German Railways, which is committed to reducing specific engines' energy consumption by 25 per cent over the next 10 years

<p>

<li> national airline Lufthansa, which has lowered its fleet's fuel consumption by 15 per cent since 1991 and aims to reduce it by at least a further 1.8 per cent a year 

<p>

<li>the Thermoplan consultancy, whose energy management concepts for hotels can lead to energy savings of more than 40 per cent

<p>

<li>heating installation manufacturer Viessmann, whose new systems save between 25 per cent and 40 per cent energy

<p>

<li>Ytong, manufacturer of high-heat insulation bricks.
</ul>

<p>
<br>
<img align=left src="scrapyard.jpeg" alt="Picture of Poland">

The companies donate part of their financial savings to support the Polish Energy-Efficiency Centre and to equip buildings in Germany's national parks with solar heating. "It is important for us all to support efficient energy production, distribution, an

d use particularly in Eastern Europe," explains Axel Kleinschumacher of Lufthansa.

<p>

The Polish centre is one of six, the others being in Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Russia, and the Ukraine, through which WWF promotes best practice and energy-saving technologies, often locally developed, to government, industry, foreign investors

, and the general public.

<h2>Larger than the drugs trade</h2>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>

No-one knows exactly how large the international trade in wildlife is, though estimates place it in excess of CHF30 billion (US$20 billion) annually. "The problem is," explains Gordon Shepherd, WWF's Director of Treaties and Advocacy Coordination, "that probably a quarter of it is illegal."

<p>

Each year a minimum of 5 million wild-caught birds, 25,000 primates, 9.3 million orchids, 7.5 million cacti and countless other live species are traded internationally; plus, of course, animal products such as tiger bones, bear gall bladders and rhino horn - all illegally sold for medicinal purposes.

<p>
 
WWF has always been deeply involved with the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which currently regulates international commerce in some 34,000 animals and plants, as well as with the TRAFFIC Network, which plays a key role in monitoring this trade and identifying illegal activities. "There have been some spectacular successes," confirms Shepherd. "Recently there have been major seizures of tiger bones in Australia, Belgium, India, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, while the introduction of strict import controls in East Asia has reduced the availability of tiger bones for medicines."

<p>

WWF's financial support for the CITES Secretariat, conditional upon 50 per cent of the monies coming from government sources, has triggered the availability of significant funds, notably from the United Kingdom and the United States of America. This has helped train CITES enforcement officials throughout Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean, to establish efficient CITES management structures in Guyana and Paraguay, equip enforcement officials in Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago, and deal with specific problems in countries including Poland, Russia, and Thailand. 

<img align=right src="tusksLizard.jpeg" alt="Picture of marketplace">

<p>

"An international treaty needs constant monitoring to make sure that it reflects current realities," says Gordon Shepherd. "For example, we must now encourage participation in CITES by ex-Soviet bloc countries that play an important role in the wildlife trade, work to stem the trade in rhino horn and tiger bones in the Far East, and press for the extension of CITES protection for timber and marine fish."

<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>
<pre>                          <font size=2>The illegal trade in endangered species is estimated to be worth 
                               more than US$5 billion per year</font>.</pre>

WWF's educational activities in Madagascar stretch from a child's first day in school to the training of postgraduate researchers. "We want to raise awareness of the island's environment and its value," says John Newby, Director of WWF's African-Madagascar Programme, "and help the Malagasy to develop ways of conserving it."

<p>

WWF introduced environmental education throughout the school curriculum and has run courses for educational administrators and more than 1,400 teacher-trainers, who have in turn trained 20,000 other teachers for such things as tree-planting and setting up school nature reserves. 

<p>

To back this up, WWF opened two environmental education centres, in Antananarivo - Madagascar's capital - and Fianarantsoa, offering in-service training to teachers and environmental information to students and the public. Based on the success of the first two, four further centres are planned.

<p>

"Eighty per cent of Madagascar's 10,000 plant species are found nowhere else," says Nat Quansah, WWF's Plants officer in Madagascar, "and it has five times as many tree species as the whole of North America. There is an urgent need to study and conserve the island's natural environments, but for that, there needs to be an even larger pool of skilled nationals who understand and care about this unique place."

</td></tr>
</table>

<br>

To build such a pool, WWF runs a programme to train students and researchers, linked to the island's universities and research institutes but supplemented with highly specialized scientists from outside. One subject currently being studied is the indigenous use of medicinal plants. "There is a wealth of knowledge among local people," explains Quansah, "but little has been documented, and few plants studied scientifically. We have built a team of students, doctors, botanists, and chemists to investigate these plants and develop a parallel health care system that draws on them. This project is providing valuable information, but it also helps train local scientists, and demonstrates to the Malagasy that their environment is well worth conserving."

"To achieve this goal," says Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud, head of WWF International's Forest Programme, "we must ensure that there is a worldwide, ecologically 
representative network of protected forest areas and that, outside these, all other forests are managed sustainably."

<p>

"Just two examples confirm the need for change," adds Jeanrenaud. "In Sweden, where much of the original forest cover has been replaced by intensively managed woods, forestry activities threaten over 300 animal and plant species, while Thailand, traditionally a timber-exporting nation, has become the world 's largest importer of tropical sawnwood, because of the depletion of its own forests. WWF's 350 forest projects in more than 50 countries are beginning to show that sustainable management is possible."

<p>
<br>

<dl>

<dt><h3> Looking for solutions</h3>

<p>
<br>

<dd>Just how important forests are can be seen in Pakistan. 
Only 3 per cent of the country is still forested, and even that is endangered by the growing population's need for agricultural land as well as by large-scale timber exploitation. 
The results of deforestation are devastating: extensive soil erosion, silted irrigation systems, reduced biological diversity, flash floods causing loss of life and property, and damaged watersheds leading to a lack of sustained water supplies for agriculture or energy production. 

<p>

WWF is working to halt this degradation, and even to reverse it. Studies to identify key conservation areas throughout the country are under way and have already led WWF to start protecting and restoring the last remaining forest in the Suleiman mountain range of north-western Pakistan. The 8,000-hectare area, standing in an almost barren landscape, is under pressure as it is the major source of income and only source of fuel and timber for about 100 villages. 

<p>
<img align=left src="mushrooms.jpeg" alt="Picture of mushrooms">

To meet immediate needs, WWF is helping to create alternative sources of fuelwood and income for the villagers through appropriate and more profitable use of their agricultural land. One hundred and fifty thousand saplings of fast-growing native tree species have been provided, two demonstration nurseries established, and environmental 
education introduced into the local schools. The initial aim is to protect at least a quarter of the existing forest, and through this to demonstrate to government officials what could be done elsewhere, as well as to convince the local communities of the need for conservation.

<p>
<br>

<a name="one"><a href="involving.htm"><h3>Involving corporations in conservation</h3></a></a>

<p>
<br>

<dt><h3>Promoting sustainability</h3>

<p>
<br>

<dd>"WWF is calling for a shift in forest management," says Jeanrenaud. "Instead of thinking of timber production first and then trying to reconcile it with conservation, foresters should put the preservation of biological diversity first and only allow timber production where it is compatible."

<p>

In pursuit of this, WWF supports the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), a body established by foresters, timber traders, forest certification agencies, indigenous peoples' groups, and environmental institutions to promote good forestry practice. The FSC has developed a set of principles, defining sustainability as forest management that is environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable.

<p>

"We believe that the FSC will set the international standard for sustainably produced timber that the public has been demanding," says Jeanrenaud. "Until now the number of ecolabels has been increasing, but with no common standard, and this has led to confusion."

<img align=right src="FSClogo.jpeg" alt="FSC logo">
<p>


The FSC acts as a master accreditation agency for monitoring, evaluating, and accrediting timber certifiers around the world. In less than two years it has accredited four agencies, who in turn have certified 19 forests totalling 4 million hectares. "This is ahead of the target we had set," says Jeanrenaud. "The WWF Network is promoting recognition of the FSC logo, so that traders and consumers alike will demand to see it on all wood and paper products."

The story of the world's whales is both symptomatic of the threats to the biological diversity of the oceans and a demonstration of what can be done. Concerted WWF campaigns and the organization's powerful influence 
within the International Whaling Commission played a crucial part, first in enacting the worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling and then in establishing the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary in 1994.

<p>

The full power of WWF's network is now focusing on a different marine issue. There is little doubt as to the 
devastated state of world fisheries. The overall catch has fallen since 1989 and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports that 70 per cent of the world's marine fish populations are either overexploited or very slowly recovering
 from overfishing.

<p>

WWF has launched a new, international campaign to promote the conservation and sustainable use of marine fish. "At stake," says Sutton, "are the health of the world's fisheries, the millions of people that depend on them for food and employment, and the s
eas themselves." 

<p>

During the past year, WWF developed strategies to :

<p>
<br>

<dl>

<dt><b>Establish recovery plans for key species of threatened marine fish by the year 2000</b>

<p>

<dd>WWF is promoting the recovery of key species, 
particularly sharks, bluefin tuna, swordfish, and other deep sea fish. WWF will work to strengthen regional fishery agreements, which hold the key to effective management of many species. WWF will also focus attention on the pressing need to improve fishe
ry management and control trade in fish products.

<p>
<br>

<dt><b>Create social and economic incentives for sustainable fishing and eliminate subsidies by the year 2000</b>


<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>

<dd><img align=left src="cod.jpeg" alt="Picture of a fishing boat">

WWF will lobby governments and international organizations to eliminate powerful existing incentives for unsustainable fishing. Currently, governments around the world pay more than US$54 billion in subsidies to support an industry in which too many boats
 are chasing fewer and fewer fish. Subsidized fleets first fish out their home waters and then risk "fish wars" as they seek catches further and further afield. WWF will also explore the potential for working with industry to establish a Marine Fisheries 
Stewardship Council to help ensure sustainable use of world fisheries.

<br>
<p>
<br>

<dt><b>Reduce or eliminate destructive fishing practices and the bycatch of selected non-target species by at least 50 per cent in each region by the year 2005</b>

<p>

<dd>Explosives, poisons, gillnets, longlines, and bottom trawls are among the most destructive fishing methods and gear types. Indiscriminate fishing kills and wastes more than 27 million tonnes of fish, seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals, corals, and 
other ocean life every year. WWF will identify and target the most destructive fishing methods and fishing gear types - such as wall - of - death driftnets - and promote environmentally sound alternatives, including protected areas closed to fishing, whil
e lobbying for changes to domestic and international legislation.

<p>

"If we are to save world fisheries," says Sutton, "we must somehow bring to bear the same worldwide public concern that outlawed commercial whaling. We must use this support to promote fishing that is both sustainable and clean."

It is possible to restore damaged environments, for the benefit of both nature and humankind. WWF's pioneering "Living Rivers" campaign proves it, and also demonstrates the strength of the WWF Network.

<p>

It all began with a small area of pasture land along the Waal River and WWF - Netherlands' vision of increasing the country's natural areas over 10 years. Today, Millingerwaard is a wild wetland, recolonized by hundreds of plant species, wild horses, beavers, and Galloway cattle.
<pre>                                    <font size=2>Millingerwaard wetlands, the Netherlands.</font></pre>

<p>

In 1992, WWF asked Stroming, a consultancy group that specializes in river regeneration, to design the concept that developed into "Living Rivers". Working with the Delft Hydraulics Laboratory, hydrobiological company Klink, and soil surveyors MEET, WWF devised a scheme that can guide river conservation around the world. In the Netherlands, where WWF operates three such schemes, the adoption of the concept by the Dutch government means that an additional 30 projects are being run by private industries and other organizations.

<p>

The scheme revolves around re - creating flowing space in rivers that have, over the years, become silted up - narrowing the rivers, changing the environment, and increasing the risk and effects of flooding. In the Netherlands, where this has been exacerbated by the protective networks of dikes, the natural siltation is clay.

<p>

Working with the Royal Dutch Brick Industry Association, WWF has encouraged brick companies to strip away the clay and create new channels for the rivers. Not everyone welcomed the scheme - farmers were worried about losing land. But with the government cutting back on agricultural subsidies that fed European overproduction, the authorities have themselves bought riverside land and encouraged brick and water companies to do the same.

<p>

<dl>

<p>
<br>

 <dt><h3>Safeguarding nature</h3>

<p>

<dd>Rivers are one of the most threatened ecosystems in Spain, and the adaptation of the "Living Rivers" scheme offered solutions. "Now areas along the Henares River, near Madrid, the Ebro Delta in the northeast, and waterways in Collserola Natural Park are again covered with trees, animals that had disappeared are returning, and the river beds have been revived," reports Pablo Xandri of WWF - Spain.
WWF - US draws on the acquired knowledge of the "Living Rivers" campaign, as well as the considerable experience of WWF-Germany's Floodplain Institute, as it works to develop a flood damage reduction plan for the Mississippi River basin. The organization has already initiated three restoration projects in Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota that are
designed to show how restoring natural systems controls floods and saves money by reducing damage.

<p>

Three other WWF National Organizations are combining to revive the River Meuse, with the long - term aim of rehabilitating the ecology of the entire river and building a network of protected areas from its source in France, through Belgium to where it joins the North Sea in the Netherlands. 

<p>
<br>

 <dt><h3>The grandeur of river systems</h3>


<p>
<br>

<dd><img src="wetland.jpeg" alt="Picture of a river system">

<br>

<font size=2>WWF - Australia's Chief Executive Officer, David Butcher, confirms the overwhelming response to the launch of the launch of its wetlands campaign. " In the lead - up to teh 25th anniversary of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, we want to focus public attention on the government's failure to halt wetland degradation and explain why these particular ecosystems are so important. "

<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>

WWF - France is not just concerned with revitalizing rivers. The organization has, since 1986, worked with the Comite Loire Vivante to protect the Loire River from the construction of four ecologically destructive dams. Plans for the construction of two dams have been abandoned, as a result of campaigns and the mobilization of people affected by the scheme. Now WWF is involved in the Loire - Nature programme, a US$10 million project for the conservation and sustainable development of the river  - 75 per cent funded by the European Union and the French government.

<p>

WWF - Austria is working to maintain the largest intact riverine ecosystem in middle Europe, the Danube floodplains east of Vienna. This area is mainly threatened by hydro-power plants and deforestation. WWF - Austria's campaign to establish a national park has been successful so far - the proposed power - plant project was halted. WWF has been pressing for the park to be opened by 1996 and is encouraging the government to work out a proper national park law.

<p>

Further east, WWF is working on an integrated conservation plan for the Lower Volga and its delta which lets into the Caspian Sea. The area is an important refuge for many plants and animals and of international importance for migratory birds. The plans will enhance conservation in the region through a network of new protected areas, environmental education, and projects to conserve endangered species such as the Saiga antelope. 

<p>

"The great river systems are enormously rich in biological diversity and they provide livelihoods for millions of people," concludes Hails, "and we should also never underestimate the importance of our emotional response to their grandeur."

"WWF is convinced that its goal of getting industrialized countries to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to at least 20 per cent below those of 1990 is possible by the year 2005."

<p>
<br>

<pre>   <b>Adam Markham</b>
   Director of WWF's Climate Change Campaign</pre>

<font size=2>Evidence of global warming is now

<br>

 apparent in the glaciers of the Alps, up

<br>

 to 25 per cent smaller than they were

<br> 

three decades ago.</font>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<br>

Global warming threatens the natural world. Scientists are now certain that if the increase in the use of fossil fuels continues unabated, the planet will heat up by an average of 3C over the next century - about the same level of change as marked the end of the last Ice Age 18,000 years ago.

<p>

No part of the world will be safe from the menace of climate change. The summer of 1995 was one for the record books as heat - waves swept across the northern hemisphere, causing severe droughts in northern Europe, and killing people and crops in the United States. Vast forests in Siberia and Canada are drying up, making them more susceptible to fires and insect pests. Snow - mass is shrinking from the Andes to the Alps - in the last 30 years, the glaciers in Switzerland have lost one quarter of their size, while warmer sea temperatures appear to be the cause of the "coral bleaching" that is seriously damaging reefs throughout the tropics.

<p>
<br>

<dl>
<dt><h3>Reducing emissions</h3>

<p>

<dd>WWF is demonstrating that emissions of greenhouse gases, the cause of global climate change, can be dramatically reduced. A report commissioned by the organization in the Netherlands reveals how that country's carbon dioxide emissions could be cut by 80 per cent in the long term and still allow for annual economic growth of 2 per cent. In Switzerland, a WWF study shows how an ecotax could reduce demand for conventional energy to 40 per cent of 1990 levels, encourage efficiency standards in cars, industrial processes, and domestic appliances, and foster the use of non - polluting, renewable energy sources without affecting individuals' living standards.

<img src="chimchim.jpeg" alt="Picture of an industrialized area">

<br>

<font size=2>WWF is working to promote cleaner production methods, particularly in eastern Europe.</font>

</center>

<p>
<br>

<dt><h3>Improving energy efficiency</h3>

<p>

<dd>But WWF is acutely aware that the industrial development of central and eastern European countries and China could undermine many of the improvements being carried out in western industrialized nations. Although per capita energy use in China and Russia is far below that of the United States, these two countries alone account for around 18 per cent of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas. 

<p>

WWF has helped to establish energy - efficiency centres in Bulgaria, China, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, and the Ukraine to study ways of limiting the growth of greenhouse-gas emissions. There have already been some considerable successes. In Russia, where the centre estimates the country can cut energy use by 40 per cent, 

<img align=right src="miller.jpeg" alt="Picture of wind power system">

Moscow's City Council has agreed to adopt the centre's codes and standards for energy efficiency. In China, based on the recommendations of the Beijing Centre, the State Planning Commission has asked the municipal government of Shenzhan to reduce the number of power plants built by 25 per cent and use the money saved, approximately US$1 billion, for energy reduction measures.

<p>

<pre>       <font size=2>Over the last 10 years the use of wind power has increased by 600 per cent. </font></pre>

<p>
<br>

<a name="one"><a href="efficiency.htm"><h3>Energy efficiency in Poland</h3></a></a>

<p>
<br>

<dt><h3>Signs of hope</h3>

<p>

<dd>Over the last 10 years the use of wind power has increased by 600 per cent while the production of solar cells has more than doubled. Sales of energy - efficient light bulbs have increased ten - fold since 1987, a saving equivalent to the output of 40 coal - fired power stations. But these steps are only the beginning of a battle to ensure that the world's 
climate remains one in which humans, plants, and animals can all survive.

<b>The conservation of the natural world is the most precious gift you can leave to your descendants. Through a bequest or assurance policy, you can help protect the earth for future generations.</b>

<p>

<h3>Bequests</h3>

<p>

 A bequest to WWF can be:

<p>
<br>
<ul>

<li> the residue of your estate after all other provisions have been made

<p>

<li> a percentage of your estate, or a specific amount

<li>a share portfolio, property, or similar asset.

</ul>

<p>
<br>

<h3>Assurance policy</h3>

<p>

By taking out a policy or transferring an existing one to the benefit of WWF, you can establish a major trust to support urgent conservation needs. The trust fund can be made permanent, so that the interest that it earns can be used, in your name, on a continuing basis for a priority project of your choice.

<p>

<h3>Recent gifts to nature</h3>

<p>
<br>
<ul>

<li>A bequest worth more than US$4 million enabled WWF - South Africa to establish a trust fund, named after the benefactor, Mrs Elizabeth Harding. The annual income from this fund is used to protect important South African wildlife habitats.

<p>

<li> An environmental education centre in Switzerland was created with the aid of a bequest, enabling teachers and students to increase their environmental knowledge and promote local conservation.

</ul>
<p>
<br>

You can initiate a bequest now by adding a provision in your will or taking out an assurance policy. Helping WWF means helping the natural world to survive.

<h1><center>The Background
<hr noshade>
</h1></center>
<P>
The number, complexity, and escalating severity of the threats
to the environment are on a scale never before experienced in
tens of thousands of years of human history.  This wave of destruction
has built up relatively recently, and there is limited time to
prevent it overwhelming the earth's natural systems.
<P>
Throughout the world, growing recognition of these problems and
widespread concern is making people increasingly conscious of
the need to commit themselves to action.  The environmental crisis
must be addressed if impoverishment of the earth's natural resources,
devastating changes in life-support systems, and massive, widespread
human misery are to be avoided.  WWF is ideally placed to promote
the action required.
<P>
It was essentially against this background that in 1989, WWF developed
its <I>Mission for the 1990s.  </I>WWF's Mission recognizes the
full complexity of the environmental crisis and the need for WWF
to address it.  The Mission Statement is topical, relevant, and
totally valid for all parts of WWF.
<P>
However, the global environmental problems are so numerous and
complex that it is vital to focus WWF's activities to ensure that
the organization's limited resources are used as effectively as
possible.
<P>
WWF therefore needs to concentrate its efforts on a number of
priority conservation issues, for which the organization is best
positioned to make a real difference in helping resolve the overall
environmental crisis.
<P>
Acknowledgment of the need to focus led to the elaboration of
the global priorities presented in this paper.  The document was
developed in a wide consultation process led by Claude Martin,
WWF's Director General, and forms the core of the Strategic Plan
approved by the WWF International Board in June 1993.

The Development of WWF's Global Priorities
</h1></center>
<hr noshade>
<P>
Since its founding in 1961, WWF has based its conservation activities on the best scientific knowledge available. Increasingly, the organization has worked to forge links between field-based projects and the promotion of appropriate policies. Regular review of conservation priorities and WWF's own activities helps ensure that the most important problems are addressed effectively. Key developments in this review process include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>1980: Development and launch of the World Conservation Strategy by WWF, IUCN, and UNEP
<LI>1986: Agreement to focus WWF's efforts more closely on the preservation of biodiversity, and particularly the conservation of forests and wetlands
<LI>1989: Development of the WWF Mission and Strategy, which noted the complexity of environmental problems and the need for WWF to address them
<LI>1991: Publication of Caring for the Earth  A Strategy for Sustainable Living, the successor to the 1980 World Conservation Strategy, again developed in collaboration with IUCN and UNEP
<LI>1992: United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Brazil, which promoted international recognition of global environmental problems and developed Agenda 21
<LI>1992: Strategic Planning Process throughout WWF with the aim of maximizing WWF's effectiveness in achieving its mission.
</UL>


The WWF Mission identifies three approaches. The primary aim is to preserve genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity, popularly summarized by the term "biodiversity". The second and third approaches  i.e. ensuring the sustainability of resource use, and reducing pollution and wasteful consumption  are of a more operational nature. In order to achieve the primary objective of biodiversity preservation, it is both implied and required that the other two mission elements are also achieved.
<P>
The global priorities reflect this duality of approach by identifying a biomic/geographic focus as being particularly important for the preservation of biodiversity, and by adopting a strategic focus to represent the operational approach. WWF's global priorities therefore consist of two mutually dependent parts: biomes and strategies. Both parts should be seen as integral to WWF's priority focus, biomes being meaningless without strategies and strategies being irrelevant without biomic and geographic reference.
<P>
Central to the development of WWF's philosophy and programme is the recognition that although there is no one single solution to solving the world's environmental crisis, people clearly play a crucial role  both in terms of their numbers, and in terms of what they do and what is done for them. WWF believes that conservation efforts which do not recognize human aspirations and needs are unrealistic and cannot hope to succeed.
<P>
<EM>Caring for the Earth  A Strategy for Sustainable Living</EM> emphasizes this point strongly, by promoting an ethic of care for nature <EM>and</EM> for people. WWF's global priorities take it further by defining WWF's role in achieving the objectives set forth in <EM>Caring for the Earth</EM>.
<P>
<STRONG>Guiding Principles</STRONG>
<P>
To guide WWF in its task of achieving the mission goals, the following programmatic principles were adopted as part of the Mission and Strategy in 1990. These principles remain valid and are of particular importance in addressing WWF's global priorities and guiding WWF's programme activities:

<UL>
<LI>WWF will use the best available scientific information to address and pursue issues
<LI>WWF will listen carefully to local communities, respect their positions, and address their needs
<LI>WWF will strive to build appropriate partnerships with other conservation organizations, environmental and population institutions, governments, and the public
<LI>WWF will establish objectives and use these to critically evaluate all its endeavours
<LI>WWF will set relevant agendas for governmental and intergovernmental institutions and take resolute action to see that all the items are addressed
<LI>WWF will seek dialogue and avoid unnecessary confrontation
<LI>WWF will plan its work and take decisions based on a long-term view and be cognizant of the wider environmental context within which its work is undertaken.
</UL>

<h1><center>
The Priority Biomes
</h1></center>
<hr noshade>
<P>
WWF identifies forests, freshwater ecosystems, and oceans and coasts as major global programmatic areas in which it has a particularly important role to play. It recognizes that, strictly speaking, none of these areas are biomes: forests and freshwater ecosystems are both groups of biomes, while oceans and coasts are geographic areas.
<P>
<STRONG>Forests</STRONG>
<P>
The forests of the world, and the diverse biotic communities they support, can be classified into two broad categories: tropical and temperate. Tropical forest usually refers to forested areas situated between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The moist tropical forests have, since the mid-1970s, increasingly attracted public attention, essentially because of the rapid rate of destruction occurring in many parts of the world. This destruction is the result of a multitude of factors, particularly the opening up of primary forests for timber exploitation, and slash and burn farming which often follows when there is population pressure and when forest tracts have been opened up. Large-scale clearfelling for industrial exploitation and cattle ranching, particularly in Latin America, has also contributed to the rapid rate of forest loss.
<P>
Although the complex ecology of forests  particularly that of tropical moist forests  is still incompletely understood, recent research has vastly increased the number of expected, yet undescribed, species living in these ecosystems. The world's forests harbour far more species and a greater genetic diversity than any other biome.
<P>
In recent years, and particularly after UNCED in 1992, WWF has also increasingly focused on the problems facing temperate forests, including boreal forests.
<P>
WWF has, as one of the first non-governmental organization's (NGO) in the field, achieved considerable success in forest conservation, both in field-based projects and forest policy, and has influenced the forestry programmes of development aid programmes. WWF has also played a critical role in the development of international forestry agreements. WWF's global forest conservation activities will be greatly strengthened through better integration of sustainable resource-use principles.
<P>
<STRONG>Freshwater Ecosystems</STRONG>
<P>
Freshwater ecosystems include rivers, river basins, catchment areas, underground aquifers, surface water bodies, lakes, wetlands, and all the life forms associated with these systems.
<P>
Water is the basis for all life and it connects many different ecosystems. Water supports unique life forms. But water is also a major natural resource itself. Without it, other resources (such as land) will become unproductive. Use and misuse of fresh water profoundly affects all the living and non-living things on Earth.
<P>
Wetland ecosystems  floodplains, freshwater marshes, mangroves, peatlands, and estuaries  play a central role in the water cycle. They absorb floodwaters and regulate floods, helping to ensure a year-round water supply; they absorb nutrients and retain sediment, thus purifying water supplies; and they buffer wind and wave action, helping to protect many coastal areas from storms. Wetlands often yield a range of products that can be harvested sustainably, including fish, shellfish, fodder, timber, and agricultural crops. In addition, many wetlands support important populations of wildlife, including a large number of endangered species.
In recent years the availability of fresh water has increasingly become a central issue, which has in some places led to social unrest.
<P>
<STRONG>Oceans and Coasts</STRONG>
<P>
The marine environment comprises more than 75 per cent of the earth's surface. The life that inhabits this largely invisible environment is extraordinarily diverse. While there are fewer species in the sea than on land, the sea contains a greater number of phyla, which means that life in the sea could be more complex than life on land. Moreover, the biological productivity of the richest regions of coastal areas rivals that of the most productive tropical forests.
<P>
This diversity is not evenly distributed. It is largely concentrated along the coastal margins ranging from the ice of Antarctica to the mangroves of Indonesia, and in certain current upwelling areas such as the North Atlantic's Georges Banks.
<P>
While these coastal regions are the most productive marine areas, they are also the areas most threatened by human activity, which is increasingly concentrated in the coastal edge. Much of WWF's work therefore focuses on the zone where land and sea meet as well as on the river systems which deliver destructive pollutants to the coastal sea.
<P>
At the same time, many of the inhabitants of the open ocean, such as the great whales and pelagic fish and birds, are threatened by a variety of human actions. These are also of great concern to WWF.
<P>
In terms of maintaining global climatic stability, oceans may well be even more important than forests. Yet oceans and coasts are experiencing rapid degradation. Overfishing and pollution lead to an increasing number of marine areas suffering virtually total ecological collapse. Government action and international treaties are largely ineffective, while land-based sources of pollution are neglected and badly controlled. WWF will reinforce marine conservation efforts, and initiate and help develop effective international cooperation in marine conservation.

<h1><center>
Strategies for Action
</h1></center>
<hr noshade>
<P>
Focusing principally on the three biomes described in the previous section WWF works to conserve biological diversity through six strategies.
<P>
The six strategies have been defined in the course of the global priorities exercise. This document only includes summary outlines: the strategies will be further developed by the appropriate advisory groups and personnel within the programme, in consultation with communications and fundraising divisions. These groups will make recommendations to the Programme Committee for adoption. The six strategies aim to help determine WWF's precise role as a conservation organization, build alliances and cooperation, develop synergy between programme, communications, and fundraising divisions, and show the interrelationship between key issues.
<P>
Each strategy will make specific reference to communication needs and/or contain communication components relevant to the implementation of strategies.
<P>
Approaches defined under each strategy will provide the primary tool to focus WWF's activities.

<H3>Strategy Outlines</H3>

STRATEGY 1: Protected Areas<BR>
<EM><STRONG>Creating and maintaining systems of effective and sustainable protected areas.</STRONG></EM>
<P>
Ensure the optimal representation of species, habitats, and ecological processes within areas designated for conservation objectives. Monitor the threats to protected areas as the basis for reinforcing their effective management, and promote models of good management practice for educational and training purposes. When establishing and supporting the management of protected areas, pay special attention to the participation of, and benefits to, local communities. Ensure the viability of the global network of protected areas through the provision of sustainable benefits to local communities in the context of the management of the wider landscape.
<P>
STRATEGY 2: Sustainable Development<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Promoting sustainable development practices, thereby linking conservation with human needs.</EM></STRONG>
<P>
Promote sustainable development by incorporating principles and practices of ecological, social, and economic sustainability. Foster an integrated approach (in which the establishment of protected areas is often an important component) in all use of natural resources  at the <EM>practical</EM> level in terms of local community involvement, management, and benefit, and at the <EM>policy</EM> level in the development plans and activities of governments, international agencies, and the private sector.
<P>
STRATEGY 3: Species<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Conserving species of special concern.</EM></STRONG>
<P>
Protect wildlife species and populations that are important for conservation and sustainable development and which are threatened by habitat destruction, overharvesting or other human activities. Pay particular attention to flagship species (such as elephants, rhinos, whales, and tigers) around which major ecosystem programmes can be built, to keystone species that serve as indicators of ecosystem health, and to single-country endemic species whose ultimate survival is the responsibility of local authorities. In developing recovery programmes for threatened species and management plans for species of conservation concern, give special emphasis to promoting sustainable benefits to local communities.
<P>
STRATEGY 4: Consumption and Pollution<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Reducing consumption and pollution by influencing public policy and the practices of consumers and business/industry.</EM></STRONG>
<P>
Reduce and ultimately stop the increasing threats to nature and biodiversity that derive from pollution and wasteful consumption in order to enhance the effectiveness of WWF's work in field conservation and sustainable development projects. 
<P>
Influence the behaviour of consumers and governments worldwide, and work with business and industry to make their activities and practices less environmentally damaging. Direct activities at local, national, and regional levels so as to combat global threats such as marine pollution and climate change.
<P>
In working to reduce pollution, pay special attention to the issue of equitable and environmentally sustainable consumption patterns. Promote solution-oriented and innovative strategies to eliminate pollution and increase life-quality.
<P>
STRATEGY 5: Treaties and Legislation<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Promote the establishment and implementation of international treaties, national policies, and legislation.</EM></STRONG>
<P>
Work through treaties as these guide governmental action worldwide and provide a significant public forum in which to highlight problems and solutions and motivate action. Treaties work, guided by <EM>Caring for the Earth</EM> and the UNCED framework for implementation, will include:

<OL>
<LI>Improving implementation of existing treaties such as CITES, Ramsar, IWC, ITTA, CLRTAP, GATT, Regional Seas and other marine agreements.
<P>
<LI>Promoting new treaties and securing early implementation on: Climate Change, Biodiversity, UNCLOS, potential international agreements on forests and consumption, and the Commission on Sustainable Development as the basis for UNCED implementation.<%0>
<P>
<LI>Strengthening WWF campaigns and treaties capacity and impact, particularly at regional and national level by working with NOs and with international, regional, and national NGOs and institutions.
<P>
<LI>Developing and promoting national legislation to implement international agreements with particular attention to sustainability and the role of local peoples and communities.
</OL>


STRATEGY 6: Environmental Education and Capacity Building<BR>
<STRONG><EM>Promoting environmental education and building capacity to enable people to sustainably manage the natural resources on which life depends.</EM></STRONG>
<P>
Promote an understanding of the interdependence of people and their environments and help develop the skills, abilities, and motivation for people to take informed decisions about their lives. Aim to help people achieve sustainable lifestyles within the context of their local environment.
<P>
As the relationship between people and their environment involves issues such as population growth, demographics, and the poverty gap, ensure that these issues are reflected in WWF's education programmes, and that these programmes address gender roles and the access of communities to resources.
<P>
Build and/or strengthen governmental and non-governmental institutions so that they have sufficient capacity to address conservation issues within their own remit. This will include training  personnel, community leaders, etc.

The 80% Focus on Global Priorities
</h1></center>
<hr noshade>
<P>
The WWF Family will strive to focus at least 80 per cent of its total programme spending, including project costs as well as cost centre costs (programme staff and other costs) on the agreed global priorities, i.e. the three biomes and six strategies.
<P>
This exercise will involve WWF International and domestic NO programmes in a combined focusing effort.
<P>
<STRONG>Focusing Criteria</STRONG>
<P>
In order that the focus of programme spending can be measured against the global priorities, criteria for programme classification are being developed. The focus is considered to have been achieved if 80 per cent of the available programme resources are spent on one or more of the three priority biomes <EM>and</EM> on at least one of the six strategies. The strategies will provide the principal mechanism for focusing WWF's conservation efforts.
<P>
<STRONG>Application</STRONG>
<P>
Programmes will be measured against the criteria at a regional level by the regional subcommittees with input from the relevant advisory groups. This process will include evaluating International as well as NO programmes within a specific region (including projects and cost centre costs). However, a reasonable mix of approaches at NO level should be ensured.
<P>
<STRONG>Programme Assessment and Refinement</STRONG>
<P>
Programmes will increasingly implement the specific priorities for each biome and strategy recommended by the advisory groups and approved by the Programme Committee.
<P>
Programme focusing will be driven by regular measuring of the programme against the target of 80 per cent focus on global priorities, which will lead to strategic considerations for future change and subsequent implementation. WWF International and all NOs are expected to contribute to the focusing effort without imposing a rigid modal split at a national level. At a regional level, at least 80 per cent of activities must focus on the global priorities by October 1995.
<P>
<STRONG>Projects Outside the 80% Focus</STRONG>
<P>
All programme activities falling outside the 80 per cent global priority focus must further conservation and correspond to the wider mission goals.

Goals and Targets
</h1></center>
<hr noshade>
<P>
Each strategy will have broader goals and clearly defined targets  both long-term and intermediate. Such targets will be of great importance as internal measures of success and as public indications of WWF's commitment to specific issues.
<P>
Targets need to be imaginative without being unrealistic. A target is only useful if the achievement of that target solves a problem or at least makes significant progress towards finding a solution.
<P>
Targets can be of a <EM>numerical</EM> nature, for example:


<UL>
<LI>The area of tropical moist forests included in protected areas will be doubled by the year 2000 and cover at least 10 per cent of the area that was covered in 1990.
</UL>


They can also describe a <EM>qualitative</EM> change, for example:

<UL>
<LI>The tropical timber trade will be based on established criteria of sustainability by the year 1995.
</UL>


The need for targets often arises when other criteria for assessing progress or achievement have failed to provide any sense of "movement". Targets, however, are only a tool. The integration of human attitudes, needs, and aspirations in conservation processes are crucial pre-conditions to change. Technocratic targets alone cannot achieve conservation. WWF will therefore strive for a healthy blend of target-oriented <EM>and</EM> process-driven approaches.
<P>
<STRONG>Establishment and Review of Targets</STRONG>
<P>
Existing WWF advisory groups have already defined a number of targets to help guide their work, some of them adopted from <EM>Caring for the Earth</EM> which includes targets for most of its 132 actions.
<P>
However, if targets are to be useful, they need to be regularly reviewed and adjusted. This will normally be done in the course of mid-term assessments of the strategies, e.g. at three-year intervals.
<P>
In the light of the revised global priorities presented in this paper, advisory groups will be asked to review existing targets and propose new targets for the strategies for which they are concerned  see <a href="annex.htm">Annex</a>.

<H3>Implementation</H3>
In order to transform WWF's global priorities into programme activities, the programme management structure has been reviewed and defined by the Programme Committee as follows:

<H3>Programme Committee</H3>

The WWF International Board has established permanent committees to manage, on an ongoing basis, the organization's principal activities. The Programme Committee (PC) is the board-appointed committee with responsibility for the development, implementation, and review of WWF's conservation activities.
<P>
The specific objectives of the PC are to:
<ul>
<li>recommend to the Board broad programme policy and priorities
<P>
<li>recommend to the Board allocation of financial resources to the various components of the programme
<P>
<li>coordinate WWF's programme activities worldwide
<P>
<li>review programme implementation.
<P>
<li>The full PC meets twice a year and comprises between 14 and 16 members drawn from:
<P>
<dl>		<dd>--the International Board (one to three members, one of whom is nominated by the Board to be the chairperson)
	<dd>--the International Secretariat (one member, who is the designated secretary)
	<dd>--WWF National Organizations (12 members)
</dl>
</ul>
A core group of the full PC can meet on an ad hoc basis to deal with specific issues which require in-depth analysis or urgent attention.

<H3>Programme Subcommittees</H3>

The PC has established one subcommittee to manage conservation issues of a transregional nature, and four subcommittees which are charged with the management of WWF's conservation activities on a regional basis.

<UL>
<LI>Transregional
<LI>Africa / Madagascar
<LI>Asia / Pacific
<LI>Latin America / Caribbean
<LI>Europe / Middle East
</UL>


The subcommittees are responsible for making recommendations to the full PC on the programme priorities within their jurisdiction, including specifically:

<UL>
<LI>translating WWF's Mission and global priorities to the Year 2000 into viable conservation objectives which address the specific challenges of each region, and ensuring that conservation issues of a transregional nature receive appropriate attention
<P>
<LI>integrating the recommendations of the advisory groups (see below) into the regional programmes
<P>
<LI>making recommendations to the PC on the establishment of country/subregional teams, programme offices, and other structures within the region
<P>
<LI>allocating resources to the country programmes and other programmes, and monitoring the effectiveness of those resources
<P>
<LI>ensuring that the various functional units of the WWF network (i.e. communications, fundraising, finance, personnel, etc.) are adequately informed about the activities of the regional and transregional programmes.
</UL>


The programme subcommittees meet at least once a year and are chaired by a member of the PC. The membership of each subcommittee is drawn primarily from WWF NOs that have a sustained programmatic involvement in regional and transregional activities. WWF International is represented on each subcommittee by the relevant regional or transregional programme director, who also serves as secretary to the subcommittee. Several programme subcommittees have also established core groups to act on important issues which arise between full subcommittee meetings.


<H3>Advisory Groups</H3>

In order to provide the programme subcommittees, and ultimately the PC, with sound technical advice on the implementation of WWF's global priorities, the PC has established six advisory groups. The advisory groups' activities are reviewed and integrated into the broader programme by the Transregional Subcommittee. The membership of each advisory group is drawn from relevant technical and functional units throughout the WWF network, and incorporates outside expertise as required.
<P>
The status of the advisory groups as of September 1993 is as follows:<P>
<STRONG>Protected Areas and Species of Special Concern</STRONG>
<P>
No advisory group has yet been formed. The advisory group's structure and terms of reference will be established when feedback has been received on the background and options paper that is currently being prepared. The group will be charged with establishing the Protected Areas and Species of Special Concern strategies.
<P>
<STRONG>Sustainable Resource Use (SRU)</STRONG>
<P>
The SRU Advisory Group has existed since 1991. At its meeting in June 1993, the group adapted its approach to reinforce the new Sustainable Development strategy.
<P>
<STRONG>Resource Consumption and Pollution (RCP)</STRONG>
<P>
The RCP Advisory Group has been in existence since 1991. At its meeting in September 1993, the group developed further details on the components of the Consumption and Pollution strategy.
<P>
<STRONG>Education and Capacity Building</STRONG>
<P>
At its meeting in February 1993, the Education Subcommittee agreed to the proposed change of its status to the Education/Capacity-building Advisory Group. A draft strategic outline has been circulated for comment.
<P>
<STRONG>Forests</STRONG>
<P>
The Forest Advisory Group has been in existence since 1988. Its work has successfully contributed to WWF's positioning in forest policy. Details of the relationship between the advisory group and the Forest Task Force have been clarified through the latter's terms of reference.
<P>
<STRONG>Marine</STRONG>
<P>
This advisory group was established in 1990. It defined three priority areas for its work. In 1993, it will define the distinction and interface between freshwater and oceans and make recommendations concerning the responsibilities for fresh water.
<P>
Following the advice of the Marine Advisory Group, a Freshwater Ecosystems Advisory Group may be established.

<H3>Task Forces</H3>

Task forces are working groups which draw upon expertise from different functional units throughout the WWF network. They will deal with important issues which require the broader integration of programme activities with communications and fundraising divisions in order to raise public awareness and carry out thematic campaigns. To be successful, task forces must draw on the resources of the full WWF network so as to maximize the quality, consistency, and impact of their work. Task forces will include staff from key organizations and disciplines across the WWF network and will be led or chaired by a capable coordinator. It will be necessary for functional units involved in the task forces to make budget and human resource allocations for task-force-related work.
<P>
<STRONG>The Forest Task Force</STRONG>
<P>
To build on the success already achieved by WWF in the field of forest conservation, a forest task force is being established to help concentrate WWF's strengths in this area, and thus achieve maximum success. This task force will work closely with the regional subcommittees, the Forest Advisory Group, and fundraising and communications divisions throughout the WWF network.
<P>
The Forest Advisory Group will provide the core policy advice to the Forest Task Force. When communications and fundraising staff are included, the advisory group will operate as a task force. Terms of reference for the task force and its manager have been drawn up.

<H3>Other Instruments</H3>

<STRONG>TRAFFIC</STRONG>
<P>
The TRAFFIC Committee will no longer be a formal subcommittee, but will continue to be the body overseeing the joint IUCN/WWF TRAFFIC Programme.
<P>
<STRONG>Treaties, National Policies, and Legislation</STRONG>
<P>
Rather than establish a formal advisory group for this strategy, the head of WWF International's Treaties Unit will coordinate the implementation of this strategy, forming ad hoc groups on the major treaties (Climate, CITES, Biodiversity, etc.) as deemed necessary. 
<P>
Priorities for the Treaties Strategy need to be established by a PC review of WWF involvement in the many and various treaties and conventions, and by close consultation between the WWF International Treaties Unit and the various strategic and technical advisory groups.
<P>
<STRONG>UNCED Group</STRONG>
<P>
This group is concerned with UNCED follow-up activities and will remain in place until individual issues can be taken care of by other advisory groups.
<P>
<STRONG>Resource Allocation</STRONG>
<P>
The PC will, in future, decide upon the resource allocation between the different programme components at its autumn meeting each year. Annual allocations will be made by region, and global targets established for each strategy/biome. To assist the PC in this allocation exercise the advisory groups will prepare reports on the implementation of the global priorities, in consultation with the transregional and regional subcommittees. This will ensure continuity, and regular evaluation of the implementation of the strategies, as well as an update on the longer-term progress towards achievement of WWF's strategic priorities.

<blockquote>
<P>
One of the most important figures in WWF's early history was the renowned 
British biologist, Sir Julian Huxley. The first Director General of 
UNESCO, Huxley had also helped found a scientific research-based 
conservation institution, now known as IUCNThe World Conservation Union.
<p>
In 1960, Huxley went to East Africa to advise UNESCO on wildlife 
conservation in the area. He was appalled at what he saw. On his return 
to London, he wrote three articles for the <em>Observer</em> newspaper in 
which he warned the British public that habitat was being destroyed and 
animals hunted at such a rate that much of the region's wildlife could 
disappear within the next 20 years.
<p>
The articles hit home, alerting readers to the fact that nature 
conservation was a serious issue. Huxley received a number of letters 
from concerned members of the public. Among these was a letter from 
businessman Victor Stolan, who pointed out the urgent need for an 
international organization to raise funds for conservation.
<p>
But Stolan stressed that he was not in a position to launch such an 
organization himself. Huxley therefore contacted ornithologist Max 
Nicholson, Director General of Britain's Nature Conservancy, who took up 
the challenge with enthusiasm.
<p>
By spring 1961, Nicholson had gathered together a group of scientists 
and advertising and public relations experts, all committed to 
establishing an organization of the kind Stolan had suggested.
Prominent among those experts was another ornithologist  Peter Scott, a 
vice-president of IUCN, who was later to become the new organization's 
first chairman.
<p>
The group decided to base its operations in neutral Switzerland, where 
IUCN had already transferred its headquarters to a villa in the small 
town of Morges on the northern shores of Lake Geneva. The new 
organization, which planned to work closely with IUCN, was to share this 
villa.
<p>
IUCN welcomed the fledgling organization: "Together," both parties 
agreed, "we will harness public opinion and educate the world about the 
necessity for conservation." 
<p>
Meanwhile, Chi-Chi the panda had arrived at London Zoo. Aware of the 
need for a strong, recognizable symbol that would overcome all language 
barriers, the group agreed that the big, furry animal with her 
appealing, black-patched eyes, would make an excellent logo. The black 
and white panda has since come to stand as a symbol for the conservation 
movement as a whole.
<p>
WWF was officially formed and registered as a charity on 11 September 
1961. The international fund-raising mission was about to begin.
<p>
The founders decided that the most efficient approach would be to set up 
offices in different countries. They therefore launched National 
Appeals, which would send up to two-thirds of the funds raised to the 
international secretariat in Morges (now known as WWF International), 
and keep the remainder to spend on conservation projects of their own 
choice.
<p>
WWF planned to work, wherever possible, with existing non-governmental 
organizations, and base its grants on the best scientific knowledge 
available  a policy which has been adhered to ever since. Its first 
grants went to IUCN, the International Council for Bird Preservation 
(ICBP, now Birdlife International), the International Waterfowl Research 
Bureau, and the International Youth Federation for the Study and 
Conservation of Nature.
<p>
The first National Appeal, with HRH The Duke of Edinburgh as President, 
was launched in the United Kingdom on 23 November 1961. On 1 December, 
it was followed by the United States, and a few days later, Switzerland.
<p>
Since then, WWF has grown considerably. National Appeals are now known 
as National Organizations. Twenty-four of these are affiliated to WWF 
International, while five organizations which operate under a different 
name are associated with WWF. Each National Organization is a separate 
legal entity, responsible to its own Board and accountable to its 
donors. WWF International itself is accountable to the National 
Organizations, donors, and the Swiss authorities. Most of the members of 
WWF International's Board and committees are drawn from the Boards and 
Chief Executive Officers of the National Organizations. WWF also has 
programme offices throughout the world and representatives in many 
countries.
<p>
In its first three years, WWF raised and donated almost US$1.9 million 
to conservation projects. Much of this money was given by individuals, 
moved by newspaper articles such as a seven-page feature on the 
organization in the Daily Mirror newspaper which provoked the British 
public to send in 60,000 within a week of its publication.
<p>
Some of the early grants, such as those to IUCN and ICBP, were large. 
Another substantial donation went to the Charles Darwin Foundation for 
the Galpagos Islands. WWF still funds projects in the Galpagos, and 
has helped the Ecuadorean government to establish the Galpagos National 
Park, control introduced species which threaten the islands' rare 
indigenous plants and animals, and set up research training and 
education programmes. The Galpagos Islands could now stand as an 
example of the way low-impact tourism can be integrated with research, 
development, and conservation initiatives.
<p>
Many grants, however, were small. In 1962, WWF gave US$131 "to enable Mr 
E P Gee of Upper Shillong, Assam, to visit the Rann of Kutch to 
ascertain the total numbers and present trends of the population of 
Indian wild ass." Mr Gee found 870. By 1975, numbers had dropped to 400 
and the wild ass seemed to be on the verge of extinction. So a rescue 
mission was launched, a wild ass sanctuary established, and by the 
mid-1980s, the population had risen to an impressive total of well over 
2,000.
<P>
Other early grants went to provide a road grader and rotary mower for 
Kenya's Masai Mara Game Reserve; to fund a survey of Costa Rica's few 
remaining white bearded spider monkeys; and to enable Professor Kim Hon 
Kyu, chairman of the Korean Section of the ICBP to go to an ICBP 
conference in New York and attend the first ever World Conference on 
National Parks in Seattle.
<p>
In 1969, WWF joined forces with the Spanish government to purchase a 
section of the Guadalquivir Delta marshes and establish the Coto Doana 
National Park. This important wetland area, one of the last refuges of 
the Spanish imperial eagle and the Iberian lynx, is constantly 
threatened by schemes to increase local agricultural output and tourism. 
WWF still supports Coto Doana, and is fighting proposals to drain the 
marshes and syphon off water to irrigate agricultural land along the 
coast and to expand tourist facilities.

<blockquote>
From the very beginning, WWF has been aware that people donate money to 
the organization because they want to give direct support to 
conservation. 

<P>
In 1970, HRH Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, then President of WWF 
International, launched an important initiative that was to provide WWF 
with the solid, independent financial base it needed. The organization 
set up a US$10 million fund, known as The 1001: A Nature Trust, to which 
1,001 individuals each contributed US$10,000. Since establishing The 
1001, WWF International has been able to use interest from the trust fund 
to help meet its basic administration costs.
<P>
So when WWF helped the Indian government launch Project Tiger in 1973, 
the public was assured that its donations would go towards saving India's 
charismatic, but severely endangered, tigers. Mrs Indira Gandhi set up a 
task force to carry out a comprehensive six-year tiger conservation plan 
and the government put aside land for nine tiger reserves. India later 
added six more reserves. Nepal followed suit with three, and Bangladesh 
with one.
<P>
Two years later, WWF embarked on its first worldwide Tropical Rainforest 
Campaign, raising money and arranging for several dozen representative 
tropical rainforest areas in Central and West Africa, Southeast Asia, and 
Latin America, to be managed as national parks or reserves. 
<P>
Forest conservation has been an important WWF focus ever since. The 
organization's Forest Programme now supports 350 projects all over the 
world, in an effort to conserve not only tropical rainforests but also 
the forests of the temperate zones.
<P>
The 1970s were an exciting and active time. The launch of an ambitious 
marine campaign, "The Seas Must Live", in 1976, enabled WWF to set up 
marine sanctuaries for whales, dolphins, and seals, and to protect marine 
turtle nesting sites. The decade drew to a close with a campaign to "Save 
the Rhino", which rapidly raised over US$1 million to combat rhino poaching.
<P>
Meanwhile, concerned that trade in animals, plants, and commodities such 
as ivory and rhino horn was driving many species towards extinction, IUCN 
had created a body to monitor trade in wildlife and wildlife products. 
The new organization, known as TRAFFIC (Trade Records Analysis of Fauna 
and Flora in Commerce) opened its first office in the United Kingdom in 
1976. With WWF's help, TRAFFIC has now grown into a network of 17 offices 
on five continents, and has played a major role in persuading governments 
all over the world to increase species protection and strengthen wildlife 
trade controls.
<p>
All this activity meant that WWF had long outgrown its villa in Morges, 
and desperately needed new premises. In 1979, the accommodation problem 
was solved by an anonymous donation that enabled the organization to move 
to a modern office block in Gland, along the lake, halfway between Geneva 
and Lausanne.

<blockquote>
<P>
By the end of the 1970s, WWF had grown from a small organization that 
concentrated on problems such as endangered species and habitat 
destruction, into an international institution involved in all manner of 
conservation issues. Perhaps the most important of these was the need to 
integrate development with conservation.
<p>
WWF marked the dawn of the 1980s by collaborating with IUCN and the 
United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) on the publication of a joint 
<em>World Conservation Strategy.</em> Endorsed by the United Nations 
Secretary General, the Strategy was launched simultaneously in 34 world 
capitals.
<p>
It recommended a holistic approach to conservation and highlighted the 
importance of using natural resources sustainably. Since the launch, 50 
countries have formulated and initiated their own national conservation 
strategies, based on its recommendations. A simplified version, <em>How 
to Save the World, </em>was subsequently published in several languages.
<p>
Meanwhile, WWF continued to build up its popular support base. In 1981, 
when HRH The Duke of Edinburgh took over from John Loudon as President of 
WWF International, the organization had one million regular supporters 
worldwide. Fundraising efforts received a boost in 1983, with the launch 
of the Conservation Stamp Collection. Under this scheme, WWF  in 
collaboration with Groth AG  has worked with the postal authorities in 
more than 200 countries, helping them select threatened species to 
feature on official postage stamps. The programme has s<%1>o far raised 
over US$13 million.
<p>
By 1986, WWF had come to realize that its name no longer reflected the 
scope of its activities. The WWF Network therefore decided to publicize 
their expanded mandate by changing their name from World Wildlife Fund to 
the World Wide Fund For Nature. The United States and Canada, however, 
retained the old name.
<p>
As part of its 25th anniversary celebrations, WWF invited leaders from 
the world's five main religions to a two-day retreat in the historic 
Italian town of Assisi. After the retreat, the leaders issued 
declarations that conservation was a fundamental element in their 
respective faiths. This led to the formation of an international network, 
that now includes eight religions, through which WWF and religious groups 
work together to achieve common aims.
<p>
WWF's status as a non-governmental organization with whom governments are 
happy to work means that it is extremely well positioned to press for 
changes in government policy. In 1985, the organization helped bring 
about an international moratorium on whaling. Since then, a whale 
sanctuary has been established in the important Antarctic feeding grounds.
<p>
The fact that the organization has good relationships with governments 
has also enabled it to negotiate debt-for-nature swaps, under which a 
portion of a nation's debt is converted into funds for conservation. 
Debt-for-nature swaps have been made with a number of countries, 
including Ecuador, Madagascar, the Philippines, and Zambia.

<P>
The 1990s began with the launch of a revised mission and strategy. The 
expanded mission reiterates WWF's commitment to nature conservation, and 
classifies the organization's work into three interdependent categories: 
the preservation of biological diversity, promoting the concept of 
sustainable use of resources, and reducing wasteful consumption and 
pollution. The 1990 strategy aims to decentralize WWF's decision-making, 
and to increase cooperation with local people.
<p>
The following year, building on lessons learned in the decade since the 
launch of the <em>World Conservation Strategy,</em> WWF, IUCN, and UNEP 
joined forces again to publish <em>Caring for the Earth  A Strategy for 
Sustainable Living.</em> Launched in over 60 countries around the world, 
<em>Caring for the Earth</em> lists 132 actions people at all social and 
political levels can take to safeguard or improve their environment, 
while simultaneously increasing the quality of their life.
<p>
One of the most important ways in which people can help ensure the future 
health of the planet is to cut down their consumption of fossil fuels. 
This will reduce the damage that air pollution and acid rain inflict on 
people, animals, and plants, and slow down the rate at which the world's 
weather patterns are changing. WWF works to make people and governments 
aware of the implications of climate change and to persuade them to 
reduce polluting activities to a minimum.
<p>
The organization works with governments in two ways  as collaborator and 
lobbyist. For example, it cooperates with the government of Madagascar on 
an environmental syllabus for use in the island's primary schools, and 
with the Chinese Ministry of Forestry on a giant panda management plan.
<p>
In 1990, WWF helped bring about an international moratorium on the ivory 
trade. And in 1992, it played a part in pressurizing governments to sign 
conventions on biodiversity and climate change at the United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development  the Earth Summit  in Rio de 
Janeiro. It is now working to ensure that those conventions are 
implemented in an effective manner.
<p>
Perhaps more than any other event in recent years, the Earth Summit 
alerted politicians and business people to the urgency of the 
environmental crisis facing the modern world. Since the conference, WWF 
has been working to build stronger relationships with the business 
community. In the UK, for example, WWF is working with a group of 
retailers and manufacturers who are committed to phasing out the sale of 
wood that does not come from independently certified, well-managed forests.
<p>
WWF also maintains links with other non-governmental organizations  both 
national and international. It makes a particular point of responding to 
local conservation needs, and working with local people. More and more 
projects involve rural communities in making decisions as to how their 
environment should be both used and conserved, while providing economic 
incentives.
<p>
In Zambia's Kafue Flats, WWF has helped the government forge an important 
link between development and conservation. Local people are trained as 
wildlife scouts to monitor and report on the area's rapidly declining 
population of lechwes  antelopes adapted to living in swamp-like 
conditions. Thanks to the scouts, and improved management techniques, 
lechwe numbers have now increased to a level that permits culling. Trophy 
hunters pay to hunt animals, and the money raised is reinvested in 
community development and wildlife management.
<p>
WWF has always recognized the importance of working in partnership. 
Cooperation is crucial  whether it is with governments, other 
conservation organizations, local communities, or with the millions of 
people whose financial and moral support enables WWF to carry out 
conservation work throughout the world.
<p>
At the end of 1993, Claude Martin took over as Director General of WWF 
International, replacing Charles de Haes who had served in this position 
for the previous 18 years. At the same time, the organization completed a 
two-year network-wide evaluation of its conservation work. On the 
strength of this study, it resolved to focus its activities on three key 
areas: forests, freshwater ecosystems, and oceans and coasts. WWF 
believes that in pursuing the new goals via carefully planned strategies, 
it will be able to make the best use of its resources.
<p>
<em>Contributions from individuals remain the organization's most 
important source of funds, making up 53 per cent of its annual income.
<p>
If you care about the welfare of our planet, and the people, animals, and 
plants that live on it, perhaps you would like to join those who support 
WWF's conservation work by contacting either the Fundraising Director or 
the Membership Officer at WWF International or your local WWF National 
Organization.</em>

<blockquote><blockquote><img src="/graphics/headerconerv.gif" alt="Conservation...it's good for business"><p>

<img src="/graphics/Tinitial.gif" alt="T" align=left>he time for protest alone is over, if, indeed, it  ever existed," says Dr. Claude Martin, director general of WWF, one of the world's largest independent conservation organizations with 24 National Organizations, five Associates and 23 Program Offices around the world. "Conservationists today must develop practical solutions to environmental issues, show what can be done, and explain to people 
<img src="/graphics/martin.jpg" align=right>how they can help."<p>

WWF's overriding objective is to preserve the Farth's biological diversity. We depend on this for much of our food, clothing and fuels, building materials, medicines and other products from rubber and pesticides to dyes and oils. WWF's action-oriented conserva tion programs in more than 100 countries are dedicated to ensuring that our use of nat ural resources becomes sustainable, and to building a future in which we live in balance with nature.  <p>  

For over 20 years, WWF has worked coop eratively in creative and innovative ways with business and industry includinglicensingthe use of its Panda logo in exchange for a royalty. "We term this mutual-benefit marketing" explains KenPhillips, WWF's international development director, "the corporations benefit through a visible link with the world's most recognizable conservation organization, while the natural world benefits from the funds donated."  <p> 

In the Netherlands, the WWF logo helped launch Zeelandia's PANDA bread, a new whole grain product. "We are convinced that our link with WWF was a major factor in the success of Zeelandia's new line. <img src="/graphics/pandaproduct.jpg" align=left>We were able to sell through 85% of Dutch bakers, an extremely high proportion in a competitive industry." says H.J. Doeleman, Zeelandia's director general. <p>   

The product is now sold throughout the Netherlands and Belgium by Zeelandia, with details of WWF's activities on the packaging. Similarbread products are sold in Denmark and Norway by Pals, in Germany through Phoenix and by Biofarm in Switzerland. Income from the sales of PANDA bread and flour has helped support a variety of WWF projects induding a Swiss campaign to encour age organic farming, a project to conserve the Meuse river, and WWF's work to save the African elephant. <p>

<img src="/graphics/texthd2.gif" align=middle><br>"Conservation is a cooperative enterprise," says Claude Martin, "it is not something that one organization, however dynamic or well funded, can achieve alone." Experience has taught WWF that lasting conservation success can be achieved only if all those affected by the process benefit from it, and that includes the business community. The organization is now involving the corporate sector in its efforts to introduce environmental change and demonstrate how continued development can become sustainable.    In pursuit of its stated goals of halting net forest loss by the year 2000 and ensuring that all foress, ~le mostbiologically diverse ecosystems on Earth, are managed sustainably, WWF joined timber traders, foresters, certification organizations, indigenous peoples' groups,and environmental institutions in 1994 to establish the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). This body lays down principles for sus tainable forest management and acts as an international master accreditation agency, monitoring, evaluating, and accrediting forestry certification organizations. cont.

<b>Gland, SWITZERLAND:</b> As a conservationist I am often asked whether 
I am optimistic or pessimistic about the future of the earth. It is a 
question almost impossible to answer objectively.
<p>
On the one hand, it is easy to be influenced by the greed and stupidity 
reported daily in the media and from that to reach the conclusion that 
the apparent incorrigibility of human beings makes the environmental 
outlook bleak. Yet on the other hand we must always be conscious of 
humankind's enormous potential for reflecting on the past and deriving 
from such reflection valuable lessons for the future. That must surely 
give cause for hope.
<p>
Of course, the enormous environmental problems we face must  be viewed 
from the perspective of realism. There are many influences, not all of 
them good, on human behaviour and we have to appreciate that people will 
not always do the "right" thing. But pessimism is dangerous because it 
inevitably limits vision, and that in turn will curtail the scope of action.
<p>
So perhaps neither optimism nor pessimism is appropriate when considering 
our ecological future. The simple fact is that man is the earth's only 
problem and yet offers the only possible solution.
<p>
Realising that basic truth, WWF has set itself the task of working to 
recreate the balance between humanity and nature that has been upset by 
the industrialisation and population explosion of the last hundred years. 
We make it clear in our mission statement, which talks specifically about 
helping to "build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature".
<p>
This is a great and noble aim, but is there a similar all-embracing 
vision for the manner of achieving it? No single organization could ever 
complete such a vast undertaking on its own, but there must be something 
that will guide us towards the kind of broad cooperation necessary to 
preserve, restore and sustain the great natural riches that human 
activity threatens to destroy for ever.
<p>
That something, I believe, is the understanding that all the governments, 
scientists, experts, organisations, laws and treaties in the world will 
achieve nothing unless there are free-thinking and freely operating 
individuals in a position to make their own decisions about the future of 
their natural environment.
<p>
Now you would be forgiven for thinking that is a fairly obvious point, 
and perhaps it is. Nevertheless it is the point that is most frequently 
forgotten in environmental debates throughout the world. Indeed, there 
are governments that deliberately ignore it, because a literate and 
well-informed population would represent a threat to their power.
<p>
Yet that kind of population is crucial to the success of all our 
conservation efforts.
<p>
As an example, we might do worse than consider the Indian state of 
Kerala. Larger and more populous than the Netherlands, it is one of the 
poorest regions of India in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per 
head. Measured in other ways, however, the position of Kerala has much to 
tell the rest of us about how we live and function as societies.
<p>
The place looks like a vast garden, showing no sign of the devastation 
apparent in other parts of the sub-continent. Infant mortality is five 
times lower than in the rest of India and life expectancy  at 73 years  
is 13 years above the Indian average. Women slightly outnumber men, which 
is not true of the remainder of the country, where female mortality is 
higher. Virtually all Kerala's villages have clean drinking water and 
health clinics. But above all, population growth is zero.
<p>
All this is striking enough, but there is an even more telling feature of 
life in Kerala. 
<p>
Demographers and sociologists have traced its success back to a single 
factor: the deliberate introduction 30 years ago of education for all, 
including girls. This has produced practically 100 per cent literacy  
double the rate in the rest of India  effective birth control as women 
are given the power to make decisions about themselves, less corruption 
than elsewhere and far more sustainable use of resources. GDP might 
indicate poverty in certain ways, but it does not equate to misery.
<p>
Or, as King Jigme Singye Wangchuck of Bhutan  2,000 kilometres north of 
Kerala  puts it: "Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross 
National Product."
<p>
If that sounds a little too idealistic, let me return to my earlier 
point: humanity and its behaviour, whatever the causes and whether 
conscious or otherwise, is at the centre of what goes on in the world. It 
follows, then, that protecting our natural resources, our biodiversity, 
our landscapes, our wildlife will depend on giving people both the 
knowledge and the power to work out for themselves what is in the best 
interests of their society and its natural environment. Too often the 
destructive choice is forced on them by ignorance, by economic pressures, 
by the daily struggle for survival.
<p>
There is now a growing understanding of the links between the world's 
greatest problems  environmental degradation, population growth, poverty, 
consumption of resources, unemployment and insecurity. What must follow 
from that understanding is a determination to give people the means to 
address all of them. Capacity building, we call it, and it should be the 
main focus of all conservation programmes.
<p>
Humans are both sentient and spiritual beings. I firmly believe that, 
given the choice, they would rather preserve than destroy. Giving them 
that power of choice is what capacity building means.  If we can work 
together to make it happen, we shall have found the best reason for optimism.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Il y a toute une histoire derrire le travail de la 6e de Fregicourt (JU), classe de Jean-Marie Droxler. Le traitement des dchets laissait beaucoup  dsirer dans la rgion de la Baroche, o se situe Fregicourt. Il y a deux ans environ, et sous l'impulsion des autorits communales de Micourt, village voisin, a dbut une vaste action d'information et d'organisation, de tri des dchets, de ramassages slectifs et de cration de composts. Tout de suite ont t impliqus des spcialistes, diverses organisations mais aussi les coles. Or celles-ci ont jou un rle important. Elles ont tudi la question, cr et gr des composts, prpar des panneaux explicatifs et mme tourn une petite vido. 
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Il y aurait beaucoup  dire sur cette exprience mais arrtons-nous plutt sur les dveloppements plus rcents. En automne 1995 les communes de la Baroche allaient voter un nouveau rglement et les taxes qui en dcouleraient pour l'incinration des ordures. Maurice Uhlmann, maire de Micourt et initiateur de tout ce renouveau, voulait vrifier l'impact des informations dlivres et connatre l'attente des gens. Il a donc propos  M. Droxler de raliser une enqute avec ses lves,  ce qu'aussi bien le matre que les lves ont immdiatement accept.

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">
Enqute sur les dchets dans la Baroche
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
La premire tape du travail a consist dans l'tablissement d'un questionnaire. Vu le contexte, les objectifs taient d'emble clairs. Mais il s'agissait de trouver de bonnes formulations et une mise en page utile.
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Il fallait ensuite raliser les entretiens. 2 par 2, les 13 lves se sont rendus dans 332 foyers, ce qui reprsente presque toute la population de la Baroche. Au cours des rencontres, ils ne se satisfaisaient pas de mettre des croix dans les cases prvues, mais ils donnaient de nombreuses explications, par exemple sur ce qui tait ou non compostable. La population s'est montre trs sensible  cette dmarche: dj le ramassage suivant rvlait un tri nettement plus consciencieux! Quant au grand travail que ces interviews a reprsent, il s'est tendu sur plusieurs semaines et a donn lieu  toute une dynamique dans la classe.
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Venait ensuite la mise en commun des rsultats: pourcentages, manipulation du rapporteur, graphiques circulaires, etc. Cette action a parfois entran la classe  dpasser le programme prvu par l'cole!
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
En conclusion, la classe  a pu fournir des chiffres sur l'tat de la rcupration de papier et de dchets organiques dans la rgion et numrer les problmes et les souhaits exprims.
<BR>
</FONT></B>

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Le lien entre le travail d'une classe et les besoins de la socit a t exceptionnel.  M. Uhlmann ne s'est-il pas appuy sur les rsultats de cette enqute dans les soires d'information qu'il a organises dans les communes de la Baroche,  la veille du vote mentionn plus haut? Les donnes recueillies n'ont-elles pas jou leur rle dans la mise au point d'une nouvelle "politique des dchets"? Et ce n'est pas termin. Il est prvu que les jeunes spcialistes, que sont devenus les lves, se rendent chez les particuliers qui en ont fait la demande, pour les assister dans le dmarrage de leurs composts.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
C'est le bon moment! Prvoyez maintenant de transformer vos lves en experts de la bioindication et votre salle de classe en station de mesure de l'ozone troposphrique. Il s'agit de cultiver du trfle en pots, de l'exposer au soleil  l'approche de l't et d'y observer les dgts d  l'ozone qui ,cette anne encore, ne manquera de se produire. Les fidles de Panda Profs reconnaissaient la mthode Ozone et trfle.
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Ces dernires annes il a toujours beaucoup t question de l'ozone  la belle saison. C'est en effet  cette poque que se forme ce gaz toxique qui endommage les plantes et empoisonne l'air que nous respirons. Sa concentration avait lgrement diminu en 1992 et 1993 grce notamment  divers efforts (catalyseurs, nouveaux solvants, etc.) mais, avec l't trs chaud de 1994, la tendance s'est inverse.  Il est plus qu'vident que le problme demeure.
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
 Le WWF a mis au point une mthode de travail  permettant de sensibiliser les enfants aux problmes lis  l'ozone - sa nature, sa provenance, ses effets - et de rflchir  nos possibilits d'action. La principale activit propose  est une exprience concrte qui rend visible les effets de ce gaz: une mthode de bioindication  l'aide de trfle blanc. 
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">
La mthode de bioindication
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Quelle est en bref cette activit? En vous procurant le matriel Ozone et trfle, vous recevez quatre sachets de semence de l'espce de trfle appele California. Celui-ci ragit  l'ozone de basse atmosphre par la formation de points caractristiques. Il constitue donc un bon bioindicateur de ce gaz polluant. Aprs l'avoir cultiv selon les indications fournies, vos lves en trieront les feuilles en trois catgories: "saines", "endommages par l'ozone", "ayant subi d'autres dommages". Ils auront vu de leurs yeux, la nocivit de l'ozone! Selon le calendrier que vous aurez russi  prvoir, ils auront observ l'volution de ces dommages.
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
En plus, grce aux activit d'accompagnement qui vous seront proposes dans un cahier annex, ils pourront en avoir appris beaucoup sur la double question de l'ozone (trou dans la couche d'ozone, haute atmosphre - smog d't, basse atmosphre). Toute cette problmatique est aborde sous une grande varit de formes de travail: lecture de presse, dessins, interviews, etc.
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Il faut savoir que l'exprience s'tend sur une priode relativement longue. A compter  partir de l'installation de vos pots et de la semence des graines jusqu' une premire observation de chacun des pots, il faut compter 12 semaines. L'exprience pourrait ensuite se poursuivre tout l't.
</FONT></B>
<P>

Evaluation
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
En 1994 la mthode Ozone et trfle a constitu une campagne dans les coles de toute la Suisse. Prs de 7000 lves de plus de 400 classes y ont particip. C'est dire que la mthode est prouve. Elle convient le plus aisment  des lves ds l'ge de 12 - 13 ans, mais des enfants plus jeunes ont ralis l'exprience avec intrt et plaisir. Certains se sont intresss davantage  la culture et la croissance du trfle, mais beaucoup ont aim comprendre ce qu'tait cet ozone dont ils entendaient parler et nombreuses ont t les affiches ou autres voies d'expression pour communiquer leurs ractions.

Chouette chevche

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
De l'information et 12 actions sont prsentes pour connatre et mieux protger la chouette chevche. Car attention, la chouette aux yeux d'or connat un dclin inquitant en Europe. Historiquement, elle a profit des grands dfrichements effectus par les hommes depuis le nolithique. On la trouve du bassin mditerranen au sud de la Sude ainsi qu'en Ecosse. Mais aujourd'hui, les activits humaines qui antrieurement lui taient favorables sont  l'origine de sa rgression.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Face  ce dclin, que faire? Une des actions proposes dans cette brochure consiste  sauver les vieux arbres susceptibles d'accueillir un couple de chevche, ces oiseaux sans domicile fixe qui aiment habiter dans un arbre creux, le trou d'un mur ou une falaise. Une autre action recommande d'informer le public sur les dangers des pesticides qui diminuent le nombre d'insectes. En effet ils diminuent du mme coup la nourriture de la chevche. Vous trouverez encore maintes actions pour protger cet animal.

Nous avons fait l'enqute: vous tes en majorit chargs d'lves de 8  11 ans, vous apprciez Panda Profs et vous ralisez les activits proposes dans une mesure rjouissante.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Voici plus d'un lustre que je suis la rdactrice de votre journal et que je ne pouvais donner que des rponses trs approximatives aux questions de savoir qui vous tes et ce que vous attendez de Panda Profs. Mais  prsent le voile se lve! Guy Muller, statisticien et homme de communication, a men  bien une enqute tlphonique auprs de 100 personnes dtermines au hasard parmi vous. Le seul critre respect lors du choix des personnes  atteindre tait une rpartition cantonale conforme  votre distribution gographique. L'enqute s'est tendue sur les six cantons romands, la Berne francophone et le canton du Tessin. Voici quelques-unes des informations qui en ressortent.
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="Helvetica">
Qui tes-vous?
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Les Vaudois viennent en tte puisqu'ils reprsentent presque un tiers des abonns  Panda Profs. Le deuxime tiers est constitu par les Genevois et, chose inattendue, les Tessinois. Suivent dans le troisime tiers les cinq autres cantons concerns.
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Comme il fallait s'y attendre, une grande majorit d'entre vous travaille dans l'enseignement. 2 sur 3 de vos lves sont gs de 8  11 ans. Viennent ensuite les 12 ans avec 1 enfant sur 5 et enfin les 6-7 ans avec prs de 1 enfant sur 7. Je sais que certains parmi vous enseignent  des lves plus gs, mais peu nombreux, vous avez chapp au sondage. Vous aussi pouvez tirer parti de notre matriel. Certaines de nos offres vous ont destines.

Second point trs rjouissant: vous considrez presque tous le look du journal comme attrayant. Un quart d'entre vous relve spontanment que la prsentation a gagn  tre modifie (il y a deux ans et demi) - bravo  Christine Serex, la graphiste. A noter que vous tes nombreux  exprimer le dsir de voir plus de couleur, en tant toutefois conscients du surcot que cela induirait. On verra si un jour...

</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Qu'en est-il des petits dossiers pdagogiques contenus dans Panda Profs? Une partie des rponses est contenue dans les graphiques reproduits ci-contre. Si une minorit d'entre vous n'a pas d'opinion sur l'intrt des activits proposes, c'est qu'elle fait partie de ceux qui n'ont - ou ne prennent - gure le temps de lire le journal. Car par ailleurs vous tes une majorit crasante  les trouver intressantes.
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Toutefois trouver de l'intrt  ces activits ne signifie pas pour autant les raliser. Disons d'abord que pour prs d'un sur cinq d'entre vous elles sont inadaptes ou hors programme. Pour les quatre cinquimes restant la situation n'est pas la mme selon l'ge de vos lves. Globalement, les enseignants des 8 - 9  ans ont le plus recours aux activits proposes,   quelque rythme que ce soit, qu'ils les ralisent, mme en utilisant les photocopies ou ne font que s'en inspirer. Ils sont suivis par ceux des 10 - 11 ans. Educateurs des 6 - 7 ans, une bonne proportion d'entre vous ralise les activits proposes, mais vous tes particulirement nombreux  vous en inspirer  sans les appliquer telles quelles. Pour les enseignants des 12 ans relevons ceci:  vous tes encore un nombre tout  fait acceptable  tirer parti des activits mais les photocopies correspondent moins  votre travail et vous les utilisez peu. Certains d'entre vous s'en inspirent pour en fabriquer d'autres.

L'informatique
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Un dernier point: nous avons profit de cette enqute pour avoir une ide de vos besoins dans le domaine de l'informatique. Or on constate que si les 6 - 7 ans ne sont pas encore touchs par ce phnomne, la demande augmente avec l'ge de vos lves et elle augmente surtout pour les CD ROM et donc pour un travail interactif  l'ordinateur. Nous y rflchissons!
<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Helvetica">
Le bilan de cette enqute est positif. Merci  tous les interpells d'avoir t prts  rpondre aux questions. En tant que responsable du Service pdagogique et de ce journal, je vais m'efforcer d'en tirer les meilleures conclusions.

<b><font size=2>A FOREST STRATEGY</font></b>

<p>

Making progress from the current position will need commitment, cooperation and resources. IUCN and WWF have identified five 
priority objectives to halt and reverse the decline in the global forest estate. These are presented below, along with positions on a variety of specific issues. They are not listed in order of priority.

<p>

It is important to stress that, although IUCN and  WWF are principally known as conservation organisations, both are well aware 
that the needs of the environment cannot be addressed in isolation from human needs. Any forest policy that does not take full a
ccount of the needs and desires of local people, including indigenous people, is both unacceptable and ultimately unworkable. The principle of participation of local and indigenous people in forest conservation and management therefore underpins the following strategy.

<p><br>

<dl>

<dd><a href="page1-1.htm"><b>Objective 1: </b></a> 

<br>

Establishment of a network of ecologically - representative protected areas.

<p>

<dd><a href="page1-2.htm"><b>Objective 2:</b></a> 

<br>
 
Environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable forest management outside protected areas.

<p>

<dd><a href="page1-3.htm"><b>Objective 3:</b></a>  

<br>

Development and implementation of ecologically and socially appropriate forest restoration programmes.

<p>

<dd><a href="page1-4.htm"><b>Objective 4:</b></a>  

<br>

Reduction of forest damage from global change, including a decrease of pollution below damage thresholds, as measured by critical loads.

<p>

<dd><a href="page1-5.htm"><b>Objective 5:</b></a> 

<br>

Use of forest goods and services at levels that do not damage 
the environment, including elimination of wasteful consumption, to attain a level of use of forest goods and services within the regenerative capacity of the forest estate.

The pulp and paper industry might be justified in feeling under environmental siege at the moment. No sooner had companies
started
responding to public fears about water pollution and organochlorine contamination than demands for greater recycling began to
be heard... </font>

<br>
 
We have drawn a necessarily depressing picture of the state of the world's forests. The problems are large and, worse still, they appear to be getting more serious. The Earth Summit,
 in June 1992, represented a high point in terms of hopes and ideals about the future of the 
world's forests, with agreement of the Forest Principles and international commitment to address problems of forest loss and degradation. Yet since then, it could be argued that the spirit of the Earth Summit has failed in five ways:

<p>

<ul type=square>

<li>	continued and/or accelerated rates of deforestation;

<br>

<li>	the spread of rapid forest loss to previously stable or untouched areas;

<br>

<li>	widespread attempts by industry to reverse or undermine conservation legislation;

<br>

<li>	failure to achieve equity between North and South in forest policy;

<br>

<li>	failure to use existing legal instruments to halt forest loss.

</ul>

<p>

However, the news is not all bad. Positive progress has been made, and continues to be made, in the wake of UNCED, including:

<p>

<ul type=square>

<li>	development of a series of more-or-less positive international forest initiatives around the world;

<br>

<li>	rapid progress towards independent certification of forest products;

<br>

<li>	changes in forest practice by some major forest products companies;

<br>

<li>	increasing support for sustainable forest management amongst consumers, politicians and business people;

<br>

<li>	agreement of integrated forest protection networks in an increasing number of countries. 

</ul>

Since 1992 the annual rate of deforestation in the Amazon has increased 34%. But by supporting pro-environment legislation 
around the world WWF is attempting to reverse that trend.

<p>
Recently, the Brazilian Congress named Senator Odacir
Soares to head an examining committee to analyze a
Provisional Measure issued by the Goverment aimed at
protecting 80% of all Amazonian forests from clear cutting.
 A favorable review from the this examining committee 
will play an essential role in helping the measure achieve permanent status. Unfortunately, this much needed provision will 
likely face strong opposition in the Brazilian Congress.
<p>
WWF is asking for your help. Please send an email message to Brazilian 
Senator Odacir Soares saying that you support the provisional measure to stop clear cutting in the Amazonian forests.

      <b>22nd November 1996</b>
      <h2>Irish Timber Industry to Adopt Certification</h2>
<p>  
DUBLIN, Ireland - The Irish timber industry should adopt forest 
certification to protect the domestic timber market and to end 
its part in the devastation of tropical forests in Africa, IWFA - Irish Woodworkers For Africa said today.
<p>
At the Wood For Life Conference hosted by IWFA and supported by WWF - World Wide Fund for Nature and the Forest Stewardship 
Council (FSC), delegates from the Irish timber industry, government and environmental organisations were urged to follow the 
example of WWF-UKs 1995 Plus Group, a Buyers Group committed to the purchase of wood and wood  products from independently 
certified  forests, and to form and Irish Buyers Group.
<p>
"Timber certification is really taking off now as more than four million cubic metres of certified timber enter the 
international trade each year," said Francis Sullivan, Leader of  WWFs Global Forests For Life Campaign.  "The Irish 
industry now has the chance to make its mark by creating an Irish Buyers Group and buying timber from independently 
certified forests."
<p>
Thirty acres of African forests are destroyed every day to meet the needs of the Irish furniture and joinery industry as 
over 70 000 tons of tropical timber are imported into Ireland each year.  "To ensure that African forests are protected and 
productive in the long term, the timber industry must import wood only from certified forests or use Irish-grown 
alternatives from certified sources," Tom Roche, IWFA.  The Irish Government currently invests development aid in Africa but 
this is being undermined by Irish timber importation practises.  IWFA is calling on the government to direct its development 
aid at specific African countries to encourage sustainable forest management and the use of certification.
<p>
More than 70 companies belong to WWFs 1995 Plus Group including timber traders (e.g. C Blumsom Ltd.), furniture 
manufacturers (e.g. Chindwell Doors), retailers (e.g. Boots The Chemist and B&Q plc) and stationers (e.g. W H Smith).
<p>
<b>Notes to Editors</b>

<p>
<li>WWFs Forests For Life Campaign has two targets:
<ul type circle>
<li>to establish a network of protected areas covering at least 10 per cent of the
	worlds forest area by the year 2000
<li>the independent certification of at least 10 million hectares of well managed forest 
	by 1998.
</ul>
<p>
<li>The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is an independent, non-profit organisation
      which accredits organisations to certify forests around the world.
<p>
<li>B&Q plc was the first member of WWFs 1995 Plus Group and the first retailer to 
      announce its plans to have all of its wood products certified under the FSC scheme.  It

MEMBRE JUNIOR ET AMI(E) DE LA NATURE, </CENTER></H2>


<FONT SIZE=2>Enfin un nouveau PANDA JUNIOR ! Un &quot;vrai&quot; journal avec des nouvelles de ton organisation, des reportages dont tu tiendras le r&ocirc;le principal, une page d'activit&eacute;s, une fiche concernant une esp&egrave;ce menac&eacute;e et beaucoup d'autres choses encore... et ceci tous les deux mois.
<p>
R&eacute;nover le PANDA Junior a &eacute;t&eacute; possible gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'appui d'UAB, une compagnie d'assurances qui pense que la nature doit &ecirc;tre prot&eacute;g&eacute;e et son avenir assur&eacute;, tout comme celui des gens qui s'assurent aupr&egrave;s d'UAB. Offrir son soutien au WWF coulait donc de source pour cette soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<p>
Le WWF collabore &eacute;galement avec UAB dans le cadre de son Prix Nature, qui r&eacute;compensera cette ann&eacute;e-ci les plus z&eacute;l&eacute;s d'entre vous qui, seuls ou avec toute la classe, dessineront la nature dans et autour de l'&eacute;cole suivant le principe &quot;avant-apr&egrave;s&quot;, l' &quot;apr&egrave;s&quot; devant repr&eacute;senter l'&eacute;cole &quot;id&eacute;ale&quot;. N'h&eacute;site pas : va voir la derni&egrave;re page et inscris-toi le plus rapidement possible.
<p>
Mais nous t'avons encore r&eacute;serv&eacute; une autre surprise : si tu parviens &agrave; faire un nouveau membre Junior parmi tes copains, cousins ou cousines, tu recevras un splendide manchot en peluche, mascotte d'UAB !  Tu d&eacute;couvriras en page 8 comment t'y prendre, mais n'attends pas trop longtemps : seuls les 500 premiers &quot;parrains&quot; seront r&eacute;compens&eacute;s!
<p>
Nous te souhaitons beaucoup de plaisir &agrave; la d&eacute;couverte de ton nouveau PANDA Junior et n'h&eacute;site pas &agrave; nous faire savoir ce que tu en penses!

<a name="2"><H2><CENTER>LES GORILLES DE MONTAGNE
A NOUVEAU EN DANGER </CENTER></h2></a>


<FONT SIZE=2>En 1995, huit gorilles de montagne ont &eacute;t&eacute; tu&eacute;s. Cela faisait pourtant 10 ans que plus aucun gorille n'avait &eacute;t&eacute; tu&eacute; par des hommes.
<p>
Les gorilles de montagne ne vivent que dans la r&eacute;gion volcanique qui s'&eacute;tend sur le Za&iuml;re, le Rwanda et l'Ouganda et il n'en reste plus que 600.
<p>
Les causes de ces massacres ne sont pas toujours claires. La guerre qui a d&eacute;vast&eacute; le Rwanda pourrait &ecirc;tre l'une des raisons : de nombreux r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s traversent le domaine des gorilles et certains d'entre eux sont arm&eacute;s...
<p>
Il arrive aussi que des braconniers tuent des gorilles adultes pour s'emparer des b&eacute;b&eacute;s et les vendre car les petits gorilles sont vendus tr&egrave;s chers (&agrave; certains zoos ou &eacute;leveurs peu scrupuleux... ). On pense aussi que certaines personnes veulent mettre en difficult&eacute; l'&eacute;conomie du Za&iuml;re, du Rwanda et de l'Ouganda&nbsp;: comme les nombreux touristes qui venaient voir les gorilles rapportent beaucoup d'argent, s'il n'y a plus de gorilles, le tourisme diminuera et ces pays auront beaucoup moins de rentr&eacute;es financi&egrave;res.
<p>
Les gorilles de montagne n'ont donc pas la vie facile pour le moment. L'homme les menace de plus en plus. Heureusement, le WWF et d'autres organisations continuent &agrave; travailler dur pour prot&eacute;ger ces merveilleux animaux.

<a name="3"><H2><CENTER>BIENVENUE A GUIZI </CENTER></h2></a>


<FONT SIZE=2>Nous sommes tr&egrave;s heureux de t'annoncer la naissance de  Guizi, un b&eacute;b&eacute; panda g&eacute;ant. La maman s'appelle Dong Dong, elle a neuf ans et Guizi est son cinqui&egrave;me b&eacute;b&eacute; en six ans. Le petit b&eacute;b&eacute; devra encore beaucoup grandir car un panda g&eacute;ant adulte mesure environ 1,5 m et p&egrave;se 125 kg alors qu'un petit qui vient de na&icirc;tre n'a qu'une dizaine de centim&egrave;tres et p&egrave;se &agrave; peine 130 gr !
<p>
Guizi est n&eacute; &agrave; Wolong, en Chine. Wolong est une r&eacute;serve naturelle de 200.000 ha o&ugrave; le WWF a construit un centre de recherche pour &eacute;tudier les pandas g&eacute;ants. Car si l'on veut prot&eacute;ger les animaux, il faut savoir le plus pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment possible comment ils vivent. 
<p>
En 1983, le WWF a sauv&eacute; plusieurs pandas g&eacute;ants de la famine et les a recueillis dans ce centre. Mais, apr&egrave;s s'&ecirc;tre r&eacute;tablis, ils paraissaient ne plus pouvoir vivre &agrave; l'&eacute;tat sauvage. C'est pourquoi on les a gard&eacute;s dans le Centre, et le WWF a entam&eacute; un programme d'&eacute;levage. Avec succ&egrave;s !
<p>
Le petit Guizi devra maintenant apprendre &agrave; vivre dans la nature, avec bien d'autres pandas g&eacute;ants qui sont n&eacute;s dans le Centre. Apr&egrave;s cette p&eacute;riode d'apprentissage, il sera rel&acirc;ch&eacute;... et devra se d&eacute;brouiller tout seul.

<a name="4"><H2><CENTER>L'AVENIR DES TORTUES DE
MER RESTE SOMBRE </CENTER></h2></a>


<FONT SIZE=2>De nombreuses tortues caret (une esp&egrave;ce de tortue de mer) viennent pondre leurs oeufs sur la plage de l'&icirc;le grecque de Zakynthos. Malheureusement, elles sont de plus en plus effray&eacute;es par les touristes qui viennent sur la plage pour bronzer, jouer et faire beaucoup de bruit et, le soir, par les projecteurs des bars.
<p>
Sur la plage de Sekania, une route a &eacute;t&eacute; ill&eacute;galement construite... pour permettre aux touristes de venir plus nombreux. Depuis lors, de moins en moins de femelles viennent enfouir leurs oeufs dans le sable et la survie de cette esp&egrave;ce de tortue de mer semble tr&egrave;s menac&eacute;e.
<p>
Dans le Panda Junior n&#176;33 (ancienne version), nous te demandions d'envoyer une lettre de protestation, avec l'aide de tes parents ou de ton instituteur, au Ministre grec de l'Environnement et au Pr&eacute;fet de l'&icirc;le. En un mois, 1200 belges (et parmi eux bon nombre de Juniors) se sont ru&eacute;s sur leur stylo. Et les Juniors du WWF-Pays-Bas (qui ont eu plus de temps) ont remis 40.000 cartes postales pour demander que cette route soit ferm&eacute;e.
<p>
Mais nous n'avons, h&eacute;las, pas encore de bonnes nouvelles : la route ill&eacute;gale reste ouverte et les projets de cr&eacute;ation d'un parc naturel marin ont &eacute;t&eacute; rejet&eacute;s.
<p>
Le WWF continue &agrave; se battre pour que les responsables de Zakynthos se rendent compte de l'importance de leurs d&eacute;cisions pour la survie des tortues caret en M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e. Nous te tiendrons bien s&ucirc;r au courant de la suite des &eacute;v&eacute;nements.

FICHE </CENTER>
</h2></a>

<H3>Un peu d'histoire...</H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Le panda g&eacute;ant a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;couvert seulement en 1869. Il ne vit que dans le centre de la Chine, dans les for&ecirc;ts d'altitude, entre 1800 et 3500 m&egrave;tres. Une r&eacute;gion presque imp&eacute;n&eacute;trable, ce qui explique qu'il a fallu longtemps aux Europ&eacute;ens pour le d&eacute;couvrir.
</FONT>


<H3>... et de latin </H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Le nom latin scientifique du panda g&eacute;ant est <I>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</I>. <I>Melanoleuca </I>signifie &quot;noir-blanc&quot; : tu devines certainement pourquoi! <I>Ailuropoda</I> signifie &quot;avec des pieds comme l'<I>Ailurus</I>&quot; parce que les pattes du panda g&eacute;ant ressemblent &agrave; celles de l'<I>Ailurus fulgens</I>, le petit panda.
<p>
Pendant longtemps, les scientifiques ne parvenaient pas &agrave; d&eacute;cider &agrave; quelle famille appartenait le panda g&eacute;ant. Les savants chinois pensaient m&ecirc;me qu'il n'&eacute;tait proche d'aucun autre animal. Aujourd'hui, il est admis qu'il fait partie de la famille des ours. En tout cas, le panda g&eacute;ant appartient au groupe des carnivores&#133; bien qu'il se nourrisse surtout de plantes.
</FONT>


<H3>La nature fait bien les choses
</H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Le panda g&eacute;ant a six doigts&nbsp;! Ses cinq doigts &quot;normaux&quot; sont align&eacute;s les uns &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; des autres, et le sixi&egrave;me occupe la m&ecirc;me place que notre pouce. Sans ce sixi&egrave;me doigt, ce serait tr&egrave;s difficile pour lui de cueillir les tiges de bambou.
</FONT>


<H3>Au menu... </H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Le bambou constitue en effet le menu principal du panda g&eacute;ant. Comme il n'y a pas beaucoup d'&eacute;nergie dans le bambou, il doit en manger jusqu'&agrave; 20 kg par jour ! Et comme le bambou est tr&egrave;s dur, il n'est pas facile &agrave; dig&eacute;rer. Le panda g&eacute;ant doit donc consacrer une bonne partie de la journ&eacute;e &agrave; chercher, mastiquer et dig&eacute;rer son repas.
</FONT>


<H3>Vie sociale </H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Les pandas g&eacute;ants peuvent vivre environ 15 ans. D&egrave;s qu'ils ont 5 ou 6 ans, ils peuvent avoir des petits. La plupart du temps, ils n'ont qu'un petit &agrave; la fois. La maman s'occupe seule de l'&eacute;ducation du jeune panda : apr&egrave;s six mois, il peut se d&eacute;brouiller tout seul et la m&egrave;re et son petit se s&eacute;parent. Les pandas g&eacute;ants vivent toujours seuls.
</FONT>


<H3>S.O.S. </H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Le panda g&eacute;ant est une esp&egrave;ce menac&eacute;e : il n'y en a plus que 1000 qui vivent encore en pleine nature, dispers&eacute;s dans 24 territoires s&eacute;par&eacute;s les uns des autres. Leur espace vital se r&eacute;duit sans cesse, parce que de plus en plus d'hommes abattent les for&ecirc;ts pour avoir du bois et pour y faire de l'agriculture, et il reste donc de moins en moins de bambous. De plus, les pandas g&eacute;ants sont parfois tu&eacute;s pour leur magnifique pelage ou bien meurent dans des pi&egrave;ges qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; plac&eacute;s pour attraper d'autres animaux.
<p>
Le bambou lui-m&ecirc;me repr&eacute;sente un probl&egrave;me pour la survie des pandas g&eacute;ants. Une fois que le bambou fleurit - tous les 10 &agrave; 100 ans - il meurt, et il faut bien compter dix ans avant que de nouvelles pousses aient une taille suffisante pour servir de nourriture. Parfois, des for&ecirc;ts enti&egrave;res de bambous disparaissent ainsi et le panda n'a plus de quoi se nourrir.
</FONT>


<H3>Symbole du WWF </H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Le panda g&eacute;ant est naturellement aussi le symbole du WWF. Le symbole des esp&egrave;ces menac&eacute;es et de la nature en danger. Le WWF a d&eacute;j&agrave; investi des millions de francs dans l'&eacute;tude et la protection de cette esp&egrave;ce, et il est bien d&eacute;cid&eacute; &agrave; continuer tant que cela sera n&eacute;cessaire.

</B></CENTER>
<B>Tu connais s&ucirc;rement l'Op&eacute;ration Sources mais sais-tu que, en octobre 1995, 1300 classes de 5&egrave; et 6&egrave; primaire y ont particip&eacute; ? L'&eacute;cole n&#176;14 de Schaerbeek nous a envoy&eacute; un petit reportage sur &quot;leur&quot; Op&eacute;ration Sources, qui a m&ecirc;me &eacute;t&eacute; suivie par une journaliste du journal &quot;Le Soir&quot;.
</B>


<H3><CENTER>LA FONTAINE D'AMOUR </CENTER>
</H3>


<FONT SIZE=2>Nous sommes all&eacute;s &agrave; la source de la fontaine d'Amour, au parc Josaphat. Avant, nous avions lu les l&eacute;gendes de cette fontaine. Il y en a deux. Dans la premi&egrave;re, c'est un homme qui s'y noie parce que sa fianc&eacute;e l'a quitt&eacute; et dans l'autre, c'est une jeune fille qui a tellement pleur&eacute; parce que son ami l'a quitt&eacute;e, qu'elle est devenue aveugle et l'eau de la source lui a rendu la vue.
<p>
A la source, nous &eacute;tions accompagn&eacute;s par une journaliste et un photographe, par quelqu'un du WWF et une dame qui repr&eacute;sentait les eaux de SPA.
<p>
En &eacute;quipe, on a mesur&eacute; la temp&eacute;rature : 10&#176;C, et la teneur en nitrates : 3 &eacute;quipes ont mesur&eacute; 100 mg/l et une entre 100 et 250 mg/l. Nous avons aussi trac&eacute; les plans, pr&egrave;s de la source, en amont et en aval.
<p>
La fontaine d'Amour est pollu&eacute;e, pourquoi ? On pense que c'est peut-&ecirc;tre &agrave; cause de toute la circulation sur le boulevard qui passe juste au-dessus . On se demande ce que l'on peut faire pour que l'eau redevienne potable. Ensuite, nous avons compl&eacute;t&eacute; les rapports et on les a renvoy&eacute;s au WWF. On retournera au printemps !

ACTION ! </CENTER></h2></a>


<FONT SIZE=2>A Brecht, pr&egrave;s d'Anvers, on s'occupe aussi beaucoup de prot&eacute;ger la nature. Ce sont les &eacute;l&egrave;ves de l' <I>Ortho-pedagogish Centrum Kristus Koning</I> qui ont lanc&eacute; le mouvement.
<p>
Tout &agrave; commenc&eacute; par une grande action de nettoyage au cours de laquelle les jeunes de cette &eacute;cole flamande ont enlev&eacute; les immondices qui tra&icirc;naient dans les bois. Leur enthousiasme a &eacute;t&eacute; tellement contagieux que des milliers d'autres enfants se sont bien vite rang&eacute;s &agrave; leurs c&ocirc;t&eacute;s. Couronnement de l'op&eacute;ration : la f&ecirc;te de l'environnement qui a eu lieu &agrave; la fin de l'ann&eacute;e scolaire. En organisant des jeux, une balade dans la nature et des stands d'informations, les enfants ont pu sensibiliser les gens aux probl&egrave;mes qui menacent la nature dans leur r&eacute;gion.
<p>
Mais ils ne se sont pas arr&ecirc;t&eacute;s l&agrave;. Aujourd'hui, ils ont d&eacute;cid&eacute; de lancer une action en faveur des nombreux espaces naturels menac&eacute;s des environs. En envoyant des lettres de plainte au gouverneur, ils esp&egrave;rent faire entendre leur avis. Ils ont &eacute;galement balis&eacute; un itin&eacute;raire pour cyclistes aux alentours afin de permettre &agrave; tout le monde de d&eacute;couvrir ces coins de paradis qui risquent de dispara&icirc;tre.
<p>
<B>Avis aux amateurs...
<p>
</B>Si toi et tes copains, dans votre commune ou dans votre &eacute;cole, vous menez des actions pour prot&eacute;ger la nature, n'h&eacute;sitez pas &agrave; nous envoyer un petit reportage. Peut-&ecirc;tre les autres Juniors auront-ils la chance de d&eacute;couvrir vos actions dans leur prochain Panda Junior.
<p>
Comme tu le vois, nous avons beaucoup plus de place dans ce nouveau Panda Junior pour publier les oeuvres de nos membres. Aussi, nous t'encourageons &agrave; nous envoyer tes dessins, tes petites histoires, tes jeux, tes r&eacute;bus, tes mots crois&eacute;s et toutes tes id&eacute;es originales. N'oublie pas d'indiquer tes nom, adresse, num&eacute;ro de membre et &acirc;ge sur tout ce que tu nous envoies. Vas-y, donne libre cours &agrave; ta cr&eacute;ativit&eacute; ! Adresse le tout au WWF, R&eacute;daction, chauss&eacute;e de Waterloo 608, 1060 Bruxelles. Nous attendons avec impatience de tes nouvelles.
<p>
Thomas, Tom, Trevor, Bas, Jasper, Leroy, Kasper et Micha&euml;l, de Deurne, ont fond&eacute; le club &quot;Chez la Loutre&quot;. Avec la vente de leurs dessins et d'un petit journal qu'ils ont fait eux-m&ecirc;mes, ils ont r&eacute;colt&eacute; 4000 francs qu'ils ont offerts au WWF ! Merci beaucoup, les enfants !
<p>
Les Amis de la Nature ont r&eacute;cemment offert 6000 F au WWF. Els, Melody, Mona et Sabrina ont r&eacute;alis&eacute; elles-m&ecirc;mes des cartes postales, des mouchoirs, des maniques, des signets et des bijoux qu'elles ont vendus au profit du WWF. Merci du fond du coeur !
<p>
Ces beaux z&egrave;bres nous ont &eacute;t&eacute; envoy&eacute;s par Evelyne Van Landeghem, 11 ans, de Hamme. Beau travail, Evelyne, et... merci !
<p>
Eva Witters, 12 ans, de Kalmthout, nous soumet cette &eacute;nigme-labyrinthe. A toi de d&eacute;chiffrer le code secret (tu trouveras la solution au bas de la page).
<p>
Griet Van Cauenberge a 9 ans et a dessin&eacute; pour nous ce magnifique papillon et ces beaux petits cygnes. Bravo Griet !

<FONT SIZE=2>En 30 pages grand format avec des dessins tout en couleurs, ce superbe livre te r&eacute;v&egrave;le les merveilles cach&eacute;es de la nature. Tu entres dans la cabane du castor, la ruche des abeilles ou la termiti&egrave;re. Tu d&eacute;couvres les animaux et les plantes de l'Antarctique et de l'Arctique, de la for&ecirc;t tropicale, des plages, du fond des oc&eacute;ans... Certains dessins sont de v&eacute;ritables posters : ainsi, pour d&eacute;couvrir l'Arctique aux pages 20 et 21, tu dois d'abord d&eacute;plier les pages 18 et 19. Une fois d&eacute;pli&eacute;es, quel spectacle ! Des animaux qui vivent sur la banquise &agrave; ceux qui vivent sous la glace, tu peux tout observer. Cet ouvrage, que tu ne pourras plus quitter, est publi&eacute; aux &eacute;ditions Gallimard Jeunesse et co&ucirc;te 650 F.

Ce livre fait partie de la collection des &quot;Encyclopoches&quot;, publi&eacute;e chez Hachette. Dans la m&ecirc;me collection, d'autres livres traitent des insectes, des arbres...

          Outside the industerialised west no-one has to be told to respect their elders.  It's simply the way society is organised.
<p>
     Which is why WWF - World Wide Fund For Nature tries to work with older people in the villages of the rainforests.  With WWF's help, they learn to teach the younger members of their communities about conservation.

          In Kafue Flats, Zambia, it's Chief Hamusonde (93).
Chief Bakary (78), is our man in Anjavimihavanana, northern Madagascar.
     
In Ban Klong Sai, Thailand, we invoke the Venerable Paparo Bhikkhu, seventy-three year old chief Buddhist monk.
<p>
This isn't just expediency, it's how WWF believes conservation projects should be run.
Before you teach someone, we believe you have to learn from them.
<p>
We spend years visiting village after village, talking to the people, listening to them, living their lives.
Only then are we able to gain the confidence of the village elders.   
Once they realise we're on their side, our elderly converts put forward the argument for conservation with a zeal that belies their years.
<p>
"Uncle" Prom (68), another of our Thai community leaders, tells us that he frequently gets scolded when he starts telling people in the market that they should leave the forests alone.
<p>
But he gets results.
<p>
Uncle Prom and his fellow villagers recently managed to prevent a new logging concession, and set up a community forest where tree felling is now forbidden.
<p>
Ninety-three year old Chief Hamusonde also makes things happen.
Income from the Kafue Flats game reserve in Zambia is funding a school, a clinic and new water boreholes for the local villages.
<p>
In Madagascar, seventy-eight year old Chief Bakary's village makes a profit by selling fruit grown in their new tree nursery.

More importantly, Chief Bakary's village now takes fewer trees from the rainforest because the nursery can provide firewood and poles for construction.
<p>
Not that we don't believe in catching them while they're young.  WWF also organises special training courses to help teachers incorporate conservation into the curriculum.
<p>
20,000 primary teachers in Madagascar have already taken part.  And WWF produces teaching aids as well as teachers.
<p>
We commission educational fact sheets, booklets, posters and video in over twenty different languages.  These are distributed to schools and colleges all over the world.
<p>
If you can help our work with a donation or a legacy please <a href="http://www.panda.org/wwf/feedback.htm">write to the membership officer</a> or <a href="http://www.panda.org/cgi-bin/mozcheck.pl?NetscapeURL=https://www.newmedium.com/wwf/join/join.htm&OtherURL=http://www.panda.org/wwf/join/join.htm">support WWF through our online form</a>.
<p>
You only have to look around you to see that the world still has an awful lot to learn about conservation.

When thousands of trees are being destroyed in the rainforests every minute, how can the planting of ten seedlings make any difference?
<p>
A WWF - World Wide Fund For Nature tree nursery addresses the problems that sometimes force people to chop down trees.
<p>
Where hunger or poverty is the reason for deforestation, we can provide fruit trees.
<p>
The villagers of Mugunga, Zaire, for example, eat papaya and magoes from WWF trees.  And rather than having to sell timber to buy other food, they can now sell surplus fruit.
<p>
          Where trees are chopped down for firewood, WWF and the local people plant 




<td width=10></td>
<td valign=top  width=145>
<font size=2>  
fast-growing tree species      to form a renewable source of fuel .
<p>  
     
This has been particularly valuable in the Inpenetrable Forest, Uganda, where indigenous hardwoods take two hundred years to mature.  <em>Markhamia lotea</em> trees planted by WWF and local villagers can be harvested after as little as five or six years.
<p>
Where trees are chopped down for us in construction, as in Panama and Pakistan, we supply other fast-growing varieties.  These tree nurseries form just part of our work with the people of the tropical forests.
<p>
WWF sponsors students from developing countries on an agroforestry course at UPAZ University in
     

<td width=10></td>  
<td valign=top  width=145>
<font size=2>
 Costa Rica, where WWF provides technical advice        on growing and improving grain and vegetable crops.
<p>  
Unless help is available, "slash and burn" farming methods deplete the nutrients in soil very quickly.  New tracts of tropical forest would then have to be cleared every two or three years.
<p>
This unnecessary waste of resources can be prevented by combining modern techniques with traditional practices to enable the same plot of land to be used over and over again.
<p>
In La Planada, Colombia, our experimental farm demonstrates how these techniques can be used to grow a family's food on a      small four hectare plot. (Instead of clearing the 


<td width=10></td>
<td valign=top  width=145>
<font size=2>
usual ten hectares of dense rainforest.)
<p>  
WWF fieldworkers are now involved in over 100 different tropical forest projects in 45 countries.  The idea behind this work is that the use of natural resources should be sustainable.
<p>
WWF is calling for the rate of deforestation in the tropics to be halved by 1997, and for there to be no net deforestation by the year 2000.

	Its not quite so odd when you understand how the weather is affected by deforestation.
<p>	Up to seventy-five per cent of the rainfall in the Amazon rainforest is recycled from tree to tree.
	Water circulates up from the roots, into the atmosphere through leaves, and back down to another trees roots as rain.
	In this way, one area of forest passes on moisture to the next as though it were part of a huge conveyor belt.
<p>	By the time air masses reach the Andes Mountains in the west, they still contain as much water as when they first crossed the Atlantic coast over fifteen hundred miles away.
<P>	Unless man breaks the chain.
<p>	Thousands and thousand of trees are removed from this natural irrigation system every minute.
<p>	Yet even small changes in the timing or severity of rainfall can have a disproportionate impact on the environment.  Trees fail to bear fruit, animals starve, and the people who live in the rainforests go hungry.
<P>	The deforested areas that cause the problem fare no better.  Without a canopy of leaves to protect the rainforest floor, what rain there is washes away the precious topsoil.
<p>	A study in the Cote dIvoire showed that the soil loss on a hectare of forested slope was 30 kg a year.  On a similar deforested slope, the loss was 138 tonnes.
</td>
<td valign=top width=10></td>
<td valign=top  width=235>
<font size=2>
	And with no sponge-like blanket of fallen leaves to release water in dry spells, or tree roots to help absorb sudden deluges, the effects of the weather become more extreme.
<p>	In December 1988, four hundred and fifty people died during floods in Thailand.  There would have been no floods had the local rainforest remained intact.
<p>	But its not realistic to simply tell everyone to stop chopping down trees; so what can we do about it?
<p>	At Government level, WWF - World Wildlife Fund For Nature, negotiates to change the way we exploit the rainforests.
	On the ground, WWF funds the training of rubber tappers in the northeastern Brazilian Amazon so that rubber extraction does no harm to the rainforest.
<p>	In Thailand, WWF provides seedlings for village tree nurseries.
	In Panama, we fund the work of the Kuna Yala Indians who mange their rainforest territory as a nature reserve.
	In Costa Rica, we are researching ways of felling and removing trees for timber without damaging other trees growing around them.
<p>	These are just some of over 100 WWF tropical forest projects in 45 countries.  Its not enough.  A lot more needs to be done.

	Somewhere in Africa, there is a rainforest that is not being cut, bulldozed, or burned.  The evolution of its plant species continues unchecked, and its wildlife are not being hunted to extinction.
<IMG SRC="/graphics/om_4a.gif" align=left>
<p>	This forest is called Korup.  It is situated in the South West province of Cameroon, and covers an area approximately the size of Greater London.

<p>	In a world full of black predictions about our environment, Korup represents a beacon of optimism.
<p>	A project is underway here, run by the Cameroon government and by WWF.  It is one of only a handful of schemes anywhere in the world which demonstrate how a forest can pay for its own protection.
<p>	Korup is one of the oldest, most species-rich rainforests in the world.  Over a quarter of Africas primate species live there.
<p>	It is home to leopards, buffalo and elephants, and a vast number of reptile, amphibian and insect species.
     
</font>
<p>  
<font size="4"><center>    Just another dying forest.</font>   </center>
<font size="2">  
<p> 	Before the Korup National Park Project was set up, this natural wealth was under threat.  One village, Erat, was responsible for killing 7,000 animals a year, largely for export to Nigeria.  The same village has also destroyed 25 square kilometres of surrounding forest with slash and burn agriculture.
<p>	Without the project, Korup would have all but disappeared in a mere 20 years.
<p>	Fortunately, the environment is high on the Cameroon governments list of priorities.  Appreciating what it was in danger of losing, it made Korup into a National Park in 1986, and signed an agreement with WWF for technical assistance to establish and manage the scheme.
<p>	The aim was simple: to protect the forest.
<p>	Actually achieving this was not so simple.  For the people who lived in Korup, hunting and farming were their livelihood.
<p>	No amount of reasoned environmental argument would have persuaded them to stop.
</font>
<p>
<font size="4"><center>    How to save a rainforest.</font>   </center>
<font size="2">
<p>	The task was to provide a sustainable livelihood for these people that did not involve destruction of the forest.  Our solution was to establish two distinct areas of Korup.  One was a core conservation area.  This was to be untouched by hunting or agriculture, and this was the area that became the Korup National Park in 1986.
<p>	The second was an area of good agricultural land surrounding the core area on which the forests inhabitants would live, farm and hunt.  We call this the buffer zone.
<p>	There were six villages like Erat which fell within the new Park boundary.  Obviously they could not be allowed to continue razing trees and slaughtering animals.  The Cameroon government therefore embarked on a scheme of voluntary resettlement of these villages to the more fertile buffer zone.  A delicate task, which required over 3 years of research and planning.
<p>	Committees were established in the relevant villages.  They found that people were prepared to move, provided they could benefit from better soils and improved infrastructural facilities, such as roads, health, education and water supplies.
<p>	(The truth is, these facilities were in precious short supply in the core area of the forest.)
<p>	WWF has a permanent staff in the Cameroon, but also commissions experts from around the world to help the development of the buffer zone.
<p>
</font>
<font size="4"><center>    Farming the Forest.</font>   </center>
<font size="2">
<p>     	 For instance, a virus-resistant cassava, staple diet of the forest inhabitants, will increase yields by over 100%.  Crop rotation will help reduce plant infection.  Tree nurseries have been established to provide fast-growing timber.  And fish are reappearing in the Ndiah river because the villagers have stopped using chemicals to kill them.  These are just a few examples of what has already been done.
<IMG SRC="/graphics/om_4a.gif" align=right>
<p>	The Korup scheme attempts to achieve a workable balance between conservation and economic reality.  Like anything that goes beyond idealism and attempts to do something, it has had its setbacks.  Some of the inhabitants of the forest have resented the move to the buffer zone.  A few of our new crop experiments have failed.  It has been hard to control illegal hunting.
<p>	These are the snags that any pioneering work inevitably faces.  It is easy to highlight the negatives.  But what we are doing here is a positive attempt to provide a blueprint for the saving of natures richest legacy to the human race:  the rainforest.
<p>	The Korup National Park proves it can be done.  And Korup is not the only reason we can look forward to a more optimistic future.
<p>
</font>
<font size="4"><center>   More Reasons for Optimism.</font>   </center>
<font size="2">
    <p>	In the Amazon basin, for example, a team of scientists from WWF are working with the Kayapo people to learn their age-old techniques for sustainable farming within a rainforest.
<p>	The Hunan province of China holds most of the countrys tropical forest.  Yet in the last 20 years that forest area has been halved to some 6,400 square kilometres.  WWF is working with the Chinese forest ministry to help develop a Korup-style management plan here.
<p>	In Sri Lanka, we are advising the government on the protection and cultivation of medicinal plants.  For here, as in so many developing countries, villagers rely on these plants for basic health care.  Like our work in Korup, this is a model for work we would like to promote in many other countries.
<p>	At WWF, we are as aware as anyone of the threat to the planet and to the survival of our children and grandchildren.  Its just that we would rather be doing something, than simply making a noise about it.

<P><font size=5><B>WWF in Peru<BR></B></font><p>
Peru is the largest country in the tropical Andean region. It is extremely
rich in species and biological diversity. Parched coastal deserts with
scanty rainfall on one side, and vast expanses of tropical rainforests make
up its ecosystems. Between these two extremes are dry forests, high
grasslands, dwarf and cloud forests, and snow-capped mountains, some above
6,800 m. Most of Peru's biological diversity is concentrated in the forests
on the eastern slopes of the Andes and in the coastal and marine waters.
<p>
More than 1,600 bird species have been recorded in Peru, half of these in a
single protected area, the Manu National Park. Peru's plankton-rich coastal
and marine systems support a wide variety of fish, shellfish, birds and
marine mammals. Eight species of whales, five species of dolphin, and one
species of porpoise are found in the Peruvian sea. The vast Amazon river is
home to some 9,000 fish species.
<p>
Peru is also home to some 360 mammal species, including endangered ones
such as the yellow-tailed woolly monkey, the jaguar and the giant river
otter. Peru is estimated to have more than five million species of beetles.
On one single tree, scientists once found some 2,000 different insect
species--48 of them ants.
<p>
But much of this is at risk. Logging, poaching, illegal grazing, and oil
exploration are exerting pressures on the environment. Population pressures
have resulted in reckless timber extraction, subsistence farming and cattle
raising, leading to further degradation of the environment. Urbanization has
increased, with 70 per cent of Peruvians having left rural areas for more
lucrative prospects in the cities. Natural resource management is therefore
subjected to commercial gain.
<p>
Peru, along with some other countries of the region, including Paraguay, has
been implicated in  the contraband trade in wildlife and wildlife products.
Nearly a third of all wildlife exports from the developing world come from
South America. This, despite the fact that all the countries involved are
members of CITES.
<p>
WWF has been involved in conservation work in Peru as part of its Hispanic
South America programme. The programme combines protected areas and natural
resource management in certain ecosystems in the region. These include the
Amazon (Rio Abesio National Park, Manu);  high Andes; marine and coastal
areas (Puracas Marine Reserve); and Pacific dry forests (Noroeste Biosphere
Reserve).
<p>
Its conservation work in the Manu Biosphere Reserve in southeastern Peru is
exemplary.  WWF  first became involved in the reserve in 1969. Designated a
World Heritage Site by UNESCO, the park contains a variety of ecosystems.
The Amazonian rainforests, spread over  1.8 million ha in the reserve are
home to a number of mammals, birds, freshwater fishes, amphibians, and
plants. There are 12 other ecosystems as well, ranging from cloud and dwarf
forests to the 4,000 m-high Andean puna (high altitude cold desert).
<p>
WWF is now focusing on the southern buffer zone of the reserve which houses
some 13,000 people. Indiscriminate timber extraction has severely depleted
forest resources. With financial support from Britain's Overseas 
Development 
Agency  and the European Union, WWF is working with the Peruvian 
Foundation 
for the Conservation of Nature and local communities. The aim is to 
develop 
an alternative resource management programme for the region which 
involves 
initiatives such as replanting, animal husbandry, and agroforestry.
<p>
A key component of WWF's activities in Peru is environmental education. WWF
works with various local groups on a wide-ranging environmental education
programme among native and settler communities, as well as in the formal
education sector.

<P><font size=5><B>WWF in Zaire<BR></B></font><p>
Located in the heart of Africa, Zaire is the third largest country in
this continent. Zaire boasts almost every African biome except desert.
The spectacular green forests in the country's central basin contain
some of Zaire's 8,000 km sq of tropical moist forest -- over half the
continent's forest reserves.
<p>
Zaire has a wealth of plant and animal life. It has more plant and
animal species than any other  African country. Over 10,000 different
plants can be found here, of which 3,200 grow nowhere else in the world.
Straphanthus kombe, a threatened medicinal plant once used by Mbuti pygmies
to poison their arrow heads, is today much sought after by western doctors
to cure heart disease.
<p>
Zaire's 409 different mammal species include the elusive okapi,
sometimes called the forest giraffe, which was discovered only in 1901. The
okapi exists solely in the humid forests of eastern Zaire. The country
also has the world's last viable population of northern white rhinos. It is
home to 31 primate species. And the pygmy chimpanzee, with its unusual
black face, can only be found  here.
<p>
The endangered manatee, an aquatic mammal resembling a huge
sea lion and believed to be a close relative of the elephant, lives in 
the estuary
of the Zaire River. Of the 51 species of amphibians found in Zaire, the
unusual hairy frog is particularly threatened.
<p>
Zaire's bird life is equally important. Of the 1,426 bird species, the
golden-naped and yellow-legged weavers are endemic. So is the large Congo
peacock.
<p>
Unlike many other countries in the region, Zaire has an impressive
record in nature conservation. It houses the continent's oldest park,
Virunga National Park, established in 1925. Moreover, four of the country's
protected areas have earned UNESCO World Heritage Site status because they
contain exceptional ecosystems.
<p>
Yet, uncontrolled use of its forest products could reverse these
gains. Each year, an estimated 200,000 ha of forest are cut down to meet 
local
fuelwood needs. Widespread shifting agriculture and a rapid population
increase in the eastern highlands are encroaching on the country's humid
forests.  Although commercial logging is limited, it is posing a problem.
<p>
Over the years, poaching has also greatly depleted Zaire's
elephant population, which used to be one of the largest in Africa.
Similarly, the northern white rhino, which ranged across much of Zaire, 
Sudan,
Uganda, the Central African Republic and Chad in the early 1900s, was
decimated by poachers by the mid-'80s, reaching near extinction levels. Rhino
population figures fell drastically from an estimated 1,300 in 1962 to a
precarious 15 in 1984.
<p>
The fate of other animals is not much better. They are being
threatened by uncontrolled hunting to meet the protein needs of a growing
population.
<p>
WWF has been in collaboration with the Zaire parks department --
Institut Zairois pour la Conservation de la Nature (IZCN) -- and other
international aid agencies in Zaire for over 30 years. During this time, 
it has
funded projects ranging from pure species and habitat protection to rural
development and education initiatives.
<p>
One of its early projects focused on protecting the highly
threatened mountain gorilla population. In collaboration with the Frankfurt
Zoological Society (FZS), the project accustomed four gorilla groups to
tourists and established a controlled gorilla viewing programme. A radio
network was installed between park headquarters and outlying guard posts to
help in coordinating tourism and anti-poaching efforts. The project also
included regular gorilla censuses and research.
<p>
WWF teamed up with IUCN - the World Conservation Union, the Food and 
Agriculture
Organization, the Institut Zairois pour la Conservation de la Nature 
(IZCN), Frankfurt Zoological Society (FZS), and UNESCO
to develop a rhino conservation project at Garamba National Park in 
northeastern Zaire. Thanks to these efforts and added 
protection from anti-poaching units, the rhino population has doubled 
from 15 to 31 in less than a decade.
<p>
WWF has also helped the IZCN to train game wardens in ecology and 
wildlife management at the Ecole de Faune de Garoua in Cameroon.
<p>
Another WWF achievement: after years of lobbying, the government finally 
upgraded the globally important Ituri Forest to a
faunal reserve in 1992.  The forest is home to the Bambuti pygmies, some 
Bantu tribes, and the endemic okapi. Together with 
the IZCN and other institutions, WWF is designing a management plan which 
integrates the needs of indigenous people
with the reserve's conservation goals.

<b><i>Executive Summary</i></b>
<p>
The North Sea is one of the most productive sea areas in the world, 
evidenced by the fact that from an area making up only 0.16 per cent of 
the oceans, almost 5 per cent of the worlds marine fish catch is 
obtained. This unique feature is due to a very favourable balance 
between effects which support productivity and those which limit 
productivity. Overfishing and pollution from agriculture and industry 
threaten this productivity. Indeed recent evidence about the ability of 
certain synthetic chemical substances to disrupt the endocrine systems 
of wildlife (and humans) warns of the potential for the loss of 
biodiversity in and around the North Sea... <a

<title>Introduction:  Why Do We Need Better Environmental Reporting? </title>

<P>
<B>Why Do We Need Better Environmental Reporting?
<BR>
</B>
<P>
WWF has been working to halt the inputs of hazardous substances
into the North Sea since 1984. WWF launched its report on &quot;The
Ecological State of the North Sea&quot; in 1987 which paid special
attention to oil pollution from shipping, nutrient inputs, eutrophication
and bio&#173;accumulation of persistent organic compounds in the
North Sea food web.<BR>

<P>
WWF has continued to pay special attention to these pollution
problems and has been a constant participant in the North Sea
Conference process, as well as in the revision of the OSPAR Convention
and its implementation. WWF has expanded its policy work to include
pollution prevention measures and now plays a lead role in promoting
pesticide reduction policies internationally, as well as in the
UK, Belgium, Germany, Canada, the USA, Pakistan, and in South
East Asia, while supporting the international consensus to eliminate
some persistent organic pollutants. <BR>

<P>
Now a new threat from synthetic chemical contamination is looming.
WWF US Senior Scientist Dr Theo Colborn has co&#173;written an
alarming book, Our Stolen Futur<SUP>e1</SUP> which suggests that
we are threatening our fertility, intelligence and survival, as
well as the survival of many species, by our indiscriminate use
of synthetic chemicals. Many bizarre wildlife deformities and
deaths are now being linked to the ability of many synthetic chemicals
to disrupt the endocrine system (<A HREF="moreinfo.htm#box1">more information of endocrine disruptors ...</A>). Included in the book
are descriptions of the largest mass die&#173;off of seals in
history, which claimed more than 40 per cent of the entire North
Sea population.<SUP>2<BR>
<BR>
</SUP>

<P>
As a necessary first step to pollution prevention, particularly
in the industrial sector, it is imperative that we gather more
relevant data to inform the policy decisions on harmful synthetic
chemicals released into the environment, and to allow each affected
group and member in society to participate in environmentally
safe and sound chemicals management. As many persistent contaminants
do not remain at the site of release and can travel thousands
of kilometres by air, chemical releases on one continent may not
only affect animals and humans on that continent but also animals
and humans on other continents and in other hemispheres. Accordingly,
the data collected on synthetic chemical use and production must
be comparable internationally, and policy solutions must also
be international.<BR>

<P>
Chapter 19 of Agenda 21 calls for the development of guidance
for governments on collecting such information by using chemical
inventories. Taking up this challenge, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) hosted five workshops with
the UN International Programme for Chemical Safety (IPCS) on what
are internationally called Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers
(PRTRs). PRTRs are a system of tracking chemicals use, transfer
and release which record chemical specific and standardized data
on emissions of toxic substances to air, water and land (including
off&#173;site disposal) from polluting industrial facilities -
private, municipal, or state - and chemicals contained in products.
<BR>

<P>
As recognized in Chapter 19, the classic example of risk reduction
is to reduce use through substitution of harmless alternatives
and alternate methodologies. Experiences with publicly accessible
PRTRS have shown them to be powerful tools which lead to reductions
in the use and release of toxics and facilitate the adoption of
less polluting materials and technologies (so&#173;called &quot;cleaner
production&quot;). Establishing and linking these chemical registers
in countries around the world provides vital information on the
sources of contamination by chemicals, information critical in
addressing substances which are increasingly transported long
distances through the air and water.<BR>

<P>
WWF assisted in the design of the OECD PRTR workshops series and
participated actively in each of the workshops. These international
workshops in 1994 and 1995 offered non&#173;governmental groups
an unusual opportunity to spur adoption of the right to know about
the use and release of toxic chemicals around the world and to
participate as equal partners in the design of international policy.
At each workshop a chapter of the guidance was prepared. <BR>

<P>
The OECD/IOMC (Inter&#173;Organization Programme for the Sound
Management of Chemicals<SUP>3</SUP>) PRTR Guidance Manual for
Governments was published in March 1996.<SUP>4</SUP> (The OECD
held one regional workshop in Australia in June 1996 and plans
to hold another in the Czech Republic in 1997.) It draws on the
experience that a number of countries have gained through existing
reporting systems, for example the US Toxic Release Inventory
(TRI), Canada's National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI), Great
Britain Chemical Release Inventory (CRI), as well as the Netherland's
Collective and Individual Emission Inventories (CEI &amp; IEI).
Furthermore, Australia has begun a widespread exploration of the
possibilities of developing reporting systems, and other countries
are also considering implementing PRTRs, for example South Africa,
Hungary, Egypt, the Czech Republic and Mexico. There are currently
three UNITAR (United Nations Institute For Training and Research)
pilot projects under way in the Czech Republic, Egypt and Mexico.
UNITAR has also prepared documents to assist countries in implementing
PRTRs.<BR>

<P>
WWF is continuing to work to strengthen corporate environmental
reporting requirements by promoting the introduction of publicly
accessible PRTRs worldwide. WWF is also supporting research and
pilot projects in developed and developing countries to assess
the potential for PRTRs and to ensure that community groups will
have the capacity to use PRTR&#173;type information for pollution
prevention purposes when it becomes available. <BR>

<P>
<B>The Precautionary Principle: Some of the Worst Offenders Need
to Go<BR>
</B>
<P>
Apart from improving information, the actual and potential impacts
of some synthetic chemicals, including the &quot;endocrine disruptors&quot;,
are so serious that action to eliminate and reduce the use and
production of some of these substances is justifiable now. Based
upon the &quot;Precautionary Principle&quot; as set out in the
Rio Declaration (Principle 15) we must act now to halt the further
contamination of the environment, ecosystems, wildlife and humans
by endocrine disruptors and other toxic chemicals. 
<P>
The Precautionary Principle has evolved in its application in
the field of toxics through the North Sea Ministerial Conference
process. In 1987, the North Sea ministers agreed to reduce at
source &quot;polluting emissions of substances that are persistent,
toxic, and liable to bio&#173;accumulate... especially when there
is reason to assume that certain damage or harmful effects on
the living resources of the sea are likely to be caused by such
substances, even when there is no scientific evidence to prove
a causal link between emissions and effects&quot;. <BR>

<P>
This precautionary approach was then extended beyond the North
Sea to the whole environment in 1990 at the Bergen conference
where the Ministers declared that:<BR>

<P>
Environmental measures must anticipate, prevent, and attack the
causes of environmental degradation. Where there are threats of
serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of scientific
certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures
to prevent environmental degradation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Growing International Consensus to Eliminate and Reduce Use
of Some Synthetic Chemicals<BR>
</B>
<P>
Regional Seas Agreements have been in the forefront of international
commitments to reduce toxics. As mentioned above, at the second
International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, held
in London in 1987, signatory countries agreed, amongst other things,
to reduce North Sea inputs of substances that are persistent,
toxic and liable to bio&#173;accumulate.<BR>

<P>
This was recognized as an important small first step. At the third
North Sea Conference, in the Hague in March 1990, a somewhat longer
list of 36 substances was agreed to be reduced by 50 per cent
and some by 70 per cent. Importantly, the Conference agreed to
&quot;phase out those pesticides which are the most persistent,
toxic and liable to bio&#173;accumulate&quot;. At the fourth Conference
in 1995, Annex 2 to the Ministerial Declaration contained a definition
of hazardous substances as follows: <BR>

<P>
In the context of this declaration hazardous substances are defined
as substances, or groups of substances, that are persistent, toxic
and liable to bio&#173;accumulate. In this definition toxicity
should be taken to include chronic effects such as carcinogenicity,
mutagenicity and teratogenicity and adverse effects on the function
of the endocrine system (emphasis added).<BR>

<P>
The North East Atlantic Declaration of the 1992 Ministerial Meeting
of the Oslo and Paris Commissions called for a reduction to levels
not harmful to the environment and humans, of inputs of toxic,
persistent or bio&#173;accumulative substances, and in particular
organohalogens, by the year 2000, with the aim of elimination
thereafter.<BR>

<P>
In the OSPAR Ministerial Declaration (Paris, 1992) Ministers agreed
that:<BR>

<P>
...as a matter of principle for the whole Convention area, discharges
and emissions of substances which are toxic, persistent and liable
to bio&#173;accumulate, in particular organohalogen substances,
and which could reach the marine environment should, regardless
of their anthropogenic source, be reduced, by the year 2000, to
levels that are not harmful to man or nature with the aim of their
elimination; to this end to implement substantial reductions in
those discharges and emissions and where appropriate, to supplement
reduction measures with programmes to phase out the use of such
substances; ...<BR>

<P>
The 1996 Conference of Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention<SUP>5</SUP>
also considered toxic chemicals and agreed a Recommendation (6.14)
that recognizes the endocrine disruption threat to wetland ecosystems
and species and that the adverse impact of toxic substances compromises
the ecological character of wetlands. It is also recommended that
the Parties to the Ramsar Convention &quot;... recognize the importance
of the communities' right to know with respect to hazardous and
bio&#173;accumulative chemicals, including pollutant release and
transfer registers (PRTRs)&quot;. <BR>

<P>
<B>International Action on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21, on the protection of the oceans, specifically
called for States to eliminate and reduce emissions or discharges
of organohalogens and other synthetic organic compounds that could
accumulate to &quot;dangerous levels&quot; in the marine environment.
This call to action has led 109 countries to adopt a Global Programme
of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment. This included
a commitment to develop a global, legally binding instrument &quot;...for
the reduction and/or elimination of emission, discharges, whether
intentional or not, and, where appropriate, the elimination of
the manufacture and use of, and illegal traffic in...&quot; selected
persistent organic pollutants.<SUP>6</SUP> <BR>

<P>
The Intergovernmental Forum on Chemical Safety (IFCS)<SUP>7</SUP>
concluded that &quot;international action, including a global
legally binding instrument, is required to reduce the risks to
human health and the environment arising from the release of the
12 specified POPs&quot;.<SUP>8</SUP> IFCS also recommended that
the UNEP Governing Council and WHA (World Health Assembly) &quot;decide
that immediate international action should be initiated to protect
human health and the environment through measures which will reduce
and/or eliminate ... the emissions and discharges of the 12 POPs
specified in UNEP GC Decision 18/32 and, where appropriate, eliminate
production and subsequently the remaining use of those POPs that
are intentionally produced&quot;. The IFCS also recommended that
&quot;... UNEP GC and WHA recognize that international action
should incorporate such practical measures as: (a) the expeditious
development of a global, legally binding instrument...&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Conclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
Better environmental reporting, through the use of Pollutant Release
&amp; Transfer Registers (PRTRs), can help measure progress towards
the goals of phasing out persistent organic pollutants and meeting
the targets set through the North Sea Conference process and those
set through the OSPAR Convention process. In addition, as is shown
in the next chapter, publicly accessible PRTRs can allow the public
and other interested stakeholders to help those goals to be met.

<P>
<B>The Pollutant Release &amp; Transfer Register (PRTR) Success
Story<BR>
</B>
<P>
Creating public awareness about pollutants released and transferred
into the environment has the potential to be a powerful and low&#173;cost
tool for the reduction and prevention of pollution. In general,
PRTR data help to identify sources of pollution and can be a tool
for cleaner production that will reduce the amount of pollution
entering the environment. By being public and structured for easy
analysis and use, PRTRs involve all interested parties, such as
citizens and company or governmental employees, in identifying
and solving pollution problems.<BR>

<P>
<B>Avenues of active public dissemination used in the USA<BR>
</B>
<P>
The US Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) database is a valuable and
comprehensive collection of emission data. Based on these nationwide
data, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) created a voluntary
reduction programme called the &quot;30/50 Program&quot;. This
program targeted 17 priority TRI chemicals for emissions reductions
of 33 per cent by 1992 and 50 per cent by 1995, from 1988 levels.
More than 1,200 companies have joined this program which provided
recognition of participating companies, including &quot;Certificates
of Appreciation&quot; to all companies upon enrolment, as well
as &quot;Certificates of Environmental Achievement&quot; to a
select group of facilities that have achieved noteworthy reductions.
<BR>

<P>
The success of the US TRI is largely due to the US EPA's policy
and program of active dissemination of data to all interested
parties. In 1989, EPA began disseminating TRI information by forming
a partnership with the National Library of Medicine (NLM) to provide
this information on NLM's on&#173;line system TOXNET. Aware that
not all of its users possessed the necessary capacity to use an
on&#173;line electronic database, EPA created a second major dissemination
vehicle, a more than 300&#173;page publication providing certain
data and analysis for the TRI database. State&#173;specific TRI
collections are also published. Every TRI submitter is required
to submit identical information to its State, and generally States
have succeeded in making the TRI data available more quickly than
EPA.<BR>

<P>
Complete national TRI data are now available on CD&#173;ROM (Compact
Disc Read Only Memory), starting with the first inventory in 1987.
On the same CD ROM, Chemical Fact&#173;Sheets containing reference
material on the health and ecological effects of the TRI regulated
substances are also available. Microfiches with TRI data are available
in over 3,000 libraries across the country. And the TRI User Support
Service is a telephone question and answer service (+1 [202] 260
1531) that provides general information about the Toxics Release
Inventory. TRI specialists can help users to determine the data
product best suited for the individual user's needs. To request
copies of TRI, one can contact the toll&#173;free Emergency Planning
and Community Right&#173;to&#173;Know Information Hotline (+1
[800] 535 0202).<BR>

<P>
More recently, as technology has progressed, EPA has looked for
more innovative pathways to disseminate TRI data. The Right&#173;To&#173;Know
Computer Network (RTK NET) is an on&#173;line computer link to
environmental and other databases such as TRI. EPA has assisted
this endeavour, by two public interest organizations (Unison Institute
and OMB Watch), with funding and information resources. RTK NET
is designed to simplify access to information for computer experts
as well as for novices. Everyone is entitled to use RTK NET for
free; the only cost which users have to pay is for the long&#173;distance
telephone call. The most exciting of the innovations embraced
by EPA for information dissemination is the Internet. The World
Wide Web (WWW) server is a graphical user interface allowing access
not only to text but to images as well.<SUP>9<BR>
</SUP>
<P>
<B>Benefits of Active Dissemination of PRTR Data<BR>
</B>
<P>
The positive effects of the US EPA's active public dissemination
efforts were not long in coming. Effectively, the public has become
the &quot;ears and eyes&quot; of government, also taking an active
role in sharing implementation of government policy and helping
business to go beyond minimum regulation standards. For example:
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Communities use TRI data to begin dialogues with local facilities
to encourage them to reduce their emissions, to develop pollution
prevention plans, and to improve safety measures. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Industry itself uses the data to identify pollution prevention
opportunities, set goals for emission reductions, and demonstrate
their commitment to and progress in reducing emissions. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>National, state, and local authorities use TRI data to set
priorities and allocate scarce environmental protection resources
to the most pressing problems. Regulators use the data to set
permit limits, measure compliance with those limits, and target
facilities for enforcement activities. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Increasingly, TRI data are being used in financial decision&#173;making.
Investment analysis uses TRI data to provide recommendations to
clients to make environmentally sound investments. Insurance companies
look to TRI data as one indication of potential environmental
liabilities. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Public interest groups are playing a critical role as intermediaries
between the general public and TRI data. Many of those groups
disseminate TRI data by analysing and compiling it in summary
reports which frequently focus attention on top dischargers, hazardous
chemicals or geographic areas of concern, and highlight perceived
needs for further action. 
</UL>

<P>
<B>WWF's key characteristics for PRTRs (<A HREF="moreinfo.htm#box2">See additional information ...</A>)<BR>
</B>
<P>
PRTRs are multimedia inventories of sources of pollution by release
and transfer of chemicals in the waste stream and also in the
product stream. PRTR data provide an invaluable baseline for measuring
progress on pollution prevention programmes. The periodic reports
can be used as a measure of both business accountability and national
success in meeting international and regional commitments and
targets. Furthermore, national PRTRs that collect the same data
elements will allow comparisons of performance among countries.
Reporting must therefore be standardized to allow analysis to
address pollutants at the regional and global levels.<BR>
<BR>


<P>
The WWF Benchmark provides data on trends in use, release, and
transfer of chemicals in wastes and products. It provides chemical&#173;specific
data for industrial sectors, companies, facilities, installations,
and processes, as well as single and total releases and transfers
in the waste and product stream. These data can then be used for
analysis and comparision at the international, national, regional
and local levels.<BR>

<P>
<B>Active Dissemination Policy (WWF Benchmark No. 10)<BR>
</B>
<P>
The effectiveness of national PRTRs relies on disseminating the
data to a wide range of users in raw as well as in summarized
form. Although quality control of the data should be built into
the collection process, wide use also improves the data, as has
been demonstrated with the US Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). The
users - government staff, workers, media, vendors, unions, customers,
community residents, investors, etc. - are likely to find errors
and request clarification and correction of the data.<BR>

<P>
<B>Databank management and common data elements (WWF Benchmark
Nos. 6 and 7) <BR>
</B>
<P>
The importance of designing and structuring reports so that data
can be managed by computer cannot be overemphasized. Data can
be easily managed, analysed and widely disseminated with the help
of computers. Common identifiers are needed for chemicals, facilities,
processes, industrial classification and locations, as well as
source reduction and waste management methods. However, many government
programmes use different identifiers for the same substances because
most pollution programmes, historically developed as individual
control programmes aimed at water, air and waste (as well as pesticides,
chemicals, and worker health), are directed in many cases by separate
government departments.<BR>

<P>
A useful approach to change this diverse situation is to use common
identifiers which are used by international bodies such as UNEP,
IPCS, OECD or the European Union. Chemicals, for example, should
be identified by their names as well as by the CAS&#173;code and
the Einecs&#173;code of the European Community (EEC/67/548, last
amendment EEC/91/632). The same applies to facilities: they should
also be named by the international SIC&#173;code and the NACE&#173;code
of the European Community (EEC/3037/90).<SUP>10<BR>
</SUP>
<P>
<B>A comprehensive PRTR (WWF Benchmark Nos. 1&#173;5)<BR>
</B>
<P>
i. <I>Number of Chemicals Covered</I>
<P>
A PRTR should as far as possible cover all &quot;relevant&quot;
emissions. The list must be comprehensive since relevance depends
on the existing state of knowledge and means something different
for chemical companies compared to its meaning for authorities,
local residents, farmers, amateur gardeners and so on. Even substances
currently regarded as &quot;safe&quot; must be included since
our knowledge of ecological inter&#173;relationships is constantly
increasing and what is today considered harmless may be shown
to be carcinogenic or eco&#173;toxic tomorrow.
<P>
The most comprehensive PRTR in existence is the US Toxic Release
Inventory which today covers 623 chemicals and chemical groups.
Yet even the US barely captures the use, release and transfer
data pertaining to the some 100,000 synthetic chemicals which
are on the market. Although 95 per cent of the worldwide production
of chemicals consists of only 1,500 of all of these chemicals,
very few of them have been subject to comprehensive risk assessment
studies, let alone tested for whether they can disrupt the endocrine
system.<BR>

<P>
ii. <I>Releases and transfers of chemicals in the waste stream
and in the product stream</I>
<P>
A single media PRTR restricted to the three classic media - water,
air and soil - would be very incomplete. Many chemicals are released
into the environment via products such as toluene in paints, nail
polish and adhesives, mercury in batteries and thermometers, or
plasticizers in plastics. Furthermore, from a health point of
view, emissions via products should be highlighted as the users
come into very close contact with the chemicals.<BR>

<P>
iii. <I>Reporting thresholds</I>
<P>
Threshold values are guidance figures and not minimum values in
the sense that lower&#173;level emissions can be considered safe.
No threshold values should appear in PRTRs for highly toxic substances
such as dioxins, or for carcinogenic or endocrine disruptor substances.
This implies that reporting thresholds for other chemicals must
be as low as possible and should reflect the state of the art
and the best available techniques/technologies.<BR>

<P>
iv. <I>PRTRs and industrial and agricultural emitters</I>
<P>
All emitters of substances should ideally track chemical use and
emissions. The agricultural sector is responsible for the largest
intentional application of synthetic chemicals to the environment.
Emitters should also be tracked for reduction purposes.<BR>

<P>
<B>Limit confidentiality claims (WWF Benchmark No. 8)<BR>
</B>
<P>
Confidential data are protected in a PRTR. However, if trade secret
claims are made, generic information should be provided as a substitute
for any data item claimed confidential and the submitter's claim
of confidentiality should be made public. The use of a generic
name for omitted data is important. Mistaken conclusions are easily
drawn if missing data are not flagged in this way. In addition,
omitting trade secret data significantly undermines the purpose
of public reporting aimed at accurately characterizing chemical
flows.<BR>

<P>
<B>Stimulating Clean Production<BR>
</B>
<P>
With site&#173;specific PRTRs and proper accounting systems, operators
can track the movement of chemicals through all of the processes
which are carried out in the installations on the site, as well
as the releases and transfers of chemicals. A company handling
hazardous substances and producing hazardous waste has a duty
to maintain accurate records on the use and emission of those
substances. If done properly this can identify unnecessary waste
and cost and identify opportunities for designing cleaner production
and developing cleaner products.<BR>

<P>
<B>The &quot;Right to Know&quot; in Belgium<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>Based on the WWF commissioned report &quot;Information available
to the public on industrial pollutant releases and transfers in
Belgium. Comparison with the situation in the State of New Jersey,&quot;
August 1995, by Dr Catherine Wattiez.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In Belgium, the information on site&#173;specific emissions which
is principally available depends mainly on obligations fixed in
permit conditions given by local and provincial authorities. There
is no national PRTR. No national institution publishes data on
air emissions, discharges into watercourses, or waste disposals.
To fulfil obligations under The Hague Declaration, Belgium has
prepared reports with aggregated data based upon measurements
and calculations.<BR>

<P>
Existing documents cannot provide for accurate and comparative
data about product and waste streams of individual substances
at the facility level over time. Citizens require a lot of time
and patience to access information and synthesize data scattered
over various administrations in order to try to evaluate reductions
of releases and transfers of chemicals.<BR>

<P>
<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
The situation in Belgium is complex. In two main phases of devolving
power to the regions, the Federal State has given responsibilities
to the governments of the regions of Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels
(Flanders and Wallonia are further divided into five provinces).
Firstly, in 1970 and 1971, the Belgian Constitution was revised
to adapt the country's structure to the reality of regions. Later,
in 1988, further powers were transferred to the regional governments.
As a consequence of this devolution of power, the Flemish, Walloon
and Brussels Regions have each developed their own environmental
regulations and access to information regimes. In principle, industrial
processes are divided into three classes according to their degree
of harmfulness to humans and environment. The exact definitions
of classes, as well as for permit demands, differ however between
Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels (<A HREF="moreinfo.htm#box3">See additional information ...</A>).<BR>
<P>
<B>Overview of documents which citizens can use to obtain environmental
information<BR>
</B>
<P>
A. <I>Site&#173;specific information</I>
<P>
There are many different documents each providing some data about
releases of chemicals. Information about transfers of chemicals,
however, is even more scarce.<BR>

<P>
1. <I>Permit Demands and Impact Studies </I>are principally available.
Permit demands in order to get a permit include inter alia estimations
of the operator about some effects on humans and the environment.
For Class 1 permits, impact studies in accordance with the Directive
on Environmental Impact Assessment (Annex I) are always requested.
In general, impact studies contain data on storage data of raw
materials and final products, about point and non&#173;point sources
of air emissions, about water discharges in watercourses and groundwater,
as well as about solid and liquid amounts of waste per waste category.
<BR>

<P>
2. <I>Waste Declarations</I> are mainly confidential. Plant operators
have to report inter alia data about origin, nature, quantity,
destination, mode of internal treatment, mode of transportation.
The declarations are based on classification codes. In the Flemish
and the Brussels regions these data are automatically confidential.
In Wallonia, this information is kept confidential when operators
fear it might reveal manufacturing secrets.<BR>

<P>
3. <I>Environmental Permits</I> are principally available. Since
1991, in accordance with the Flemish VLAREM I regulations, new
installation and process permits and renewals of old ones are
combined into a single Environment Permit covering air emissions,
waste&#173;water and groundwater discharges, solid and hazardous
waste, on&#173;site land disposal, and maximal on&#173;site storage
capacities.<BR>

<P>
Since 1992 in Brussels, the integrated Environmental Permit contains
inter alia conditions and norms for air and water emissions. This
permit reminds the operator to respect the Ordinance of Prevention
and Management of Waste of 1991.<BR>

<P>
In Wallonia, however, there is not an integrated permitting process.
Some limits for air emissions are fixed in Exploitation Permits,
water emissions have to conform with a 1976 regulation, and maximal
instant flow and daily volume of water emissions are fixed in
Discharge Permits.<BR>

<P>
4. <I>Company's Emission Reports in Flanders</I> are principally
available. Since August 1995, in accordance with the VLAREM 2
bis legislation, plant operators of Class 1 and 2 processes and
installations must submit annually a report on air and water emissions
to the responsible authority. In comparison with VLAREM 2 regulations,
this obligation covers also Class 2 processes and installations;
more substances have to be considered and reporting thresholds
for many chemicals have been lowered, sometimes by up to 100 times.
<BR>

<P>
5. <I>Security Reports</I> are principally available. In accordance
with the Seveso&#173;Directive, a Security Report can be requested
from companies operating high&#173;risk Class 1 processes. In
general, a more accurate description of the hazardous process
is given by these reports compared to the impact studies, so that
much of the information contained therein is kept confidential
upon request of the industry.<BR>

<P>
B. <B>Summarized emissions data</B>
<P>
The scope of reports from the Flemish, Walloon, and Brussels administrations
is relatively small compared with the Great Britain CRI or the
US TRI. With one exception, only aggregated or calculated data
are published. None of these reports allow the tracking of chemicals
as they move through the plant. Nor do any of them provide details
of the amounts of toxic chemicals brought to the production site,
the amounts consumed in processes, the amount going into the treatment
plant on site, and the amount released from the site, including
that leaving the site in products.<BR>

<P>
1. <I>Emission reports in the Flemish Region.</I> Since 1992,
the Flemish Environmental Agency VMM (Vlaamse Milieumaatschappij)
informs annually aggregated emission data on SO<SUB>2</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>,
dust, CO, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, and heavy metals. These reports are
based on mandatory data delivered by Class I industries and voluntary
data delivered by about 380 companies with Class 2 processes.
This report, &quot;Emissie jaarverslag&quot;, is available for
BFr350.<BR>

<P>
Since 1990, VMM publishes annually site&#173;specific data from
about 1,200 companies. These companies have to report on concentrations
in the effluent and daily loads for parameters such as chemical
oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended
soils, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and a few heavy metals.
VMM uses these data mainly to calculate the company's tax. Furthermore,
these reports include a ranking of the top ten polluters for each
pollutant and parameter. This report, &quot;Resultaten Emissiemeetnet
water&quot;, is available for BFr400.<BR>

<P>
2. <I>Emission reports in the Brussels Region.</I> In 1994, under
the framework of CORINAIR'90, an emissions inventory covering
SO2, NOx and VOC - calculated with the help of emission factors
from energy and production data - was published by IBGE in &quot;Les
cahiers de l'IBGE&#173;9. Rapport sur l'Etat de l'Environnement
en R&eacute;gion de Bruxelles&#173;Capitale&quot;. The 1993 data
update was not published for the public and was forwarded only
to European authorities. No inventory on water emissions exists.
There is no tax for waste&#173;water in the region of Brussels.
<BR>

<P>
3. <I>Emission reports in the Walloon Region.</I> In 1995, the
Institut Wallon<SUP>12</SUP> published air emissions (SO<SUB>x</SUB>,
NO<SUB>2</SUB>, VOC, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, N2O, NH<SUB>3</SUB>)
for the year 1990 in the &quot;Inventaire des &eacute;missions
atmosph&eacute;rique en Wallonie CORINAIR 1990&quot;. These data
are aggregated and are calculated from energy consumption and
production data using emission factors. Some data were directly
communicated by a number of large point sources. However, facility&#173;specific
data are confidential.<BR>

<P>
No inventory on water discharges exists, although the Ministry,
DGRNE, is working on the report &quot;Inventaire des emissions
autoris&eacute;es&quot; which will include site&#173;specific
data per hydrographic basin, such as the basin of the river Sambre.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Comparison with the State of New Jersey<BR>
</B>
<P>
It is impossible to compare the well structured US information
systems with the complex Belgian situation. However the following
points are worth mentioning:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Some data about the frequency of transfers of a hazardous
substance and the method of transfers from storage can sometimes
be found in security reports in Flanders and Wallonia. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Data on water consumption are available from environmental
permit demands of the Brussels region. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>Pollution prevention efforts can be identified in Flemish
emission reports, in Walloon impact studies or preliminary evaluation
notices, and in Brussels impact studies and environmental reports.
These documents include some source&#173;reduction measures but
mainly end&#173;of&#173;pipe measures.
<LI>Material accounting data needed to calculate input and outputs
of substances are not available. However, in accordance with the
Flemish VLAREM 2 bis regulation, the monthly quantity of raw material
used in processes involving point source air emissions has to
be given. Furthermore, companies are obliged to report the monthly
quantities of final products associated with substances released
in the air from point sources. These data must be published in
future annual emission reports. 
</UL>

<P>
<B>Access to information in daily practice<BR>
</B>
<P>
The permit conditions are complex, as is access to environmental
information. In 1991, Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia implemented
the European Council Directive 90/313/EEC on freedom of access
to environmental information. Yet, in Flanders and Brussels, other
legislation regulates the access to administrative documents in
general. In spite of these various laws, access in daily practice
is generally very poor.<BR>

<P>
In principle, the various types of permits (storage permits, exploitation
permits, discharge permits, environmental permits) and studies
(impact studies and security reports) are available from the responsible
municipal, provincial or regional authority. Access to site&#173;specific
declarations and monitoring data for emissions in the atmosphere
and the discharges into watercourses are often limited by claims
for confidentiality. Contrary to the practice in Great Britain,
Belgian authorities appear to accept these claims unchallenged.
Waste declarations are based on a simple waste classification
code and only some chemicals are named. Consequently, the exact
amount of most chemicals present in the waste is not known. If
monitoring data exceed limit values, authorities can file a complaint
within the court system, with the effect that the data become
confidential as a part of the preliminary investigation file.
<BR>

<P>
In practice, citizens have many difficulties obtaining access
to the dispersed information about the pollutant releases and
transfers mentioned above. This access differs between administrations.
Overall in Flanders and Wallonia the access system does not work
well, whereas the administration in the Brussels region responded
much more positively to access requests. In Wallonia, most departments
of DGRNE have not responded well. The worst cases for Flanders
are the municipality, and the province of Antwerp - an unfortunate
fact since a large number of heavy industries polluting the North
Sea are situated in the port of Antwerp. <A HREF="moreinfo.htm#box4">As described in the attached supplement</A>,
there was no way to obtain access to all of the information requested.
<BR>

<P>
In trying to get a fast answer, one should firstly have a perfect
knowledge of the complexities of the various regional regulations
and policies, about the various formats in which the information
is recorded, and which are available to the public. Secondly,
it is very helpful to have a good understanding of the different
jurisdictions of each institution. Thirdly, one must know exactly
which document will contain the needed information and what specific
research was done that might be relevant to the enquiry. Even
if the citizen has such an understanding of the legislation and
a good knowledge of the administration with jurisdiction over
the required information, he will often be refused access to the
requested information or will obtain it only with the utmost efforts
(extreme delays, expensive rates, need for appeal, etc.).<BR>

<B>The &quot;Right to Know&quot; in Germany<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>Based on the WWF commissioned report &quot;Emissionskataster
Deutsche Nordseek&uuml;ste - Eine Untersuchung &uuml;ber den Zugang
zu betriebsbezogenen Emissionsdaten in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland&quot;,
May 1995, by Sabine Winteler, &Ouml;kopol GmbH.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In Germany, the available information on releases depends on obligations
fixed in permit conditions given by local or regional authorities.
Data on chemical releases into atmosphere, watercourses and disposals
of waste are only available if the operator is obliged to report
such emissions to the responsible authority.<BR>

<P>
There is no nationwide PRTR. Emission inventories covering well&#173;defined
areas are established for only a few air pollutants. The nationwide
environmental report of the German Environmental Protection Agency
(Ger&#173;EPA) provides an overview of six air pollutants. In
these two cases only aggregated data are published. As a rule,
site&#173;specific data are available only from local and regional
authorities. This availability is, however, restricted by trade
secrecy claims. This access limitation was not removed by the
&quot;Umweltinformationsgesetz&quot; (UIG) - the implementation
of the Directive on Freedom of Access to Environmental Information
(90/313/EEC) - in force since July 1994.<BR>

<P>
<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is a clear allocation of jurisdiction between the government
of the Federal Republic of Germany and the 16 States. The federal
government is, inter alia, responsible for regulations about air
pollution, but can only enact framework regulations for water
protection. In the latter case, the States are responsible for
the instructions to regulate the authorization of discharges into
watercourses or sewers. Permits are given by local or regional
authorities depending on the State's regulation. As a rule, local
authorities are responsible for checking compliance with permit
conditions.<BR>

<P>
<B>Background information<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>Access to information about discharges into watercourses</I>
<P>
Before a company may release waste&#173;water it has to obtain
a &quot;discharge permit&quot; from the responsible authority
in accordance with the States Water Management Act under the Federal
Water Management Act (Wasserhaushaltsgesetz). These permits set
the maximum amount of waste&#173;water in cubic meters per year
and the maximum concentration of various pollutants that can be
released.<BR>

<P>
The responsible local authority collects these permits in &quot;Water
Books&quot; (Wasserb&uuml;cher). Their inspection by the public
is governed by the States' Water Protection Acts. The permits
contain the amounts for different parameters noted either as specific
weights (in kilograms per tonne of product) or in concentrations
(in milligram per litre outflow). However, data measured by the
companies or the water administration are not collected in these
files and are handled as confidential data.
<P>
<I>Access to information about emissions into the atmosphere</I>
<P>
The authorization procedure of processes is mainly laid down in
the Federal Emission Control Act 'BImSchG' (&quot;Bundesimmissionsschutzgesetz&quot;).
<BR>

<P>
In accordance with the 11th Decree of BImSchG, operators of many
but not all installations listed in the 4th Decree of BImSchG
have to submit biennially an &quot;Emission Declaration&quot;
to the responsible authority. Emission Declarations provide information
<I>inter alia</I> on: <BR>

<UL>
<LI>the declaration period
<LI>the plant and the person responsible
<LI>the sources of emission (point and diffuse)
<LI>plants or units and auxiliary installations
<LI>the substances and materials handled
<LI>the processes that cause emission
<LI>the process and total emissions. 
</UL>

<P>
Emissions data either measured or estimated are given as volume
flow (cubic metres per hour), as mass flow (kilograms per hour),
total emissions (kilogram per annum) and as concentration (milligram
per cubic metre).<BR>

<P>
<I>Summarized emission data</I>
<P>
a) Emission Inventories. The provisions for territory&#173;related
emission control serve to control regional and local air pollution
problems. To carry out clean air plans, permanent control is prescribed
for those &quot;areas subject to investigation&quot; in which
particularly hazardous air pollutants can occur or are expected
to occur. Since April 1992, in accordance with the fifth Administration
Provision pursuant to the BImSchG, air pollutants such as SO2,
NOx, CO, gaseous organic compounds, benzene, NH3, dust, diesel
particles and asbestos, Cl&#173;, F&#173;, Cd&#173;, Pb&#173;,
Th&#173;compounds and dioxins and carcinogens must be recorded
for the Emission Inventories. The data are partly calculated by
emission factors and partly based on Emission Declarations, in
accordance with the 11th BImSchG and Emission Declarations of
further industrial sectors such as small heating installations
and chemical refining. Altogether, these inventories cover large
and medium&#173;sized industrial and other commercial operations,
domestic heating installations and motor vehicles.<BR>

<P>
b) Aggregated discharged data are available from the AG Weser,
the International Conference for the Protection of the River Rhine
and the International Conference for the Protection of the River
Elbe. The &quot;Unterwasserbericht 1993&quot; report of the State
of Bremen named the emitters and the observed discharges, a practice
that is an exception to the rule.<BR>

<P>
c) Since 1984 Ger&#173;EPA has published biennially the national
report &quot;Daten zur Umwelt&quot;. This describes the load of
pollutants in the environment. To calculate this, Ger&#173;EPA
mainly uses emission factors and statistical data since there
is no regulation governing cooperation between Ger&#173;EPA and
the States which hold the emissions data. Therefore, emissions
data on air pollutants (NO<SUB>x</SUB>, CO<SUB>2</SUB>, VOC, CO,
SO<SUB>2</SUB>, and dust) are based on emission factors and statistical
data. The same is valid for water loads.
<P>
<B>Access to data in practice<BR>
</B>
<P>
In Germany, the right&#173;to&#173;know principle was set up by
the &quot;Umweltinformationsgesetz&quot; (UIG). States have, however,
adopted their own regulations to implement the Council Directive
and local and regional authorities give their civil servants their
own instructions how to react on public requests. And civil servants
still have discretionary powers.<BR>

<P>
In principal, access to Emissions Declarations and monitored water
discharges is available. The procedures vary depending on the
county and also from authority to authority. For example, in Bremen
and Lower Saxony some authorities send copies free of charge,
while others ask for reimbursement of copy costs. In Schleswig&#173;Holstein
some authorities charge for the time needed for search and review
and administrative expenses. The type of access also varies. For
example, at some authorities it is possible to look through entire
files, while others send copies of the total emissions.<BR>

<P>
Access to discharge permits for emissions into watercourses and
monitoring data in Lower Saxony, Bremen and Schleswig&#173;Holstein
is problem&#173;free. In Nordrhine&#173;Westphalia, however, monitored
water discharges are as a rule confidential. Ernst Dr&ouml;semeier,
head of the Environmental Department of Cologne, considers that
just three or four companies out of a hundred will allow access
to such &quot;delicate&quot; data.<BR>

<P>
In Germany there are many data on emissions into atmosphere and
watercourses. The various data sets located in local and regional
authorities are not comparable with each other. For a proper functioning
German PRTR these data sets will have to be connected. However,
standardization of these data sets will be extremely difficult
because:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>the set of parameters varies between sectors and also between
various environmental compartments 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>for water releases, data is recorded as either maximum concentrations
or amounts per product 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>for releases into the atmosphere there are mass flow, volume
flow, and concentration data. 
</UL>

<P>
One step in the right direction towards a German PRTR has been
taken in the State of Nordrhine&#173;Westphalen, where an information
data system for substances and installations (ISA: Informationssystem
Stoffe und Anlagen) has been developed. There are also ISAs being
developed for use in 13 other States, as well as in Austria. Under
these ISAs, authorities will record inter alia permit demands
and measurements, although these data will be available only to
the authorities (<A HREF="moreinfo.htm#box5">see additional information ...</A>).<BR>

<B>The &quot;Right to Know&quot; in Great Britain<BR>
</B>
<P>
<I>Based on the WWF commissioned report &quot;Anglo&#173;American
differences in information provision: The information available
to the public on industries operating in the UK as compared to
industries operating in the State of New Jersey&quot;, May 1995,
by Gwynne Lyons.<BR>
</I>
<P>
In England and Wales, the available information on emissions depends
on obligations fixed in authorization conditions given by Local
Authorities, the recently formed Environment Agency, or Her Majesty's
Inspectorate for Pollution (HMIP). Since 1991, access to information
relating to emissions of substances, processes and operators which
HMIP regulates has been made easily available by the setting up
of public registers, as well as by establishing an electronic
database holding such information for major polluting sources.
However, this database - the Chemical Release Inventory (CRI)
- is far from an optimal PRTR.<BR>

<P>
<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
In 1991 the British government introduced the Integrated Pollution
Control (IPC) system under the Environmental Protection Act (EPA90).
One of the most important features of the IPC is that the main
polluting industrial operations must have an integrated authorization
covering limits for emissions into air, water, and waste production.
The IPC system was the example for the forthcoming IPPC Directive
of the European Union (Annex 2).<BR>

<P>
Establishment of the Chemical Release Inventory (CRI) and the
possibility of the public taking part in authorization procedures
of Part A and Part B processes are important features of the IPC
system. HMIP is responsible for the CRI and in 1994 first published
emissions data relating to Part A processes from the calendar
years 1992 and 1993. The CRI also holds details of releases of
radioactive substances controlled by HMIP under the Radioactive
Substance Act 1993. Those data will be published in the future.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Background information<BR>
</B>
<P>
In accordance with Prescribed Processes and Substances Regulations
(1991) under EPA90, polluting industrial processes are divided
into two groups: Part A processes and Part B processes.<BR>

<P>
<I>Part A processes</I>
<P>
Public registers of Part A processes contain applications for
authorization, the authorizations themselves, and all monitoring
data which HMIP requires to be submitted in the authorization.
The public registers are held at the seven regional HMIP offices
in England and Wales. Local District Councils keep duplicates
for processes in their area. One can look at the process&#173;specific
data at HMIP offices or District Councils free&#173;of&#173;charge,
and there are photocopying facilities which are provided at very
reasonable rates.<BR>

<P>
Apart from Local Authorities, one cannot obtain CRI&#173;formatted
data on annual emissions from the Part A processes in a particular
area. However, it is possible to obtain all monitoring data for
these processes, from which the annual totals which feature on
the CRI were derived.
<P>
The registers do note when something is missing, due to confidentiality,
and the register identifies whether this is on the grounds of
commercial confidentiality or national security. The public cannot
influence HMIP's decision on whether or not to grant industry
such confidentiality.<BR>

<P>
For the CRI, HMIP totals the returns from the companies (which
may be monthly, biennially of even continously) and produces annual
accounts for each substance on which a report is required. Thus,
the public registers contain all the monitoring data that the
HMIP requires the operator to provide to it. Hence, it is possible
to obtain data on monthly releases from the register. Documents
for each process can be over 100 pages long, whereas CRI data
fit on one page.<BR>

<P>
Annual off&#173;site releases of kiln slag, effluent treatment
plant filter cake and other waste processes are recorded (in kilograms)
on the register, but in some cases no details of the total amounts
of metals and dioxins released off&#173;site in this waste is
provided by the CRI. In some cases analysis has been undertaken
and details of the contamination of the filter cake and kiln slag
with heavy metals and dioxins are available in public registers.
<BR>

<P>
<I>Part B processes</I>
<P>
Releases of pollutant emissions to the atmosphere are authorized
by Local Authorities. Reporting of air emissions of Part B processes
is required to the same authorities. Specific demands depend upon
the industrial sector. Again, the Local Authorities provide the
applications, the authorizations and the monitoring data which
are accessible to the public. These data, however, are not summarized
in as concise a way as data concerning Part A processes.<BR>

<P>
Data on solid waste arising from Part B processes are not available.
<BR>

<P>
If companies discharge liquid waste directly to watercourses,
it is very likely to be covered by a 'discharge consent' and monitored
by the Environment Agency. If monitoring is undertaken, and information
has to be furnished to the authority, it will be held on public
registers (but not in the CRI). All these monitoring data are
available from the Environment Agency's regional offices in England
and Wales - however, not many chemicals are specified. If the
discharge goes into the sewer system, then it is must be authorized
by the relevant regional water company. It is possible to obtain
a copy of the discharge permit from the water company, but not
the monitoring data to determine compliance with that permit.
<BR>

<P>
<B>Advantages and Disadvantages of the CRI<BR>
</B>
<P>
At present the British CRI is far from an optimal PRTR and is
therefore not very helpful in giving any real indication of exposures.
However, the CRI system does have its advantages over the US TRI.
<BR>

<P>
<I>Major disadvantages</I>
<P>
1. Information on the annual emissions of particular pollutants
from the Part A processes are only provided by the CRI if HMIP
sets an emission limit for that substance in the company's authorization,
or if HMIP requires it to be reported as a condition of the authorization.
In reality this means that hazardous waste incinerators may have
to report on some monitoring data of air and water emissions of
dioxins, but coal&#173;fired power stations do not.<BR>

<P>
2. In order to gain a true picture of total emissions from a site,
the CRI should include Part B processes. If there are only, say,
four Part A processes on a particular site, one could obtain total
site emissions. If, however, the same substance is also released
on site by a Part B process, that would not be included in the
CRI. The total annual emissions of a particular substance from
all sources at that process, as well as from all the other processes
operating on that site, should be required to be reported as releases
of the given substance.<BR>

<P>
3. There are no easily accessible quantitative data to evaluate
whether the company has gone down the route of true pollution
prevention, or whether it has instead used end&#173;of&#173;pipe
solutions.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
4. In England and Wales, more substances need to be designated
as prescribed substances, particularly for water. Chemicals known
or reasonably anticipated to cause acute or chronic damage to
humans and wildlife, as well as endocrine disruption effects,
should be prescribed, along with substances which are persistent
and bio&#173;accumulative.<BR>

<P>
<I>Major advantages</I>
<P>
1. With respect to threshold values, where potentially toxic substances
are formed during the operation, and if these are monitored as
part of a condition of the authorization, then the public is given
access to information on the amounts released per year. The US
system, on the other hand, only provides details of the releases
if the plant processes or manufactures or imports more than 25,000
pounds (11,35 tonnes) of a TRI&#173;listed substance, or uses
more than 10,000 pounds (4,54 tonnes) of a listed chemical.<BR>

<P>
2. Plants such as incinerators and power stations are covered
by reporting requirements and hence figure in Great Britain's
CRI. In contrast, the TRI does not include information on the
releases or inputs of toxic chemicals at waste treatment facilities,
nor does the TRI include emissions from large combustion plants
(power plants).<BR>

<B>Appendix 1. Access to Pollutant Release and Transfer Data in
Europe<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>The European step&#173;by&#173;step approach to the right&#173;to&#173;know
principle<BR>
</B>
<P>
The European Community has directly involved the public in several
pieces of legislation to improve environmental protection. Examples
include:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>the Directive on major&#173;accident hazards of certain industrial
activities 82/501/EEC (1982), the so&#173;called &quot;Seveso&quot;
Directive, including its amendments: 
</UL>

<P>
&quot;The operator of an industrial plant which is considered
as particularly dangerous must provide information about the plant
and possible major accident situations to the authorities which,
for their part, must pass on this information to the people affected.&quot;
<BR>

<UL>
<LI>the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 85/337/EEC (1985)
(now under revision): 
</UL>

<P>
&quot;For certain large projects, like thermal or nuclear power
stations, facilities for storage or disposal of radioactive waste
or motorways, Member States must perform an environmental impact
assessment. The intention is, among other things, to involve the
general public. Moreover, a narrower group of &quot;people affected&quot;
must be given the opportunity to express their view on the project,
before it is implemented.&quot;<BR>

<UL>
<LI>the Eco&#173;Audit and Management System Regulation EEC/1836/93
(1993): 
</UL>

<P>
&quot;After undergoing an audit by non&#173;governmental, independent
verifiers, companies can receive a statement of participation
and its site is officially registered for three years. After the
first environmental review and all subsequent internal audits,
the company has to notify the public by means of an environmental
statement including, among other things, an assessment of all
significant environmental issues, and a summary of the figures
on pollutant emissions, waste generation, consumption of raw material,
energy, water, noise and others, as appropriate.&quot;<BR>

<UL>
<LI>and the proposed IPPC Directive mentioned below. 
</UL>

<P>
With an eye on the US right&#173;to&#173;know principle (see Appendix
2), the European Community has adopted Directive 90/313/EEC on
Freedom of Access to Environmental Information. In accordance
with this Directive, authorities have to make information relating
to the environment available to the public on request. However,
practical experience shows that the right&#173;to&#173;know needs
much improvement (see chapters 4 and 5 on the &quot;Right&#173;to&#173;Know&quot;
in Belgium and Germany respectively).<BR>

<P>
<B>PER - an inadequate PRTR<BR>
</B>
<P>
In Europe, PRTR&#173;type inventories exist only in Great Britain
and in the Netherlands. Since 1994, in Great Britain, Her Majesty's
Inspectorate for Pollution (HMIP) has published emissions data
(initially for 1992&#173;93) from industrial processes in England
and Wales in the so&#173;called Chemical Release Inventory (CRI,
see chapter 6. The &quot;Right&#173;to&#173;Know&quot; in Great
Britain). Since 1974, an integrated database of emissions and
supporting information has been in existence in the Netherlands.
The Dutch Emission Inventory System comprises two connected information
systems: <BR>

<UL>
<LI>The individual system (IEI) contains emissions to air and
water from large point sources; in the near future waste data
will be incorporated. 
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>The collective system (CEI), which is a geographical information
system, contains spatially resolved emissions data; this system
includes emissions from all sources, industrial as well as non&#173;industrial,
including diffuse sources such as consumers, traffic and agricultural
activities. Only aggregated data are published, but since 1994&#173;95
the polluters can be identified, upon request. 
</UL>

<P>
Sweden stopped its work on a national PRTR upon becoming a Member
of the European Community because the European Commission had
started to draw up a PRTR called Polluting Emissions Register
(PER, see box 7). The motivating forces for the Commission were
to fulfil commitments under Agenda 21 (1992) and the EU's Vth
Environmental Action Programme &quot;Towards Sustainability&quot;
(1992), as well as to build up their own database as a basis for
rational environmental policies.<BR>

<P>
If Member States are serious about their reporting obligations
to the EEA and fulfilling the community's right&#173;to&#173;know
as envisaged by Agenda 21, they will build up national databases

<P>
Air and water polluting substances do not respect national borders
and coming generations will have to handle the toxic chemicals
- and their effects - which we are using now. Since 1984, the
Environmental Ministers of the North Sea riparian States have
been discussing measures to protect the marine environment of
the North Sea, and by 1991 had met three times to such effect.
Their first meeting called for a report on the state of the pollution
of the North Sea environment. This work was only recently published
and is called the Dobr&iacute;&#154;&#173;Assessment.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>a) CORINAIR</B></I>
<P>
The first attempt to construct a chemical register was the Emission
Inventory of Major Air Pollutants in OECD European countries in
1980. The first inventory covered only SO2, NOx and VOCs, categorized
by nine main sources. In 1985, this OECD project was followed
by the CORINAIR inventory established by a Decision of the European
Community. This inventory was a compilation of atmospheric emissions
from the 12 EEC Member States in 1985, covering the same pollutants
as the OECD project.<BR>

<P>
CORINAIR'85 was followed by CORINAIR'90, covering eight pollutants
(SO<SUB>2</SUB>, NO<SUB>x</SUB>, NMVOC, CH<SUB>4</SUB>, CO, CO<SUB>2</SUB>,
N<SUB>2</SUB>O, NH<SUB>3</SUB>). The data - from eleven sources
- were collected from 28 European countries. The CORINAIR'94 data
will be published at the end of 1996 and will cover aggregated
data from the same eight pollutants.<BR>

<P>
<I><B>b) The Hague Declaration</B></I>
<P>
In Bremen in 1984, the Environmental Ministers of the North Sea
riparian States discussed measures in order to protect this marine
environment. This became the first international North Sea Conference
(NSC). In light of a general deterioration in the environment
of the North Sea, the Ministerial Declaration following the third
NSC in 1990 adopted the so&#173;called Hague Declaration. This
calls for a 50&#173;70 per cent reduction of 36 substances via
direct and riverine input pathways by 1995 (1999 at the latest)
and for atmospheric emission reductions of 17 of these substances.
<BR>

<P>
Despite the difficulties in meeting the figures for aquatic discharges
and atmospheric emissions, progress appears to have been made
towards achieving the 70 per cent reduction target for the most
hazardous substances. For instance, Denmark and Norway will achieve
the 70 per cent reduction target for mercury; the Netherlands,
Sweden and the UK will achieve 50 per cent reductions; and all
other countries expect reductions of at least 30 per cent. One
major problem in comparing the progress of the riparian countries
are differences in the nature of the data collected, in the methods
of collection, and in the calculation of the levels of discharges
and emissions. <BR>

<P>
<I><B>c) The Dobr&iacute;&#154;&#173;Assessment</B></I>
<P>
In June 1991, at the first Conference of Environment Ministers
held at Dobr&iacute;&#154; Castle in the former Czechoslovakia,
the idea was born to report on the state of the pan&#173;European
environment, including central and eastern Europe. In that report
(&quot;Europe's Environment: The Dobr&iacute;&#154;&#173;Assessment&quot;),
the EEA Task Force, based in Copenhagen, summarized data from
48 European countries. Published in September 1995, it gives a
valuable overview of the loadings of pollutants in the environment.
<BR>

<P>
The Dobr&iacute;&#154;&#173;Assessment has served as the basis
for developing the Environmental Programme for Europe (EPE), which
in October 1995 was endorsed at the Third Conference of Environment
Ministers held in Sofia, Bulgaria. Then, the Ministers stated
that &quot;public participation is important at all levels of
environment policy&#173;making: setting objects, selecting instruments,
implementation and monitoring. However, in order to achieve sustainable
development, public participation also requires the willingness
of citizens and their ability to take responsibilities&quot;.
<BR>

<P>
For the Fourth Conference, to be held in Denmark in the spring
of 1998, the EEA will report on progress in respect of the main
issues which have been identified in the Dobr&iacute;&#154;&#173;Assessment.
Public participation will be one of the main agenda items. As
a result of decisions made at the Third Conference, currently
under way are negotiations, under the auspices of the UN Economic
Commission for Europe, for a convention on public participation.
It is expected that PRTRs will form part of the obligations of
the parties to such a convention.<BR>

<B>1 The &quot;New&quot; Synthetic Chemical Threat - Endocrine
Disruptors<BR>
</B>
<P>
Wildlife - and humans - are daily being exposed to synthetic chemical
compounds that disrupt development of the reproductive, immune,
nervous, and endocrine systems by mimicking hormones, blocking
the action of hormones, or by other unknown interference with
the endocrine system. Hormones play a key role in development,
and especially sexual differentiation.<BR>

<P>
The main message for those working in the field of toxic threats
to biodiversity is that it is no longer sufficient to approach
population/species revitalization passively by providing appropriate
habitat and expecting threatened populations to recover. Contamination
of habitat may not be visible and may not cause immediate death
of organisms. Instead, contaminants may cause population&#173;threatening
changes in the way an organism functions. For example, endocrine
disruption may endanger populations because their immune systems
are malfunctioning and they cannot recover from infections. Or
their ability to obtain sufficient food or avoid predators could
be affected. There is also evidence that endocrine disruptors
cause the loss of parenting instinct in some bird species because
of neurotoxicological effects. Abnormal sexual development of
anatomy or behaviour because of endocrine disruption can also
put populations at risk of not being able to reproduce in sufficient
numbers.<BR>

<P>
Scientists have concluded that many wildlife populations are already
affected by these compounds which are in everyday use. Impacts
already identified are:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Thyroid dysfunction in birds and fish
<LI>Decreased fertility in birds, fish, shellfish and mammals
<LI>Decreased hatching success in birds, fish and turtles
<LI>Gross birth deformities in birds, fish and turtles
<LI>Metabolic abnormalities in birds, fish and mammals
<LI>Behavioural abnormalities in birds
<LI>Demasculinization and feminization of male fish, birds and
mammals
<LI>Defeminization and masculinization of female fish and birds
<LI>Compromised immune systems in birds and mammals.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Some of the declines in a number of species and groups of animals
and plants which are in progress on the North American continent
are related to exposure to man&#173;made chemicals. Moreover,
these declines are not solely a US or North American problem.
They are occurring on a global basis.<BR>

<P>
Long&#173;lived species are particularly at risk, even though
they may not show overt signs of reproductive impairment. Populations
of many long&#173;lived species are declining, some to the verge
of extinction, without being noticed. Human beings have been affected
by compounds of this nature too. This is not too surprising, given
that we are on the top of the food&#173;chain.<BR>

<B>2 WWF's Key Characteristics of the &quot;Benchmark&quot; PRTR
<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. WWF's benchmark provides a concise and comprehensive accounting
of chemicals in an industrial facility's product and waste stream.
It is a stimulus for and measure of cleaner products and processes.
<BR>

<P>
The benchmark reports on:
<P>
2. individual chemicals
<P>
3. individual facilities, installations and processes
<P>
4. periodically
<P>
5. all releases and transfers to air, water and land, as well
as into products.<BR>

<P>
6. For data elements such as chemicals, facilities, installations,
processes and locations, the benchmark uses common identifiers.
<P>
7. The data are structured for entry, organization, analysis and
access through computer database management.
<P>
8. The benchmark allows limited trade secrecy.
<P>
9. The benchmark shows what type of data are claimed secret.
<P>
10. The data are intended for active and regular public dissemination
- to local communities, industrial managers, government policy&#173;makers,
investors, etc. Everyone has the &quot;right&#173;to&#173;know&quot;.

<B>3 Class Definitions for Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels<BR>
</B>
<P>
Class 1 processes and installations* in Flanders and Wallonia
and Class IA processes and installations in Brussels are considered
to be potentially the most harmful ones; provincial authorities
are responsible for the permit procedures; the public is involved.
<BR>

<P>
Class 2 processes and installations in Flanders and Wallonia and
Class IB processes and installations in Brussels are considered
to have less harmful potential; communal authorities are responsible
for the simplified permit procedures.<BR>

<P>
Class 3 processes and installations in Flanders and Wallonia and
Class 2 processes and installations in Brussels are expected to
have little or no impact on the environment. They either need
to notify the authorities or obtain a simplified environmental
permit demand from the Brussels Region.<BR>

<P>
* Under Flemish, Walloon and Brussels regulations, permits are
given for &quot;installations&quot; as well as for &quot;processes&quot;
which are defined, for example for Flanders in Annex I of VLAREM
I. Under certain conditions, authorities can give permits for
whole enterprises.<BR>

<B>4 Experiences with the province of Antwerp (Flanders)...<BR>
</B>
<P>
The Permanent Deputation of the province has refused seven requests
for permits or emission reports. Five appeals were introduced
to the Flemish Minister of Environment. In four cases the Minister
has instructed the Permanent Deputation to answer the requests.
But five months later, only one request had been answered. The
per copy price, which has to be paid in advance, was very high
at BFr60 per page; however, after appealing, the information was
given for free.<BR>

<P>
<B>...and the municipality of Antwerp (Flanders)<BR>
</B>
<P>
The municipality refused requests to view permits for a few companies
operating in or near the harbour of Antwerp. However, WWF's consultant
was told to write to two senior officials of the city of Antwerp
to explain the reason for the request and to ask that staff be
instructed to spend time locating the information.<BR>

<P>
Having received no response to the written request one month later,
WWF's consultant telephoned the municipal secretary requesting
that the law be respected. The civil servant, aware that the information
was being requested, said he was in favour of providing the information
but, due to a staff shortage, access could only be given in half&#173;day
increments and by appointment.<BR>

<P>
The archives appeared to be in disorder. For an entire day, WWF's
consultant and a municipality staff member searched for 14 permits
for one of the companies. Some permits were missing and others
were impossible to retrieve. Copies could be taken for the price
of BFr5 each, however the copy machine was primitive and deficient.

<B>5 Authorization procedures</B>
<P>
For the authorization procedure in accordance with the Federal
Emission Control Act (BImSchG), authorities' responsibilities
differ as follows:<BR>

<P>
1. New installations which may affect humans and the environment
require a permit. Such installations are summarized in columns
1 and 2 in the Annex of the 4th Decree of BImSchG. The public
is involved only in the authorization procedure for installations
listed in column 1.<BR>

<P>
2. New installations with permitted loads are listed in column
2 and have to go through a simplified authorization procedure
without public involvement. <BR>

<P>
Small installations with negligible effects are not prescribed
under the Federal Air Pollution Act. Their releases into atmosphere
go unregulated, except where there are concerns for worker safety.
For discharges into watercourses, a discharge permit is needed
from the water authority.<BR>

<P>
<A HREF="germany.htm">Back to the main text ...</A>

<A NAME="box6"></A>
<P>
<B>6 Processes in England and Wales<BR>
</B>
<P>
Part A processes* (IPC processes): 34 process categories are covered
which are considered to have the most polluting potential. About
1,910 authorizations/processes have been registered and controlled
by the HMIP. Existing plants have to apply for authorizations
in phases, so not all Part A processes have yet been regulated
under the IPC.<BR>

<P>
Part B processes* (LAAPC processes): 82 process categories are
covered which are considered to have less polluting potential
and are not covered by the IPC. Air emissions are controlled by
Local Authorities Air Pollution Control (LAAPC) and discharges
into watercourses by the Environment Agency. Approximately 13,000
authorizations/processes are registered.<BR>

<P>
Neither Part A, nor Part B processes: Certain processes are not
prescribed under the Environmental Protection Regulations. Such
discharges direct into watercourses will be regulated by the Environment
Agency. Discharges to atmosphere go unregulated apart from any
concerns to worker safety, which are dealt with by the Health
and Safety Executive.<BR>

<P>
* &quot;Processes&quot; under the EPA90 are distinguishable from
&quot;installations&quot; under German legislation in that a company
in Germany requires a permit for an installation which could use
more than one process, whereas a company in England and Wales
will require authorizations for each process.<BR>

<P>

<A NAME="box7"></A>

<P>
<B>7 Polluting Emissions Register (PER)<BR>
</B>
<P>
PER will be integrated into the EEC&#173;wide permitting scheme
for major polluters - the proposed &quot;Integrated Pollution
and Prevention Control&quot; (IPPC) Directive. The Directive,
which was adopted by the European Council in September 1996, will
come into force at the end of 1996.<BR>

<P>
The IPPC Directive provides that the Commission should publish
every three years an inventory of the &quot;principal emissions
and sources responsible&quot; on the basis of data supplied by
the Member States. It is likely that the Commission will delegate
this task to the European Environmental Agency (EEA). However,
the draft Directive does not fix details and unfortunately no
active public dissemination is foreseen. A committee will have
to negotiate these details after implementation. At the very least,
it would be useful if this committee, which will define the reporting
obligations, recommends the use of comparable databases and the
use of common identifiers. It is crucial for maximum pollution
prevention that the Member States submit their PRTR data to the
EEA based upon the WWF Benchmark model.
<P>
It seems clear that the PER will be not be published before the
next millennium since the Member States have three years to align
their legislation with the IPPC Directive; in addition, they have
18 months within which to report to the Commission for the first
time after the Directive comes into effect.<BR>

<P><font size=5><B>WWF in Nepal<BR></B></font><p>
Nestled among the Himalayas, the world's highest mountain peaks, Nepal 
has a
varied bio-geography. From lush moist forests and sparse alpine deserts to
luxurious grasslands. Massive rivers flow through the country's middle hills
to the southern flood plains. Flora and fauna from the Oriental and
Palaearctic zones meet and mingle here. The altitudinal changes and
resulting environmental diversity give Nepal's ecosystems a unique wealth
and variety.
<p>
Nepal shelters some of the world's rarest animals. These include endangered
species such as the Greater One-horned rhinoceros, Royal Bengal tiger
(Panthera tigris), snow leopard (Panthera uncia), Asian elephant (Elephas
maximus), barasingha or swamp deer, Gangetic dolphin, gharial or fish-eating
crocodile, musk deer, and red panda. Nepal also has over 800 species of
birds, including six endemic pheasant species, 640 species of butterflies,
and over 6,500 species of flowering plants.
<p>
Poverty and a rapidly growing population are, however, posing serious
conservation threats to the country. Nepal is classified by the United
Nations as one of the least developed countries in the world. The burgeoning
population is beginning to exceed the carrying capacity of the country's
arable land. Pristine lowland jungles were cleared for development
infrastructure such as roads, power and irrigation systems. Hill people
migrated in resettlement programs. As a result, populations of rhinoceros,
tiger, and elephant have been gravely threatened.
<p>
Between 1975 and 1980, 15 per cent of Nepal's remaining forests were
destroyed mainly due to the demand for fuelwood, fodder and agricultural
development. If left unprotected, Nepal's forest may disappear completely
within a few decades.
<p>
Nepal's problems have been compounded in recent years by toxic residue from
chemical pesticides. This has diminished fertility, affected health and
infected water supplies. Vehicular and industrial pollution, especially in
the capital Kathmandu, have contributed to the woes of this mountain
kingdom. As Mingma Norbu Sherpa, Country Representative for WWF-Bhutan and
Nepal Programmes, puts it: "Nepal faces a formidable environmental challenge.
The government of Nepal, various conservation organizations and WWF share a
commitment to preserving the country's rich natural heritage while also
addressing the needs of a growing human population."
<p>
WWF's involvement in Nepal dates back to 1967 when it supported work to save
endangered species such as the Greater One-horned Rhinoceros and the Royal
Bengal tiger. In 1985, WWF stepped up its activities and initiated a
country-wide programme with the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation,
a local NGO founded with the support of the Nepalese royal family. In 1993,
WWF signed an agreement with the government and opened an office in
Kathmandu to coordinate and monitor project activities. 
<p>
The initial focus was on research and training. Since then, WWF's Nepal
program has expanded to cover conservation education, protected area and
endangered species management, and institutional strengthening. It also
addresses human needs and community issues. And encourages the integration
of conservation with development.
<p>
One of WWF's biggest achievements in Nepal is the reforestation, protection
and clean-up of the Mt Everest area. Protected as the Sagarmatha National
Park and recognized internationally as a World Heritage Site, this highland
Khumbu region has long attracted trekkers and mountaineers.  Camp litter,
garbage left from expeditions, and improper human waste disposal had created
a serious health and ecological problem in the area. Equally serious was the
problem of deforestation -- the direct result of demand for scarce fuelwood.
<p>
In 1991, WWF assisted local villagers to form a committee to prevent and
control pollution in Sagarmatha, and to strengthen reforestation efforts.
The Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC) evolved different 
methods to
manage human and other kinds of waste such as compost and incinerators. WWF
produced an Operational Plan in 1993 to focus priorities. A monetary deposit
scheme was introduced, based on the weight of equipment and supplies brought
in, thus giving visitors an incentive to pack out as much as possible at the
end of their expedition. All funds forfeited were to help finance the
clean-up program.
<p>
SPCC has gathered momentum in the past four years. It has expanded its
activities beyond pollution control to include community services,
environmental protection, tourism development and cultural preservation.
<p>
WWF also supports the Annapurna Conservation Area Project. Initiated with
WWF funding in 1986, this project --WWF's largest throughout the last decade
-- gives the 120,000 inhabitants of the beautiful Annapurna region in
mid-north Nepal control over the area's natural resources.
<p>
WWF has developed several new projects as well. Along with the Department of
National Parks and Wildlife Conservation (DNPWC) it carried out a joint
feasibility study of the Kanchenjunga area. The aim is to establish a
protected area here. WWF assisted DNPWC in biodiversity inventory and
management plan preparation for the Royal Bardia National Park. A programme
has also been initiated to promote local guardianship of endangered wildlife
species and habitats in  the Royal Chitwan National Park. Aside from this,
the Integrated Pest Management project has been developed to combat the
adverse effect of extensive use of pesticides in the health, agriculture and
industrial sectors.

<font size=3 color="#bb0000"><b>Meet WWF's People in the Field</b></font> 
<p>
         Ashiq Ahmad,  presently the Conservation Director (North West 
Frontier Province and Northern Areas), WWF-Pakistan, 
is considered to be one of just a handful of experts in conservation 
working there. His dedication has led him to become  a 
world reference on topics of species and wildlife preservation. 
<p>
          A charismatic, handsome man of the Pathan tribe, very early on 
in life Ashiq focused on what he wanted to do. In 
his youth wildlife was a passion, which would later become his profession.
<p>
           Born in Charsadda village in the North West Frontier of  
Pakistan in 1947, and beginning his education in a 
village school, the young Ashiq's aptitude led him to graduate in 
Zoology, followed by a post-graduation in Forestry from  
Peshawar. Another feather in his cap was the M.Sc in Natural Resource 
Management he attained from the University of Edinburgh 
in the UK.
<p>
Subsequent to his studies, Ashiq joined the Pakistan Forest Institute as 
a researcher. Very early on, whilst conducting field 
surveys, he was introduced to the  the increasing and alarming pressures 
faced by wildlife species and their habitats all 
over  Pakistan.
<p>
One of the first surveys he conducted was to determine the distribution 
and status of crocodiles, which were reportedly on 
the verge of extinction in Pakistan. Ashiq covered almost all the areas 
where these reptiles were thought to exist. In 
addition to the known sites, he discovered half a dozen other places that 
were new to scientific records as crocodile sites.
A river near the town of Sibbi in the Baluchistan Province, which was 
once a haven for crocodiles, now had very few, due 
primarily to the villagers' practice of killing these animals on sight. 
Investigations revealed that during this century, 
people developed the  unusual belief  that if you saw a crocodile and did 
not kill it, your wife stood divorced. As a 
conservationist Ashiq had luckily spotted several crocodiles on that 
trip, but as a married man he was unlucky!
<p>

<b>The nature detective</b>
<p>
           Subsequent research on birds led him to identify the flyways 
and corridors of migratory birds (1980-91) and some 
of the factors that threaten their existence. His contribution to the 
conservation of these species has been invaluable. In 
1982, Ashiq rediscovered the marbled teal duck (Marmaronetta 
angustirastris) which had been declared extinct in Pakistan. He 
has also recorded the sightings of swans and various species of  birds 
which had not been seen in the country for over 60 
years.
<p>
                        Ashiq's discoveries have not been confined to 
bird species either.  His nose for detection 
coupled with his experience in the field has led him to  locate several 
new wetland sites as well.
In 1985, in an effort to track the endangered Sulaiman Markhor (Capra 
falconeri jerdoni), an endemic wild goat, he started 
surveys in Pakistan's 'tribal belt' in the province of Balochistan.  
While on the wild goat's trail, the sleuth in Ashiq 
discovered that a big chunk of forest, the life blood of the local tribal 
people, was quickly disappearing. Fortunately for 
these tribals, Ashiq went on to devise a plan to protect not only  these 
forests, but the livelihood of the local Shirani  
people.

<p>


<b>Taking a gamble</b>
<p>
 In 1991, Ashiq joined WWF-Pakistan and instantly got the chance to make 
a real difference based on his previous discovery in 
the Sulaiman Mountains. He formulated a multi-faceted project that would 
protect the forests and biodiversity of the Sulaiman 
Mountains, focusing especially  on protecting migratory birds from 
hunting in the Northwest Frontier Province, whilst 
demonstrating how sustainable utilization of wildlife species benefits 
conservation as well as the local economy. It was a 
new approach for the area, and it was a gamble that paid off.
<p>
To save the forests of the Sulaiman Mountains, Ashiq had to face greedy 
contractors willing to go to any length to protect 
their interests. He also had to work intimately with rival tribal 
communities that live by their own rigid traditions and are 
involved in a complicated chain of conflicts and disputes. Finally, he 
had to risk his life convincing tribals who had been 
feuding for years to sit down and talk to one another. These men are 
known to talk with their Kalashnikov rifles first, and 
tongues later. 
<p>
The tribal belt has its own autonomous political and administrative set 
up. The forests, valued by the contractors and tribes 
in different ways, are the local people's only source of cash income. To 
get through this maze, Ashiq had to do two things: 
resolve the inter-tribal disputes, and help  create alternate sources of 
income to reduce pressure on the forests. So far the 
strategy is working: a part of the forest is now protected, and the 
project is being extended to other parts of the mountain 
region.
<p>
             The project has its detractors, but they are not numerous or 
agitated enough to throw a spanner in the works. 
More importantly, the Shirani tribals are happy with it, especially with 
the prospect of gaining income from trophy hunting 
of the Markhor (Capra falconeri jerdoni), a mountain goat with a 
distinctive cork-screw horn which can fetch between $10,000 
to $15,000 apiece.   
<p>
             

<b>Bird tactics </b>
<p>
        To protect migrating birds traversing along the internationally 
renowned Chitral Flyway, in the Northern Areas of 
Pakistan,  Ashiq found himself  working with a society where every third 
person is a hunter, where any attempt to regulate 
hunting is considered a serious violation of local rights, and where 
hunters are proud to break and abuse hunting laws. In 
addition, politicians seek votes on the promise that the government will 
never interfere in hunting activities. So things 
were not going to be easy.
   <p>
        Although this project is still finding its feet, Ashiq is  
carrying out the overall strategy with some good 
results. For the first time in Pakistan, private bird refuges are in 
place in the project area, and hunters have formed 
associations with their own rules and ethics for bird hunting. They are 
now very much aware that should they wish to continue 
their sport, they will need to ensure that only a sustainable amount of 
birds are hunted. 
<p>
           Not only this, but they have noticed the dramatic increase in 
a ferocious mosquito-type insect, locally known as 
keeshum, whose population was previously controlled by the visiting birds 
who fed off them. Unless the birds are allowed to 
visit the area without disturbance, the keeshum are likely to 
proliferate. 
<p>
Children, have also joined hands in conservation by enlisting in 
conservation clubs in their schools. These youngsters begin 
hunting with their catapaults at a young age as they  have no other 
entertainment. However, also on realizing the importance 
of these birds to the environment, hundreds  have now surrendered their 
slingshots to WWF.
<p>
As this programme could not be successful without the full cooperation of 
the local hunters, this project was full of  
uncertainties. If even one man bucked the programme, the whole process 
could collapse. The idea was to initiate carefully 
controlled commercial trophy hunting for foreigners, with the revenue 
benefiting the local communities. 
<p>
            Although the government has a rule forbidding all mammal 
hunting, hunting ibex is permitted under license. This 
was allowed subsequent to Ashiq's deliberations  with the government and 
local communities to invoke the principle of 
sustainable hunting practices. The ban on the export of trophies was 
another hurdle he had to overcome. Fortunately both 
sustainable hunting and exporting trophies were permitted due to the 
results WWF had achieved, as well as Ashiq's persuasive 
charm with both officials and local communities.
<p>
In 1994, the government issued five ibex permits to  foreign hunters, at 
a cost of  $3000 per animal. The deal was that 75 
per cent of the $15,000 revenue would go to local communities.  This 
project has now become a precedent for others.
Given the magnitude of Pakistan's environmental problems, Ashiq's efforts 
may seem negligible  forests are still being cut 
down and hunting still continues unregulated. However, his work provides  
guidance and will become something for others to 
build upon. It will probably take longer than his lifetime for this to 
happen, and for tangible results to emerge. However, 
Ashiq is satisfied that, thanks to the support of the Government of 
Pakistan and WWF-Pakistan, he has given all he could.

<P><font size=5><B>WWF in Zambia<BR></B></font><p>
Approximately  twice the size of the United Kingdom, Zambia is situated 
in the southern part of the African continent. 
Woodlands and forests cover 80 per cent of the country, making it highly 
significant from the biological point of view. A 
further six per cent of Zambia is made up of vast wetlands and swamp 
forests with their specialized aquatic and swamp 
vegetation. Zambia is home to 4,600 plant species, of which 200 are 
endemic. 
<p>
Its animal wealth is no less diverse. The varied wildlife includes the 
elephant, hippo, buffalo, lion, leopard, cheetah, 
wild dog and three sub-species of  lechwe. The Kafue (Kobus leche 
kafuensis)  and black lechwe(K.l. smithemani), 
Cookson's wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus cooksoni) and Thornicroft's 
giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis thornicrofti) 
are, in fact, unique to Zambia. Over 700 species of birds, including the 
rare and threatened shoebill, wattled crane, 
slaty egret and black-cheeked lovebird are also found here.
<p>
Pressures of change are, however, threatening these biological treasures. 
Over 90 per cent of Zambia's energy is derived 
from charcoal and wood, both forest products. Expanding human 
settlements, shifting agriculture and slash-and-burn 
farming are having their effect too. And overstocking and overgrazing of 
land have exacerbated the problem.
<p>
Adding to the problem is rapid industrialization. Although water remains 
one of Zambia's most important natural 
resource--the country receives 700-1,500 mm of rainfall 
annually--industrial waste from the large mining sector is 
affecting the country's ground and river-water systems. These are already 
being infiltrated by insecticides used in 
tsetse fly eradication programmes. At the same time, Zambia's wetland 
ecosystem, which relies on regular flooding, is 
being threatened by hydroelectric power stations, irrigation and dam 
construction. 
<p>
Already falling under the endangered category are the black rhinoceros, 
elephant, wild dog, cheetah, lechwe, leopard, 
and Nile and slender-snouted crocodiles. Poaching has reduced Zambia's 
rhino population by 90 per cent and its elephants 
by 60 per cent in the past 15 years. Habitat destruction (especially 
deforestation), unregulated hunting and fishing are 
other threats to the country's fauna. 
<p>
Despite the growing threat to its ecology, only 30.6 per cent of Zambia's 
land area has been declared a protected 
region, and there are 52 protected area sites in all.
<p>
WWF began its conservation efforts in the country in 1962. By 1990, the 
organization had provided support to 20 Zambian 
conservation projects, amounting to Sfr 3.9 million. In 1989, Zambia was 
declared a priority country in WWF's Africa 
Programme, and about a year later, WWF signed an official agreement with 
the government. WWF opened its Country Office 
in Zambia in 1991. It has so far completed 18 projects in the country and 
is at present involved
in 10 other operations.
In 1966, its funds helped set up the Lochinvar National Park, home of the 
Kafue lechwe. Since the mid-'70s, the 
organization has been funding the Wildlife Conservation Society of 
Zambia's environmental education programmes. This 
includes a network of primary and secondary school conservation clubs and 
a weekly environment programme, which is one 
of the most popular children's shows in and around the country. 
<p>
The early '80s saw the launch of the Administrative Management Design for 
Game Management Areas (ADMADE), a highly 
successful nationwide conservation pogramme. It involves local 
communities in conservation and helps them financially by 
reinvesting money raised from park entry and safari fees in community 
development and local wildlife management. ADMADE 
has helped reduce poaching ten-fold in areas where projects are 
well-established.
<p>
WWF also played a key role in the setting up of the Luangwa Integrated 
Resource Development Project. The people living 
on the border of the South Luangwa National Park are encouraged to 
exploit its natural resources on a sustainable level. 
The project focuses on rural development schemes such as forestry, 
agriculture, and fisheries programmes.
<p>
In 1989, the organization funded a US $2.27 million debt-for-nature 
agreement with the Zambian Central Bank. This has 
helped the country save important wetlands and provide institutional 
support to its National Parks and Wildlife Service.

<B><H2><CENTER>WWF Considers CSD Conference The Acid Test Of The Earth Summit</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
</B>
<B>New York City</B> -- As the UN Commission on Sustainable Development
(CSD) enters its third year, WWF sees the 1995 meeting beginning
today as the acid test of the Earth Summit.
<BR>
<BR> 
A key test will be the Commission's ability to make real progress
on the issue of conserving and managing the world's forests. WWF
is calling on the CSD to coordinate all the existing international
initiatives which relate to forests. Such coordination must address
the conflicts of interests between the implementation of international
economic policies, such as structural adjustment, and the objectives
of the Forest Principles, agreed at the Earth Summit.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This meeting of the Commission offers an exciting opportunity
to demonstrate how environment and development policies can be
integrated,&quot; said Carole Saint Laurent, head of WWF's delegation.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The patchwork of current international forest agreements
make effective forest conservation impossible,&quot; she added.
&quot;The CSD can play a crucial role by pulling these commitments
under one roof.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Another test will be how the CSD guides future work on trade environment
and sustainable development issues. WWF is calling on the CSD
to create an Intergovernmental Panel on Trade and Sustainable
Development. This panel should have an open-ended mandate dedicated
to realising the inextricable link between trade, environment
and development.
<BR>
<BR>

In June 1992 The Earth Summit, the largest ever gathering of world
leaders, addressed the relationship between unsustainable economic
patterns and global environmental degradation.
 
 
It adopted Agenda 21, the blueprint for putting the world on a
sustainable course, and created the CSD to implement its recommendations.
<BR>
 
The 1993 CSD meeting was focused primarily on establishing a
detailed programme of work which will take the CSD through to
1997. The 1994 CSD set about the task of reviewing the implementation
of Agenda 21.
<BR>
 
&quot;The CSD must not waste any more time paraphrasing Agenda
21 and instead focus on concrete and achievable actions,&quot;
Ms Saint Laurent concluded. &quot;This meeting will prove the
value of the Earth Summit, or not.&quot;
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
 

<B>WWF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE THIRD SESSION OF
THE UN COMMISSION ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</B>
<BR>
<BR> 
1) Establish the framework for an immediate preliminary assessment
of the likely impacts of the Uruguay Round Agreement on the environment
and sustainable development in order to identify issues of particular
concern.
<BR>
<BR>
 
2) Call for an Intergovernmental Panel on Trade and Sustainable
Development to be established to analyze how trade policies and
positive incentives for sustainable development should be linked.
<BR>
<BR>
 
3) Establish and promote specialist technology transfer teams
at the national, regional and sectoral levels to identify transfer
and market opportunities, undertake assessments, prepare project
proposals, and access finance.
<BR>
<BR>
 
4) Highlight emerging problems and identify needs for technical
and financial reserves using information provided by countries
in their national reports, combined with internally comparable
statistics.
<BR>
<BR>
 
5) Draw together into one coherent strategy the various international
initiatives on forests.
<BR>
<BR>
 
6) Agree to a definition of forest quality and consequent criteria
for forest management.
<BR>
<BR>

7) Call for national pesticide reduction programmes and sustainable
agricultural strategies to include targets of at least an overall
50 per cent pesticide reduction.
<BR>
<BR>
8) Begin negotiations on a Biosafety Protocol to the Convention
on Biodiversity to begin during 1995. The Protocol should set
out: stringent rules for release of Genetically Engineered Organisms
(GEOs) to the environment; environmental impact assessment requirements
including assessment of the need for a GEO, and of non-GEO alternatives;
long term ecological surveillance requirements for released GEOs
and their impacts.

<font size=3 color="#bb0000"><b>Life in Gashaka Gumti National 
Park</b></font> 
<p>
<b>Lagos, Nigeria-</b>Since 1992, Andrew Dunn, 32, has been living in
the tiny village of Gashaka, close to Nigeria's northeastern border
with Cameroon. The tall, mild-mannered British biologist, who
originally did primate and large-mammal research in the area,
is now working on a management plan for Nigeria's youngest park.
<P>
Gashaka Gumti National Park, covering more than 6,000 km<SUP>2</SUP>,
is home to Nigeria's tallest mountain, Mount Gangirwal. The surrounding
Fulani communities call it the &quot;mountain of death&quot; because
it is so high and steep. Besides its impressive highlands of rolling
grasslands and montane forest (Africa's rarest and most threatened
habitat) ranging in altitude from 1,800 to 2,200 metres, the park
also has savannah woodlands and tropical forests. The park not
only has very rich plant and animal life (including about 2,000
chimpanzees) - it is also the source of the River Benue, Nigeria's
second-largest river. 
<P>
July is rainy season in Gashaka Gumti, and the going is tough.
From the project base camp in Gashaka village, Dunn has to risk
steep, slippery roads with old four-wheel-drive vehicles and brave
two rivers by canoe to get to the nearest road. From there it's
another seven-hour journey to the closest airport. A couple of
weeks ago, a rain-swollen river swept away a game guard. Dunn
dove in to rescue him. The strong current sucked him down and
he was almost drowned in the terrified guard's grip. Fortunately
they were swept downstream to a clearing where they clutched on
to river bank vegetation and made it to safety.<BR>

<P>
<B>Working with the Fulani </B>
<P>
For the past year, Dunn has worked alongside Nigerian project
manager Faith Ananze and national park staff to devise a way of
incorporating close to 2,000 Fulani cattle herdsmen and their
10,000 cattle into the park management plan. The Fulani have resided
in the area since well before the park was created. Now they live
in seven enclaves within the park, most at high altitudes of over
2,000 metres, out of reach of tsetse flies and where the grazing
is good and water plentiful.
<P>
The Fulani are happy to be integrated in to conservation activities,
although there is no official government legislation addressing
the needs and rights of people living within parks.  So this is
a new area to be tackled by conservationists in Nigeria.
<P>
Besides assisting the national parks authorities by supplying
camping equipment and park surveillance and management training,
Dunn's project (supported by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation,
WWF, the British Overseas Development Agency, and the European
Union) also focuses on rural development. So far a health clinic
is almost completed, two schools have been built, and a human/animal
conflict programme is being developed to provide relief to farmers
whose land is razed by baboons and green monkeys.
<P>
Dunn speaks with a sense of enchantment about the area's spectacular
scenery. &quot;When I sit in front of my house writing reports,
I look out over a spectacular valley with a river running through
it,&quot; he says. &quot;It is so beautiful and peaceful, I am
often reluctant to put on my small generator because I don't want
to disturb Gashaka's serenity.&quot; 
<P>
And he's had more than a few adventures. He recalls a memorable
experience during a biological inventory: &quot;One day, as we
were cutting our way through the bush in my study area, we surprised
a group of grown chimps.  Not being habituated to humans, the
chimps became very agitated and chased us down the hill. It was
terrifying, as a grown chimp has the strength of three men and
can easily tear someone apart.&quot; 
<P>
For the next three years, two doctorate students from England
and the US are continuing chimp research in the park, while other
Nigerian and international researchers are focusing on  botanical
surveys, traditional Fulani ethno-veterinary medicine, vegetation
changes due to livestock grazing, ethnobotanical research, the
use of non-timber forest products, as well as continuing surveys
of large mammals.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>GLAND, Switzerland</B> -- The lack of adequate controls in
the international trade in bear bile and gall bladder in East
Asia may be having seriously negative effects on several species
of bear in Asia and America, according to a trade report released
today by TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring arm of WWF-World
Wide Fund For Nature and IUCN-The World Conservation Union.<BR>
<BR>
Covering markets in China, Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Japan
and Taiwan, the report <I>The Bear Facts: the East Asian Market
for Bear Gall Bladder</I>, by J.A.Mills, Simba Chan and Akiko
Ishihara, says that the legal trade in bear gall bladders and
bear bile products is still far from being controlled enough to
ensure the survival of several bear species, particularly the
Sun Bear (<I>Helarctos malayanus</I>), the Asiatic Black Bear
(<I>Selenarctos thibetanus</I>) and South America's highly endangered
Spectacled Bear (<I>Tremarctus ornatus</I>). The report also warns
about the possibility that China's bear farming programme, officially
hailed as a conservation success story, may hide a dangerous black
market in bear parts.<BR>
<BR>
Bears are the only mammals to produce significant amounts of the
bile acid <I>tauro ursodeoxycholic</I> (UDCA), which has been
used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine to treat several
forms of cancer, burns, asthma, fractures, hemorrhoids and other
conditions. Although Chinese experts claim the bile produced in
bear farms can satisfy the needs of the country's 1.2 billion
citizens, the TRAFFIC report says that documentation of the claimed
positive effects of bear farming on conservation of wild bear
populations has yet to be achieved. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Chinese government has devoted many resources to bear
farming but altogether too few resources to monitoring bears in
the wild&quot;, says Judy Mills, co-author of the report and Director
of TRAFFIC East Asia. &quot;There also may be a danger that increased
availability of farmed bile will stimulate demand for gall bladders
from wild bears, which could prove disastrous for China's last
bears.&quot; TRAFFIC has also received reports that mortality
rates in the farms are excessively high and that bears continue
to be taken from the wild to supplement farm populations. Estimates
place China's bear population at fewer than 30,000. <BR>
<BR>
Prices for bear gall bladders have escalated in several of the
countries surveyed. In South Korea, for example, where &quot;milking&quot;
of bile from live bears is illegal, the demand for gall bladders
has risen significantly over the last four years, driving the
prices up from US$1-US$210 per gram in 1991 to US$10-US$500 per
gram in 1995. <BR>
<BR>
Moreover, international trade controls such as those mandated
by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) have failed to be systematically
implemented in many of the bear part trading countries, with official
import and export records often clearly contradicting CITES trade
data. In 1991, for example, Russia notified the CITES Secretariat
that it had exported 1,289kg of bear gall bladder to Singapore
--the largest quantity listed for that year. This information
appears nowhere on the import records of the CITES management
authority in Singapore.<BR>
<BR>
In Macau, a CITES-bound territory since 1986, authorities &quot;report
no significant trade of bear gall bladder or bile.&quot; However,
TRAFFIC investigators found gall bladder or bile available in
34 out of 43 stores visited.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Governments should adopt strict measures to combat illegal
trade, including registration and marking systems for bear gall
bladders and bear bile and requirements for proof of legal acquisition&quot;,
says the report. &quot;The patchwork of national trade controls
currently in place is clearly inadequate to ensure that legally
obtained bear products can be distinguished from those obtained
illegally, a situation which undermines efforts to conserve wild
bear populations.&quot;<BR>

<B><H2><CENTER>WWF Advises Tourists Against Buying Wildlife Products</CENTER></H2></B> 
<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Gland, Switzerland</B> &#173; Tourists should beware of buying
products from endangered animals and plants while travelling abroad
for Christmas or winter holidays, WWF&#173;World Wide Fund for
Nature and TRAFFIC warned today, while releasing a guide on what
not to buy in 20 tourist destinations.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;Tourists travelling during this popular holiday season must
take great care if they consider buying wildlife products as gifts,&quot;
said Steven Broad, Executive Director of TRAFFIC International.
&quot;By buying unwisely, tourists can unwittingly become part
of a trade which is both illegal and threatening to many animal
and plant species in the wild. They have a great responsibility
for not perpetuating this irresponsible demand.&quot;<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While some wildlife and wildlife products can be legally offered
for sale in many countries, this does not necessarily mean that
it is legal to take them home. The guide includes dozens of tips
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
on products to be wary of, such as sea turtle products from Morocco,
walrus tusks from the USA or hippo teeth carvings from Hong Kong.
All of these are prohibited or require special permits in international
commercial trade.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Jewellery made from ivory and coral, besides carvings made from
these materials and precious woods are other restricted wildlife
products likely to be offered to tourists during this season.
<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The annual trade in wildlife and wildlife products is estimated
to be worth US$20 billion, with up to five million live birds,
six million live reptiles, 50 million manufactured reptile skin
products and 2,000 tonnes of coral sold each year. Up to one quarter
of this trade is unsustainable or illegal, pushing endangered
species ever closer to extinction. This is the third most significant
illegal trade worldwide, following drugs and weapons.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
International commercial trade in wildlife is regulated by the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), which has 130 member states. TRAFFIC
is the wildlife trade monitoring programme of WWF and IUCN&#173;The
World

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In many cases, wildlife and wildlife products can be legally offered
for sale in popular tourist locations, bringing these purchases
home can often be prohibited or require special permits. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This guide is designed to help tourists be aware of national and
international trade controls and, therefore, avoid contributing
to illegal or detrimental trade in wildlife.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mediterranean resorts: Mediterranean beaches hold many attractions
for tourists, even in wintertime. Though rare these days, the
chance to have your photo taken with a live chimpanzee in Spain
should still not be one of them. Baby chimps in circuses and tiger
cubs sold by zoos can also turn up as tourist lures. Make sure
that the memories you bring home on film do not support this use
of rare species. In Greece, coats made from spotted cat furs may
be illegal. Also watch out for trinkets made from tortoise shell,
ivory and other wildlife products.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Turkey: All sorts of stuffed native birds and live turtles, chameleons
and other animals, native and exotic, are sold in local markets.
In some markets, there is also trade in birds of prey captured
or injured by hunters. Have the wildlife and products been collected
legally? It's impossible to tell, so it's best to leave well alone.
The same should be said for many marine
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
curios sold in Mediterranean Turkey. Even though much of this
trade is legal, it adversely affects many corals, sponges, shelled
molluscs and fishes.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Morocco: A walk through the central markets of Tangier and other
cities will reveal that sea turtles are not the only endangered
animals. Spur&#173;thighed tortoises are turned into souvenirs
ranging from home&#173;made musical instruments to fire bellows.
Be aware that the purchase of these and other unusual items may
contribute to the extinction of a species. Instead, choose the
same souvenirs made from alternative materials.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Kenya: This is the safari centre of the world, but beware. Kenya
has strict wildlife protection laws, and prohibits the collection
of corals and the export of products made from elephants, rhinos
and sea turtles. Trade in products made from certain reptiles
is also prohibited. Trade is allowed for some species, although
you should always check to see what permits are required, especially
for the export of any plants, insects and shells. Kenya is famous
for wood carvings but some species are poorly managed. Therefore
you should strive to buy carvings made from exotic species such
as mango and neem.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Zimbabwe: Think before you buy an ivory carving or bangle. Though
legal in Zimbabwe, most countries will confiscate elephant ivory
souvenirs upon your return home. With appropriate permits, hippo
teeth or warthog tusks could be acceptable substitutes, or try
the wide range of farmed ostrich and crocodile products.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
South Africa: Cycads have been described as living fossils and
are certainly among the unusual plants you will see during your
visit. Avoid most purchases of wild&#173;collected native flora,

including a vast range of rare succulents. Apart from special
circumstances, exports are likely 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
to be curbed under South African law or international trade controls,
and importation blocked by agricultural quarantine restrictions.
Elephant ivory is also available in South Africa, but illegal
to import into most countries. <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
R&eacute;union Island: This island is a popular destination for
Europeans. Sea turtle shells, turtle soup and decorative turtle
items are offered for sale. Even if the public information indicates
that the turtles are captive bred, the export of these products
is banned by international wildlife trade controls and the items
may be confiscated in the country of import.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
India: Shahtoosh, the &quot;King of Wools&quot;, comes from the
highly endangered Tibetan antelope. Shahtoosh, which is the underwool
of the animal, is extracted after killing the animal in its winter
coat. Being extremely expensive, shahtoosh is considered to be
a luxury item and a status symbol among the rich. Unfortunately,
the cost of this luxury is leading to the extinction of the species.
Up to three animals must die to provide enough wool for a single
shawl. Avoid shahtoosh and other goods made from wild animals,
most of which are protected in India.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sri Lanka: The tourist industry here threatens many sea turtles.
Shops along the south coast sell bracelets, earrings and hair
clips made from two of the most endangered: the hawksbill and
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
green turtles. Sea shells, coral and ivory are also available.
Buying coral or shells is unwise in Sri Lanka, even if they are
not protected by international trade controls because of the
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
environmental damage caused during their collection.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thailand: The most exotic of flowers &#173;&#173; orchids &#173;&#173;
grow with abandon in Thailand's tropical forests. But beware:
bringing home cut orchid flowers grown in nurseries would not
be a
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
problem, but bringing home live orchid plants would be. Some orchid
species are endangered or protected. Beware of exotic wildlife
foods, which may be made from threatened animals.<BR>

Malaysia: Looking for an unusual memento of your trip to Malaysia?
Butterflies captured forever behind glass, perhaps? Some butterflies
are endangered and buying specimens in

Indonesia: The thousands of islands in Indonesia's great archipelago
are home to the world's greatest range of animal and plant life.
You may be bewildered by the array of wildlife

<BLOCKQUOTE>
products offered for sale, but are subject to local and international
restrictions. Don't buy sea turtle products or curios such as
stuffed Birds of Paradise. Remember that you may need special
permits if you want to take home snake and lizard skin goods and
coral decorations.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Philippines: Sea shells may look lovely on a bookshelf but
remember that they may have been taken from the sea while still
inhabited by living animals. Be especially careful to avoid the
shells of giant clams which are banned from export under Philippine
law. Giant clams also require special permits to take back to
your home country.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hong Kong: A number of items available in Hong Kong that may not
be imported into most countries, including ivory. Hippo teeth
carvings and many Chinese medicines with wildlife as ingredients
also require special permits or are banned from international
commercial trade.

Australia: The vast majority of Australia's wildlife is protected
and many items cannot be exported without permission. This includes
live native animals, insects and wildlife items such as Australian
marine shells. Australian authorities take the legislation very
seriously and impose strict penalties, including prison sentences,
on violators. Souvenirs made from kangaroos, however, can be exported.

Mexico: Tempted to buy a parrot? Don't think of buying one in
the streets or shops of Mexico, which prohibits export of its
native birds. Many of Mexico's native cacti and orchids for sale
are unusual and rare, but Mexico prohibits the export of these
plants collected in the wild. So avoid them unless you are sure
they are artificially propagated and have proper documents. If
you would like a pair of cowboy boots, make sure they are not

USA: The Wild West and beautiful souvenirs to remember it by.
Do not be tempted by intricately carved scrimshaw products from
walrus tusks, especially in Alaska, or by wall hangings displaying
the feathers of wild birds. All native wild birds are protected
in the USA: possessing even a feather is illegal. Products from
American black bears, grizzly bears and polar bears require special
permits in international commercial trade. Walruses, fur seals
and other marine mammals are also protected, and trade in their
parts is only allowed for exempted Native American artisans.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Caribbean: The Caribbean is home to some of the richest terrestrial
and marine environments on earth. Enjoy the sun but watch out
for vendors selling tortoise-shell jewellery, turtle oil and other
items made from endangered sea turtles and other marine species.
The semi&#173;precious black corals, heavily exploited for jewellery,
are protected by many nations. By collecting or purchasing these
souvenirs, you are depleting marine ecosystems, risk having the
products seized, and you may have to pay hefty fines as well.

<B><H2><CENTER>Climate Change: Golden Opportunity Missed</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
BERLIN</B>-Two weeks of tense negotiations and late-night manoeuvrings
on measures to strengthen the United Nations Climate Convention
ended today in a mishmash of compromises that falls well short
of developing countries' and non-governmental organizations' expectations.
<BR>
&quot;Governments have missed a golden opportunity to combat the
threat of climate change,&quot; said Joy Hyvarinen, Treaties Officer
at WWF International.<BR>
<BR>
Last Saturday, developing nations put forward their &quot;Green
Paper&quot; proposal for a mandate to strengthen the Climate Convention
in a post-Berlin negotiating process. The paper challenged industrialized
countries to commit themselves to firm targets and timetables
to reduce CO2 emissions.<BR>
<BR>
Led by countries like the US, Canada, and Australia, and encouraged
by oil producers such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, governments
have radically diluted that proposal. Wording about industrialized
country commitments has been replaced by language that leaves
far too much open to abuse by those few countries that oppose
CO2 reductions.<BR>
<BR>
Some 80 ministers came to Berlin fully aware of the scientific
conclusions that significant cuts in CO2 emissions are the only
responsible course of action to tackle climate change. Ministers
from the US and the UK publicly acknowledged that the threats
are imminent. Chancellor Kohl of Germany called on the conference
to set &quot;clear objectives and target dates&quot;. It did not.
<BR>
<BR>
WWF urges forward-looking countries like Germany, Denmark, and
the Netherlands to stick to their own national targets -- Germany
aims to cut emissions by 25% by 2005 -- and lead a new &quot;Green
Group&quot; of developed and developing countries forward on the
path to averting the risk of climate change.<BR>

<B>ROME</B>--Hundreds of young WWF supporters attired in ponchos
carrying the slogan &quot;SOS Clima&quot; expressed their concern
about global warming to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro
when he came to open a landmark meeting of the UN Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change here today. He was also greeted by a giant
picture of the earth with a thermometer in its mouth: a symbol
of the global sickness caused by rising temperatures.<BR>

&quot;Global warming threatens to affect wildlife all over the
world, from the polar ice caps to tropical forests,&quot; said
Paolo Lombardi, Responsible for International Programmes at WWF-Italy.
<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The children waved flags featuring polar bears, whose arctic home
features high on WWF's list of &quot;ecosystems on the front line
of climate change&quot;. Global warming is likely to melt arctic
sea ice, threatening the survival of polar bears as well as certain
marine seals.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

The schoolchildren also carried huge cardboard cutouts of bears
and lynxes, two of the many species living in the Italian Alps
whose habitat is likely to be limited by changes in temperature

WWF delegates have come to Rome for the last session of discussions
on the IPCC's Second Assessment Report -- the world's most authoritative
document on climate science. The report has been prepared by 2,500
top international climate experts in consultation with government
delegates.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

At the IPCC's last meeting in Madrid at the end of November, governments
finally acknowledged that human activities -- notably burning
oil and coal -- are having an impact on the earth's climate.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;This recognition is an important breakthrough,&quot; said
Merylyn McKenzie Hedger, climate policy officer at WWF-UK. &quot;But
there is a lot to get through in Rome over the next few days.
Governments will have to work hard to protect the scientific integrity
of the report.&quot;<BR>

Timber Trade Destroys The World's Best Forests</H2>
</CENTER>
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GLAND, Switzerland</B> -- Logging companies from Europe, Asia,
and North and South America are currently wiping out some of the
world's best quality forests, according to a WWF-World Wide Fund
For Nature review of the global timber trade released today.<BR>
<BR>
The report <B>Bad Harvest?</B> states that, from the standpoint
of biodiversity, the damage to forests by the timber trade is
now far greater than that caused by land clearance for farming
and fuel, traditionally blamed for most forest destruction.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Although logging companies claim that they are responsible
for only a small percentage of trees felled, this ignores the
fact that they are operating in primary or old-growth forests
where wildlife is abundant and the best timber is found.  Logging
in natural forests is destroying a huge range of plants and animals
worldwide, as well as tree species&quot; says Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud,
Head of WWF International's Forest Programme.<BR>
<BR>
In eastern Europe, many natural forests have already been destroyed
by logging companies.  In the former Soviet Republic of Latvia
timber exports have increased 700% in the last 3 years, threatening
Europe's finest swamp forests, home to beavers, wolves, woodpeckers
and the rare black stork.  Latvian timber is imported into Britain
as rough sawn lumber and is currently undercutting British timber
in price.<BR>
<BR>
In Africa, overlogging by European companies has virtually destroyed
the tropical rainforests of the Ivory Coast and Nigeria.  Zaire,
Congo and Cameroon are rapidly following suit.  More than 60 foreign
companies are currently operating in Cameroon and felling has
increased by over 400% since 1993.<BR>
<BR>
In South America, domestic and foreign companies are logging in
both tropical forests and native temperate forests, which are
now rapidly disappearing.<BR>
<BR>
Illegal logging and overlogging have devastated many of Asia's
forests.  As a result, a logging ban has been imposed in Thailand
but this has simply increased cross-border trade with Myanmar,
Laos and Cambodia and all are now suffering rapid deforestation.
 In many countries instant profits are guaranteed by clearing
natural forests and establishing plantations.  The Indonesian
government is planning to replace at least 2 million hectares
of forest with plantations by the year 2000 and commercial forestry
is the main cause of forest destruction in Kalimantan, Irian Jaya
and Siberut.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Replacing old-growth, natural forests with plantations gives
the impression that forests are being restored.  But, a plantation
is about as similar to a natural forest as a football pitch is
to a flower-rich meadow&quot; says Nigel Dudley, WWF consultant
and author of the <B>Bad Harvest?</B> report.<BR>
<I>more...<BR>
<BR>
</I>...2<BR>
<BR>
Timber companies are currently exploiting many pristine forests
in temperate countries.  In Ontario, Canada, old growth forest
has been reduced to 1% of its original area.<BR>
<BR>
The actions of the national and international timber trade are
now critical to the survival of pristine forests throughout the
world and to the species which live in them.  In Latvia, for example,
industry support for certification of sustainably produced timber
could bring a range of benefits &#173;including stronger forest
policy resulting in sustainable forest management and access to
the world's growing &quot;green&quot; market for timber products.
<BR>
<BR>
WWF supports the use of sustainably produced timber.  Wood is
energy-efficient in production, biodegradable, re-usable, and
forests have major social and environmental benefits.  <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are ways to stop this wholesale destruction of forests
and wildlife: with better forestry practices and timber certification
under the auspices of the Forest Stewardship Council, industry
and environmental bodies can work together to find solutions to
forestry problems. In Britain, over 50 companies have pledged,
as part of WWF's 95 Group, to buy wood and wood products only
from well-managed sustainable forests by the end of 1995&quot;
says Francis Sullivan, Leader of the WWF Global Forest Campaign.
 A similar initiative exists in Belgium, the &quot;97 Group&quot;.
 Other groups are being started in Austria, Australia and North
America.<BR>
<BR>
WWF calls on the timber trade to take up the challenge of managing
forests for wildlife and people, as well as for profit.<BR>

<P>
Future climate change will have potentially
significant negative impacts on cetaceans and may hinder their
population recovery.  The climate change effects can be classified
into two sets of phenomena: global warming and ozone depletion.
 The former include warming-related changes to physical oceanography
and attendant impacts on the distribution and abundance of food
for baleen and toothed whales, sea level rise impacts in the location
of critical areas for cetaceans, increased coastal precipitation
affecting water quality of nearshore whale habitat, and possible
environmental changes affecting whale communication and social
structure.  The effects of ozone depletion include similar changes
in the food availability, changes in food quality, and increased
incidence of UV-related disease.  Much of this is speculative
and awaits verification by interdisciplinary research by climate
modellers, physical oceanographers, and cetacean biologists. 
What is know with certainty is that negative impacts of climate
change compound what is an already dire situation regarding whales,
and may be the gravest of all the cumulative threats affecting
endangered cetacean species.  The implications for cetacean conservation
warrant serious attention: future debate will have to focus on
if harvesting is, indeed an option, given these new threats, what
additional protection measures are necessary to counter these
threats, and how to optimally site future protected areas for
whales in a changing global marine environment.<BR>

<P>
The consequences of the earth's atmospheric
warming include changing global-scale weather patterns that in
turn affect both sea surface temperature regimes and temperature-driven
current patterns throughout the world's oceans.  We know from
studies of El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation patterns that even
small shifts in these meteorological and oceanographic patterns
can have enormous consequences for marine productivity and food
web stability (Limberger, 1990).  Well-studied El Ni&ntilde;o
events such as that which occurred in 1982-83 have been shown
to change the distribution of plankton, planktivorous and piscivorous
fishes, and the pinnipeds that rely on them (Polovina et al, 1994).
 Similar climate shifts will undoubtedly affect other food web
components, including cetacean species.</FONT>
<P>
Significant data have recently been compiled
and analyzed regarding climate impacts on fisheries (e.g. Francis,
1990; Francis and Sibley, 1991; Gucinski, 1990; Kawasaki, 1991;
Kawasaki and Omori, 1986; Kawasaki et al., 1989;  McDowell, 1992;
Shannon et al., 1988).  These studies rest on the assumption that
global warming will act to decrease surface layer phytoplankton
production in certain coastal areas and will change both the depth
and level of mixing that drives plankton production in upwelling
and other areas (Lange et al., 1990).   Oceanographic data indicate
that shifts of spectral radiances in the water alter photoinhibition,
photoreactivation, photoprotection and photosynthesis (Smith et
al., 1992).  Changes in diatom fluxes and overall phytoplankton
production will have corresponding effects on fisheries production,
influencing both the total production of phytoplankton and its
distribution in neritic and pelagic environments (Williamson and
Holligan, 1990;Roemmich and McGowan, 1995).  This has consequences
for the marine life that prey on plankton and secondary consumers
higher in the trophic web.  For organisms that have evolved to
find food in a highly patchy environment, such shifts in food
resources - particularly shifts in the patterns in which prey
are aggregated across vast ocean areas - means potential difficulties
in securing enough food to survive (MacGarvin and Simmonds, 1993;
Polovina et al., 1995).  Although decreases in the net abundance
of plankton for baleen whales and fish for toothed whales will
probably not drive such species to extinction, the changes in
distribution of food patches may mean that whales will have to
spend more of their energy budgets on finding prey.  For those
species that migrate vast distances and have intrinsically high
metabolic requirements, as is the case for most of the highly
endangered great whales, the potential cost of changes in prey
availability may be significant.
<P>
Warming-related changes also include increases
or decreases in estuarine salinity patterns (depending on the
location of watersheds), which in turn have a dramatic impact
on fisheries production in the coastal zone.   Warming will also
have enormous impacts in the biological oceanography of polar
areas, where the consequences of even small rises in temperature
will be to cause ice pack melting and corollary changes in mixing
patterns, salinity, and plankton production (Vaughan and Doake,
1996).  Such areas are particularly important as feeding areas
for many of the baleen whales.</FONT>
<P>
Food quality may also be reduced by global
climate shifts (Borobia et al., 1995).  Oceanographic patterns
influence the structure of the base of the trophic web, therefore
shifts in temperature and salinity patterns may mean increased
patchiness in phytoplankton and leaner consumers at higher trophic
levels.  Changes in currents and other physical features of the
coastal environment may lead to increased pollutant loading, again
decreasing food quality.  Ozone depletion, discussed below, also
causes lowered food quality of plankton.
<P>
Warming is expected to increase the rate
of relative sea level rise in many portions of the globe (Pernetta
and Elder, 1992).  Some nearshore habitats important to cetaceans
will be affected - and many habitat types that are particularly
important to whale ecology may be lost altogether (e.g. <U>Orcinus</U>
<U>orca</U> &quot;rubbing stones&quot; in British Columbia). 
Relative sea level changes will also cause major changes in physical
oceanography (Emery and Aubrey, 1991) and threaten to change whale
migration patterns.
<P>
Another consequence of global warming is
the change to meteorological patterns that will result in increased
coastal precipitation.  Such forecasts are most pronounced in
tropical coastal areas.  Along with other effects, increased coastal
precipitation will mean greater levels of run-off and therefore
pollutant loading, spelling a reduction in water quality in many
nearshore areas (Bismarck et al., 1996).  Pollution has already
been shown to be a major stressor inhibiting the recovery of certain
whale species, especially persistent organic pollution that disrupts
endocrine and reproductive system (Colborn et al., 1996).  The
cumulative impact of increased turbidity and decreased water quality
due to land-based sources of pollution will hit coastal cetaceans
especially hard.  Unfortunately, however, even those cetacean
species that spend only a fraction of their adult lives in nearshore
areas breed and calve in coastal areas - those most likely to
be degraded by pollutants in the future.</FONT>
<P>
Global climate change related warming of
the seas will also cause other sublethal but potentially disastrous
effects.  Warming of tropical waters has been shown to increase
the incidence and the rate of transmission of pathogens, making
whales (and especially those that breed in the tropics and therefore
have young that are particularly susceptible) vulnerable to disease
and immune system stress.  This compounded with other stress-causing
factors, such as pollutant loading and bioaccumulation of organochloride
and other toxins, will have the potential cumulative effect of
causing reproductive failure in those whale species that are already
slow to reproduce and therefore have extremely low population
recovery rates (Marine Mammal Commission, 1996).</FONT>
<P>
Analysis of historic climate shifts show
corollary changes in the distribution of species (Markham, 1996).
 For cetaceans, we can at a very minimum expect latitudinal changes
in distribution (Crame, 1993).  This has serious implications
for where we site marine areas protected as critical habitat for
endangered species.  For instance, whale sanctuaries aimed at
protecting tropical calving grounds or areas important to breeding
(Hudnall, 1978) may well be ineffective as the location of these
critical areas shifts with changes in current patterns or relative
sea level.</FONT>
<P>
<B>2. Ozone Depletion</FONT></B>
<P>
Ozone depletion will affect whales and dolphins
in at least two ways: 1) increased ultraviolet radiation will
change food abundance, distribution and quality, and 2) increased
UV-A and UV-B radiation may cause cancer in whales or make whales
more susceptible to disease; especially those spending significant
time in areas of acute ozone layer thinning.  Ozone thinning leads
to higher UV-A radiance which inhibits photosynthesis by diatoms
and dinoflagellates, and UV-B radiances which contribute to documented
near surface photosynthetic suppression 15% below normal (Cullen
et al., 1992).  Phytoplankton distribution has already been altered
by the incidence of ozone thinning in the southern hemisphere
(Baker, 1991; Smith et al., 1992) and there is some evidence that
aquatic species have increased morbidity and mortality from exposure
to higher than normal levels of ultraviolet radiation as a consequence
(Kerr and McElroy, 1993; Macknay et al., 1996).  This is a cause
for concern for those species that spend significant amounts of
time near the surface in areas where thinning is acute (polar
cetacean species) - especially since many of these species have
reduced skin pigmentation and will thus not have natural defenses
against increased radiation (e.g. belugas, narwhals, etc.). 
<P>
Some studies suggest that ozone-related
exposure to high radiation levels causes immune system suppression,
compounding other environmental stress factors affecting marine
organisms living in degraded coastal zones.  As is the case with
other marine organisms, such as hermatypic corals, these effects
may send already stressed populations
beyond the brink of recovery (Agardy, 1993).
<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Implications for Conservation</FONT></B></FONT>
<P>
Even as environmental groups and forward-thinking
governments are scoring small victories in the effort to save
cetaceans from extinction, larger forces are at work that may
hinder recovery for many whale species around the world.  The
fact that experts on both whale ecology and global climate change
are meeting under the auspices of International Whaling Commission
signals a new awareness of the importance of looking at the multiple
impacts on marine species and ecosystems.  Further discussions
of how global scale disruptions in climate may affect whale populations
slowly rebounding from former large-scale exploitation will result.
 Scientific information about the links between climate and whale
population recovery underscore the need to support a continued
moratorium on commercial whaling, at least until further multidisciplinary
long term monitoring furthers our understanding of these linkages.</FONT>
<P>
The ways that global change will potentially
impede whale populations from maintaining their current numbers
or increasing to pre-whaling population sizes are varied.  The
most easily quantifiable impact, for which there are good data
from which to construct predictions on the magnitude of threat
to whales, is how climate change will impact physical oceanography,
and how this in turn will cause changes in the abundance and distribution
of prey available to whales.  Such changes in food availability
are particularly worrisome because whales have to cope with the
extremely patchily-distributed patterns of prey that are characteristic
of marine systems.  Even small changes in those food sources will
mean whales will have to exert more energy and time in finding
food, and could spell morbidity and mortality for those species
that cannot adapt to the rapid pace of change the climate scenarios
are forecasting.</FONT>
<P>
There are many other potential effects besides
food availability, however.  Global scale changes in the distribution
of ozone in the troposphere will mean loss of phytoplankton in
areas under ozone &quot;holes&quot;, causing disruptions in food
webs across wide distances.  Recent evidence also suggests that
increased ultraviolet radiation may affect the quality of phytoplankton
as a food source, and may also act on cetaceans directly by causing
radiation-related diseases.  Cancers of the skin and eye problems
will be especially acute in those species of whales like the beluga
and narwhal that have reduced pigmentation, spend much of their
time in surface waters, and occur in areas where ozone has been
shown to be particularly thin.</FONT>
<P>
Some climate change scenarios predict increases
in storm frequency and severity, especially in coastal regions.
 Such storms, while not impacting whales directly, would act to
increase precipitation in the coastal plains and watersheds, which
in turn would result in increased loading of pollutants into nearshore
areas.  Since many of these nearshore areas are critical areas
for whale breeding, calving and growth of young, it is likely
that pollutant-related stress will be significantly higher in
the future.  Offspring may well in fact be rendered unable to
reproduce in later life if toxics loading is particularly acute.</FONT>
<P>
Global warming may do even more subtle things
like influence the transmission of sound in areas used by whales
for communication. For instance, sperm whales are largely solitary
organisms that are only able to have offspring if they can successfully
locate mates across enormous areas of the oceans.  In order to
find one another, sperm whales dive to precisely those depths
where sound can travel the longest distance without loss of signal.
 Warming and the corollary changes in ocean current patterns may
well disrupt these communication systems, again potentially causing
reproductive failure.  These much less obvious possible impacts
on cetaceans warrant further investigation and discussion.</FONT>
<P>
One major implication of these documented
and hypothesized impacts is that acceptable levels of exploitation
will have to be revised downwards if climate change is factored
in to the list of stresses affecting whale population recovery.
 Additionally, as global climate changes affect large scale oceanographic
features and cause ramifications in the ecological communities
they support, areas currently deemed critical for whales may well
be superfluous in the future.  Thus conservation strategies aimed
at protecting important habitat such as feeding areas, breeding
grounds, or migration corridors, may well be for nought as the
areas critical to cetaceans change location.  Today's whale sanctuaries
could be devoid of whales if climate change causes shifts in food
availability and breeding habitat.</FONT>
<P>
Though much of this is speculative, it is
clear that climate change poses yet another threat to the recovery
of whale populations, a recovery that has been for the large part
excruciating slow and uncertain.<BR>

<tt><b>Introduction</b>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>

<br>

Cr&eacute;&eacute; en 1961, le WWF - Fonds Mondial pour la Nature est aujourd'hui l'organisation environnementale &agrave; but non lucratif la plus importante du monde, en termes de mobilisation et d'utilisation de fonds pour la protection des esp&egrave;ces sauvages. Ces fonds sont r&eacute;partis sur quatre grands domaines d'activit&eacute;.

<p>

En premier lieu, il faut sensibiliser les gens &agrave; la gravit&eacute; de la situation dans laquelle se trouve le monde naturel. Cette situation a &eacute;t&eacute; engendr&eacute;e par l'explosion d&eacute;mographique mondiale et l'extension de plus en plus rapide des activit&eacute;s humaines, ainsi que par la demande toujours croissante de l'industrie, de l'agriculture, des transports, de l'exploitation foresti&egrave;re et de la p&ecirc;che. Toutes ces activit&eacute;s exercent une pression dramatique sur les ressources du monde naturel.

<p>

Ensuite - et avant m&ecirc;me de pouvoir mettre en place des projets de conservation de la nature efficaces - il est &eacute;videmment indispensable de disposer de donn&eacute;es fiables et pr&eacute;cises. Cela implique la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de financer des &eacute;tudes d'&eacute;valuation et des analyses des facteurs ayant un impact sur la sant&eacute; et la vitalit&eacute; de l'environnement naturel.

<p>

Le troisi&egrave;me domaine d'activit&eacute;s, auquel nous consacrons une proportion importante de nos ressources, consiste &agrave; favoriser et &agrave; soutenir les actions de protection des zones et des &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes qui jouent un r&ocirc;le critique dans la survie des animaux et des plantes sauvages. Il s'agit en particulier des zones humides, des for&ecirc;ts, des oc&eacute;ans et des zones c&ocirc;ti&egrave;res.

<p>

Enfin, nous apportons notre concours &agrave; la conception et &agrave; la mise en place de mesures pour ma&icirc;triser la surexploitation des esp&egrave;ces sauvages. Ces mesures comprennent notamment les conventions internationales concues pour prot&eacute;ger les &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes sensibles, supprimer le braconnage et le commerce ill&eacute;gal d'esp&egrave;ces sauvages, et - lorsque l'exploitation des ressources est l&eacute;gale - faire en sorte qu'elle respecte le principe de la viabilit&eacute; &agrave; long terme.

<p>

Les progr&egrave;s sont sensibles, mais la conservation active est un travail sans cesse &agrave; renouveler. Pour continuer &agrave; lutter efficacement dans un contexte toujours aussi pr&eacute;occupant, le WWF a besoin de votre soutien - de toute urgence.

<tt>L'ann&eacute;e 1995 a &eacute;t&eacute; marqu&eacute;e par l'&eacute;mergence du WWF en tant qu'autorit&eacute; dans le domaine de &#171; l'&eacute;conomie verte &#187;. En juin, en association avec la Commission europ&eacute;enne et le Club de Rome, le WWF a organis&eacute; une conf&eacute;rence au Parlement europ&eacute;en &agrave; Bruxelles sur le th&egrave;me &#171; Prendre en compte la nature &#187;, qui a pr&eacute;conis&eacute; l'incorporation de la valeur des ressources naturelles dans les syst&egrave;mes de comptabilit&eacute; nationale (voir ci-contre). Comment&eacute;e par la presse dans le monde entier, la conf&eacute;rence a attir&eacute; l'attention du Pr&eacute;sident de la Banque mondiale, James D Wolfenson et du Vice-pr&eacute;sident des Etats-Unis, Al Gore.

<p>

Le r&eacute;sultat : quatre mois plus tard, en association cette fois avec la Banque mondiale, l'UICN1, la National Wildlife Federation et le Bank Information Center des Etats-Unis, le WWF organise la campagne &#171; Prendre l'avenir en compte &#187;, fond&eacute;e sur le message de la conf&eacute;rence de Bruxelles. Une initiative internationale en vue d'&eacute;tablir un nouveau syst&egrave;me d'indicateurs du progr&egrave;s &eacute;conomique est lanc&eacute;e.

<p>

Cette campagne apporte une r&eacute;ponse &agrave; un probl&egrave;me fondamental : la communaut&eacute; internationale utilise toujours un syst&egrave;me de comptabilit&eacute; p&eacute;rim&eacute;, qui omet de chiffrer l'&eacute;puisement progressif des ressources naturelles. 

<p>

Ce processus est &agrave; l'image m&ecirc;me du fonctionnement du WWF aujourd'hui. L'organisation recherche des solutions et pr&eacute;pare ensuite leur mise en application. Depuis deux ans, le WWF a restructur&eacute; ses activit&eacute;s et consacre actuellement 80 pour cent de ses efforts &agrave; la pr&eacute;servation des trois biomes o&ugrave; se concentre la majorit&eacute; de la diversit&eacute; biologique de la plan&egrave;te - les for&ecirc;ts, les oc&eacute;ans et zones c&ocirc;ti&egrave;res, les &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes d'eau douce - ainsi qu'&agrave; la lutte contre les causes du changement climatique.
<p>

Il ne fait plus aucun doute aujourd'hui que le changement climatique est une r&eacute;alit&eacute;, caus&eacute;e par le rejet dans l'atmosph&egrave;re de gaz &agrave; effet de serre. Le WWF a alert&eacute; la communaut&eacute; internationale contre la menace que repr&eacute;sentent ces changements pour les esp&egrave;ces et les habitats. Il est toujours &agrave; la pointe des recherches men&eacute;es pour en minimiser les effets. 

<p>

Cependant, il faut &ecirc;tre pleinement conscient du fait que tous les progr&egrave;s accomplis dans le monde occidental industrialis&eacute; pourraient &ecirc;tre r&eacute;duits &agrave; n&eacute;ant par la demande d'&eacute;nergie croissante en Chine et en Europe de l'Est. Dans certains de ces pays, le WWF examine la production &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique actuelle et soutient des centres de recherche pour la ma&icirc;trise de l'&eacute;nergie, qui sont charg&eacute;s d'encourager l'adoption des pratiques environnementales les plus efficaces par les gouvernements, par les industriels et par les entreprises &eacute;trang&egrave;res cherchant &agrave; investir dans ces pays - ainsi que par la population.

<p>

Mais il ne suffit pas d'une seule organisation, aussi dynamique soit elle, pour pr&eacute;server le monde naturel. A long terme, les probl&egrave;mes de l'environnement ne peuvent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;solus que par les personnes qui en subissent les consquences. Le r&ocirc;le du WWF est de leur montrer ce qui est possible, de les aider &agrave; dresser des plans d'action et de s'assurer qu'elles disposent localement d'une capacit&eacute; suffisante. C'est pour cela que pratiquement tous les projets du WWF s'efforcent d'accro&icirc;tre les capacit&eacute;s des populations locales &agrave; g&eacute;rer leurs ressources naturelles de facon durable. Et surtout, par le biais de programmes d'&eacute;ducation formels et informels, le WWF aide les hommes &agrave; mieux comprendre le besoin de vivre en harmonie avec la nature. Je crois de toutes mes forces que si nous arrivons &agrave; graver cette imp&eacute;rieuse n&eacute;cessit&eacute; dans l'esprit de la nouvelle g&eacute;n&eacute;ration, nos efforts n'auront pas &eacute;t&eacute; vains.

<h2> QU'EST CE QUE LE 
   WWF - FONDS MONDIAL
       POUR LA NATURE ?</h2>

</center>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>

<tt>La mission du WWF est de conserver la nature et les processus &eacute;cologiques :
<p>
<br>

<ul>
<li> en pr&eacute;servant la diversit&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;tique, celle des esp&egravee;ces et celle des &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes
<p>

<li> en veillant &agrave; ce que l'utilisation des ressources naturelles renouvelables soit durable, dans l'imm&eacute;diat comme &agrave; long terme, pour assurer la protection de la vie dans son ensemble 
<p>

<li> en encourageant des mesures visant &agrave; r&eacute;duire le plus possible la pollution, ainsi que le gaspillage dans l'exploitation et la consommation des ressources et de l'&eacute;nergie.
</ul>
<p>
<br>

L'objectif final du WWF est de faire cesser - puis dinverser - la d&eacute;gradation toujours plus rapide de l'environnement naturel de notre plan&egrave;te et d'aider &agrave; construire un avenir o&ugrave; l'humanit&eacute; vivra en harmonie avec la nature.</tt>

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=10 width=510>
<td align=left>
<tt><b><font size=6>L</font></b>e WWF est l'organisation ind&eacute;pendante pour la conservation de la nature la plus importante et la plus exp&eacute;riment&eacute;e 
       du globe, avec plus de 4,7 millions d'adh&eacute;rents et un r&eacute;seau mondial qui compte aujourd'hui 24 organisations nationales, 5 organisations associ&eacute;es et 26 bureaux r&eacute;gionaux.

<p>

Le WWF combine travail de terrain et strat&eacute;gie r&eacute;fl&eacute;chie, pour obtenir des r&eacute;sultats cr&eacute;dibles qui se fondent sur un large &eacute;ventail de comp&eacute;tence et d'exp&eacute;rience dans tous les domaines de la protection de la nature. Le WWF fournit des services de conservation de grande qualit&eacute; en faisant appel aux meilleures informations scientifiques du moment, en recherchant le dialogue pour rapprocher les diff&eacute;rents int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts et en menant une r&eacute;flexion approfondie sur le long terme.

<p>

Le WWF vise en permanence &agrave; m&eacute;riter la confiance, &agrave; maintenir la transparence et &agrave; orienter ses activit&eacute;s sur la recherche de solutions.

<p>

En 1995, le <b>r&eacute;seau WWF</b>, compos&eacute; de 3 500 professionnels d&eacute;vou&eacute;s &agrave; la cause de la nature, a consacr&eacute; 252 millions de dollars US &agrave; des programmes de conservation orient&eacute;s sur les solutions pratiques et &agrave; des services d'extension dans 96 pays. La force du WWF r&eacute;side dans une politique globale par sa port&eacute;e, mais locale dans ses applications.

<p>
<br>
<br>

<ul>

<li><tt>Les <b>organisations nationales</tt> du WWF m&eacute;nent des actions de conservation dans leurs propres pays et contribuent au programme de conservation international du WWF par l'apport de leur expertise technique et de fonds.

<p>
<br>

<li><tt>Les <b>bureaux r&eacute;gionaux</b> du WWF g&eacute;rent les travaux de terrain du WWF, apportent leurs conseils aux gouvernements et aux administrations locales et favorisent une meilleure compr&eacute;hension publique des enjeux de la conservation. Deux bureaux sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s s'efforcent d'influencer les politiques de l'Union europ&eacute;enne et des institutions internationales ayant leur si&egrave;ge aux Etats-Unis, comme la Banque mondiale. En 1995, le r&eacute;seau WWF s'est renforc&eacute; gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation de nouveaux bureaux en R&eacute;publique centrafricaine et au P&eacute;rou, dotant ainsi l'organisation d'une pr&eacute;sence institutionnelle dans 53 pays.

<p>
<br>

<li><tt>Le <b>WWF International</b>, secr&eacute;tariat de l'organisation, est bas&eacute; &agrave; Gland, en Suisse. Il se charge de l'animation du r&eacute;seau, &eacute;labore des politiques et des normes communes, assure la coordination des activit&eacute;s de l'organisation, travaille &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation de partenariats &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle mondiale et fournit des services aux organisations nationales du WWF. 

</ul>

<p>
<br>
<br>

Par ailleurs, les <b>organisations associ&eacute;es</b> sont des organisations non-gouvernementales (ONG) ind&eacute;pendantes qui collaborent &eacute;troitement avec le WWF et travaillent &agrave; l'avancement d'objectifs de conservation communs, mais qui ne participent pas au programme international du WWF.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>

<font size=5><b> LA RECHERCHE DU PARTENARIAT </b></font>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
<br>

Pour obtenir des r&eacute;sultats durables, il est indispensable de cr&eacute;er des partenariats avec le public, avec les associations locales, avec d'autres organisations de conservation, avec les entreprises, les gouvernements et les institutions internationales.

<p>
<br>

<img align=left src="income.gif">

<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>

<tt><b>Au niveau local</b></tt>

<p>

Chaque fois que cela est possible, le WWF travaille avec et par le biais d'organisations de conservation locales. Si de telles structures n'existent pas encore, le WWF aide les communaut&eacute;s locales &agrave; les cr&eacute;er.

<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>

<tt><b>Au niveau national</b></tt>
<p>
<br>

Quel que soit le lieu de son intervention, le WWF recherche toujours l'accord du gouvernement, tout en coop&eacute;rant avec les ONG nationales qui partagent les m&ecirc;mes objectifs.

<p>
<br>
<br>

<tt><b>Au niveau international</b></tt>
<p>
Dans la poursuite de ses objectifs d'&eacute;tablir, de renforcer ou de modifier les trait&eacute;s et les accords internationaux, le WWF travaille avec des institutions comme l'Union europ&eacute;enne, l'UICN, le Programme des Nations Unies pour l'environnement, l'UNICEF et la Banque mondiale, ainsi qu'avec d'autres ONG internationales.

<p>
<br>
<br>

<tt><b>Les organismes d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement</b></tt>
<p>
Des projets WWF exemplaires attirent r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement 
des fonds allou&eacute;s par la communaut&eacute; internationale des bailleurs de fonds. Le WWF travaille actuellement avec 37 organismes d'aide, dont l'Administration du d&eacute;veloppement outre-mer au Royaume-Uni, l'Agence japonaise pour la coop&eacute;ration internationale, USAID et l'Agence danoise pour le d&eacute;veloppement international.</tt>

<p>
<br>

<tt> Au cours de l'exercice 1995, les revenus du r&eacute;seau WWF ont atteint 270 millions de dollars US. La part recueillie              
         par les organisations nationales dans leurs propres pays s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve &agrave; 259 millions de dollars US, tandis que le WWF International a r&eacute;colt&eacute; 11 millions de dollars US aupr&egrave;s de sources diff&eacute;rentes.

<p>

Sur la totalit&eacute; des sommes recueillies, 100 millions de dollars US ont &eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s &agrave; des projets dans les pays des organisations nationales et 93 millions au programme de conservation international. Le r&eacute;seau a consacr&eacute; respectivement 59 millions de dollars US &agrave; la r&eacute;colte de fonds et &agrave; l'administration et 18 millions au soutien de ses activit&eacute;s futures.

<p>
<br>
<br>

<dl>


<dt><tt><font size=3><b>LES DONS DES PARTICULIERS</b></font></tt>

<p>

<dd>Le WWF compte sur la g&eacute;n&eacute;rosit&eacute; des particuliers pour la plupart de ses fonds. Au cours de l'exercice 1995, 65 pour cent des revenus de l'organisation provenaient de dons personnels (53 pour cent), de trusts et de fondations (4 pour cent) et de legs (8 pour cent), qui profiteront durablement &agrave; la nature. 

<p>
<br>

<dt><tt><font size=3><b>LES GOUVERNEMENTS ET LES ORGANISMES D'AIDE AU DEVELOPPEMENT</b></font></tt>

<p>

<dd>Une large part des revenus du WWF provient des subventions accord&eacute;es par les gouvernements et des organismes d'aide. Ces financements, qui, en 1995, repr&eacute;sentaient 17 pour cent des revenus du r&eacute;seau, sont tr&egrave;s souvent du type 
&#171; proportionnel &#187; - c'est-&agrave;-dire qu'ils ne deviennent disponibles que lorsque le WWF a d&eacute;j&agrave; recueilli une partie des fonds - ou bien du type &#171; &agrave; affectation sp&eacute;ciale &#187;, &agrave; n'utiliser que pour un projet particulier ou un pays sp&eacute;cifique.

<p>
<br>

<dt><tt><font size=3><b>LES ENTREPRISES ET L'INDUSTRIE</b></font></tt>

<p>

<dd>Le WWF travaille de mani&egrave;re innovatrice et cr&eacute;ative avec les entreprises et l'industrie pour recueillir des fonds et pour mieux diffuser le message de la conservation. Ces op&eacute;rations de &#171; marketing r&eacute;ciproque &#187; contiennent des accords pour l'utilisation du logo WWF - le panda - par les entreprises, moyennant une redevance. Les entreprises y gagnent - parce qu'elles mettent en avant ainsi leur lien avec l'organisation de conservation la mieux reconnue au monde - et les fonds recueillis profitent &agrave; la nature. En Italie, par exemple, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; Electrolux s'est associ&eacute;e au WWF pour encourager l'adoption de styles de vie respectueux de l'environnement. La soci&eacute;t&eacute; fabrique des r&eacute;frig&eacute;rateurs &eacute;conomes en &eacute;nergie et sans gaz CFC, ainsi que des machines &agrave; laver &agrave; faible consommation d'eau et d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;. Elle a r&eacute;cemment financ&eacute; la publication d'un &#171; &eacute;co-guide &#187; par le WWF pour le bon usage des appareils m&eacute;nagers &eacute;lectriques, ainsi qu'une s&eacute;rie de brochures WWF destin&eacute;es aux &eacute;coles italiennes et une conf&eacute;rence intitul&eacute;e &#171; La cit&eacute; &agrave; pied &#187;, pour les responsables de l'urbanisme, les psychologues, les politiciens et autres experts.
<p>
<br>

<dt><tt><font size=3><b>LES 1001 : UN FONDS POUR LA NATURE</b></font></tt>

<p>

<dd>Le WWF International est en mesure d'assurer &agrave; ses donateurs que leurs contributions sont utilis&eacute;es de facon efficace pour la conservation de la nature. Cela est notamment possible gr&agrave;ce au &#187; 1001 : un Fonds pour la nature &#171;, &eacute;tabli en 1971 par SAR le Prince Bernhard des Pays-Bas, lorsqu'il invita 1 000 hommes et femmes &agrave; se joindre &agrave; lui pour verser une contribution financi&egrave;re importante pour la protection de la nature. Les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de ce fonds, au capital initial de 11,7 millions de dollars US, contribuent au r&eacute;glement des co&ucirc;ts administratifs de base du WWF International. Lorsque il y a une vacance &agrave; pourvoir, les nouveaux membres, qui sont souvent propos&eacute;s par les membres existants des 1001, sont invit&eacute;s &agrave; adh&eacute;rer au fonds moyennant une contribution de 25 000 dollars US.

Ceux-ci abritent la majorit&eacute; de la diversit&eacute; biologique et sont essentiels &agrave; la p&eacute;rennit&eacute; des syst&egrave;mes naturels dont d&eacute;pend toute vie sur terre.

<p>
<br>

Le WWF a pour objectif de consacrer 80 pour cent de ses moyens &agrave; ces domaines prioritaires et de faire tout son possible pour r&eacute;duire la menace que le changement climatique fait peser sur toutes les formes de vie.</tt>

<font size=2>&#171; L'objectif global du WWF est de mettre fin &agrave; la destruction et &agrave; la d&eacute;gradation des for&ecirc;ts - notamment 
les for&ecirc;ts primaires - et des 
surfaces bois&eacute;es de toute nature d'ici l'an 2000. &#187;</font>

<p>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>
<p>
<br>

<tt>&#171; Pour r&eacute;aliser cet objectif, nous devons assurer un r&eacute;seau mondial de r&eacute;serves foresti&egrave;res repr&eacute;sentatives de tous les &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes et faire en sorte que toutes les for&ecirc;ts, en dehors de ces zones prot&eacute;g&eacute;es, soient exploit&eacute;es de facon durable &#187;, explique Jean-Paul Jeanrenaud, responsable du Programme For&ecirc;ts au WWF International.

<p><br>

&#171; Deux exemples suffisent &agrave; d&eacute;montrer la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de changement &#187;, ajoute Jeanrenaud. &#171; En Su&egrave;de, o&ugrave; les for&ecirc;ts anciennes ont &eacute;t&eacute; en grande partie d&eacute;truites pour faire place &agrave; des plantations intensives, les activit&eacute;s foresti&egrave;res menacent plus de 300 esp&egrave;ces d'animaux et de plantes. La Thailande, traditionnellement exportatrice de bois, est aujourd'hui le plus gros importateur de bois sci&eacute; exotique en raison de l'&eacute;puisement de ses propres for&ecirc;ts. Les 350 projets forestiers du WWF, dans plus de 50 pays, commencent &agrave; apporter la preuve qu'il est possible d'exploiter les for&ecirc;ts de facon durable. &#187;

<p>
<br>
<br>

<dl>

<dt><tt><h3><b>LA RECHERCHE DE SOLUTIONS</b></h3></tt>

<p>
<br>

L'importance des for&ecirc;ts peut &ecirc;tre illustr&eacute;e par l'exemple du Pakistan. Les bois et les for&ecirc;ts ne recouvrent plus que 3 pour cent du pays. Le peu qui subsiste est menac&eacute; par la demande de terres cultivables d'une population en croissance rapide et par l'exploitation industrielle du bois. Les r&eacute;sultats de la d&eacute;forestation sont catastrophiques : &eacute;rosion massive des sols, syst&egrave;mes d'irrigation envas&eacute;s, diversit&eacute; biologique r&eacute;duite, crues subites causant la perte de vies et de biens, d&eacute;gradation des bassins versants entra&icirc;nant des probl&egrave;mes d'approvisionnement en eau pour l'agriculture et la production d'&eacute;nergie.

<p><br>

Le WWF s'efforce de mettre fin &agrave; ces processus de d&eacute;gradation, voire de les inverser. Des tudes sont en cours dans tout le pays pour identifier les zones &agrave; prserver en priorit. Les premiers rsultats ont dj&agrave; abouti &agrave; la mise en place, par le WWF, de mesures de protection et de reconstitution des derniers lambeaux de fort dans la chane montagneuse de Suleiman au nord-ouest du pays. Cette zone de 8 000 hectares forme une sorte d'oasis au milieu d'un paysage presque entirement dnud et subit la pression d'une centaine de villages auxquels elle fournit la majeure partie des revenus et la totalit du combustible et du bois d'uvre.

<p><br>
<img align=left src="mushrooms.jpeg">

Pour r&eacute;pondre aux besoins imm&eacute;diats, le WWF aide les villageois &agrave; obtenir de nouvelles sources de bois de feu et de revenus, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une utilisation plus appropri&eacute;e et plus rentable de leurs terres agricoles. Le programme leur a fourni 150 000 jeunes plants d'essences locales &agrave; croissance rapide, deux p&eacute;pini&egrave;res de d&eacute;monstration ont &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute;es et un volet d'&eacute;ducation &agrave; l'environnement a &eacute;t&eacute; introduit dans les &eacute;coles. L'objectif initial est de prot&eacute;ger au moins un quart de la for&ecirc;t existante, de montrer aux agents gouvernementaux - gr&acirc;ce &agrave; cet exemple - ce qui pourrait &ecirc;tre r&eacute;alis&eacute; ailleurs et, bien s&ucirc;r, de convaincre les communaut&eacute;s locales que la conservation de la nature est une n&eacute;cessit&eacute;.

<dt><tt><h3><b>FAVORISER L'EXPLOITATION DURABLE </b></h3></tt>

<p>
<br>

&#171; Le WWF demande un changement en mati&egrave;re d'exploitation foresti&egrave;re &#187;, dit Jeanrenaud. &#171; Au lieu de penser en premier lieu &agrave; la production de bois, pour la concilier ensuite avec la conservation, les forestiers doivent donner la priorit&eacute; &agrave; la pr&eacute;servation de la diversit&eacute; biologique et ne permettre la production de bois que lorsque les deux sont compatibles. &#187;

<p><br>

Pour favoriser ce changement, le WWF soutient le Conseil pour la bonne gestion des for&ecirc;ts (Forest Stewardship Council - FSC), un organisme cr&eacute;&eacute; par des forestiers, des commercants de bois, des agences de certification des produits forestiers, des groupements de peuples autochtones et des institutions environnementales dans le but de promouvoir des pratiques foresti&egrave;res saines. Selon la d&eacute;finition &eacute;labor&eacute;e par le FSC, pour &ecirc;tre durable l'exploitation des for&ecirc;ts doit &ecirc;tre &agrave; la fois respectueuse de la nature, profitable sur le plan social et viable &eacute;conomiquement.

<p><br>

&#171; Nous sommes convaincus que le FSC va &eacute;tablir la norme internationale r&eacute;clam&eacute;e par le public pour le bois provenant de for&ecirc;ts exploit&eacute;es de facon durable &#187;, dit Jeanrenaud. &#171; Actuellement, les &eacute;colabels se multiplient, mais l'absence de norme commune conduit &agrave; une certaine incoh&eacute;rence. &#187;

<img align=right src="FSClogo.jpeg">
<p>
<br>

Le FSC intervient en tant que bureau d'accr&eacute;ditation principal assurant le suivi, l'&eacute;valuation et l'homologation des agences de certification du bois dans le monde entier. En moins de deux ans, le FSC a homologu&eacute; quatre agences qui ont, &agrave; leur tour, accord&eacute; un certificat &agrave; 19 for&ecirc;ts totalisant 4 millions d'hectares. &#171; Nous avons devanc&eacute; nos objectifs &#187;, dit Jeanrenaud. &#171; Maintenant, le r&eacute;seau WWF s'occupe de la promotion du logo FSC, pour encourager les commercants et les consommateurs &agrave; exiger sa pr&eacute;sence sur tous les produits du bois et sur le papier. &#187;

<tt>L'histoire des baleines est symptomatique des menaces qui p&egrave;sent sur la diversit&eacute; biologique des oc&eacute;ans et apporte, en m&ecirc;me temps, la preuve qu'il est possible de les contrer. Les campagnes du WWF et la puissante influence de l'organisation au sein de la Commission baleini&egrave;re internationale ont &eacute;t&eacute; cruciales : d'abord pour donner force de loi au moratoire mondial sur la chasse commerciale des baleines, ensuite pour obtenir la cr&eacute;ation, en 1994, d'un sanctuaire pour les baleines dans les eaux de l'Antarctique.

<p>
<br>

Le r&eacute;seau WWF concentre aujourd'hui toute la puissance de ses moyens sur un autre enjeu marin. La situation catastrophique des lieux de p&ecirc;che dans le monde est actuellement reconnue. Les prises diminuent depuis 1989 et les rapports de l'Organisation des Nations Unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture (FAO) montrent que 70 pour cent des populations de poissons marins sont surexploit&eacute;es ou ne se reconstituent que tr&egrave;s lentement suite &agrave; cette surexploitation.

Le WWF a lanc&eacute; une nouvelle campagne internationale pour favoriser la conservation et l'exploitation durable des poissons marins. &#171; Ce qui est en jeu, c'est la sant&eacute; des lieux de p&ecirc;che, la survie des millions de gens qui en d&eacute;pendent pour leur alimentation et leur emploi, ainsi que l'avenir des mers elles-m&ecirc;mes &#187;, explique Sutton.

Depuis un an le WWF travaille aux objectifs suivants :

<p>
<br>
<br>

<tt><dd>Le WWF favorise le r&eacute;tablissement d'esp&egrave;ces-cl&eacute;s, notamment du requin, de l'espadon, du thon rouge et d'autres poissons de haute mer. Les actions du WWF visent &agrave; renforcer l'efficacit&eacute; des accords de p&ecirc;che r&eacute;gionaux, essentiels &agrave; l'exploitation rationnelle d'un grand nombre d'esp&egrave;ces. L'organisation concentre &eacute;galement ses efforts sur le besoin urgent d'am&eacute;liorer la gestion des lieux de p&ecirc;che et d'imposer des contr&ocirc;les sur le commerce des produits marins.</tt>

<tt><dd>Le WWF fera du lobbying aupr&egrave;s des gouvernements et des organisations internationales pour supprimer les puissantes incitations &eacute;conomiques aux pratiques de p&ecirc;che non durables. Actuellement, les gouvernements du monde versent des subventions totalisant plus de 54 milliards de dollars US pour soutenir une industrie qui envoie des bateaux trop nombreux &agrave; la poursuite de poissons de plus en plus rares. Ainsi subventionn&eacute;es, les flottes de p&ecirc;che &eacute;puisent d'abord les ressources de leurs eaux territoriales avant de partir de plus en plus loin, m&ecirc;me au risque de d&eacute;clencher une &#171; guerre du poisson &#187;. Le WWF compte &eacute;galement &eacute;tudier les possibilit&eacute;s de collaboration avec l'industrie en vue de la cr&eacute;ation d'une Commission pour la bonne gestion de la p&ecirc;che en mer, qui serait charg&eacute;e d'assurer l'exploitation des lieux de p&ecirc;che dans le monde.</tt>

</font>

<hr size=1 noshade>

<p>
<br>
<br>

<tt><dd>Explosifs, poisons, filets &agrave; mailles trop petites, palangres et chaluts de fond sont quelques unes des m&eacute;thodes de p&ecirc;che les plus destructrices. Les prises indiscrimin&eacute;es tuent et d&eacute;truisent chaque ann&eacute;e plus de 27 millions de tonnes de poissons, d'oiseaux et de mammif&egrave;res marins, de tortues de mer, de coraux et de bien d'autres formes de vie marine. Le WWF est en passe d'identifier et de prendre pour cible les m&eacute;thodes et les &eacute;quipements de p&ecirc;che les plus nuisibles - comme les v&eacute;ritables &#171; murs de la mort &#187; que sont les filets d&eacute;rivants de tr&egrave;s grande longueur. Il pr&eacute;voit &eacute;galement d'encourager le recours &agrave; des alternatives &eacute;cologiques, comme les zones prot&eacute;g&eacute;es avec interdiction de p&ecirc;che, tout en menant des op&eacute;rations de lobbying pour faire modifier les lois nationales et internationales dans le domaine de la p&ecirc;che.</tt>

<img align=right src="seagull.jpeg">

<p>
<br>

<tt>&#171; Pour sauver les lieux de p&ecirc;che, la pression de l'opinion publique mondiale devra &ecirc;tre aussi efficace que celle qui a fait proscrire la chasse commerciale des baleines et nous devons mobiliser ce soutien pour promouvoir des techniques de p&ecirc;che &agrave; la fois propres et viables &agrave; long terme &#187;, d&eacute;clare Sutton.</tt>

<font size=2>&#171; Seulement 0,01 pour cent de l'eau de la plan&egrave;te est facilement accessible aux formes de vie terrestres qui en d&eacute;pendent.

 d&eacute;grad&eacute;s, tant pour le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice du monde naturel que pour celui de l'humanit&eacute;. Le WWF en a donn&eacute; la preuve par sa campagne novatrice &#171; Rivi&egrave;res Vivantes &#187;, qui t&eacute;moigne par ailleurs de la vigueur du r&eacute;seau WWF.

<p>
<br>

Tout a commenc&eacute; par une petite &eacute;tendue de p&acirc;turage sur la rivi&egrave;re Waal et par l'id&eacute;e du WWF-Pays-Bas de se donner dix ans pour augmenter les espaces naturels du pays. Aujourd'hui, Millingerwaard est une zone humide qui a &eacute;t&eacute; rendue &agrave; la nature et repeupl&eacute;e par des centaines d'esp&egrave;ces de plantes, par des chevaux sauvages, des castors et des bovins de l'ancienne race Galloway.</tt>

<tt>En 1992, le WWF a demand&eacute; &agrave; Stroming, un groupe de consultants sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; dans la r&eacute;habilitation des cours d'eau, d'&eacute;laborer le concept qui allait jeter les bases de la campagne &#171; Rivi&egrave;res Vivantes &#187;. Ensuite, en collaboration avec le Laboratoire d'hydraulique de Delft, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'hydrobiologie Klink et MEET, une soci&eacute;t&eacute; d'expertise des sols, le WWF a concu un plan de conservation des cours d'eau, qui pourrait servir de mod&egrave;le dans le monde entier. Le WWF m&egrave;ne trois projets de ce type aux 
Pays-Bas et, gr&agrave;ce &agrave; l'adoption du concept par le gouvernement, 30 autres projets ont &eacute;t&eacute; initi&eacute;s par des organisations diff&eacute;rentes, dont des industries du secteur priv&eacute;.

<p>
<br>

Ces projets sont b&acirc;tis autour du concept de base consistant &agrave; r&eacute;tablir la capacit&eacute; d'&eacute;coulement des cours d'eau qui se sont progressivement envas&eacute;s, entra&icirc;nant le r&eacute;tr&eacute;cissement des lits, des modifications de l'environnement et l'aggravation &agrave; la fois des risques et des effets des inondations. Aux Pays-Bas, o&ugrave; ces probl&egrave;mes sont exacerb&eacute;s par les r&eacute;seaux de digues qui prot&egrave;gent les terres, les d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts qui envasent les cours d'eau sont naturellement argileux.

<p>
<br>

En collaboration avec l'Union royale des briqueteries n&eacute;erlandaises, le WWF encourage les fabricants &agrave; r&eacute;cup&eacute;rer l'argile pour recr&eacute;er des chenaux d'&eacute;coulement. Le projet n'a pas toujours &eacute;t&eacute; accueilli favorablement ; certains agriculteurs craignent de perdre des terres cultivables. Mais gr&acirc;ce &agrave; la r&eacute;duction des subventions qui favorisaient une surproduction agricole en Europe, les autorit&eacute;s ont elles-m&ecirc;mes achet&eacute; des terrains en bordure de rivi&egrave;res et ont encourag&eacute; les briqueteries et les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s des eaux &agrave; faire de m&ecirc;me.</tt>

<tt>En Espagne, o&ugrave; les &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes fluviaux sont parmi les plus menac&eacute;s, une variante du plan &#171; Rivi&egrave;res Vivantes &#187; a permis de r&eacute;soudre certains probl&egrave;mes. &#171; Aujourd'hui, les berges de la rivi&egrave;re Henares pr&egrave;s de Madrid, le delta de l'Ebre dans le nord-est du pays et les cours d'eau du parc naturel de Collserola ont retrouv&eacute; leur couvert bois&eacute;, les animaux reviennent et les lits des rivi&egrave;res sont &agrave; nouveau pleins de vie &#187;, raconte Pablo Xandri du WWF-Espagne.

<p>
<br>

Aux Etats-Unis, le WWF a fait appel &agrave; l'exp&eacute;rience acquise lors de la campagne &#171; Rivi&egrave;res Vivantes &#187;, ainsi qu'&agrave; l'exp&eacute;rience consid&eacute;rable de l'Institut des plaines alluviales du WWF-Allemagne, pour &eacute;laborer un plan de limitation des effets des crues pour le bassin du Mississippi. L'organisation a d&eacute;j&agrave; lanc&eacute; trois projets de r&eacute;habilitation dans l'Iowa, l'Illinois et le Minnesota. Ceux-ci sont concus pour montrer que la r&eacute;habilitation des syst&egrave;mes d'&eacute;coulement naturels permet de ma&icirc;triser les crues et d'&eacute;conomiser de l'argent en limitant les d&eacute;g&agrave;ts.

<p>
<br>

Trois autres organisations nationales du WWF se sont associ&eacute;es pour r&eacute;habiliter la Meuse, avec l'objectif &agrave; long terme de reconstituer l'&eacute;cologie du fleuve dans son ensemble et de cr&eacute;er un r&eacute;seau de zones prot&eacute;g&eacute;es le long de son cours depuis sa naissance en France, &agrave; travers la Belgique et jusqu'&agrave; son embouchure aux Pays-Bas.</tt>

<tt>Le WWF-France ne travaille pas seulement au r&eacute;tablissement des &eacute;cosyst&egrave;mes fluviaux. L'organisation s'est associ&eacute;e depuis 1986 au Comit&eacute; Loire Vivante pour lutter contre la construction de quatre barrages, qui menacent l'&eacute;cologie de la Loire. Les projets de construction de deux barrages ont &eacute;t&eacute; abandonn&eacute;s suite aux campagnes et &agrave; la mobilisation des personnes affect&eacute;es par le projet. Le WWF participe maintenant au programme Loire-Nature, un projet de 10 millions de dollars US pour la conservation et l'am&eacute;nagement durable du fleuve, financ&eacute; &agrave; 75 pour cent par l'Union europ&eacute;enne et le gouvernement francais.

<p>
<br>

Le WWF-Autriche s'efforce de sauvegarder l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; du plus grand &eacute;cosyst&egrave;me fluvial d'Europe centrale, la plaine du Danube, &agrave; l'est de Vienne. Cette r&eacute;gion est surtout menac&eacute;e par les centrales hydro&eacute;lectriques et la d&eacute;forestation. La campagne du WWF-Autriche pour la cr&eacute;ation d'un parc national est en train de porter ses fruits : un projet de centrale hydro&eacute;lectrique a &eacute;t&eacute; abandonn&eacute;, le WWF encourage le gouvernement &agrave; &eacute;laborer une l&eacute;gislation appropri&eacute;e pour le parc, tout en faisant pression pour obtenir son ouverture en 1996. 

<p>
<br>

Plus &agrave; l'est, le WWF &eacute;labore un plan int&eacute;gr&eacute; de conservation pour la Basse Volga et son delta dans la mer Caspienne. Il s'agit d'une zone d'importance internationale pour sa flore et sa faune, notamment pour les oiseaux migrateurs qui y trouvent un refuge. Le programme pr&eacute;voit d'am&eacute;liorer la protection de toute la r&eacute;gion, gr&agrave;ce &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation d'un nouveau r&eacute;seau de zones prot&eacute;g&eacute;es, &agrave; des actions &eacute;ducatives et &agrave; des projets pour la pr&eacute;servation d'esp&egrave;ces menac&eacute;es, comme l'antilope Saiga.

<p>
<br>

&#171; Les syst&egrave;mes fluviaux ont une diversit&eacute; biologique extr&ecirc;mement riche et des millions de gens en d&eacute;pendent &#187;, conclut Hails. &#171; Par ailleurs, il ne faut jamais sous-estimer l'importance de la profonde &eacute;motion que suscite chez nous la noblesse des grands fleuves. &#187; </tt>
