<p>Studies were conducted for four years (1992 -1995) on two
different soil types - Commerce silt loam and Sharkey clay - to
evaluate cultivars, Pix application, plant population density,
and N rate for cotton grown in 30- and 40-inch row spacings. The
six cultivars evaluated were DP 20, DP5409, DP5415, Stoneville LA
887, Stoneville 453, and Hyperformer HS 46, with and without
PIX® applications. Yield response to all treatment variables
differed among years and between soil types, however, there was
no consistent advantage to growing cotton in 30-inch rows. </p>

<p>Seedcotton yields on the Commerce silt loam, averaged across
four years, six cultivars and two Pix treatments, showed a small
but significant advantage for the 30-inch row spacing vs. 40-inch
row spacing (3361 vs. 3225 lb/acre). In contrast, the results of
a similar experiment on Sharkey clay showed a 239 lb/acre
seedcotton yield advantage for the 40-inch row spacing over the
30-inch row spacing (3368 vs 3129 lb/acre). </p>

<p>In a separate experiment on Sharkey clay with variable N rates
(60, 90, 120, and 150 lb/acre) and plant densities (26, 39, 52,
and 65 thousand- plants/acre), the 40-inch row spacing had a
small but significant yield advantage over 30-inch rows. Yield
interactions between row spacing and cultivar and row spacing and
Pix were not significant. Occasional significant yield
interactions occurred between row spacing and N rate and row
spacing and plant density. Thirty-inch rows consistently (across
years) required higher N rates than 40-inch rows. Surprisingly,
30-inch rows were capable of maximum yield production with lower
plant density per acre than 40-inch rows. </p>

<p>Lack of weed management technology has historically limited
cotton production in reduced-tillage systems. Although the
advantages of no-till or stale seedbed cotton production on
alluvial clay soils and on the erodible soils of the Macon Ridge
have been identified, the ability to control winter weeds and
early-emerging summer annual weeds has been limited by the
expense and availability of non-selective, burndown herbicides.
Failure to control weeds at cotton emergence and throughout the
season often results in reduced yield, low grades, and
unfavorable fiber quality. </p>

<p>Although the cost of non-selective herbicides such as
Roundup® and Gramoxone Extra® has decreased, growers are often
faced with emerging weeds and partially controlled winter-annual
and perennial weeds when cotton seedlings are emerging.
Herbicides that are currently registered for use at planting or
after cotton emergence often do not control these weeds.
Herbicides that are more non-selective and that control a wider
spectrum of weeds without injuring cotton would be beneficial. </p>

<p>Roundup Ready® cotton varieties are in development that will
tolerate Roundup when applied at early stages of cotton growth.
Planting these varieties and making timely applications will
greatly increase the producer's flexibility in
conservation-tillage systems by enabling control of a broad
spectrum of weeds. Research in 1995 indicated that herbicide
programs in Roundup Ready cotton were as effective as </p>

<p>commercially available programs containing Dual® and
Cotoran® with timely post-directed herbicide applications. These
programs were also as effective as BXN® systems containing
postemergence applications of Buctril® and systems with
Staple®. </p>

<p>Because the dinitroaniline herbicides are typically not used
in reduced-tillage systems, and because preemergence herbicides
are extremely dependent upon rainfall for activation, pigweeds
are one of the major weed problems in reduced tillage systems.
Excellent pigweed control with Roundup in Roundup Ready cotton
has been demonstrated. The BXN cottons that are tolerant of
Buctril have also shown benefits in reduced-tillage systems.
Although Buctril is marginal on pigweeds, control of cocklebur
and morningglory is excellent. </p>

<p>Incorporation of the genes imparting resistance to these
herbicides in a wide array of commercially acceptable varieties
will be critical in the profitability of these transgenic
systems. Presently, the varieties containing such tolerance are
limiting. Once high quality, high yielding cottons contain these
genes, this technology will have major, positive impacts on
reduced-tillage cotton production. </p>

<p>I. Tillage and Cover Crops for Cotton </p>

<p>This study was initiated in 1992 at the Macon Ridge Research
Station to determine the short-term and long-term effects of
alternative tillage systems and cover crops. This study consists
of three tillage systems and four cover crop treatments. Averaged
lint yields in 1995 for no-till cotton were significantly higher
than for conventional and ridge tillage. Cotton lint yields
following a wheat cover crop were significantly higher than those
following native vegetation, hairy vetch or crimson clover. Crop
maturity of no-till cotton was significantly earlier than the
other two tillage methods. Cover crops had no effect on crop
maturity in 1995. This year's results are similar to the four
year average (1992-1995) from this study. Wheat cover crop,
followed by no-till cotton, results in the highest yield and
earliest maturing cotton in the four year study. </p>

<p>II. N Rates and Cover Crops for Conventional Tillage and
No-till Cotton </p>

<p>This study was designed to determine the effects of tillage
systems (no-till and conventional tillage) on cotton response to
N rates and cover crops. N rates evaluated in this study were, 0,
35, 70 105, and 140 lb N/acre. Cotton lint yields, lint
percentage and maturity averaged across both tillage treatments
were similar in 1995. Cotton following native vegetation and
wheat cover crops produced optimum yields with 70 lb N/acre.
Cotton following vetch produced optimum yield with 35-70 lb
N/acre. Cotton following wheat, hairy vetch or native vegetation
produced similar cotton yields when adequate N was applied. Crop
maturity of treatments with optimum N fertilization rates was
similar. Nitrogen application rates above those necessary for
optimum yield tended to delay crop maturity with no corresponding
increase in yield. Mature plant height of cotton increased as N
rates increased up to levels that produced optimum yield.
Application of additional N above these rates generally had
little effect on vegetative growth of cotton. </p>

<p>III. Starter Fertilizers for Conventional Tillage and No-till
Cotton </p>

<p>Starter fertilizer tests were conducted on a Ginger silt loam
in 1995. Each test consisted of nine starter fertilizer
treatments arranged in a randomized, complete block design with
six replications. None of the starter fertilizer treatments
evaluated in 1995 had a significant effect on early growth of
conventional tillage or no-till cotton compared to broadcast
fertilization. Furthermore, none of the treatments influenced
lint percentage, lint yield or crop maturity of cotton in either
tillage system. </p>

<p>Insecticide resistance in insect pests limits the economic
production of cotton throughout the Cotton Belt. Strategies have
been implemented to manage levels of resistance, but these plans
are based on untested assumptions regarding the underlying causes
of resistance. The emphasis of our research is to provide
information that can be used to develop rational resistance
management strategies. Objectives of studies in 1995 were: to
determine whether the adult vial test (AVT) was an accurate way
to monitor pyrethroid resistance in field populations of the
tobacco budworm, <i>Heliothis virescens,</i> and to develop a
rapid and reliable bioassay using insecticide synergists to
detect expression of metabolic resistance in this insect. </p>

<p>Our results indicate that one of the reasons tobacco budworms
in northern Louisiana are resistant to pyrethroids is that many
(15- 20%) of these insects have target sites that are no longer
affected by these insecticides (i.e. they are target site
resistant). Once this occurs, the utility of pyrethroids for
control of these insects is greatly reduced. Two aspects of
target site resistance were studied. The first question was: is
this mechanism found in both larval and adult tobacco budworms?
This was important because we use adults to monitor resistance
throughout the growing season but it is the larvae that damage
the crop and are of major concern. We found that the target site
mechanism was expressed in both life stages of the tobacco
budworms. Therefore, the adult vial test was useful for
monitoring the expression of this resistance mechanism in larval
insects. The second question we addressed was: can we use adults
collected in pheromone traps to estimate levels of target-site
resistance in adults? Others have suggested that when adult male
tobacco budworms are target site resistant, they can not
&quot;sense&quot; pheromone as readily as males that are target
site susceptible. If this were true, the adult vial technique
(which relies on pheromone-trapped male moths) would
underestimate levels of target site resistance in the field. To
address this question, we measured target site resistance in
adults that we collected in pheromone traps and compared the
results to those we obtained using adults that were collected
with sweep nets from the same field. This experiment was tried in
two locations of the state and two different results were
obtained. At one location (the northwest comer of LA), expression
of target site resistance was identical between sweep-netted and
pheromone-trapped adults, while at the second (the northeast
corner of LA) there were more target site resistant adults in the
field than in the pheromone trap. Clearly, populations of tobacco
budworm monitored by pheromone traps at the second (but not the
first) location were different than those in the field near the
traps. We believe these results may suggest that tobacco budworms
fly from great distances in response to pheromone in the traps.
If populations within range of the trap are more heterogeneous in
terms of target site sensitivity than in-field populations, the
composition of insects in the trap will differ from that in a
nearby field. </p>

<p>The second objective of our research is to develop a fast and
reliable method for detecting the other, major resistance
mechanism in this insect, enhanced metabolism. Insects expressing
this mechanism are resistant because they possess enzymes that
rapidly degrade pyrethroids. Most often, compounds that inhibit
these enzymes will enhance (or synergize) the toxicity of the
insecticide. One such inhibitor, piperonyl butoxide (or PBO) is
widely used as an indicator of metabolic resistance. The problem
with using PBO as a diagnostic tool is that it does not inhibit
all of the enzymes that metabolize pyrethroids. In addition, if
not used carefully, other effects that have nothing to do with
enzyme-mediated resistance may be measured with PBO. Our goal is
to develop a simple bioassay with a series of effective
synergists so that metabolic resistance to pyrethroids can be
detected accurately in field populations of tobacco budworms. A
series of synthetic compounds were tested as potential synergists
against pyrethroid-susceptible and -resistant tobacco budworm
larvae in bioassays with cypermethrin. Early results from this
study confirm that a portion of the enzyme-mediated resistance in
this strain is not inhibited by PBO and that different types of
chemicals provide additional levels of synergism. </p>

<p>Two nematicides, Temik® 15G and Nemacur® 15% Granular, were
evaluated for their performance in a field with a high
infestation of the reniform nematode. Cotton yields were higher
in all nematicide treatments than the untreated control. Temik
15G at the rate of 7 lb/acre reduced the level of reniform
nematode throughout the growing season. Populations of reniform
nematode ranged from 5,000 to almost 20,000 per pint of soil in
the treatments at harvest. </p>

<p>A survey was initiated in 1994 to determine the distribution
in Louisiana of recognized nematode pests including root-knot and
reniform and to determine presence of other pest nematodes such
as the Columbia lance. The ten parishes with the most cotton
acreage were surveyed during 1994. During 1995, ten additional
parishes, representing about 18% of the cotton acreage, were
surveyed. Reniform nematode continues to be widespread and was
present in 55 of the 100 fields sampled. Parishes such as
Avoyelles, Caldwell, Grant, and Natchitoches had reniform
nematode in 80-100% of the fields sampled. Root-knot nematode was
present in 39% of the samples and was found in a high percentage
of the samples from Bossier and Caddo parishes. The survey has
also found the Columbia lance nematode in a small percentage of
the samples. </p>

<p>Legislation required to establish a Boll Weevil Eradication
Program in Louisiana was passed in 1992. Prior to the eradication
program being put before the state's cotton growers in a
referendum, an informational program was established through the
Cooperative Extension Service. The purpose of this program was to
disseminate information on the technical aspects of boll weevil
eradication and the tactics required to accomplish the goal. </p>

<p>In support of the informational program, funds from this
project were used to prepare and produce high quality brochures,
question and answer sheets and related posters on boll weevil
eradication. Also, a nine minute video was prepared that outlines
the technical, legal, and the economic aspects of an eradication
effort. </p>

<p>At the request of the Louisiana Boll Weevil Eradication
Commission (BWEC), technical assistance for a statewide
educational program on boll weevil eradication was provided.
Information was presented at 35 meetings, most of which were held
prior to the referendum vote in late March. Most of the remainder
were held during the summer in preparation for a second
referendum vote after the first referendum failed. Additional
meetings were held following the filing of a lawsuit that stopped
the second referendum vote to assess the likelihood of passing an
area referendum for the Red River Valley. Following those
meetings, the decision was made to delay referendum votes until
further notice by the BWEC. </p>

<p>Educational materials prepared and assistance provided
included a video, two brochures, two posters, a fact sheet,
numerous news articles, radio and TV tapes. </p>

<p>Although a referendum to initiate the boll weevil eradication
program was not passed, the educational program was deemed a
success. Cotton producers and land owners were well informed
about the weevil eradication as a result of this educational
program. When a referendum is held in the future, it is likely
that the Louisiana Cooperative Extension Service will conduct the
educational program for it. </p>

<p>Resistance to organophosphate and pyrethroid insecticides in
TBW from Louisiana appears to have stabilized or even decreased
during 1995. Standard adult vial tests using diagnostic doses of
pyrethroid classes of insecticides were performed on over 2500
TBW moths from 12 parishes. The mean survival of moths bioassayed
for organophosphate (10µg of profenofos/vial) and pyrethroid
(10µg of cypermethrin/vial) resistance during 1995 was 6% and
39%, respectively. During 1994, survival at these same diagnostic
doses for organophosphates and pyrethroids was 13% and 39%,
respectively. In replicated small plot field tests, Pirate® and
Tracer® (spinosad), which represent two novel classes of
insecticides, were more effective against TBW than standard
insecticides. </p>

<p>TPB from Louisiana exhibited a seasonal pattern of resistance
to carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids. This seemed to
be correlated with the use pattern of these insecticides. Based
on results obtained using a standard vial bioassay, LC<font
size="1">50</font>s measured during 1995 ranged from 0.57-12.69
(22X difference) for cypermethrin, from 0.93-6.18 (7X difference)
for acephate, and from 0.92-4.84 (5X difference) for oxamyl. The
highest LC<font size="1">50</font> values for the carbamates,
organophosphates, and pyrethroid were recorded during the months
of August, July, and August, respectively. The experimental
insecticide, Regent® (fipronil), was significantly more toxic to
TPB than a standard recommended organophosphate in replicated
small plot field tests. </p>

<p>BAW from Louisiana exhibited resistance to carbamate (3X) and
organophosphate (11X) insecticides in laboratory bioassays using
insecticide-dosed artificial diets. There was no evidence of
cross-resistance to the experimental insecticides Confirm®,
Pirate or Tracer. Also Confirm, Pirate and Tracer effectively
controlled BAW in replicated small plot field tests in contrast
to the standard insecticides, Larvin® and Lorsban®, which
performed poorly. </p>

<p>Six trials were conducted in 1995 to evaluate the interactions
of recommended IPM strategies with transgenic (Bt) cotton.
Preliminary data suggest that Bt cotton responds similarly to
conventional varieties with regard to planting dates, early
season pest management strategies and late-season crop management
decisions. Seedcotton yields of commercial cultivars with the Bt
gene (NuCot® 33, NuCot® 35) were higher than the yields of the
untreated commercial parents (DP 5415, DP 5690) in the presence
of tobacco budworm (TBW) infestations. </p>

<p>Numerous screening studies were conducted in 1995 to evaluate
the performance of commercial and experimental insecticides
against bollworm (BW) and TBW. Performance of the commercial
products (carbamates, pyrethroids and organophosphates) in tank
mixtures continue to demonstrate acceptable control of low to
moderate infestations of BW/TBW. None of the commercial
treatments provided cost-effective control of high densities of
insecticide-resistant TBW during August and September. The
results of these tests showed Pirate® and Tracer® (spinosad)
generally provided control of these Lepidopteran pests including
BW/TBW, soybean looper and beet armyworm at levels equal to or
greater than that afforded by the pyrethroid, organophosphate or
carbamate standards. </p>

<p>Field tests evaluated the effects of terminating insect
control strategies for BW/TBW and boll weevils at selected
intervals on seedcotton yields. The termination intervals were
based on cotton plant development measured as plant mainstem
nodes above white flower (NAWF) and heat unit (HU) accumulation.
Treatment termination intervals included NAWF=5, NAWF=5 + 200 HU,
NAWF=5 + 350 HU, NAWF=5 + 500 HU and NAWF=5 + 650 HU. There were
no significant differences in yields among termination intervals,
although yields consistently increased as insecticide termination
was delayed until NAWF=5 + 350 HU. </p>

<p>Some specific findings of the Mississippi Boll Weevil Management Corporation for the 1992, 
1993, and 1994 growing seasons are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Delta and non-Delta regions have significant differences in spring-emerging boll weevil 
numbers. The Delta region consistently trapped fewer weevils. </li>
<li>Counties in the northeast corner of the state showed low weevil numbers emerging in 1992, 
likely a result of a near absence of cotton in that area during 1991. Boll Weevil populations 
greatly increased in this area in the spring of 1993 and 1994 to levels similar to the rest of 
north Mississippi. </li>
<li>Two counties, Rankin and Lafayette, had areas of low weevil density during 1992 and 1994. 
This situation appears to be a result of prior effective pest management in these areas. </li>
<li>Highest populations of spring weevils were found along the northern row of counties. </li>
<li>Areas such as Noxubee County, which are somewhat isolated from other cotton counties 
and only recently back in cotton production, have lower weevil densities than other 
non-Delta areas. </li>
<li>All areas of the state had at least four times as many weevils captured in 1993 compared to 
1992. Some areas had ten times as many weevils captured in 1993; 1994 trap catch 
numbers were between the levels of 1992 and 1993. </li>
<li>1995 trap data illustrated that the Hill area consistently has higher populations of boll weevils. </li>
<li>There has been a steady trend of boll weevil numbers increasing in Region 2, or the South 
Delta. </li>
<li>An area in central MS, Yazoo County Hills, Madison, Hills of Holmes and western Attala, 
traditionally over 4 years trapping has extremely high counts. </li>
<li>The North Delta, Region 1, except for areas adjacent to the Hills or Mississippi River 
consistently has lower numbers of boll weevils. </li>
<li>In 1995, 4 traplines were established. Two in Delta and south west MS and two in Hill area 
outside of eradication areas. Trap lines filled in &quot;gaps&quot; in volunteer trapping and confirmed 
&quot;hot spots&quot; and also areas of low populations. </li>

<p>Because of this project, we were able to inform the Washington County grower, who first reported 
the problem of Fusilade&#174;/Assure II&#174; resistant (R) johnsongrass, that Select&#174; would be effective 
before he planted his next crop! We developed quick assays to identify graminicide-R johnsongrass 
from seed (7 days) and rhizomes (14 days). This turn-around compares with about six weeks using 
standard greenhouse procedures. Other herbicides effective on seedling and rhizome R 
johnsongrass were Roundup&#174;, Liberty&#174; (Ignite&#174;), Touchdown&#174;, and Accent&#174;. Seedling R 
johnsongrass was controlled by Gramoxone Extra&#174;, Treflan&#174;, Prowl&#174;, Lasso&#174;, Dual&#174;, 
Command&#174;, Cotoran&#174;, Scepter&#174;, Sencor&#174;, and Zorial&#174;. </p>
<p>We found that an immediate (1996 season) alternative for cotton producers having the R 
johnsongrass problem is to rotate those fields to soybean and plant one of several soybean cultivars 
resistant to Roundup&#174;. A single application of 1 qt/acre gave 97% control of the R johnsongrass. 
Excellent results were also obtained with Accent and Liberty&#174;, using sulfonylurea-tolerant and 
Liberty-tolerant soybean cultivars. </p>
<p>We recommend that growers not spread seed and rhizomes from R johnsongrass infested fields. 
Chisel plow in the fall to pull rhizomes near the soil surface, disk once shallowly with a pulverizing 
disk to break up the rhizomes and apply a double rate of Treflan&#174;. Use Select&#174; sparingly, if at all, 
as the R johnsongrass will most likely develop resistance to it. Use the rope-wick applicator, or 
consider rotating to Roundup-tolerant soybean so the R johnsongrass can be controlled with 
Roundup. </p>
<p>Cotton fields in 16 north-northwestern- and west-central-Mississippi counties are infested with 
MSMA resistant cocklebur biotypes. Uptake and translocation studies concluded that <sup>14</sup>C-MSMA 
uptake and translocation did not account for the MSMA resistance. We have tentatively concluded 
from our initial inheritance studies that the MSMA resistance in cocklebur is controlled by a single 
dominant gene. If outcrossing occurs under field conditions, then these resistant biotypes will 
continue to spread and dominate the population. </p>
<p>MSMA-resistant cockleburs can be controlled by any herbicide effective on cockleburs in 
Mississippi row crops. This includes the newly released Staple&#174; herbicide for use in cotton. Except 
for Staple, this means a cotton grower must rotate to soybean, corn, or grain sorghum to have an 
effective herbicide. The Roundup tolerant cultivars will be an alternative when released in 1997. </p>

<p>Interest in increased nitrogen (N) rates in combination with plant growth regulators continues in the 
Mississippi Delta and has been proposed to further enhance cotton productivity. A five year study 
was initiated in 1992 to determine the interaction of N rates (90, 120, 150, and 180 lb. N/acre) 
and mepiquat chloride rates. Four mepiquat chloride rates or systems were evaluated including 1) 
an untreated control, 2) 2 oz/acre applied four times (4x), 3) 4 oz/acre applied 4x, and 4) a 
variable system dependent upon the growing conditions but sometimes using higher rates. Plots size 
in this study was sufficient to allow 15-25 lb. seedcotton/acre to be harvested and processed 
through a commercial ginning sequence including dual lint cleaners. The fiber samples were then 
analyzed by HVI, as well as stelometer and arealometer. Lint yields and HVI data have been 
summarized over the first four years. A combined analysis of lint yields showed a significant lint 
response to N rates up to 120 lb. N/acre with no additional response to either the 150 or 180 lb. 
N/acre rates. Applications of mepicquat chloride did increase lint yields from 1001 to 1033 lb./acre 
(an increase of 3.2%) over the four-year period when the higher N rates were included. This 
increase was achieved with 2 oz mepiquat chloride/acre applied in four applications (total of 8 
oz/acre). In most years there was not a significant response to mepiquat chloride. Micronaire 
decreased with increasing N rates at both first and second harvest. Nitrogen had little effect on fiber 
length or strength but did cause an increase in yellowness (Hunter's b). Where mepiquat chloride 
was used there was a slight increase (0.01 inches) in fiber length with varying effects on fiber 
strength. Mepiquat chloride applications did result in height reductions and shorter internodes. 
Increasing N rates and using plant growth regulators to control growth is not a means to obtain 
higher yields. Mepiquat chloride has been shown to hasten maturity in some cases while increasing 
N rates has been shown to delay maturity. Putting these two factors together usually results in no 
change in maturity. The final analysis must weigh the cost of the practice, including materials and 
application, to the realized benefit. </p>

<p>A series of field experiments was done at Stoneville to evaluate the effects of fall, winter, and spring 
applied herbicides to control winter weeds for reduced tillage seedings on stale seed beds. Fall or 
winter applications of residual herbicides resulted in 50% to greater than 95% control of ground 
cover the following spring, depending largely on spring growing conditions. Spring applications of 
several herbicides and herbicide combinations gave excellent broad spectrum control. Therefore, 
research was focused on cotton tolerance to herbicides and herbicide combinations that were 
effective when applied within the 30-days prior to planting. Field experiments were done to 
evaluate the effects of preplant applications of Roundup&#174; or Roundup in combination with 
Bladex&#174;, Banvel&#174;, Weedar&#174;, Harmony Extra&#174;, Facet&#174;, or Cobra&#174;. All treatments were 
applied at 28, 14, and 7 days before planting (DBP) to standing beds. The only tillage operation 
between herbicide application and planting was leveling the beds at planting with a conditioner. 
Thereafter, conventional weed management programs were used as needed during the cotton 
growing season. Percent ground cover of weeds, stand counts, and yield were measured. In 
general, excellent control of winter weeds was achieved with tank-mix combinations of Roundup 
plus Weedar, or Banvel, or Harmony Extra. In some instances, minor injury was seen with 
Roundup plus Bladex, or Weedar, or Banvel at 7 DBP. Roundup + Facet caused major injury. The 
only herbicide, at any treatment timing, that adversely affected cotton yields was Facet. In some 
instances, preplant herbicides increased early growth, probably due to decreased competition from 
surviving winter weeds. Preplant applications of Roundup plus Weedar, or Banvel, or Harmony 
Extra provide excellent control of winter weeds in stale seed beds. Timing of applications must 
follow label instructions. </p>

<p>The hopper-box treatments Delta Coat AD and Prevail were evaluated alone and in combination 
with the in-furrow fungicides Terraclor Super X&#174; 12.5G, Ridomil PC&#174; 11G and Start&#174; 15G at 
the recommended rates and at 1/2 and 1/4 recommended rates. Plots were inoculated with 
<i>Rhizoctonia solani </i>and <i>Pythium </i>ssp. to encourage disease development. Two stand counts were 
made and the trial was carried to yield. </p>
<p>In 1993, disease pressure was very high and there were no significant differences in stand counts or 
seed cotton yields in plots planted with untreated and hopper box-treated seed. Almost all of the 
in-furrow treatments significantly increased stands and yields over the plots receiving no in-furrow 
treatment. </p>
<p>In 1994, two inoculum levels were established by using inoculum produced on oats (low pressure) 
and on fall panicum (high pressure). Weather conditions were not as favorable to disease 
development in 1994. There were significant differences in seedling stands in plots with and without 
in-furrow fungicide treatment. However, none of the in-furrow treatments significantly increased 
yield over the untreated control. </p>
<p>There were no significant differences in plots planted with untreated and hopper box-treated seed. 
In the high pressure plots (disease pressure was still less than in 1993), both hopper box treatments 
significantly increased seedling stands but not yields. Almost all of the in-furrow treatments 
significantly increased yields over the plots receiving no in-furrow treatment. Some of the lower 
in-furrow fungicide rates, especially in combination with hopper box treatments, had comparable 
seedling stands and yields. </p>
<p>In 1995 an inoculum level was established to give medium disease pressure. Results were similar to 
those in 1994. In general, the lowest recommended rate and 3/4 for granular in-furrow formulations 
and 1/2 for liquid formulation performed comparably. Addition of a hopper-box treatment was 
additive and increased fungicide efficacy with granular formulations but not with liquid formulations. </p>
<p>In conclusion, it appears that in-furrow treatment may be needed when disease pressure is high. 
Reduced in-furrow fungicide rates, possible in combination with hopper box treatments, may be as 
effective as the full in-furrow rates except when disease pressure is extremely high. The addition of 
a hopper-box or an in-furrow applied fungicide should be viewed as added insurance against 
environmental conditions conducive to disease development. No one can predict weather 
conditions after planting. Producers should weigh the costs of a particular treatment against 
potential benefits. </p>

<p>Weather is one of the most important factors impacting agricultural production. By providing the 
best possible weather information, management decisions about crop practices and timing of 
practices can be improved. The objectives of this research are to establish a series of weather 
stations for improved weather forecasting and to identify weather events involved in agricultural 
management decisions. This will be accomplished by development of a computer information 
system that provides rapid acquisition of real-time weather data from the Agricultural Weather 
Service Center in Stoneville, Mississippi. </p>

<p>Boll weevil pheromone traps in combination with malathion at a rate of 16 oz. per acre have been 
the primary tools used for boll weevil eradication. At the 16 oz. rate, malathion and its application 
account for more than half of the cost of eradication. If the rate of malathion could be lowered from 
16 to 12 oz. per acre without sacrificing efficiency, millions of dollars could be saved for the 
program. </p>
<p>During the 1995 season, we tested the effectiveness of malathion at rates of 16, 12, and 8 oz. per 
acre in the field. Treatments were applied both aerially and by ground, and three methods were 
used to evaluate toxicity: 1) Weevils were placed on treated leaves in petri dishes; 2) Weevils were 
placed in mesh bags on treated cotton plants; and 3) Weevils with wing covers glued together were 
placed on cotton plants in the field before malathion was applied and collected after application. All 
3 methods of evaluation were done at various intervals after treatment, and each treatment was 
evaluated several times. </p>
<p>During this season, we saw no significant difference in the toxicity of the 3 dosages tested. All 3 
dosages were consistently effective for 48 hours after treatment. Toxicity was somewhat erratic 
after 48 hours, but in several cases was substantial at 72 and 96 hours after treatment. Twice during 
the course of the study rainfall in the amounts of 0.05 and 0.10 inches occurred at approximately 
20 and 40 hours, respectively, post treatment and drastically reduced the effectiveness of 
malathion. </p>
<p>We conclude that the rate of malathion can be reduced to 12 ounces per acre immediately. The 8 
ounce rate could be used on the leading edge of the program where re-infestation is inevitable and 
should be </p>
<p>tested over a large area, perhaps the size of a county, before being used in the interior portion of 
the program. Rainfall, even in small amounts, severely reduces the toxicity of malathion and 
reapplication after rain should be a priority. </p>

<p>Using a subsoiler on sandy loam and silt loam soils with hardpans is a very common practice in the 
Mississippi Delta. This practice improves productivity but leaves soil surface rough and destroys 
most of the plant residue on the soil surface. New Federal legislation requires most producers to 
make some changes in land preparation methods to meet requirements for reduced soil erosion 
from fields. Maintaining a residue cover on the soil surface is a recognized method of reducing soil 
erosion. </p>
<p>A dryland experiment was initiated in 1994 to study the effects of subsoiling on plant yield in two 
different soil types. Two in-row subsoilers, the Para-Till and the Low-Till subsoiler, were designed 
to reduce soil surface disturbance and preserve most of the residue cover on the surface. These 
in-row subsoilers were compared to a conventional parabolic subsoiler operated at a 45&#176; angle to 
the row with or without alternate middle (non-traffic) chiseling. Each of these subsoiling treatments 
was conducted in the fall and spring. </p>
<p>The highest treatment yields averaged across both soil types and years was produced by the 
parabolic subsoiler in the fall and followed by the Low-Till subsoiler in the spring. This treatment 
produced a 14.2% yield increase over the fall parabolic subsoiling alone. Fall in-row subsoiling or 
spring in-row subsoiling on a fine-sandy-loam soil produced 98.5 and 94.1%, respectively, of the 
lint yield of the parabolic subsoiler run in the fall during the 2-year study. Combinations of parabolic 
subsoiling in the fall plus the in-row Para-Till or Low-Till parabolic subsoilers in spring produced 
100% and 103% for the sandy loam study and 107% and 110% for the clay loam study, 
respectively over the 2 years. </p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the immediate and residual effects of soil structure 
modification on cotton grown on heavy clay soils. This soil profile modification (PM) was 
accomplished by an experimental machine to mix soil up to 30 inches deep and 56 inches wide. 
Plots were established at the end of the 1994 season and included both conventional tillage 
operations and PM trials at 10-, 20- and 30-inch depths. Some of the data collected during the 
year included water infiltration rate, soil strength and cotton yield for non-irrigated cotton 
production. </p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of deep tillage is the improved infiltration of surface water into the 
profile. The PM tillage treatments have much higher infiltration rates during the first hour but, after 
time exhibited a rate reduction similar to the conventional tilled plots. Soil strength data were also 
collected in conjunction with the infiltration data. A penetrometer was used to measure soil strength 
and as expected, the 30-inch PM treatment had the lowest strength at the lowest soil depths and 
the 20-inch PM treatment was the next lowest. </p>
<p>Yield data showed the highest yield was produced on the 30-inch PM treatment, but the 
conventional tillage treatment produced as much as the shallower PM treatments. In 1995, overall 
lint yields were low and tillage treatments had little efficacy. This study will continue to identify the 
long-term effects of soil profile modification on cotton production. </p>

<p>The objective of this study was to look at the possible economic impact of narrow-row cotton 
production on farm profitability. The principal concern of this study is focused on machinery and 
equipment costs, and the differences between farms utilizing different row spacings for the various 
crops produced on that farm and one-row spacing (30&quot;-32&quot;). Data collected in 1994 and 1995 
clearly indicates that in the Hill areas of Mississippi, most corn, soybean and grain sorghum 
production utilizes 30-inch row spacings. If conventional-row spacings are utilized for cotton then 
an additional set of tools and perhaps one or two tractors are required just for cotton production. 
Thus, the potential attractiveness of 30-inch rows for cotton production is obvious. This study will 
attempt to quantify the differences in investment costs for such farms. </p>
<p>In the Mississippi Delta, narrow-row cotton is usually grown in 32-inch rows with much larger 
equipment. If corn or grain sorghum is grown on these farms, the 32-inch row configuration is often 
used for production of these crops. Delta soybean production, however, has rapidly moved to row 
spacings between 16 and 24 inches and these spacings require an entirely different type of planter. 
The investment costs of tractors and farm machinery on these farms will be compared with 
investment costs for farms utilizing conventional row spacings (38-40 inches) coupled with the use 
of the same equipment for corn, grain sorghum and soybean production. </p>
<p>Machinery and equipment inventories are being obtained from several cooperators growing 
narrow-row cotton in both the Hill and Delta areas of Mississippi. An effort to obtain on-farm yield 
data is still not providing reliable comparisons between narrow-row production for cotton but some 
research data on row spacings for corn and grain sorghum is becoming available in Mississippi. 
Data collection on whole farm profitability will be completed by the end of 1996. Model 
representative farms will be developed for the Hills and Delta to compare the impact of row 
spacing on machinery investment, yields and profits. </p>

<p>Four small-plot, replicated experiments were conducted at the Delta Branch Experiment Station in 
Stoneville, Mississippi in 1995 to study insecticide chemistry effects on cotton plant growth and 
development; sensitivity of cotton to early season insect infestation and damage; and timing of late 
season termination of insect control. </p>
<p>In an experiment to determine the effect of insecticides on plant growth and development, plots 
were established with the following treatments: 1) Methyl Parathion 4E (0.5 lb. ai/acre), 2) Bidrin&#174; 
8L (0.4 lb. ai/acre), 3) Orthene&#174; 90SP (0.33 lb. ai/acre), 4) Vydate&#174; 3.77L (0.25 lb. ai/acre), 5) 
Karate&#174; 1E (0.03 lb. ai/acre), 6) Baythroid&#174; 2E (0.03 lb. ai/acre), 7) Provado&#174; 1.63F (0.044 lb. 
ai/acre), 8) Condor&#174; OF (1.5 pt formulation/acre), and 9) Untreated Check. Applications of 
treatments were initiated 7 days pre-square and at 7 day intervals for a total of 3 applications. 
There were no direct insecticide chemistry effects on cotton crop growth, development, or yield 
measured in the 1995 experiment. A similar experiment conducted in 1994 showed reduced early 
season squares per acre in a methyl parathion treatment but no subsequent yield effect. Early 
season insecticide treatment effects on square set may be associated with the spectrum of insect 
control activity of the insecticide rather than a direct chemical effect on crop development. </p>
<p>An experiment to determine the extent of cotton susceptibility to early season insect damage was 
conducted at the Delta Research and Extension Center in 1995. Applications of Baythroid 2E 
(0.04 lb. ai/acre) + Ovasyn 1.5E (0.25 lb. ai/acre) were applied in such a manner as to leave 0, 1, 
2, or 3 discreet 7-day window(s) during early season plant development unprotected from insect 
damage. These windows are described as pre-square (5/27-6/3), pinhead square (6/3-6/10), and 
post-square (6/10-6/17). Results of the study showed no indication of a particular insect damage 
sensitive 7-day period associated with early square set. The light early season insect infestations 
encountered in the 1995 and earlier studies make the results inconclusive, but suggest that 
monitoring both crop development and insect infestation will be necessary for optimum timing of 
insect control in early season. </p>
<p>The small plot study of timing of late-season cotton insect control based on Nodes Above White 
Flower (NAWF)=5 plus various heat unit accumulations suggested a plateau of yield response from 
NAWF=5 + 200 HU to NAWF=5 + 650 HU, i.e., insect control after NAWF=5 + 200 HU did 
not increase yield. Previous similar studies have shown that insecticide applications later than 
NAWF=5 + 350 HU were unlikely to show an economic benefit. </p>

<p>The objective of this study was to evaluate cotton cultivars containing insect resistance traits, 
including transgenic Bt cotton, for impact on the insect pest complex and on economics of pest 
control. Cultivars tested included a nectariless isoline of DES 119, the high glanding cultivar &#151; 
Hartz H1215, the transgenic Bt cultivar &#151; Nucot 33, and for comparison the conventional varieties 
Deltapine 5415, Stoneville 474, and Suregrow 125. </p>
<p>Insect pressure was fairly light on both farms included in this study, and statistical differences in 
infestation among cultivars were rarely detected. Tarnished plant bug populations did not exceed 
threshold in any cultivar on either farm. Data on bollworm/tobacco budworm (BW/TBW) damage 
and infestation demonstrated the high level of resistance in Nucot 33 (NC33). All other cultivars 
exceed BW/TBW thresholds on 6 occasions (combined across both farms), although late-season 
occurrences were not treated. Boll weevil populations exceeded threshold only in NC33 on 
7/18/95. </p>
<p>Chemical and application costs incurred by all non-transgenic cultivars were $61.82/acre on the 
Smythe farm and $67.36/acre on the Walker farm. Nucot 33 was assigned $32.00/acre for the Bt 
licensing fee and $1.25/acre for the higher cost of seed. Cultivar-specific applications for thrips 
were made in May, for boll weevil in July, and for BW/TBW on two occasions on each farm in 
June or July. Total control cost, averaged across both farms was highest for Nucot 33 at 
$82.39/acre. Relatively low numbers of BW/TBW treatments in non-transgenic cultivars kept 
control costs for this complex below the cost of the Bt technology. The lowest control cost was for 
the nectariless isoline of DES 119 at $56.96/acre. </p>
<p>Averaged across both farms, the numerically highest yields were from the check cultivars Stoneville 
474 (1028 lb./acre) and Suregrow 125 (908 lb./acre). At all assumed cotton prices, Stoneville 474 
and Suregrow 125 were the most profitable, due to their high lint yields and the relatively small 
differences in insect control costs. It must be noted that insect pressure was unusually light on these 
farms in 1995. Under more severe insect pressure, relative profit differences may vary. It must also 
be noted that no statistical confidence level can be assigned to these apparent differences. </p>

<p>A discriminating-dose bioassay was developed and used to determine how widespread pyrethroid 
resistance was in plant bug populations in the Mississippi River Delta in 1995. This information is 
important, because pyrethroid resistant plant bugs have multiple resistance to other insecticides and 
are difficult to control in cotton. </p>
<p>Adult plant bugs were collected from weeds and tested in the spring (April 25th - May 31st) at 71 
locations, while 72 locations (mostly the same ones used in the spring) were used in the fall 
(September 7th - October 5th). In the spring survey 18, 3, and 50 collection locations were used in 
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, respectively, while 18, 6, and 48 locations were used in 
these states in the fall. Collection locations were weedy areas near fields located along U.S. and 
state highways, and all locations were at least five miles apart. A minimum of 50 adult plant bugs 
were tested from each location. </p>
<p>In the spring, 57.7% (41) of the collection locations had plant bug populations with pyrethroid 
resistance, this increased to 84.7% (61) in the fall. These results showed that pyrethroid resistance 
was widespread throughout the Delta in the spring and increased in the fall due to exposure of plant 
bugs to insecticides in cotton during the growing season. They also showed that pyrethroid 
insecticides should not be used in cotton in the Delta during May and June, since pyrethroid 
resistance was so widespread that use of these insecticides could rapidly produce plant bug 
populations with multiple insecticide resistance. This research also supports the current resistance 
management plan used in the mid-south to control the tobacco budworm in which pyrethroids are 
not used for budworm control in early season. </p>
<p>A large field experiment was set up and conducted on the farm of Lawrence Long at Holly Ridge, 
Mississippi. Plot design was randomized complete block with four replications. Plot size was five 
acres. All plots were sampled weekly from June through July. However, plant bug numbers found 
in all weeks were too low to conduct the experiment. </p>

<p>Early maturing and mid-season commercial varieties from the Mississippi Cotton Variety Trial were 
evaluated in both narrow (30&quot;) and conventional (38-40&quot;) row spacings at Delta and Hill locations 
in 1995. In general, varieties performing well in narrow rows were the same varieties that typically 
do well in 38- to 40-inch rows. Delta and Hill breeding strains developed for narrow rows were 
evaluated in replicated yield trials. Strains superior to the best commercial check variety were 
discovered at both locations. These strains will be further evaluated in 1996. Leaf shape, plant 
shape, and other morphological characters are being explored as a means to develop strains with 
specific adaptation to narrow rows. These strains are also being evaluated in conventional row 
spacings to identify superior strains regardless of row spacing. </p>

<p>The objective of this project is to develop new, high yielding, high fiber quality cotton strains and 
varieties that express at least partial resistance to key insect pests in Mississippi. The primary 
resistance traits currently used in the breeding program are: 1) nectariless (absence of extra-floral 
nectaries) which supresses reproduction by tarnished plant bug, and 2) high glanding (presence of 
gossypol glands on the calyx crown of cotton squares) which confers resistance to the 
budworm-bollworm complex. Activities and results of this project during 1995 will be discussed 
beginning with breeding material in the most advanced stage of development (new strains in the first 
year of replicated yield testing) and concluding with material in the earliest stages of development 
(i.e., crosses made this year). </p>
<p>A yield test of 58 new nectariless strains revealed none that showed immediate commercial 
promise, though several of the populations may be amenable to improvement through further 
selection. From among 700 single progeny rows, 70 new nectariless and 58 new high glanding 
strains were selected for further evaluation. Those with acceptable lint percentage and fiber quality 
will be included in replicated yield tests in 1996. Approximately 540 nectariless and 630 high 
glanding plant selections were made from the Advanced Generation Nursery. Those with 
acceptable lint percentage and fiber properties will be in progeny rows in 1996. </p>
<p>Unselected populations in the F<font size=1>2</font> and F<font size=1>3</font> generations were included in yield tests. Among F<font size=1>3</font>'s, 1 
nectariless and 2 high glanding populations were equal in yield to Stoneville 474, the highest yielding 
check variety. Among F<font size=1>2</font>'s (all with at least 1 insect resistant parent), 13 populations were equal in 
yield to Suregrow 125. A study of results from the F<font size=1>2</font> yield trials showed that, among insect 
resistant lines, DES936 (tolerant to plant bugs), Stoneville 907 (nectariless) and LA850082 
(nectariless) had the highest general combining ability and would thus be most likely to produce high 
yielding populations in future crosses. </p>
<p>Ninety-three new crosses were made in 1995. All but 8 included at least 1 nectariless parent and 
17 included at least 1 high glanding parent. F<font size=1>1</font> seed of crosses was sent to the winter nursery in 
Mexico for generation advance. </p>

<p>A four year study was started in 1992 to compare different cotton-tillage systems at Portageville, 
Missouri. The systems tested were ridge-till planted into native cover, ridge-till planted into killed 
wheat, and conventional tillage. No significant difference in soil temperature or cotton plant 
population was found in any of the four years. Plant maps were made for all cropping systems 
biweekly, beginning at first square. Photosynthetic Active Radiation (PAR) interception readings 
were made with a Sunfleck Ceptometer on the same days that plant maps were made. This 
ceptometer measures photosynthetically active light (400-700nm wavelength) intercepted by cotton 
leaves which is an indirect measure of leaf canopy size and density. </p>
<p>Ridge-till systems provided greater protection for cotton seedlings from wind and blowing sand 
than did conventional tillage. On windy days, canopy-level wind speed in conventional tillage plots 
during May and early June was 2 to 3 miles per hour greater than in the ridge-till with wheat plots. 
This resulted in greater early season plant height and light interception in the ridge-till cotton system 
with wheat. PAR readings averaged 10% greater in ridge-till cotton with wheat than conventional 
till in 1992 and 1993. No difference in light interception between cropping systems was found in 
1995. </p>
<p>The greatest difference in reproductive growth between conventional and ridge-till occurred in 
1992. Boll dry matter biomass at 83 days after planting was 278 lb./acre in conventional tillage, 
655 lb./acre in ridge-till cotton with wheat, and 670 lb./acre in ridge-till without wheat. </p>
<p>Yields were numerically greater with cotton planted ridge-till with wheat as compared to cotton 
planted conventional tillage in all years but were statistically different only in 1992. Lint yields in 
1995 were 1057 lb./acre for ridge-till planted into killed wheat, 1175 lb./acre for ridge-till planted 
into native cover, and 974 lb./acre for conventional tillage. Yields from ridge-till with wheat were 
significantly greater than ridge-till without wheat in the first two years of the study (1992 and 1993), 
but were not different in the following years. This indicates that planting cover crops may become 
less important for wind protection as native winter vegetation become established after several 
years of continuous ridge-till. </p>

<p>In a short season environment, measures must be taken to promote early crop maturity. Controlling 
the rate of nitrogen, and use of a growth regulator, could force cotton to slow vegetative 
development and ripen the bolls earlier. An experiment was done with three nitrogen rates; 40, 80, 
and 120 lb./acre, and with mepiquat chloride applied by two different methods. Mepiquat chloride 
was applied either as one application of 16 oz./acre at early flower, or as four applications of 4 
oz./acre, at weekly intervals, commencing two weeks before flowering. </p>
<p>Significant differences were found in maturity due to nitrogen rates. Nitrogen rates above 80 
lb./acre delayed maturity across all mepiquat chloride treatments. Yields were numerically greatest 
with the 80 lb./acre rate. There was a trend for reduced lint percentage with increasing nitrogen 
rates. Fiber quality was not affected by the experimental treatments. </p>
<p>Both methods of application of mepiquat chloride significantly reduced plant height. Height was 
most reduced with the multiple applications. Yield was increased with one application of mepiquat 
chloride, but was reduced with multiple applications. </p>

<p>Winter mortality is a significant factor in the annual population cycle of the boll weevil, particularly in 
the northern limits of the Cotton Belt. In this region, winter kill could be an important ally in boll 
weevil eradication efforts. We conducted research to determine the temperatures required to kill 
diapausing Missouri boll weevils under wet and dry conditions and also to determine if differences 
exist in cold tolerance of weevils from different locations in the cotton belt. </p>
<p>A cold bath was used to study the cold tolerance of boll weevils in the two experiments. In the first 
test, groups of weevils collected in Missouri were exposed to temperatures of 25&#176;, 20&#176;, and 15&#176;F 
for six hours under wet and dry conditions. Boll weevils appear to have very little tolerance for the 
formation of ice crystals in their immediate vicinity. The insects essentially froze when the water in 
their surroundings froze. All groups of weevils in the wet treatments suffered heavy mortality 
(essentially 100%) with exception of the 25&#176; treatment. In this instance the wet environment around 
the weevils did not freeze until approximately four hours into the test. Mortality of weevils in a dry 
environment ranged from 21 to 28% in the three temperature treatments. </p>
<p>In the second experiment, adult boll weevils were collected from pheromone traps in the vicinity of 
Portageville, MO (36&#176;30&#162;N), Starkville, MS (33&#176;45&#162;N) and Corpus Christi, TX (27&#176;45&#162;N). 
Groups of weevils were exposed to temperatures of 25&#176;, 20&#176;, 15&#176;, 10&#176; and 5&#176;F for six hours. Boll 
weevils from Missouri were not more cold tolerant than weevils from either of the two more 
southern locations. Essentially no weevils, regardless of origin, survived the 10&#176; or 5&#176;F treatment. 
Survival at the other temperature treatments ranged from 49.3 to 84.8% with survival being above 
80% for all locations in the 25&#176;F treatment. </p>
<p>In a related study, pheromone traps were used to determine distribution of spring-emerging weevils. 
A 6X6 mile grid was established with three traps placed in the cotton field nearest each grid point. 
Results of the 1995 survey are shown in the figure below. The size of the dot is proportional to 
weevil captures at that site. The numbers ranged from 0 to 12.5 weevils/trap/day. </p>
<p>The distribution of boll weevils in both 1994 and 1995 was heavily skewed to the western parts of 
the Bootheel. Wooded areas combined with substantial land form relief and/or very well drained 
soils are characteristics of regions with highest numbers of weevils. In the east, most wooded areas 
are very level and have poor surface drainage. This distribution may be explained in part by 
laboratory data showing the boll weevil's low tolerance for ice formation in its environment. </p>

<p>This project is devoted to applied and basic aspects of genetic improvement of Acala cotton 
germplasm. Large and diverse genetic populations are grown in breeding nurseries at Las Cruces 
and Artesia, New Mexico. Selection is practiced for fiber quality, lint yield, tolerance to Verticillum 
wilt and resistance to Southwestern Cotton Rust. An experimental strain NM24052 (genetic source 
of high fiber strength) was extensively tested in various Acala backgrounds. Interesting 
combinations were produced that had fiber strength equal to a Pima S6 control yet in an Acala 
1517 germplasm. This material is being studied to determine its potential in Acala breeding. In 
addition, several advanced rust-resistant Acala strains have been produced that trace back to 
Nazas 87 x Acala 1517 populations. These strains have good Acala fiber quality and lint yield 
potential (equal to present Acala 1517 cultivars). These are being accelerated in the program for 
future release. </p>

<p>Three early-season tobacco budworm management tests were conducted in 1994 in southern 
North Carolina to evaluate the potential use of non-pyrethroid chemistry. </p>
<p>In a 60-acre, 5 replicate test under heavy tobacco budworm pressure (19% early instar tobacco 
budworms in terminals), a carbamate (Larvin&#174; at the larval rate), an organophosphate plus 
biological tank mix (Curacron&#174; at the ovicidal rate plus Design&#174;), and a pyrethroid (Scout 
X-TRA&#174;) were compared to an untreated check. Scout X-TRA held budworms in terminals and 
on squares to 1/5-1/3 of that of the other treatments, with Larvin providing intermediate control. 
Extensive sweep net samples taken 5 days after treatment revealed no significant differences of 
common beneficial arthropods between treatments. </p>
<p>The other two studies were conducted on small, replicated plots. The first was comprised of the 
traditional pyrethroid alternatives (Bolstar&#174;, Curacron, Larvin, and Ovasyn&#174; + Phaser&#174;), Scout 
as the pyrethroid comparison, and an untreated check. Partially due to light budworm pressure at 
the location of this test, no significant differences were noted in the treatments, although the 
pyrethroid comparison treatment contained numerically less damaged terminals and squares than 
the other treatments. </p>
<p>Included in the second small plot test were the biologically-oriented options Desing + Curacron (at 
the ovicidal rate), Raptor&#174;, Ovasyn&#174;, and an untreated check. In addition, treatments to emulate 
budworm damage at two cotton growth periods were included: 1) squares were removed on the 
three, most mature fruiting branches just prior to bloom, and 2) all squares and terminals were 
removed in late June. None of the insecticide treatments increased subsequent fruit retention over 
the check. However, the terminal plus square removal treatment sustained a significant maturity 
penalty. The proportion of open bolls in the insecticide treatments ranged 82% to 98% as 
compared to 44% for this treatment. </p>
<p>These and other recent tests suggest that 1) non-pyrethroids provide only marginal control of 
tobacco budworms under heavy pressure, 2) a single application of either pyrethroids or 
alternatives appears to have minor adverse impact on the beneficial arthropod community, 3) 
removal of early squares (first three positions) thus far has had no negative impact on either maturity 
or yield, and 4) the loss of a significant proportion of June terminals may lead to both maturity 
delays and yield penalties. </p>

<p>Experiments were conducted at four locations in North Carolina during 1994 and 1995 to evaluate 
weed management systems in no-till BXN&#174; cotton utilizing Buctril&#174; and Staple&#174; applied 
postemergence (POST) overtop compared with the standard early POST treatment of Cotoran&#174; 
plus MSMA POST-directed. Treatments consisted of all combinations of the following 
preemergence (PRE), early POST, and late POST herbicides. PRE treatments included Prowl&#174; or 
Prowl plus Cotoran&#174;. Early POST treatments included no herbicide, Buctril&#174; or Staple&#174; applied 
POST overtop, and Cotoran plus MSMA applied POST-directed. Late POST treatments 
included no herbicide, or Bladex&#174; plus MSMA POST-directed. Excellent control of common 
lambsquarters and common ragweed was obtained with any system containing Cotoran plus 
MSMA or Buctril applied early POST. Staple controlled both of these species poorly. Cotoran 
plus MSMA and Staple were more effective on redroot pigweed and Palmer amaranth than was 
Buctril. Cotoran plus MSMA and Buctril controlled tall morningglory well, whereas control by 
Staple was inadequate. Pitted morningglory and prickly side were more effectively controlled in 
some experiments by Cotoran plus MSMA than with either Buctril or Staple. Annual grass control 
was much better in systems with Cotoran plus MSMA early POST than in systems with either 
Staple or Buctril. In complete management systems consisting of Prowl plus Cotoran applied PRE, 
an early POST herbicide, and Bladex plus MSMA applied late POST, weed control, cotton yield, 
and net returns were similar with Cotoran plus MSMA, Buctril, or Staple applied early POST. 
There was, however, no advantage of Buctril or Staple over Cotoran plus MSMA. In systems not 
including Cotoran PRE or Bladex plus MSMA late POST, weed control, cotton yield, and net 
returns were sometimes less with Buctril or Staple applied early POST compared with Cotoran&#174; 
plus MSMA. These experiments demonstrate that Buctril or Staple can replace early POST 
directed herbicides but only in a system that includes PRE and late POST-directed herbicides. </p>

<p>The economic evaluation of new technology is important to cotton growers to assist them in making 
management decisions. For this purpose, agronomic field tests were done in four areas: 1. starter 
fertilizer and in-furrow fungicides, 2. yield tests with transgenic, herbicide-resistant, BXN cotton, 3. 
row spacings and patterns, and 4. plant growth regulation treatment strategies with Pix. Starter 
fertilizers provided economical yield responses in two of three years. There was little response to 
in-furrow fungicide treatments. BXN cotton varieties yielded less than did either DPL51 or LA887 
in two of three years. BXN cotton should be used in areas where heavy weed populations might 
otherwise reduce yields of high-yielding, conventional varieties. Narrow, 30-inch row cotton did 
not yield more than traditional, 38-inch row cotton in two of three years. The overall mean yield 
with traditional, 38-inch cotton was more than with 30-inch cotton. In 1995 skip-row, 30-inch row 
yields were equivalent with those of solid planted 30-inch row cotton, while solid planted 38-inch 
row cotton yields were more than with skip-row, 38-inch row cotton. </p>
<p>Pix management systems based on plant monitoring either gave higher yields or were equivalent to 
automatic Pix regimes in all three years. In many locations over the three years there was no 
response to Pix treatment. At all harvested locations in 1995, the numerically highest yields were 
with no Pix applications compared with four treatment regimes for using Pix. Pix systems based on 
plant monitoring used less Pix and were much less likely to reduce yields in dry years. Pix use has 
been observed to reduce yields on droughty soils when there is low rainfall in July and August. 
Treating at early bloom as required, based on plant monitoring, yielded more than all other methods 
averaged over locations and years. This result indicates that in most cases growers should not apply 
Pix routinely at first square, and most likely will benefit from unimpeded leaf area development until 
the cotton plant has about 9-10 nodes. </p>

<p>The winter nursery near Tecoman, Mexico is operated under the auspices of the National Cotton 
Council and serves as a means to advance breeding material an extra generation each year. In the 
fall 1994, lines in the F<font size=1>5</font> and F<font size=1>6</font> generation were sent to the nursery for seed increase to be yield 
tested in the summer 1995. Yield trials of 200 lines were conducted in 1995 at three locations. 
Twenty-three lines out yielded the checks; these included five early lines that out yielded both 
Deltapine 51 and Sure Grow 125. Eighteen medium/late-maturing lines out yielded the late 
checks-Deltapine 51 and LA 887. Seeds of these twenty-three lines were sent to the winter 
nursery in Mexico for increase so that more extensive testing can be performed in 1996. An 
additional 200 lines will be available for yield testing in 1996. Also sent to the winter nursery were

<p>Improved cost effective and environmentally benign methods for managing the Columbia lance 
nematode are needed. One promising approach is the use of a short-season, cotton-production 
system. Factors that promote cotton earliness, such as planting date, variety and growth-regulator 
application, may also impact the population densities of plant parasitic nematodes and the damage 
they cause to cotton. </p>
<p>This study was performed in a cotton field naturally infested with Columbia lance nematode. 
Treatments included two planting dates (May and April) with two cotton varieties, Deltapine 50 
and Deltapine 90 (early and late maturity), two levels of growth-regulator management (PIX&#174; 
versus no PIX), and two tillage treatments (paired side-by-side plots; destruction of cotton-root 
systems after cotton harvest versus allowing the residual plants to be killed by frost). </p>
<p>Populations of nematodes were measured periodicly throughout the season. The May planting of 
Deltapine 50 cotton which was treated with the growth regulator PIX resulted in lower mid-season 
counts of Columbia lance nematode as compared to untreated cotton. However, neither planting 
date nor cotton variety influenced the final population densities of this nematode. These data agree 
with results from 1994. In addition, the early destruction of the cotton root system did not influence 
population densities of Columbia lance nematode compared to plots in which cotton was allowed 
to continue to grow until frost. </p>
<p>The yield of Deltapine 90 was significantly greater than that of Deltapine 50 (P=O.05). Regression 
of seed cotton yield versus preplant numbers of Columbia lance nematode indicates that Deltapine 
90 is more tolerant of this nematode than is Deltapine 50, and confirm data from 1994. 
Late-planted cotton yielded more than early-planted cotton (P=0.10). </p>
<p>Thus, cotton yield losses caused by Columbia lance nematode can be minimized by proper variety 
selection. Deltapine 90 cotton is fairly tolerant of this nematode species, or performs better than 
earlier-maturing verities in the sandy soils where this nematode is prevalent. Use of a late-maturing 
cotton variety may be among the most effective management practices for maximizing cotton yield 
in the presence of this nematode. </p>

<p>The major objective of this project is to evaluate the implications of emerging technology on 
economically important insect populations. </p>
<p>Insecticides normally applied for the control of the pests targeted by the Bt cottons also potentially 
also limit numbers of non-target pests. Experiments were established in Robeson, Jones, Greene 
and Halifax counties to determine the impact of these pests in a non-pesticide situation similar to 
what would be expected in Bt culture. In the test, DPL lines 5690 and 5415, both protected and 
unprotected with pyrethroids were compared with their transformed, unprotected counterparts, 
NuCOTN 33 and 35. </p>
<p>As was the case in 1994, the transgenic lines held boll damage from caterpillars to approximately 
the same levels as the grower-protected lines. With both transgenic varieties averaged over the two 
years and all locations (12 comparisons), total damage from bollworms, European corn borer, fall 
armyworm and stink bugs was identical in the trasgenic Bt versus the non-transgenic, 
pyrethroid-protected alternative (both at 5.85% boll damage). The unprotected, non-Bt check 
sustained 27.4% damaged bolls. </p>
<p>Plant bug levels were very low at all of the locations, with percent square retention levels in the 
mid-90's and sweep net sampling for adults revealing levels which were often less than 10% of 
suggested threshold levels. </p>
<p>The above results are important in that they (1) were conducted under producer conditions, 
(2)encompassed 2.5 to 5 acre untreated blocks, (3) involved producers providing the insect sprays 
for the non-Bt, protected lines and (4) represented multi-year, multi-location evaluations. </p>
<p>A 10-replicate study comparing the effect of skip row, Pix&#174;, and row width (30 versus 38 inches) 
and their interactions on late-season bollworm damage was conducted under moderate to high 
bollworm pressure. No significant differences in boll damage or in yields were noted in either row 
width or Pix use, but surprisingly, a significant difference in boll damage, 11.75 versus 6.7% was 
noted in the inside versus outside rows, respectively, in skip row plantings. In comparing 
interactions between variables, the 38-inch row width plots with Pix treatments at 5.75%, had 
significantly lower boll damage than the 30-inch plots with Pix and the 30 and 38-inch row plots 
without Pix. These data, when combined with that from 1994, essentially showed no late season 
insect advantage in using any of the Pix deployment strategies evaluated (eg., low rate multiples, 
plant development triggers for Pix use, a single application at early bloom, etc.), or in combination 
with narrow versus conventional rows. </p>
<p>In continuing to evaluate the possible effect of transgenic BXN&#174; cotton on late-season bollworm 
and European corn borer damage to bolls, light caterpillar pressure at both the Clayton and Rocky 
Mount locations precluded any significant differences between treatments. However, the numerical 
trend at the latter location revealed higher boll damage in the later-maturing varieties, whether or not 
they had been transformed. </p>

<p>Only two sites were suitable for harvest in 1995 because of the extreme waterlogging in June 
followed by extended drought during the bloom period. Even though all sites were affected by the 
weather, the test results added to our knowledge of leaf petiole monitoring, and allowed preliminary 
thresholds to be tested under unusual conditions. Leaf and petiole monitoring results gave conflicting 
results in 1995. Leaf tissue levels were all below published thresholds, while petiole concentrations 
of Potassium (K) were above current thresholds in all but the unfertilized plots. We suspect that 
waterlogging in the early season contributed to low accumulation and storage of K in the leaf tissue. 
We hypothesis that when the sampling period began, translocation through petioles resumed as soils 
began to dry and roots began to regrow. These data will help interpret data in future years if 
extremely wet conditions affect plant uptake and storage mechanisms. The Lewiston site showed 
that severely deficient cotton may not respond to foliar fertilization. Similarly, there was no response 
to supplemental foliar K when very high levels of K were applied to the soil. Where mild 
deficiencies were encountered, three applications containing 10 pounds of KNO<font size=1>3</font> in 10 gallons of 
water increased yields by as much as 85 pounds of lint per acre. Studies over the past two years 
have shown no response to K additions on soils testing above 80 pounds of K per acre or above 
50 (NCDA soil test index). In sites testing less than 50, rates required to correct deficiencies have 
been identified. </p>

<p>Cultural practices often are neglected as an option for nematode management in cotton. Use of 
animal wastes, other organic amendments or green manure crops, such as winter rye crop, have 
promise for controlling many nematodes. North Carolina is a leading state in poultry production, 
including broiler chickens and turkeys. Poultry waste generally is high in nitrogen and may supply 
much of this nutrient to cotton. In addition, chicken litter may also have nematicidal properties. </p>
<p>Field experiments were initiated to evaluate the influence of rates of chicken litter, dates of 
application and (or) a winter rye cover crop on Columbia lance nematode and cotton yield. Fertility 
levels for all plots were adjusted to levels recommended by a soil test. </p>
<p>A rye cover crop tended to suppress numbers of Columbia lance nematode, but also had a 
negative impact on cotton yield at a site in Robeson County, NC. There was a negative correlation 
(<i>P</i>=0.05) between seed cotton yield and the amount of rye incorporated into the soil. However, 
high rates of chicken litter increased (<i>P</i>=0.10) cotton yield in the presence of Columbia lance 
nematode and resulted in low numbers of this nematode in September. The increased cotton yield 
in response to chicken litter application can be attributed to nematode control, since it is unlikely 
that fall-litter applications affected soil fertility during the growing season. </p>
<p>Seed-cotton yield, in a Scotland county field infested with Columbia lance nematode, was 
enhanced by high rates of chicken litter. Early application (December) tended to improve nematode 
control and enhance yield more than later application (April). Numbers of root-knot nematode 
were lowest in plots receiving chicken litter, regardless of the date of application. Enhanced 
nematode control and improved cotton yield with early applications of poultry litter, suggest that 
nematode suppression via this soil amendment is a result of biological processes. </p>
<p>Applications of 6 to 9 tons of poultry litter per acre increased seed cotton yield by as much as 300 
lb/acre while reducing population densities of nematodes damaging to cotton. A rye cover crop was 
somewhat effective in suppressing mid-season numbers of Columbia lance nematode. Addition of 
poultry litter to fields infested with high populations Columbia lance nematode can alleviate much of 
the cotton yield suppression caused by these pathogens. </p>

<p>Monsanto Company's Bt cotton Bollgard&#153;, which is to be marketed in 1996, has demonstrated a 
very high level of resistance to the cotton bollworm and tobacco budworm in field studies 
conducted in North Carolina and elsewhere. Thus, this new technology offers great promise for 
insect management and it's release this year is particularly timely since the tobacco budworm 
resistance to pyrethroid insecticides has spread eastward into Georgia. However, there is great 
concern that this technology may not be long lived due to insect strains, particularly tobacco 
budworm, becoming resistant to Bt toxins. Laboratory strains have developed resistance to the Bt 
toxin and field populations are very likely to also unless selection pressure can be minimized. The 
principle means for minimizing selection for Bt. resistant insects is to provide refuge areas, &quot;refugia&quot;, 
where selection pressure would not occur. One way that has been suggested as a means of insuring 
that a proportion of the insects would not be selected is to package the Bollgard cottonseed with a 
proportion of non-Bt seed in each bag. Thus, the non-Bt. plants resulting in each field would 
provide a food source which would guarantee that some insects develop without selection for Bt. 
toxin-resistance. However, for this concept to be acceptable to farmers in North Carolina, the 
losses sustained on the non-Bt plants must be of little economic consequence. </p>
<p>We evaluated pure and blended genotypes of Bollgard during 1995 under both normal and late 
planting dates and where beneficial insects had been eliminated and where they had been 
conserved. Our results show that whenever 15% non-Bt plants are present yield losses to 
bollworms were 7% greater than that recorded for the pure Bt planting; if non-Bt plants were 25% 
of the seed mix, yields were reduced by 12% from that of the pure Bt planting. </p>
<p>The losses we measured suggest that a lower proportion of non-Bt seed in the mixture (eg. 5-10%) 
should be acceptable in areas of the cottonbelt where tobacco budworm is the major insect pest 
and is practically impossible to control with synthetic insecticides. However, in North Carolina the 
major insect pest of cotton is the bollworm which is not as susceptible to Bt cotton as is the 
tobacco budworm. In our 1995 test, yields were reduced 8.5% by bollworm feeding in the pure Bt 
planting and another 7-12% loss would have resulted in total losses in the range of 15-20%, which 
would be totally unacceptable. We have planned tests for 1996 to confirm our 1995 results, but at 
this point blends of Bt and non-Bt cotton plants within a field do not appear to be a viable 
economic option in North Carolina as long as the pyrethroid insecticides continue to provide good 
control of bollworm and tobacco budworm. </p>

<p>One of the most persistent challenges a grower must face is getting a uniform stand of healthy, 
vigorous cotton seedlings. Among the factors affecting cotton stand establishment are seed vigor, 
seed placement, temperature and soil or seed moisture, and seed and seedling diseases. With the 
less than ideal conditions imposed by no-till tillage, practices these factors may make stand 
establishment even more challenging. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the effect of cotton 
seed germination and vigor potentials, and efficiency of at-planting fungicides on field emergence, 
seedling survival, and yield under conventional and no-till production. </p>
<p>Cotton plots were established in Rocky Mount, North Carolina (conventional tillage) and in Union 
county (no-till) in the spring of 1995. Two seed lots of Delta Pine 51 (high and low quality) were 
used in combination with 4, at-planting fungicides (Delta Coat, Ridomil PC&#174;, Terrachlor Super X&#174; 
12.5G, and Prevail) and an untreated check. </p>
<p>Yield was influenced by planting method and seed quality, but not by at-planting fungicide 
application. No-till cotton yielded slightly less than conventional tillage, but note that the 
performance of high quality seed was consistently highest in each of the two production systems 
(Table 1 and 2). The difference between the performance of low and high quality seed is more 
pronounced in the no-till plots. </p>

<p>The survey documents the extremely limited treatment for both second generation budworms and 
plant bugs where services of a consultant are used. Consultants now contract over a third of North 
Carolina's cotton acreage. </p>
<p>In an informal telephone survey of approximately 20 producers without services of a consultant, it 
was found that a somewhat higher proportion of the total represented acreage (0.75%) was treated 
for plant bugs while treatment for June populations of tobacco budworm was at approximately the 
same level (4+%) as that where consultants were engaged. </p>

<p>Eighteen defoliation treatments were applied at maximum daily temperatures of 70&#176; and 80&#176;F. 
Percent defoliation, desiccation and regrowth were estimated visually. This cotton was irrigated and 
more lush than most cotton in North Carolina last year. Dropp&#174; + Prep&#174;, Quickpick&#174; (QP) + 
Dropp + Prepp, and Harvade&#174; + Prep gave the least amount of desiccation with the Harvade + 
Prep giving the best combination of high defoliation and low desiccation. By the 21st day after 
treatment, desiccation rating was acceptable on most treatments with the exception of Quickpick + 
Prep. The Def rate in the Def + Dropp combination appears to be too high and should probably be 
lowered to at least 1.5 pints in future recommendations. The addition of Prep to Roundup&#174;+ Def 
appeared to increase desiccation. </p>
<p>Regrowth was not severe because the crop was irrigated and had a good boll load. All 
combinations with Dropp held regrowth to a minimum. Dropp controlled regrowth slightly better 
than Roundup. </p>
<p>The 70&#176; test was applied on October 16 and rated on October 23, 7 days after treatment. 
Desiccation was still rather high at this rating because the cotton was rather lush and only 7 days 
had passed. The later rating data are not included in this report because the check had desiccation 
indicating frost damage. </p>
<p>Tests to determine optimum defoliation timing were done at several maturity levels. As in the past 
two years, defoliation was possible prior to 60% open. This year, maximum yield was reached at 
51% open when nodes above cracked boll (NACB) reached 3.1. In past years defoliation at 4-5 
NACB did not reduce yields whereas this year defoliation at 3.7 NACB did reduce yields. </p>

<p>This project evaluated new cotton varieties at 11 cotton producing sites in Oklahoma. Personnel 
from the OSU Cotton Research and Extension Center assisted farmers with planting and monitored 
demonstration areas throughout the growing season. Tours of two of these locations were held in 
October. </p>
<p>Due to poor yield, only seven of the demonstrations were harvested. Each sample was ginned on a 
small sample gin and fiber was submitted for HVI analysis. </p>
<p>Oklahoma's 1995 season was characterized by late planting, early drought, heavy mid-season 
rainfall, and an early fall. Total number of bales produced in Oklahoma was the lowest in 
approximately 100 years. </p>
<p>Four locations were not harvested by the cooperator due to low yield potential. In early August, all 
the plots received unusually heavy rainfall. Pix was applied at 3 or 6 oz/acre to three of these 
locations. Highly determinate varieties did not show a response to Pix at either the 3 or 6 oz/acre 
applications (e.g.: AllTex Excess yielded 927, 818 and 891 lb/acre with 0, 3, and 6 oz/acre, 
respectively). Moderately determinate varieties showed a positive yield response to Pix at the 3 oz 
application rate (e.g.: DP 5409 yielded 178, 345, and 305 lb/acre with 0, 3, and 6 oz/acre, 
respectively). </p>

<p>Late in the season, one of the many difficult decisions cotton producers or consultants must make is 
when to stop insecticide treatments. Of primary importance is the identification of insect treatments 
that benefit yield and those that do not. Termination of weekly scouting and cotton insect control 
based on the number of branches or nodes above the uppermost white flower (NAWF) is a very 
reliable means to accurately predict the uppermost bolls that will contribute to yield. Bolls are 
mature enough to resist insects after 350 growing degree days (GDD) or heat units have 
accumulated after bloom. Replicated studies conducted in Oklahoma in 1993 and 1994 revealed 
that no cotton was harvested above NAWF = 4. The objective of this study was to introduce 
producers and consultants to NAWF concept. </p>
<p>Demonstration centers were established in Caddo, Washita, Harmon, Tillman, Garvin and McClain 
counties. At all locations at least two adapted varieties were planted. Dryland fields were planted 
with Paymaster HS 26 and Holland 1379, while irrigated fields received Paymaster HS 26 and 
DPL 90. Besides monitoring NAWF, all flowers were tagged twice a week to reveal the 
importance of each fruiting position to the overall yield and demonstrate that following this 
procedure would not impact yields. </p>
<p>In 1995 plant mapping and boll tagging revealed no bolls contributed to yield above NAWF = 6. 
Unfavorable growing conditions during August and September plus heavy insect pressure resulted 
in a lower-than-expected boll retention rate. Poor boll retention forced the plant to compensate for 
this boll loss by setting and maturing 3rd and 4th position bolls. Reliance on these bolls further 
delayed maturity compounding the overall lateness of the 1995 crop. </p>
<p>NAWF demonstrations will continue in 1996. Producers that terminate insect scouting and insect 
control based on the NAWF will not jeopardize yield. The 1995 data suggests that the uppermost 
harvestable boll in dryland cotton may be 1 or 2 nodes below NAWF = 4. Growing conditions, 
GDD accumulations, and soil moisture levels will influence the uppermost boll that contributes to 
yield. </p>

<p>The objectives of this project are to develop reduced-tillage, cotton-production systems for the 
highly erodible soils of Southwest Oklahoma, with emphasis on stand establishment, weed control 
programs, and interseeding cover crops. On coarse-textured soils, strip tillage or row-tillage 
systems work best. This includes an in-row subsoiler, fluted coulters, and packing wheels. This 
produces a good seedbed approximately 12-in. wide with residues in the row middle. </p>
<p>One experiment was established on a highly erodible soil in Greer County to evaluate large block, 
side-by-side comparisons of row-tillage versus conventional tillage. The conventional tillage block 
yielded 205 lb lint/acre and the row-tillage block yielded 348 lb lint/acre. Cotton plants had a much 
deeper and extensive root system in the row-tillage block than the conventional tillage block. </p>
<p>Two additional experiments were established on highly erodible soils in Greer and Payne Counties. 
Both of these experiments were set up to evaluate weed control at the time of planting with mixtures 
of Caparol&#174;, Dual&#174;, Cotoran&#174; plus Roundup&#174;, and paraquat. Weeds evaluated were pigweed, 
cutleaf eveningprimrose, leafflower, crabgrass, and knotted spurge. </p>
<p>Results from these studies indicated that a contact herbicide could be used at the time of planting, 
but weed control was soon lost due to germinating seedlings. The most effective treatment for weed 
control was Cotoran plus Roundup, but some early-season crop injury was observed. Using Dual 
instead of Cotoran decreased injury but allowed pigweed escapes. Caparol plus Roundup or 
paraquat provided more consistent weed control while reducing crop injury. </p>

<p>A long-term (5-year) continuous cotton study was established in Oklahoma in 1990 by overseeding 
or transplanting johnsongrass, devil's-claw, silverleaf nightshade, annual morningglories, pigweed, 
large crabgrass, and Texas panicum. In 1991, cotton was planted and treatments, including three 
weed management levels and four nitrogen variables, were begun. Two sites were used for this 
research, an irrigated site near Altus and a dryland site near Chickasha. The weed management 
levels were low (cultivation only with no herbicides), medium (Treflan&#174;, Caparol&#174;, and 
cultivation), and high (Treflan&#174;, Caparol&#174;, Fusilade&#174; 2000, cultivation, and hoeing). The nitrogen 
variables included no nitrogen and three nitrogen sources and placements. A single nitrogen rate 
was used for all treatments including ammonium nitrate broadcast, injecting urea ammonium nitrate 
both with and without DCD (a nitrification inhibitor). Costs were recorded for variable inputs. 
Weed control and weed numbers and biomass was collected each year. Cotton was harvested, 
ginned, and graded each year. </p>
<p>If no herbicides were applied (low), johnsongrass became the predominant species at both 
locations. The application of Treflan&#174; and Caparol&#174; (medium) caused devil's-claw to be dominant 
at the dryland site and morningglory to be dominant at the irrigated site. All weeds were controlled 
with the high weed management treatments and none was allowed to produce seed. There were no 
differences among nitrogen sources (ammonium nitrate, urea ammonium nitrate, and urea 
ammonium nitrate plus DCD) or placement of nitrogen (broadcast vs. injected). For the first two 
years there was no response to nitrogen inputs because of the inherent high fertility at these two 
sites; however the last three years showed an increase in yield with nitrogen applications. Although 
the variable costs were the highest with the high weed management systems, the net income was the 
highest - making the high input system the most profitable. The bottom line - high weed 
management, including hoeing, coupled with the addition of nitrogen provided the most profitable 
cotton production system. The medium weed management system was profitable; however, the 
weed composition shifted from johnsongrass (low input) to broadleaf annual weeds (medium 
inputs). A continual decline in weed numbers was observed with the high weed management 
system. This decrease in weed numbers leads us to believe that future weed control costs might 
also show a decline making profitability in the future even greater. </p>

<p>The sporadic occurrence of insecticide resistance in the aphid populations has made effective 
control of this pest difficult. There is a need to be able to monitor the status of aphid populations 
and determine insecticide resistance prior to application. In recent years a petri dish bioassay has 
been developed which allows the monitoring of resistance to specific compounds. Although the 
assay is very useful it is relatively expensive and is labor intensive and therefore, does not lend itself 
well to routine screening of a large number of fields. The goal of this research is to determine if 
biochemical markers can be established that can be used in the field to detect resistant aphids. The 
biochemical marker tested in 1995 was carboxylesterase. Elevated levels of this enzyme have been 
correlated with resistance to a wide variety of insecticides in a number of insects including aphids. </p>
<p>Reference colonies of susceptible and Bidrin&#174; (dicrotophos) resistant aphids were maintained in 
the laboratory. Other aphids were collected and shipped overnight to the laboratory from four fields 
in southwestern Oklahoma where control failures were reported. Insecticides involved in these 
failures were Bidrin, Curacron&#174;, Lorsban&#174;, Fury&#174;, Karate&#174;, Scout&#174;, Lannate&#174; and Thiodan&#174;. 
Resistance to Lorsban and Lannate was confirmed with the petri dish bioassay. The activity of 
carboxylesterase in the aphids from the various sources was tested using two assay methods. In 
each, alpha-naphthyl acetate was used as the substrate. In the first method a stain was added to a 
solution containing aphid homogenates and the substrate, and the absorbance of the solution 
determined. In the second method filter paper strips are impregnated with the substrate and aphid 
homogenates and stain applied to the paper. Carboxylesterase activity is shown as a purple spot on 
a white background. </p>
<p>Assays using aphids from the laboratory colonies indicated that the assay worked well and would 
give dependable results. There was an increase of 2.5 to 3 times greater carboxylesterase activity in 
aphids from the dicrotophos resistant colony than in the aphids from the susceptible colony. The 
elevated carboxylesterase remained constant indicating that it was constitutive rather than induced 
by insecticide treatment. This is an important finding because it indicates that high carboxylesterase 
levels are present before insecticide application and may serve as an indicator of resistance. </p>
<p>The carboxylesterase activity in aphids collected from fields experiencing insecticide failures was at 
significantly higher levels than in aphids from the susceptible laboratory colony. Although there was 
considerable variation from field to field, this confirms that elevated carboxylesterase activity is 
associated with insecticide resistance and that this activity might predict insecticide resistance. </p>
<p>Samples of aphids were also tested from an untreated portion of a replicated insecticide study. 
Some aphid samples showed high esterase activity while other samples tested in the same range as 
the susceptible laboratory colony. This suggests that resistant and susceptible aphid populations 
may occur in a field. In plots where insecticide failures occurred esterase activity was high. </p>
<p>The filter paper assay was optimized to detect differences between the susceptible and resistant 
populations. Conditions were set up to give a very light yellow spot with the low esterase aphids 
and a purple spot with the high esterase aphids. It is rapid, requiring approximately 15 minutes to 
complete, and can be carried out under field conditions with reagents that could easily be 
incorporated into a test kit. Results are either positive or negative and require no interpretation. </p>

<p>Monitoring Cotton Bollworm, Tobacco Budworm and Boll Weevil Populations. Pheromone traps 
were established and maintained throughout the growing season to monitor cotton bollworm, 
tobacco budworm and boll weevil populations. Data was recorded weekly. A total of 207,706 
weevils were caught in 696 traps between May 1 and July 7, 1995. A total of 1,742 bollworm 
moths and 285 tobacco budworm moths were caught in Jackson and Tillman County between June 
1 and September 6, 1995. Seasonal trends of the cotton bollworm are given in Figure 1. </p>
<p>Figure 1. Cotton bollworm moth activity in Oklahoma </p>
<p>Impact of Boll Weevil Infestations on Dryland Production. The boll weevil eradication effort in 
central Texas stimulated the Rolling Plains Cotton Producers of Oklahoma to determine the 
economic impact of the boll weevil on dryland production. Eight fields were selected at random 
across the cotton producing region of southwest Oklahoma in the counties of Jackson, Caddo, 
Greer, McClain, Garvin, and Tillman. Each field was scouted weekly and sprayed if boll weevil 
infestations exceeded the economic threshold of 15 to 25% infested squares. A 20-row untreated 
check for comparison of economic returns from boll weevil management was established in each 
field. </p>
<p>Eight fields were scouted and sprayed to prevent insect loss in 1995. Fields averaged 3 
applications per season costing $21.58/acre. An average of 55 lb more lint per acre was realized 
while increasing net returns by $11.42/acre compared to the untreated check. </p>
<p>Analyzing monetary returns for boll weevil control in dryland cotton in Oklahoma between 1990 
and 1995, demonstrates that spraying is economical when decisions are based on weekly scouting 
and economic thresholds. Managed cotton fields averaged 3.6 insecticide applications during this 
5-year period with net gains of an average of 81.5 lb/acre or $18.96/acre. </p>

<p>The effect of early season flower bud damage caused primarily by <i>Heliothis virescens</i> (F.) on 
cotton, <i>Gossypium hirsutum L</i>., was determined at Florence and Blackville, South Carolina, from 
1989 to 1994. From 1989 to 1991, using the varieties Coker 315 and DP 90, yields from plots 
treated for <i>H. virescens</i> during June were compared with plots untreated during June. Damage was 
simulated in DP 90 and DES 119 by hand removal of 10 - 100% of flower buds for 1 - 4 
consecutive weeks during 1992 to 1994. In all cases from 1989 to 1991, no significant differences 
in yield were observed between treated and untreated plots at either location. In 1992, a 
comparison of plants with even the most severe removal (100% x 4 weeks) to those without 
removal, revealed no significant differences in crop maturity, yield, or lint quality. A one week delay 
in maturity was observed in cultivars DES 119 and DP 90 at both locations, following removals of 
100% for three and four week (1993), and at Blackville, following removals of 100% for 3 wk 
(1994). The only significant yield reductions occurred in DES 119 in 1993, but only in late-planted 
tests at both Florence (irrigated) and Blackville (irrigated and dry-land). No significant yield 
reductions were observed for any other conditions, and no differences in lint quality were observed 
for any conditions. Our data indicate that cotton compensates adequately for flower bud loss in 
June under most conditions in the Southeast and that insecticides for <i>H. virescens</i> are seldom 
needed in the early season. Opportunities to ameliorate traditional insecticide approaches for cotton 
insect management are discussed by considering our data in conjunction with the deployment of 
transgenic Bt cottons and the completion of the Boll Weevil Eradication Program in other areas of 
the cotton belt. </p>

<p>Objectives: 1. To measure glutathione synthetase activity in MSMA-treated and control plants of 
cotton and MSMA-resistant and-susceptible cocklebur plants; 2. To extract phytochelatins (PCS) 
in the presence of arsenic from treated and control cotton and both cocklebur biotypes; and 3. To 
study the effect of butathionine sulfoxime on enzyme activity and phytochelatin production. </p>
<p>Hypothesis: The resistance mechanism of MSMA in cocklebur is believed to be related to 
production of heavy-metal-binding proteins (phytochelatins). </p>
<p>Resistant and susceptible cocklebur seeds were collected from treated and non-treated plants. 
Seeds were removed from burs when needed, disinfected and germinated aseptically for tissue 
culture. Other seeds were germinated to provide plant material for enzyme analysis. As observed 
earlier, seedlings of MSMA-resistant plants had less vigor and root production. </p>
<p>A procedure for the assay of glutathione synthetase has been established. The enzyme catalyzes the 
conversion of glutamyl-cysteine and glycine to glutamyl-cysteine-glycine (glutathione). The 
procedure involves extraction, derivitization, and the addition of a fluorescent marker for detection 
of the thiol group on the peptide. Detection and analysis is via High Performance Liquid 
Chromatography (HPLC). To date, low levels of enzyme activity have been detected; however, 
activity levels were too low to distinguish between biotypes. Enzyme activity in extracts from cotton 
were also low. We have included tobacco as a reference material because it is known to contain 
detectable levels of glutathione synthetase activity. Levels in tobacco were comparable to those of 
cotton and the cocklebur biotypes. </p>
<p>In an effort to enhance enzyme levels, both biotypes of cocklebur and cotton were challenged with 
1600 ppm MSMA for 5 days. We also initiated callus from both cocklebur biotypes and 
challenged this tissue with 6.25 mg/l MSMA for 10 days. Extracts have been prepared from 
challenged plant and callus tissue and are pending analysis at this time. An HPLC protocol for 
phytochelatin analysis has been identified. Tissue extracts have been prepared and stored at -80&#176; C 
until analysis. </p>
<p>Future efforts include performing analysis of plant and callus extracts for glutathione synthetase 
activity and phytochelatin content. We are also saving some of the protein extracted for future 
isoenzyme analysis. Our thinking is that we are not as yet detecting large differences between 
cocklebur biotypes in the parameters measured. Perhaps isoenzyme analysis would provide a lead. </p>

<p>Arsenical-resistant common cocklebur has been documented in several Southeastern areas 
including West Tennessee. Reports also indicate that it is likely present in most of the areas that 
have a history of repeated MSMA/DSMA use. The objectives of this project have focused on the 
development of strategies to control cocklebur and other troublesome broad-leaf weeds in cotton. 
Fortunately, new herbicides, Staple&#174; and Buctril&#174;, promise to provide needed control. 
Experiments conducted at Milan (no-till) and at Jackson (conventional till) evaluated some 
programs for broad-leaf weed control in cotton. These experiments confirmed the weakness of 
DSMA on velvetleaf and pigweed. </p>
<p>Use of post emergence and post-directed treatments with pre-emergence treatments doubled the 
lint yield compared with the yield with pre-emergence treatments alone. To maintain cocklebur 
control in the weed-free check, 152 hours per acre of hoe-time were necessary to produce 1277 
pounds of lint per acre. At $4.50 per hour, this would cost $648 per acre. Ten of thirteen herbicide 
programs produced similar yields at total costs of less than $70 per acre. There was little advantage 
to pre-emergence treatments when followed by effective post and post-directed treatments, except 
that they provide a wider window of application for post herbicides treatments. Broad-leaf weed 
control with both Buctril and Staple benefit from a sequential post-directed treatment. </p>

<p>The Ag In The Classroom program is administered by staff from the Tennessee Farm Bureau in 
cooperation with other Tennessee Agriculture organizations, agencies and individuals. Ninety-five 
percent of local contacts with school administrators and teachers are initiated and conducted by 
former volunteers. Consultants are utilized in urban areas with few farmers and half of Tennessee's 
student population. </p>
<p>Priority Program Activities for the Tennessee Foundation For Agriculture In The Classroom 
(A.I.T.C.) are: </p>
<ol>
<li>Teacher Training </li>
<li>Distribution of Teacher Curriculum Enrichment Resource Materials </li>
<li>Direct communication with teachers through a Teacher Ambassador Network </li>
<li>Direct communication with students and parents through local farm tours </li>
<li>Grants to schools for &quot;Agricultural&quot; Outdoor Classroom </li>
</ol>
<p>Over 1,100 teachers have received training in 1995 at 60 local workshops. One hundred and 
sixty-eight teachers received instruction as &quot;Ag In The Classroom Trainers&quot; at workshops at six 
state universities. </p>
<p>Twenty-two hundred copies of the K-4 curriculum, &quot;Plant A Seed In Tennessee&quot; (includes units on 
cotton for second and fourth grade) were distributed along with 2,100 additional resource units, 
including the National Cotton Council's &quot;Story of Cotton&quot; kit. </p>
<p>Over 150 schools have designated teachers as Agriculture Ambassadors. Resource packets and 
information about farm tours, teacher training, etc., are sent to Ambassadors six times a year. Barn 
Box Resource libraries have been placed in 75 urban schools during 1995. The &quot;Story of Cotton&quot; 
kit and videos are included in these &quot;Libraries&quot;. </p>
<p>Forty-three counties conducted farm tours for over 38,000 children, teachers, and parents. Twelve 
local schools received grants for Outdoor Agricultural Classroom experiments. </p>

<p>Effects of tillage practices and application of a growth regulator on cotton physiological properties 
and yield were evaluated in a three-year study, 1993-1995. Tillage practices included no-till and 
conventional seedbed preparation with three levels of post emergence cultivation (single, double, 
and triple) employed during the production season. DPL-20 variety was grown in West Tennessee 
using 30-inch row spacing. Yield performance was shown to be affected by tillage system. In 
particular, conventionally prepared seedbeds with post emergence cultivation resulted in 
significantly higher yields than no-tillage planting. However, the number of post emergence 
cultivations, either one, two, or three, was not a significant factor in predicting yield of the plots with 
conventionally prepared seedbeds. The effect of tillage treatment was generally consistent, in that in 
only one year was tillage treatment not shown to be a significant factor in predicting yield. </p>
<p>Application of the growth regulator, Pix&#174;, had no significant effect upon mean crop yield over the 
three years. Only in 1995, did Pix result in a significant yield advantage. The 1995 yield advantage 
associated with Pix corresponded to greater numbers of green bolls observed on Pix-treated 
plants. </p>
<p>Physiological development of cotton produced using no-till was similar to that of cotton planted in 
conventionally prepared seedbeds. In particular, activity at fruiting sites as indicated by frequency 
counts of squares, aborts, green bolls, and open bolls over the growing season were similar 
regardless of tillage treatment. Further, tillage treatment did not have a discernible effect upon the 
maximum number of nodes, plant height, or main stem diameter. </p>
<p>Sequential applications of Pix were effective in controlling vegetative growth as indicted by plant 
height. For instance, Pix-treated plants were, on the average, about five inches shorter than 
untreated plants at harvest maturity in 1995. Plant maturity or earliness as indicated by the 
percentage of the total crop collected during the first picking was not affected by either tillage 
treatment or application of the growth regulator. </p>

<p>The increase in levels of pyrethroid resistance in tobacco budworm populations in states south of 
Tennessee, the potential for development of resistance in Tennessee and the heavy population 
pressure experienced in 1995 mandate continued evaluation of recommended and experimental 
treatments for suppression of tobacco budworm. An experiment to evaluate such treatments was 
established at the Ames Plantation near Grand Junction. Pretreatment counts of eggs, larvae and 
damaged squares per 100 terminals was 35, 30 and 35, respectively. Four applications of 
insecticide treatments were made to the test plots. Efficacy data were collected 3-5 days after 
treatment. No significant egg or larval differences were noted among treatments. Square damage on 
August 14 was reduced by treatments of Orthene&#174; 90S (1 lb ai/acre) + Danitol&#174; 2.4EC (0.3 lb 
ai/acre), Larvin&#174; 3.2EC (0.75 lb ai/ac), Larvin + Danitol and Tracer&#174; 4SC (spinosad; 0.0625 lb 
ai/acre) compared to the untreated check. Although all treatments provided first harvest yields 
greater than the untreated, Tracer was superior to all. Total lint yield was also highest from the 
Tracer-treated plot and all treated plots yielded more than the untreated plot. </p>
<p>The rapid registration and introduction of Provado&#174; (imidacloprid) into the cotton market 
prompted an investigation of its ability to deter plant bug feeding and subsequent square shed. An 
experiment was designed to test the use of this novel insecticide as a preventive treatment. 
Broadleaf mustard, an excellent early-season host of plant bug, was planted in strips between which 
eight rows of cotton were later planted. Prior to and during squaring, one to three applications of 
Provado 1.6EC (0.047 lb ai/acre) were made to accumulate the insecticide in the plant in order to 
prevent feeding and square loss. After the third application, the mustard was cut, forcing the plant 
bugs to migrate into the cotton. Conventional insecticide treatments were also applied for 
comparison. Plants were mapped to determine square retention. </p>
<p>No significant differences in square retention were measured among treatments for three mapping 
dates. First harvest, second harvest and total lint yields did not differ among insecticide treatments 
and none of the treatments differed from the untreated check. The utilization of Provado as a 
preventive treatment will require further testing. </p>

<p>Cotton Seedling Disease Nursery. The goal of this project is two-fold: first, to evaluate the most 
promising technology and accepted recommendations in producer fields using producer methods 
and machinery; and second, to provide an opportunity for producers, extension agents and 
company representatives to observe first hand the benefits of seedling disease control methods. </p>
<p>Over forty seedling disease control treatments in six different tests were planted in a producer's field 
in Madison county in side-by-side comparisons using many recommended and some promising 
in-furrow fungicides. </p>
<p>In test COT-01, an in-furrow spray treatment of Ridomil&#174; 2E at 4 oz/acre plus Terraclor&#174; 2E at 
64 oz/acre led the test with significantly higher final plant stand than any other treatment. In test 
COT-02, Rovral&#174; 4 SC at 0.2 lb ai/acre plus Ridomil 2 EC at 0.125 lb ai/acre tied with Start&#174; 60 
WG at 0.45 lb ai/acre for the best final stand count. In test COT-03, Rovral 4F at 6.4 fl. oz/acre 
led the test but was not significantly better than any of the other treatments except Delta-Coat&#174; AD 
which was lower than the untreated. </p>
<p>In test COT-04, a new formulation of Tetrachlor Super-X&#174; (TSX 18.8G) was found to have the 
highest stand count. This will be a new recommendation for this formulation. In test COT-05, 
Terraclor (PCNB) and Vitavax&#174; (both are Rhizoctonia fighters) were applied in combination. At 
the 14.29 oz/acre rate, the combination was found to be significantly better (stand count) than 
Terraclor Flowable at 24 oz/acre. In test COT-06, TSX-EC at 48 oz/acre had the highest stand 
count when compared to similar liquids and was significantly better than the untreated. </p>
<p>The most important message that producers find helpful from this project is that in-furrow 
applications of fungicides, especially liquid sprays, can increase the stand by as much as 25% to 
53%. In times when earliness is a big factor and seed may be at an all time high in cost to the 
producer, getting and keeping a good, healthy, early stand will be more important then ever. 
Producers can profit greatly from the use of an in-furrow fungicide in areas of the Cotton Belt 
where seedling diseases are a constant threat. In a five-year average, research has shown that $150 
per acre can be saved by using in-furrow fungicides at planting time in Tennessee. </p>
<p>Leaf Spot Control with Foliar Applied KN0<font size=1>3</font> and Soil Applied KCl and Fungicides: The late 
season leaf spot complex is widespread in many cotton growing counties of Tennessee especially 
where the soil is low in extractable potassium (K). This disease is causing premature defoliation and 
possible yield loss. Results show that fungicides alone only slightly reduced the leaf spot rating, 
while foliar applied K alone was only slightly better. However, soil applied K was significantly 
better in leaf spot ratings as well as increased yields. The highest yields were obtained from a 
combination treatment of foliar fungicide plus soil applied K, plus foliar applied K. Producers are 
encouraged to sample their cotton land and to be sure to bring their soil up to a high level of K. 
Although foliar applied K can help, soil application is more effective. The use of fungicides to 
control late season leaf spot diseases is not very effective and should be discouraged. </p>

<p>Tennessee cotton producers and consultants are participating in an intensive boll weevil pheromone 
trapping program being coordinated by The University of Tennessee Agricultural Extension Service. 
The objective of this program is to better define the distribution and density of overwintered boll 
weevil populations in West Tennessee. Information gained will aid in the development of area-wide 
boll weevil management or eradication programs. The second year of a three year program was 
completed in 1995. An additional objective of the 1995 program was to establish emergence 
curves for overwintered boll weevils. </p>
<p>Cooperators placed boll weevil pheromone traps around cotton fields in mid-May and monitored 
trap captures every two weeks until cotton fruiting. Trap captures were summarized for 25 square 
mile sections and illustrated on a color coded map using a geographic information system. 
Emergence curves were established by weekly monitoring traps which were placed around fields 
planted to cotton in 1994 and rotated to another crop in 1995. </p>
<p>Early season boll weevil populations were significantly higher in 1995 compared with 1994. 
Pheromone trap captures in excess of 50 boll weevils per two weeks were common in most areas 
of West Tennessee during 1995. As observed in 1994, the southern-most counties tended to have 
higher boll weevil populations during 1995. Differences observed in boll weevil captures were 
generally 100 percent greater in 1995 compared with 1994. Such information demonstrates the 
importance of annually monitoring overwintered boll weevil populations with pheromone traps. </p>
<p>Overwintered boll weevil emergence curves were generated in six counties. Peak emergence 
occurred in mid-May and 95 percent of diapausing boll weevils had emerged by late June. The 
early emergence in 1995 allowed producers to efficiently manage boll weevils with well timed 
match-head square sprays. </p>

<p>Field tests conducted in the fall of 1995 demonstrated the importance of proper placement and 
maintenance of Boll Weevil Attract and Control Tube (BWACT) installations. BWACTs which 
had been coated with Stickem, a glue-like gel, were used to capture boll weevils attracted to 
selected installations of BWACTs placed along the perimeter of cotton fields. </p>
<p>BWACTs placed in weed-free areas attracted numerically greater boll weevils compared with 
BWACTs placed where excessive vegetation was present. Placement of BWACTs under tree 
limbs attracted significantly fewer boll weevils compared with placements in open areas. Nearly 
three-fourths of all boll weevils captured on BWACTs placed in preferred locations were on the 
bottom half of the tube. Placement of BWACTs in fences (30&quot; above the ground) attracted 
significantly fewer boll weevils compared with recommended placement on the ground. </p>
<p>Field demonstrations were conducted at three locations to evaluate the efficacy of BWACTs in boll 
weevil management programs. Only one replication of these tests was valid due to numerous 
pyrethroid oversprays for tobacco budworm during July and conclusions could not be drawn. </p>

<p>Objectives: (1) Present new and innovative research findings plus information of special interest to 
Tennessee cotton producers at the Annual Cotton Focus Conference. (2) Conduct field 
demonstrations with new varieties and with weed, insect and disease control technologies. (3) 
Conduct additional grower meetings for specials needs. </p>
<p>The 1995 Cotton Focus Conference was attended by 235 producers and about 65 
University/Cotton Industry Representatives (Extension, Research, Seed and Chemical Company 
Personnel). There were over 160,000 acres of cotton represented by producers attending this 
conference. </p>
<p>Attendees received copies of the speakers presentations and cotton production recommendations 
from the University of Tennessee Agricultural Extension Service. Also, a program of activities was 
produced and distributed through each county Extension office prior to the conference. A complete 
list of sponsors was announced. Producers appreciated the annual sponsorship by Cotton 
Incorporated and the State Support Committee. </p>
<p>The Mississippi River flooded about 35,000 acres of cotton in four Tennessee counties in June. A 
meeting was held in each county advising producers of options they had for replanting to other 
crops in 1995. About 200 producers, bankers and media attended this series of meetings. </p>
<p>A Madison County producer requested help with Arsenical-resistant cockleburs in 1995. A 
demonstration using BXN&#174; cotton varieties and Buctril&#174; and Staple&#174; herbicides was done. The 
cockleburs were controlled almost 100%. Fifty-eight county Extension agents, chemical and seed 
representatives attended a tour of this demonstration. </p>
<p>Chemical reference materials dealing with insect and disease control were purchased for use in each 
county producing cotton. This will aid Extension agents dealing with problems that face cotton 
producers. </p>

<p>Eleven experiments were conducted at three locations in West Tennessee to evaluate the efficacy 
and yield performance of available transgenic Bt cottons. Transgenic cotton seed was obtained 
from Monsanto, Jacob Hartz Seed Co. and Calgene. The seed from Monsanto included 
NUCOTN 33<sup>B</sup>, DP5415, an unnamed line with the Bollgard gene and its non-transgenic parent. 
Twelve lines from Hartz included varieties H1215, H1220, H1244, H1330, H1380 and H1560 
with and without Bollgard. Seed from Stoneville/Calgene included a Bt/BXN line and its Coker 
130 parent. Boll weevil populations were light at Milan, intermediate at Jackson and heavier at the 
Ames Plantation. Bollworm/tobacco budworm populations were light at Milan, moderate at 
Jackson and heavy at the Ames Plantation. </p>
<p>At Jackson and Milan there were no yield differences among sprayed and unsprayed conventional 
and unnamed Bollgard cottons. At Grand Junction, sprayed Bollgard yielded more than the sprayed 
conventional cotton which did not differ from the unsprayed Bollgard cotton. At Grand Junction, 
where tobacco budworm pressure was heavy, yield of the unsprayed Bt/BXN cotton was equal to 
the sprayed conventional cotton. At the other locations, the conventional cotton yielded more than 
the Bt/BXN line. NUCOTN 33<sup>B</sup> planted April 26 and May 9 at Jackson yielded more than 
sprayed DP5415 planted the same two dates. NUCOTN 33<sup>B</sup> planted May 22 yielded 50 percent 
of the two early planting dates and almost twice as much as the sprayed DP5415 planted late. At 
Grand Junction, NUCOTN 33<sup>B</sup> planted April 27, May 11 or May 23 yielded as much as the 
sprayed DP5415. DP5415 planted May 11 yielded as much as NUCOTN 33<sup>B</sup> planted May 11 or 
May 23. Yield of DP5415 planted May 23 was approximately 70 percent of all other yields. 
Under the sprayed conditions of a standard variety test and light to moderate bollworm/tobacco 
budworm pressure, Hartz lines with the Bollgard gene produced similar to better yields than the 
parent lines. Under heavy pressure, Bollgard lines yielded more than their non-tranagenic parents. </p>
<p>The development of transgenic cotton containing the Bt endotoxin which effectively controls 
bollworm, tobacco budworm and the pink bollworm, presents an exciting option to cotton 
producers plagued with resistant and hard-to-control tobacco budworms. Utilization of this 
technology in Tennessee will depend on several factors including 1) the incidence of tobacco 
budworm in an historically bollworm prevalent area, 2) any shift in Heliothine populations from 
bollworm to tobacco budworm, 3) an increase in the level of insecticide resistance in tobacco 
budworm populations, 4) the abundance of Heliothine species a grower routinely experiences each 
year, 5) the cost of this technology, and 6) the availability of adapted varieties possessing this 
technology. </p>

<p>A yield-mapping system for cotton fields is being developed to document infield yield variability on 
a production-field scale. This project encompasses the interfacing of a Global Positioning System 
(GPS) with a prototype seedcotton flow sensor and an instrumented cotton weighing device on a 
spindle picker. During the 1995 harvest, two production cotton fields were mapped for yield 
variability. Results from this study will provide valuable inputs into the feasibility of precision cotton 
farming in the future. Cotton yield sensors in conjunction with GPS are necessary technologies to 
take precision farming in cotton from a concept to a reality. </p>
<p>In 1993, the United States had 13.4 million acres of farm land in cotton production averaging 606 
pounds per acre (approximately 1.26 bales/acre) with a net value of $4.5 billion (USDA, 1994). 
However, with the best management practices employed by cotton farmers today, crop yields vary 
widely between fields and within fields (Reichenberger and Russnogle, 1989). For a given field, 
many sources of variability affect yield. Some of the sources of spatial variability commonly found 
within a field include soil type, soil moisture, pH, fertility levels (N,P,K), organic matter, weed 
pressure, insect pressures, and wildlife damage. In many instances, there is as much variability 
within fields as between fields. It is common for one field to have several soil types with varying 
yield potentials. In other words, not every spot in the field has the same potential to produce a 
cotton crop given the same inputs. However, the common practice has been to farm a field on its 
average needs by treating the entire field as though input requirements were uniformly required. </p>
<p>Applying fertilizers and chemicals based on field averages results in overapplication in some areas 
and underapplication in other areas of the field (Russnogle, 1991). Costs associated with this 
variability have both economic and environmental dimensions. By addressing the fertility and 
chemical needs of small areas within a field, prescription application of fertilizers and chemicals can 
be practiced on a variable-rate basis. This approach has the potential to help address the inherent 
spatial variability concerns that are encountered within cotton fields. By knowing the areas of the 
field that consistently produce the highest and lowest yields, inputs such as fertilizers, herbicides, 
and growth regulators can be varied to potentially maximize production efficiency while minimizing 
the negative environmental impact. </p>

<p>The objective of this project was to develop best management practices for controlling seedling 
diseases of cotton. The factors being examined included: </p>
<ol>
<li>clean tillage versus terminated wheat </li>
<li>low, moderate and high quality seed </li>
<li>chemical seed treatments (Captan&#174;, Apron&#174;, Vitavax&#174;-PCNB, and Baytan&#174; 30) </li>
</ol>
<p>Tests were established at sites in the Texas counties of Lynn, Hockley and Swisher to evaluate 
seed treatments in relation to seed quality. In those tests seed treatment had no effect on emergence 
with high quality seed, it was either all poor or all good depending on the site. But, seed treatments 
did impact the health of the roots. In two of the sites where black root rot (<i>Thielaviopsis basicola</i>) 
caused significant damage to roots (Swisher and Lynn counties) seeds treated with Baytan 30 had 
less damage than those that were not treated. However, in the Swisher county site there was still 
greater than 70% of the roots with damage even with the best seed treatment. There was some 
pressure from <i>Rhizoctonia solani</i> in the Hockley county site. In this case, treatments with activity 
against the pathogen (Baytan 30 and Vitavax-PCNB) had less root damage than treatments with no 
activity. Yields were not different between the different seed treatments in either Hockley or Lynn 
counties. The test in Swisher county did not survive the seedling stage. </p>
<p>At Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in Lubbock seed quality (low, medium, and high) was 
examined across two tillage systems and the six seed treatments. Emergence in the black seed, 
Captan alone, and Captan + Apron treatments was higher at 7 days compared with Captan + 
Apron + Baytan 30 when averaged across the two tillage systems and three seed qualities. 
However, by 28 days after planting, emergence was higher in the Captan + Baytan 30 and Captan 
+ Apron + Vitavax-PCNB treatments when compared with the Captan alone or black seed 
treatments. </p>
<p>Emergence was affected by both seed quality and tillage system. Initially, emergence was higher in 
clean tillage systems over terminated wheat (across all seed quality levels) but by day 21 emergence 
was similar between tillage systems for both moderate and high quality seed. On day 28 emergence 
was higher for terminated wheat than clean tillage in the high quality seed plots. There was no 
difference in emergence with moderate quality seed in both tillage systems. However, higher 
emergence did occur when low quality seeds were planted in a clean tillage system rather than in 
terminated wheat. </p>
<p>The difference in these results (i.e., terminated wheat favoring emergence in high quality seed and 
clean tillage favoring emergence in low quality seed) could be the result of two factors: disease 
caused by <i>R. solani</i> and wind stress. In low quality seed plants were more affected by seedling 
disease than in high quality seed, so the residue left by the terminated wheat caused an additional 
increase in seedling disease. However, there was very little disease in the high quality seed and the 
terminated wheat acted as a wind break. Yields were primarily affected by seed quality (higher 
yields with higher quality) and tillage (higher yields with clean tillage than with terminated wheat). </p>

<p>Operation of the Daily Price Estimation System (DPES) continued. DPES estimates and daily 
reports were completed for the remainder of the 1994 crop and initiated for the 1995 crop. 
Diagnostics on accuracy were conducted and a report of the 1994 crop prices was written. Four 
proceedings papers, two other presentations, three journal articles, and several press stories were 
published from the research. </p>
<p>Minor revisions in the econometric model for the system were made and the capacity to process 
sales data from anywhere in the U.S. was introduced to the system. One additional electronic spot 
market, Satellite Cotton Exchange, was added to the list of data sources for analyzing the price 
structures. Weekly price summaries, including a crop year-to-date graph of daily price movements 
for base quality have been added to the system. Comparisons with the Daily Spot Cotton 
Quotations continue. DPES results have also been combined with a study of the structure of prices 
and quality premiums and discounts paid by U.S. textile manufacturers to show the similarities and 
differences between mill prices paid and producer prices received in the Southwest region. </p>

<p>The first portion of this study was completed in Southern Rolling Plains in 1993. Low aphid 
numbers in the Lubbock area in 1993 and 1994 prevented successful completion of the economic 
threshold part of this project until this year. Two test locations, each involving 48 plots with different 
aphid infestation levels were established. The aphid infestation was induced with two pyrethroid 
insecticide applications. Aphid counts were made every 3-5 days before and after infestations were 
removed once numbers reached predetermined levels. Plants were mapped on two occasions and 
stratified yield samples and composite yield samples taken at the end of the trials. Measurements to 
also be included are boll number per sample, lint weight, seed weight, seed number and fiber 
number per seed as well as the various fiber quality parameters. </p>
<p>Analysis of the data is pending the samples being ginned and fiber quality analysis. </p>
<p>I am optimistic that the study findings will shed some light on the economic threshold issue of aphids 
in blooming cotton and to clarify the factor(s) responsible for yield losses. </p>

<p>The objective of this project is to develop an integrated management system for cotton production 
across the state of Texas. Validation of the ICEMM cotton model developed by Dr. Landivar and 
co-workers at the Texas A&amp;M University Agricultural Research and Extension Center at Corpus 
Christi, Texas, is the major emphasis of this project. This model was developed under a dryland 
scenario and requires some modification to fit the arid, irrigated conditions in west Texas. However, 
when ICEMM is calibrated across this wide range of conditions it can provide producers across 
the state with an assessment of their cotton crop at any time during the growing season. It also 
allows various inputs such as irrigation amounts and/or dates (timing) and fertilization to be 
projected for the remainder of the season under various weather patterns. </p>
<p>The 1995 growing season was utilized to determine varietal differences due to irrigation amounts 
and frequency, and to irrigation-water salinity levels. Three irrigation amounts (24, 30, and 37 
inches) were applied to five varieties of cotton (DPL-50, DPL-90, DPL-5690, Hyperformer 
HS-44, and Paymaster HS-26). These represent common varieties for several areas of the state. </p>
<p>Comparisons were made between in-season daily drip irrigated blocks of DPL-90 and furrow 
irrigated plots on a ten-day schedule to establish if modifications in the soil files of the model are 
needed. This would be to compensate for soil hydraulic conductivity where higher evaporative 
demands exist at Pecos as compared to the Costal Bend. </p>
<p>To establish the effect of water-salinity levels, DPL-90 was produced with four treatments of saline, 
irrigation water (1,000, 3,000, 6,000, and 9,000 ppm total salts). Plant mapping was conducted on 
treatments during the growing season. Yield and lint quality data were also collected. All data 
collected are being sent to Landivar's group at the Corpus Christi center to test the ICEMM model 
and make necessary modifications for the 1996 growing season. </p>

<p>A total of 109 new, MAR-7, hybrid pool strains, divided into two groups -- Mar-7A and 
MAR-7B, that were identified and selected in 1992 to 1994, were extensively tested in 1995. 
These strains were included in the four-stage MAR field testing at ten locations throughout Texas. 
The field tests were the Early Field Planting test (EFP) at four locations, and the Strains test and 
Uniform MAR test (UMAR) at 10 locations. Five of the locations are irrigated and five are dryland 
production. Data were collected on agronomic traits, drought tolerance, resistance to insects and 
diseases, lint yields, earliness, and fiber quality traits. Also, a water stress test was conducted at 
College Station under well irrigated and non-irrigated/dryland treatments, and a dryland production 
test was conducted at Chillicothe. </p>
<p>We continue to improve fiber quality traits in the new MAR-7 cottons. The range in fiber length is 
1.10 to 1.25 inches, uniformity 83.3 to 86.5, strength 28.5 to 34.2 g/tex, elongation 5.5 to 6.8, 
micronaire 4.1 to 4.8, maturity 90.6 to 95.1, and fineness 159 to 178 militex. Five MAR-7A 
strains performed exceptionally well, especially CDRCIQCUBH-2-92, in both rotor and ring 
spinning tests. In the water stress test at College Station, a 40% yield reduction was obtained in 
non-irrigated compared to the irrigated treatment. Averaged over both treatments, five MAR-7A 
strains and Tamcot Sphinx were highly productive under both treatments. In a dryland test at 
Chllicothe, lint yield ranged from 307 to 709 lb/acre with a 479 lb test mean. Several MAR-7 
strains were identified to be tolerant to drought and have high water use efficiency. </p>
<p>Tamcot Sphinx foundation seed was planted by 10 commercial seed companies. Certified seed is 
available to growers to plant approximately 40,000 acres in 1996. Production fields of Tamcot 
Sphinx, about 1,400 acres, demonstrated its superior performance in yield potential, drought 
tolerance, improved fiber quality (especially strength), rotor and ring spinning performance, levels of 
resistance to insects and diseases, and stability over environments. </p>
<p>Average lint yield for MAR-7A strains over nine UMAR tests was 592 lb/acre, with a range among 
locations from 279 lb/acre for McGregor to 926 lb/acre for the Brazos Valley test. In the EFP tests 
averaged over four locations, yield for the MAR-7B strains ranged from 427 lb/acre at College 
Station to 739 lb/acre at the Corpus Christi dry-land test, with a mean of 636 lb/acre. Tamcot 
Sphinx and the MAR-7 releases will sustain maximum profits to growers and will greatly benefit the 
Texas and USA cotton industry. </p>

<p>Nutrient management for cotton should provide maximum economic yields for producers with the 
least environmental impact. Growers benefit from the information obtained from petiole tests. A 
sound, basic soil fertility program combined with petiole analyses should provide a means to limit 
excess fertilizer inputs while obtaining maximum economic yield. </p>
<p>Field demonstrations were set up to determine how well current petiole recommendations apply to 
growers in the Texas Coastal Plain. Dryland and irrigated plots were located in cooperating 
farmers' fields in Wharton County and surrounding counties in 1993, 1994, and 1995 to obtain 
data over a range of environmental conditions found in the Texas Coastal Plain. Treatments in 
grower fields were: no supplemental fertilizer applied and supplemental fertilizer applied as 
recommended by the petiole test. Plots were 16 to 24 rows wide. Nutrient recommendations are 
based upon levels of No<sub><font size=1>3</font></sub>N, P and K found in the cotton petioles brought in weekly for testing, on 
the fertilizer history of the crop and on recent insect and soil moisture conditions. (The criteria used 
to make recommendations are those that were developed and are currently being used at the 
University of Arkansas). </p>
<p>Foliar application of nitrogen on fields determined to be deficient in nitrate-nitrogen resulted in 
increased petiole nitrate-N concentration the following week. While petiole nitrate nitrogen 
responded to foliar nitrogen application, a yield response was obtained in only two of the five field 
demonstrations. This indicates that further tests are needed to determine any adjustments in 
recommendations that may be needed. </p>

<p>The cotton fleahopper and tarnished plant bug are important pests of cotton in central Texas and 
other cotton growing regions. Insecticides applied for the control of these pests can destroy 
beneficial insects which can be followed by outbreaks of bollworms and budworms, cotton aphids, 
spider mites, and other pests. Several new insecticides are under development that have less impact 
on beneficial insects than many conventional cotton insecticides. Two of these, Regent&#174; (fipronil) 
and Provado&#174; (imidacloprid), have activity against fleahoppers and tarnished plant bugs. The 
efficacy of these insecticides for control of plant bugs and their impact on beneficial insects was 
measured in replicated field plots. At the rates used in these tests (Regent 80 WDG at 0.025 lb 
ai/acre and Provado 1.6F at 0.22 lb ai/acre), Regent provided good control of both species of 
plant bugs while control by Provado was more variable. Densities of lady beetles and pirate bugs 
were significantly greater in cotton treated with Regent and Provado than in cotton treated with 
Vydate&#174; 3.77L (0.25 lb ai/acre), Orthene&#174; 90S (0.5 lb ai/acre) or Asana&#174; XL (0.66 lb ai/acre). 
Beating single plants into a white, five-gallon plastic pail was an effective method for sampling 
tarnished plant bug adults and nymphs as sweeping with a standard 15 inch insect sweep net. </p>

<p>The 1995 cotton season in South Texas was a disaster with 80-85 percent loss of expected yield 
for the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The yield loss was attributed to heavy aphid infestations, an 
area-wide outbreak of beet armyworm which growers were not able to control, and extremely 
heavy rains just prior to harvest when most of the cotton was open. </p>
<p>The Weslaco performance trials for Dr. C. Wayne Smith and Dr. Kamal El-Zik (cooperators of the 
project) were satisfactorily completed. The results of these tests will be reported by Dr. Smith and 
Dr. El-Zik. </p>
<p>The Weslaco, Texas, cotton breeding program is progressing on schedule. The 1994 season with 
heavy whitefly infestations and the 1995 season with heavy aphid and beet armyworm infestations 
have allowed us to identify a number of cotton cultivars that performed reasonable well under 
severe stress conditions. </p>
<p>The major accomplishments of the Weslaco breeding program are reflected in three germplasm 
releases in 1995. The first accomplishment was the release and registration of three parental 
restorer lines of cotton which possess a strong fertility useful in producing hybrid cottonseed. The 
three lines are glabrous, a trait that reduces fiber trash content and imparts some resistance to the 
bollworm/budworm complex and sweetpotato whitefly. </p>
<p>The second accomplishment was a release of four upland cotton germplasm lines that possess 
significant resistance to reniform and/or southern root-knot nematodes. These four germplasm lines 
should be useful to other cotton breeders due to their combination of reniform and/or root-knot 
nematode resistance and high yield potential. </p>
<p>The third accomplishment was the release of an additional four upland cotton germplasm lines 
which are highly tolerant to reniform nematodes and/or bacterial blight. These four germplasm lines 
should also be useful to other cotton breeders due to their tolerances to reniform nematodes, high 
yield potential, earliness and adaptability to the Lower Rio Grande Valley and Coastal Bend areas 
of Texas. </p>

<p>Education is a key component of successfully passing eradication referenda, keeping growers 
aware of progress of eradication programs and explaining the program to producers, landowners, 
rural and urban audiences. Previous funding from the State Support Committee allowed us to 
develop fact sheets, a slide-tape set and a brochure on boll weevil eradication and to conduct a 
number of grower meetings. These resources continue to be valuable to educational programs. </p>
<p>The objective of this project was to continue to develop comprehensive educational programs at 
the request of the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation. </p>
<p>Educational efforts conducted as a result of this project included 78 producer meetings, 10 crop 
tours and 4 pesticide applicator training CEU programs where eradication was discussed. Also, 50 
newsletters were prepared and sent directly to Texas producers and landowners in various parts of 
the state. A total of 8,210 producers and landowners were directly contacted through 
Extension-sponsored events. Additionally, 18 newspaper and magazine articles on eradication were 
developed by Extension personnel and thousands of telephone calls, office conferences, radio 
programs, TV and newspaper interviews were handled. Numerous on-farm demonstrations were 
conducted to monitor boll weevil populations to obtain baseline data and to evaluate ongoing 
eradication programs. </p>
<p>A 21 minute video entitled &quot;Boll Weevil Eradication-A New Era in Texas Agriculture&quot; was 
developed. This video discusses the history of eradication, guides the viewer through the various 
components and tactics used in eradication and stresses the economic and environmental aspects of 
eradication. It also discusses potential secondary pest problems which can occur. </p>
<p>We have distributed 64 copies of the video to key cotton commodity groups, the Texas Boll

<p>Cotton Producers throughout the Rolling Plains of Texas have suffered tremendous economic 
losses from boll weevil infestations for many years. Attempts to control weevils have been futile and 
have put many farmers in an unprofitable position. Therefore, many producers have shown an 
interest in the possibility of eradicating the boll weevil through a cooperative effort, as has been 
done in other areas. The objectives of this project were to obtain grower input and disseminate 
information on boll weevil eradication through meetings and print material and to provide input and 
assistance to the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation (TBWEF). </p>
<p>Through this project, Rolling Plains Cotton Growers, Inc. (RPCG) has been able to identify the 
needs and concerns of farmers growing cotton in the Rolling Plains. We have communicated these 
needs and concerns to the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation. We have also worked with 
the Foundation to design programs of eradication suitable for the Rolling Plains. </p>
<p>This project has been extremely beneficial in helping producers throughout this region be informed 
about all aspects of eradication programs and planning. This has been especially beneficial during 
the time when all difficulties were being attributed by a misinformed press to the eradication 
programs. Producers throughout the Rolling Plains of Oklahoma and Texas continue to exhibit the 
desire to develop boll weevil control or eradication programs for their area. The result has been the 
overwhelming approval of initiating an eradication program in the Central Rolling Plains. Also, 
producers in the Northern Rolling Plains are much more informed about possible boll weevil control 
or eradication efforts. </p>

<p>The goal of the Cotton Profitability Program is to implement and conduct research and education 
programs intended to identify, develop and deliver technology to make cotton production in Texas 
Blacklands sustainable and more profitable. In 1995, several field trials were conducted in the 
Central Texas area in cooperation with cotton producers, researchers, and Extension agents. </p>
<p>This program included a tillage study that compared reduced tillage (stale seedbed) and 
conventional tillage in cotton production. Yields from the reduced tillage plots were numerically 
lower, the plants were shorter and they cut out sooner than those in the conventional till plots. This 
was probably due to a compacted zone in the soil that limited water infiltration and root 
development in the reduced till plots. </p>
<p>This program also included a stand establishment study that compared planting seed quality and 
evaluated planting equipment. Three seed lots categorized as EXCELLENT, GOOD and POOR 
were planted at four seeding rates in a field trial. Seed quality had a positive influence on stand 
establishment (time from planting to emergence). Both seed quality and seeding rate had an effect 
on final plant populations, but only seed quality impacted the survival percentage (percent of seed 
planted that developed into viable seedlings). The use of White 6700 air planter and John Deere 
7300 vacuum planter resulted in faster seedling emergence and more uniform spacing of plants than 
did the use of an old International Harvester model 67 &quot;buster type&quot; planter. The plots planted with 
the White planter also produced significantly higher yields. </p>
<p>Three in-furrow fungicides (Ridomil PC, Terrachlor 2E, Terrachlor Super X) and one seed dressing 
(0.5 oz/cwt Baytan added to the &quot;standard&quot; seed treatment which already included 0.5 oz/cwt 
Baytan) were compared to a standard planting seed (DPL 5409) treatment in an on-farm seedling 
disease control trial. The in-furrow fungicides treatments had no apparent influence on emergence 
and stand establishment. At harvest, however, the Terrachlor Super X, Baytan and Terrachlor 2E 
plots produced significantly higher yields than the control. Yields from the Terrachlor Super X plots 
were also significantly higher than those from the check and Ridomil PC plots. </p>
<p>The effect of plant growth regulators on cotton growth and development was evaluated in a field 
plot at the Blackland Research Center at Temple, Texas. The application of PIX&#174;, PGR IV&#174;, and 
Ryzup&#174; (a relatively new plant growth regulator), as recommended by the product label, had no 
significant effect on lint yields or fiber quality. </p>

<p>Satellite images were used to determine the location (e.g., latitude and longitude) of all vegetation 
within six counties (Coleman, McCulloch, Runnels, Concho, Tom Green, and Schleicher) in the 
Southern Rolling Plains of Texas. Previous research has shown that during the winter months, boll 
weevils require vegetation that provides abundant leaf litter for insulation against freezing 
temperatures. The maximum distance that emerging weevils can fly from these habitats is about one 
half mile (0.8 km). Thus, the degree to which cotton fields will be infested in the spring will depend 
upon the severity of winter temperatures and the proximity of these fields to favored boll weevil 
overwintering habitats. Knowledge of the location and size of these habitats will allow prediction of 
specific sub-regions within an eradication zone that will have the greatest pressures from weevil 
infestations in the spring. Consequently, recommendations can then be made as to the most critical 
cotton acreage for placement of pheromone traps and the acreage most likely to require treatments. </p>
<p>Our goal in developing this project was to provide data that will enable managers to increase the 
efficiency of the Boll Weevil Eradication Program by providing data and maps delineating the level 
of susceptibility for all cotton growing areas within the six-county region. Satellite images covering 
the areas of interest and recorded in the 1994 season were obtained during the spring of 1995. 
During the same season, examples of all general types of overwintering habitats were located and 
recorded using a global positioning system (GPS) device. Data on sample habitats were then used 
to characterize the spectral signature of each type of vegetation. Based on these signature files, 
habitat types were classified for all six counties. These raster data were subsequently converted into 
geographic information system (GIS) vector files, which allowed vegetation to be quantified in terms 
of location, size, and shape. Using GIS software, buffers representing 1/2 mile were placed around 
all habitats to spatially define the limits of susceptibility to spring weevil infestations. Analyses of 
relative susceptibility have not yet been conducted, but will be completed for all six counties. 
Results of these analyses will allow us to produce maps of each county showing color-coded 
susceptibility (or risk) of weevil infestations, for every acre of cropland present within the region. </p>

<p>The boll weevil eradication program is to begin in the Central Rolling Plains in the fall of 1996 and 
in the Northern Rolling Plains in the fall of 1997. Cultural management of the boll weevil through the 
uniform planting of cotton is a basic part of boll weevil management in the area. To further enhance 
cultural management, setting an early crop and maturing those bolls will help reduce the amount of 
late square and small boll production, limiting boll weevil late season feeding and reproduction sites. </p>
<p>Two studies were initiated June 9, 1995. Study #1 included three varieties with differing crop 
maturity (Deltapine Acala 90 - indeterminate, full-season; Paymaster HS26 - medium maturity; and 
TAMCOT CAB-CS - determinate, short-season) and two targeted seeding rates (three and six 
seeds per row foot). Study #2 included Paymaster HS26 variety with three targeted seeding rates 
(one, three, and six seeds per row foot). Hard, driving rainfall just after planting and cool conditions 
resulted in soil crusting and reduced plant emergence. The plant populations achieved were lower 
than targeted. </p>
<p>As seeding rate decreased from six seeds per foot to three, no significant differences in yields were 
observed. However, plants with few bolls are more likely to initiate regrowth and produce late 
season squares and bolls for boll weevil food and egg deposition sites. Three seeds per foot 
produced the same lint yield as six seeds per foot, indicating that use of the lower seeding rate 
could save approximately $5 per acre in seed cost. Paymaster HS26 produced significantly more 
lint than Deltapine Acala 90 and TAMCOT CAB-CS. </p>
<p>The study is to be repeated in 1996. Final plant populations of two to three plants per foot are 
suggested. When cotton is planted late in warm soils, seeding rates should be reduced 10 to 15 
percent. </p>

<p>Long-term cropping system studies were continued at AG-CARES, near Lamesa, Texas. These 
studies included minimum tillage, no-till with a cover crop, and conventional tillage in both irrigated 
and dryland cotton production. Irrigated cotton yields were below previous-year levels but dryland 
yields were slightly higher. Irrigated cotton yields for the three cropping systems evaluated, ranged 
from 726 to 853 lb/acre based on 0.75 percent of the ET demand. In 1995, highest yields and net 
returns were produced with the no-till system. Over a four-year period, the highest average 
irrigated yields (965 lb/acre) and net returns ($230/acre) were achieved with the no-till with cover 
crop system, representing a 24% increase in net returns over a conventional-tillage system (Table 
1). </p>
<p>Dryland cotton yields at AG-CARES ranged from 335 to 398 lb/acre for the different cropping 
systems. Highest yields and net returns in 1995 were produced with the minimum-tillage system. 
Over a four year period, the highest average dryland yields (364 lb/acre and net returns $91/acre) 
were produced with this system, representing a 200% increase in net returns over a 
conventional-tillage system (Table 1). </p>
<p>Irrigation methods included LEPA on alternate rows, LEPA on every row and spray irrigation 
amounts ranged from 0.25 to 1.25 percent of ET demand. Alternate furrow LEPA continued to be 
superior to spray irrigation, particularly at deficit irrigation levels. At 0.5 ET, yields averaged across 
cropping systems were 764 lb/acre with LEPA compared to 625 lb/acre with the spray. </p>

<p>Irrigation systems, such as LEPA and drip systems, have reached water-application efficiencies of 
90%. However, the irrigation system efficiency is only part of the plant-water use efficiency 
equation, irrigation scheduling for optimum yield is equally important. The objectives of this study 
were to evaluate several techniques of irrigation scheduling at different research locations to 
determine management guidelines, and to optimize water-use efficiency of cotton production. </p>
<p>Two, different, irrigation-scheduling techniques were used in this project--potential 
evapotranspiration (PET) and the pressure bomb to measure leaf water potential (LWP). Another 
method was proposed, using an infrared thermometer, however, it was received to late to be 
included in the 1995 growing season. </p>
<p>Several cotton growers began using PET as an irrigation management tool, all but one dropped it 
due to the difficulty keeping up with the PET information. In each of these situations, irrigation 
capacity was so limited toward the end of the growing season that irrigation pumps were being 
operated continuously without regard to scheduling. </p>
<p>Two locations were chosen to measure leaf-water potentials (LWP), Agcares with a fine sandy 
loam soil and the Halfway site with a clay soil. A center pivot irrigated the Agcares site every 3.5 
days from mid-June through late August. Pivot movement was set to water 1.25, 1.0, 0.75, 0.5, 
and 0.25 percent of the water requirement calculated for the crop. The Halfway site was watered 
using a linear move irrigation system at a 3 day interval, applying 1.2, 0.8 and 0.4 percent of the 
estimated water requirements. Hourly leaf water potential readings were taken to develop a diurnal 
set of leaf-water potentials on two soil types and several irrigation treatments. </p>
<p>The results of the first year's data show a definite trend of diurnal readings to be directly related to 
the amount of plant water stress in the irrigation treatments. This information is accurately measuring 
the effects of irrigation timing and the use of LWP as a tool for making irrigation decisions. </p>
<p>This was the first year of a three-year project and many of the objectives were not reached. The 
project was terminated because the Principal Investigator resigned. </p>

<p>Simulation analysis of representative gin plant firms in Texas was carried out to determine the effect 
of required investments in air pollution controls on firms financial performance. The simulation 
analysis facilitated the measurement of the representative firms financial performance before and 
after the required investment in pollution controls. The research shows many of the smaller, low 
volume gin plant firms in Texas are likely to fail over a ten year period before any required 
investment in pollution controls. For those representative firms projected to be successful before the 
required investment in control systems, failure rates were calculated as controls were introduced 
that increasingly lowered emission rates. Nine percent of the representative firms processing 
stripped cotton (with and without debt) are projected to fail when introducing best available control 
technology (BACT), a baseline or minimum emissions system (2.24 lb/bale) specified for Texas gin 
plants, while 11 and 20 percent fail when upgrading to systems with emission rates of 1.8 and 1.2 
lb/bale, respectively. The analysis show firm failure rates are sensitive to plant volume over the 
repayment period on the required investment in controls, stringency of the controls, plant size, 
indebtedness of plant at time of the required investment and whether the plant processes picked or 
stripped cotton. </p>

<p>Growers in the Coastal Bend Region of Texas often produce cotton with micronaire values which 
exceeds 5.0. This results in discounts to the price they receive for cotton. Management practices 
aimed at reducing fiber thickening prior to boll maturity may be effective in producing fibers with 
more desirable micronaire values. Growers however, may be able to accurately forecast potential 
micronaire values and yield in order to select the proper time and rate of harvest-aid applications, 
and to analyze the cost/benefit of management options. The objectives of this research were to (1) 
develop a simulation model to estimate micronaire values of cotton crops prior to cotton maturity, 
and link it to a cotton simulation model, (2) measure micronaire value of bolls from position one of 
each sympodial branch and (3) compare simulated micronaire values to observed values. </p>
<p>A simulation model was developed to estimate micronaire values of cotton crops. The fiber 
development sub-model assumes that the secondary wall deposition in cotton fibers is initiated 
approximately 15 to 20 days after anthesis and overlaps with the final stage of fiber elongation. 
Fiber elongation period and rate are estimated as a function of temperature. Fiber elongation rate is 
reduced by water stress in excess of -2.4 MPa. Micronaire values in the model are calculated as a 
function of fiber weight gain (rate of secondary wall deposition). The micronaire sub-model was 
linked to the boll development subroutine of the ICEMM (the Integrated Cropping Economic 
Management Model) cotton model. Data used to generate the micronaire equation was obtained 
from first position bolls of each sympodial of the main stem. The measured data shows that both 
seedcotton weight and micronaire values decline as the branch number increase. A binomial linear 
model was fitted to these data for the estimation micronaire for each boll in the plant. </p>
<p>The simulation model successfully predicted micronaire values of cotton bolls up to reproductive 
branch eight. The model failed to forecast micronaire for bolls produced in the upper portion of the 
plant (branches nine and ten). The reason for this was attributed to the failure of ICEMM to 
accurately predict the weight of late maturing bolls. In spite of this short coming, the model 
predicted final micronaire of the crop within 0.15 of the measured value (measured = 4.30; 
simulated 4.15). Further work on improving the ability of ICEMM to forecast boll weight and 
micronaire value is planned for the 1996 growing season. </p>

<p>In 1995 the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation (TBWEF) initiated the establishment of an 
overall information system for the statewide boll weevil eradication program. Two employees, a 
computer programming specialist and a public information director, were hired to help develop that 
system. </p>
<p>The first computer programming specialist developed a computer reporting system to relay accurate 
and timely information about eradication activities to cotton producers. A second computer 
specialist was added later in the year to assist in meeting the increasing demands placed on the 
system by the rapid growth of the Foundation's information and assessment operations. In January, 
the Foundation had only one zone, the Southern Rolling Plains, in active eradication. In April, active 
eradication began in the Lower Rio Grande Valley Zone. By year's end, the Foundation's 
assessment operations included four zones, with pre-planning and recruiting operations under way 
in two additional zones, the Central Rolling Plains and the South Texas/Winter Garden, where 
active eradication efforts are scheduled to begin in September and June, 1996, respectively. 
Temporary offices in anticipation of start-up operations in those zones have been established in 
Corpus Christi, Taft, El Campo, Uvalde and Victoria. </p>
<p>The public information director (PID) developed a system to communicate information about 
Foundation activities to producers and the general public. This information system included building 
and maintaining professional working relationships with the news media in each zone, writing, 
editing and disseminating news releases to print and broadcast media, developing 
speeches/presentations for use by the board chairman and executive director at agriculture-related 
and public meetings; working closely with the Foundation Board of Directors to relay information 
about board meetings to producers in a timely manner; and developing other informational materials 
as necessary. The PID also developed a monthly employee newsletter that was also distributed to 
grower organizations both in and out of active eradication zones, and was responsible for answering 
inquiries under the Texas Open Records Act. Due to increasing demands for information about the 
program, the public information office now includes two public information directors. In addition to 
the duties above, the directors (1) publish zone-specific newsletters for growers and landowners 
about eradication activities; (2) have developed a zone-specific gin-point informational poster about 
the eradication program; and (3) have published the first of a series of zone-specific &quot;Texas Boll 
Weevil Eradication Manuals,&quot; detailing every aspect of the eradication program. More than 60 
news releases were generated by the public information office since March. </p>
<p>Toll-free lines have been installed at the headquarters office in Abilene as well as at offices in San 
Angelo, Ballinger, Weslaco, Rio Hondo and Mission to facilitate and enhance communication 
between the Foundation and producers. The numbers allow growers greater access to Foundation 
personnel, who in turn can provide them accurate information in a timely manner. </p>
<p>The benefits of a public information system for cotton producers, landowners and the public 
continues to prove itself daily in the eradication program. </p>

<p>Research is crucial for the United States to maintain its competitive position in the world cotton 
market. Research is funded by federal, state, and private institutions and by cotton producers 
themselves. Without current information about research being conducted throughout the United 
States, funding organizations may have difficulty evaluating proposals. This project provides a 
clearinghouse for information on recent and ongoing cotton research in the U.S. through two means: </p>
<p>(1) a database of cotton research information that can be accessed through an interactive electronic 
bulletin board system (BBS); </p>
<p>(2) linkages on the Natural Fibers Research Information Center (NFRIC) home page to other 
information sources on the World Wide Web related to cotton research. </p>
<p>Use of this database and the information sources linked to our home page should help organizations 
review important research issues, avoid duplication of efforts, and allocate resources efficiently. </p>
<p>To create this database we conducted a survey to gather information on cotton research projects. 
We sent more than 800 surveys, and 172 respondents returned surveys with a total of 406 
research projects. We entered this information into a spreadsheet and we will transfer it to the 
NFRIC's existing BBS using database management software. With a computer and a modem, 
users anywhere can access this online information. </p>
<p>The NFRIC's home page (http://www.utexas/edu/depts/bbr/natfiber) includes three choices under 
the heading Electronic Services, one of which is called NATRES, or Natural Fibers Research 
Information. Clicking on it will give you a screen that will describe this project and tell you how to

<p>Objectives: 1. Development of improved germplasm having specifically defined leaf texture and 
shape, plant color, frego bracts and varying levels of gossypol; 2. Improve the genetic yield 
potential, agronomic performance, and fiber quality of germplasm/cultivars with tolerance to 
stresses such as drought, high temperatures, and biotic pests that are recurring in Central, South, 
and East Texas; 3. Enhancement of plant characters known to impart resistance or tolerance to 
insect pests of cotton. These include: nectariless leaves and/or bracts, smooth leaves and/or stems, 
frego bract, and high anthocyanin concentration (red leaves and/or stems); 4. Development of 
germplasm/cultivars with resistance to the rootknot nematode and to the reniform nematode; 5. 
train graduate and undergraduate students such that they are familiar with the U.S. and Texas 
cotton industries. </p>
<p>The mission of the Cotton Improvement Laboratory is to develop germplasm/cultivars of cotton 
that enhance the position of cotton producers or the cotton industry in Central and South Texas. To 
that end, germplasm/cultivars are developed that have improved yield potential, earliness of 
maturity, improved fiber quality, tolerance of abiotic stresses such as drought or early season cool 
temperatures, resistance to biotic pests such as the Silverleaf Whitefly, bollworm/budworm, 
fleahoppers and nematodes. All of these characteristics must be packaged in a plant phenotype that 
is amenable to mechanical harvest and husbandry. </p>
<p>Three root-knot nematode germplasm lines were released in 1995 that have good yield potential on 
the High Plains where root-knot is a problem. Two of these lines failed to perform well in 1995 
under extremely heavy infestation indicating that additional resistance genes are needed for 
acceptable performance on the High Plains. One experimental strain, 90K-3, did perform well 
under the infestation levels encountered this year and will be evaluated further to determine its 
genetic constitution relative to the other resistant germplasm lines. Strain 900-24L continues to 
perform well for an okra leaf phenotype. This strain may be released as an enhanced okra leaf 
germplasm or as a public cultivar. It is a distinct improvement of the okra leaf character for Texas. 
A number of subokra-leaf shaped strains should be ready for release in early 1996. </p>

<p>One of the main constraints to cotton production on the High Plains of Texas is the lack of seasonal 
heat units. In order to capture as many heat units as possible, many producers plant early when soil 
temperatures are relatively low, especially in the more northern areas of the High Plains. Because 
cotton is a &quot;cold sensitive&quot; plant, it is not uncommon to get only 50 to 60% of the seeds planted to 
become established plants. This study was initiated to determine if an improved laboratory test(s) 
could be devised to screen many varieties and breeding lines for early (and also late) season cold 
tolerance. If available, an initial laboratory screening test could be used to select only the most 
promising breeding lines to be further field tested for cold tolerance. This should both speed and 
reduce cost of the selection procedure. </p>
<p>This study is being conducted in cooperation with Dr. John Gannaway (Cotton Breeder TAES, 
Lubbock). During 1995, thirty-two entries (14 commercial varieties and 18 breeding lines in Dr. 
Gannaway's program) were evaluated for cold tolerance in both the laboratory and field. 
Twenty-two laboratory tests were conducted on the seed/seedlings, measuring both germination 
and seedling growth at low temperatures. In addition, the entries were planted in the field on April 
12, and again on June 9. Field data collected included evaluation for emergence (rate and total) and 
establishment (percentage of seeds planted resulting in established plants). The laboratory and field 
data were then correlated to identify which test(s) best predicted actual field performance under 
low temperature conditions. </p>
<p>The best laboratory test for evaluating early season cold tolerance was the EC5 test. This test 
measures the electrical conductivity of water after soaking seed in it for 24 hours at 41&#176;F (5&#176;C) and 
allowing the water to come to room temperature. The results of this test correlated with both the 
field emergence and stand establishment parameters. This would indicate that seed not damaged 
during the water uptake phase of germination under cool\cold conditions tend to emerge faster and 
have higher establishment percentages under cool field conditions. </p>
<p>Evaluation of new tests and confirmation of existing tests is continuing in 1996. </p>

by using a germination bench in a growth chamber, and to confirm these predictions in field studies. 
In addition, other field studies were conducted to determine the effectiveness of Staple&#174; on weeds 
of west Texas when applications were made at different stages of weed growth. We have 
completed the efficacy studies and will continue examination of weed germination and emergence as 
a function of soil temperature and water levels. </p>
<p>A germination bench with a temperature gradient of 50&#176; to 86&#176; F was designed and constructed for 
laboratory studies. A temperature gradient of 1 degree per inch was created along the length of the 
bench. Seeds of Palmer amaranth, devil's-claw, and morningglory were acid treated or placed in 
the freezer for 6 weeks to maximize germination. Equipment was constructed to monitor soil 
temperature and moisture levels in the field. </p>
<p>In field studies, seeds of Palmer amaranth, devil's-claw, lanceleaf sage, puncturevine, red 
morningglory, and barnyardgrass were planted in June. Applications of Staple at the labelled rate 
(1.2 oz product/acre) were made to weeds at the cotyledonary, 2-inch, 4-inch, 6-inch, 8-inch, and 
10-inch growth stages. Weed control was recorded throughout the growing season. Weed control 
with Staple varied with stage of growth. Palmer amaranth and devil's-claw were controlled greater 
than 85% at the end of the growing season when applications were made at heights of up to 
4-inches. Puncturevine, lanceleaf sage, and red morningglory were controlled at least 79% when 
treated with Staple&#174; at 2-inches. Barnyardgrass control was unacceptable. These results suggest 
that Staple must be applied at or before the 4-inch stage of weed growth to maintain acceptable 
control of the principal weeds found in west Texas. </p>

<p>Tamcot Sphinx, a new early variety from Dr. El-Zik's program at Texas A&amp;M University, 
continues to perform very well in agronomic testing in this region. Sphinx's first year of commercial 
production will be in 1996. HS 200, Texas 121, Holland 1919, BS&amp;D 297, and All Tex Express 
all performed well in testing, however, none of them was successful in the commercial fields of the 
area because of aphid damage. </p>
<p>G&amp;P 785 was a new variety in its first year of commercial production. It sustained appreciable 
damage from both cotton aphids and an unknown plant disease. Approximately one half of the 
plants produced a normal crop while the other half were barren, apparently due to the unidentified 
disease. The responsible pathogen has not been identified. </p>
<p>G&amp;P 3774 was also susceptible to the unidentified disease. It is a selection from SP 37. Breeders 
with Hartz and Stoneville observed that any line containing a high level of SP 37 parentage was 
badly damaged in 1995 by the unidentified disease. G&amp;P 3774 is also susceptible. This 
phenomenon is unexplained because SP37 itself has been commercially grown for about 20 years 
and is one of the most consistent-performing varieties in the region. </p>

<p>The goal of this project is to develop management systems which minimize the waste of rainfall and 
maximize yield and water use efficiency of cotton under rainfed conditions in West Texas. Tillage 
systems, rotations, row spacings, plant populations, variety and fertility, are components of the 
systems being developed and evaluated. This is a long term project that was initiated in 1995. The 
first year's results could only evaluate row spacing, population and variety effects since tillage and 
rotational components were established this year. Population had the greatest impact on yield in 
1995. The greatest yields were obtained at populations around 30,000 plants/acre. As population 
increased, yields decreased. The determinate variety was more sensitive to increasing population 
than the indeterminate variety. Skip row planting patterns produced only 10-15% more yield per 
planted acre than did solid planted cotton. Due to the extreme drought, yields were in the 160-240 
lb/acre ranges. </p>
<p>In 1997, we should have all components of the system in place for evaluation and the results will be 
much more comprehensive. </p>

<p>South Texas Cotton and Grain Association started the fiscal year by working with the Texas Boll 
Weevil Foundation to develop and carry forward a state-wide informational program that was 
conducted in conjunction with the Beltwide Cotton Conferences held in San Antonio, Texas. The 
conference program included a variety of speakers from across the Cotton Belt who discussed the 
Boll Weevil Eradication (BWE) program. </p>
<p>Within the zone, South Texas Cotton and Grain Association (STCGA) personnel worked to 
increase contacts with growers at cotton gin points, farm Co-Op and other meetings, and meetings 
arranged by the organization to meet with growers to discuss the program. Additionally, the 
association worked to coordinate planned meetings for the interim zone boll weevil eradication 
steering committee. </p>
<p>The Cotton Incorporated grant has allowed the association to expand its network of 
communications to growers by creating a new-breed communications network in South Texas. This 
network is referred to as the South Texas Agriculture News Network (STANN, or Big STANN). 
Comprising this informational network are the association's printed publications, South Texas 
Agrinews and Views and the ST/WG Boll Weevil Express, and their electronic South Texas 
Agriculture News (STAN, or Little STAN) counterparts. The STAN counterparts include STAN 
COTNET, STAN Home Page (internal), STAN E-Mail and STAN AgFax. </p>
<p>The organization has prepared and submitted a number of press releases through the year pertaining 
to the program. However, its center of concentration and focus continues to be further development 
of an &quot;in-house&quot; communication network to provide growers with science supported fact and truth 
rather than rumor about the program. Cotton Incorporated grant funding has contributed greatly to 
fulfilling this goal. </p>
<p>In addition to printed and electronic communications with growers, the organization worked to plan 
and coordinate various informational grower meetings within the zone. A total of 6 grower meetings 
were conducted in the Fall of 1995, and a 7th is to be conducted in early 1996. Growers were 
informed of the provisions of the program, its current status and summary as well as reviews of the 
Southern Rolling Plains and Lower Rio Grande Valley programs. </p>
<p>The organization also planned and coordinated a meeting with entomological consultants operating 
within the zone to solicit their input and support for the program. Efforts will be expanded to 
communicate with this group as the date of program initiation approaches. </p>
<p>This project has helped provide travel costs for association directors and staff to attend meetings 
with growers, gin managers, consultants and allied interests to discuss details of the zone's boll 
weevil eradication effort. Also, it has helped to defray the cost of salaries as mail lists were 
updated. Other funded salary dollars were used to cover costs in preparing and distributing printed 
publications and materials. </p>

<p>Insecticide based systems have been the standard for controlling cotton insect pests for some 
30-40 years in west Texas. But, because of resistance in pests to insecticides and the effect some 
broad spectrum insecticides have on secondary pests, growers are moving increasingly to less 
disruptive insecticides and relying on biological control. The objective of this project was to 
evaluate and compare traditional, insecticide-based cotton insect pest management systems to 
systems utilizing (1) &quot;soft&quot; insecticides, (2) released beneficial insects or no treatments. In addition, 
observations were made on effects of varying levels of predators on bollworm survival and also, 
effects of bollworm egg population density on predators and worm survival. </p>
<p>Four 10-acre plots were established at each of four on-farm sites in 1995. Four treatments were 
applied at each site: 1. untreated control, 2. treated weekly after bloom with commercially reared 
beneficial insects (<i>Trichogramma pretiosum</i>), 3. treated as needed according to scouting reports 
and appropriate thresholds with &quot;soft&quot; insecticides (Condor XL&#174; + Ovasyn&#174;), and 4. Treated as 
in (3) with &quot;hard&quot; insecticides (methyl parathion). </p>
<p>Bollworm/budworm populations were low in 1995 and few, as-needed treatments were applied. 
One treatment was applied to three of the four &quot;soft&quot; insecticide plots. All four &quot;hard&quot; insecticide 
plots were treated for stink bugs in late August. A total of seven <i>Trichogramma</i> releases were 
made during the season. </p>
<p>Results are inconclusive about the effect of the different treatments on the bollworm/budworm 
populations due to the low numbers in 1995. </p>
<p>Data from three years of research indicate that the ratio of predatory insects to bollworm eggs 
declines and then levels out at about one predator per bollworm egg as egg populations increase to 
above 32,000 eggs/acre. In contradiction to the predator/egg relationship observed, bollworm 
mortality (egg to 5-day-old larvae) increases as the egg density increases. Larval populations 
increase in fields as egg density increases (up to 32,000 eggs/acre). But because of higher mortality 
at the higher egg densities, the rate of increase in larvae does not keep pace with the increase in 
eggs. Data suggests that even when egg densities reach high levels, 16,000 to above 32,000 
eggs/acre, only about 33% of fields exceed economic thresholds (for worms) the following week. 
Furthermore, little change is seen in the percentage of fields above thresholds as the previous weeks 
egg counts fluctuate from 2,000 - 4,000 eggs per acre to above 32,000 eggs/ acre. At increasing 
egg densities, the higher bollworm/budworm mortality is unexplained. It does not appear to be 
related to the number of predators per egg since predator to egg ratios decline at higher egg 
densities. </p>
<p>Finally, <i>Trichogramma</i> releases made weekly did not increase the mortality of bollworm/budworm 
in the three years of this study. </p>

<p>The active phase of the Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP) began in the Lower Rio Grande 
Valley in the spring of this year. The objectives of this project were to obtain grower input and 
disseminate information on boll weevil eradication through meetings and print material and to 
provide input and assistance to the Texas Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation (TBWEF). </p>
<p>Activities in 1995 included: </p>
<ul>
<li>Held informational meetings at the request of opponents of BWEP in the valley--Texas Rural 
Legal Aid, Sierra Club, and Audubon Society. </li>
<li>Disseminated BWEP information to producers through newsletters. </li>
<li>Held informational meetings for producers and the general public. </li>
<li>Produced large county maps with defined BWEP work units for distribution to gins. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the second half of the year, much time was spent documenting, whenever possible, the causes of 
the disastrous crop in the valley. Many cited the BWEP as the sole reason for the crop failure but 
one of the most unusual weather patterns in history was documented. Meetings were held with the 
Valley Boll Weevil Committee to devise modifications in the program should it occur in 1996 and 
to prepare newsletters concerning the recall vote scheduled for January 1996. </p>

<p>The primary reason this study was undertaken was to determine if experimental cottons that are 
available, which exhibit superior quality fiber properties, will perform as expected by the spinning 
industry, which expresses a need for fibers that are longer, stronger, finer, and more mature. 
However, prior to developing these experimental lines into varieties that will perform in an 
acceptable manner, it was decided to produce enough fiber for large-scale spinning tests to ensure 
that we were not creating some unforeseen problem that would be worse than the one we are 
currently striving to solve. </p>
<p>These four experimental lines, and one commercial cultivar, &quot;Paymaster HS26&quot;, were produced in 
sufficient quantities for large scale spinning tests. All of the four experimentals outperformed the 
commercial cultivar concerning spinning potential. Two of these four produced results suggesting 
they could possibly compete with ELS cottons for selected uses. Our primary concern was that 
these experimentals, which produce a very fine fiber, would encounter serious problems with 
neppiness. This was not the case. Even though they did produce more process neps that the 
commercial cultivar, the increase was not of sufficient magnitude to warrant concern. </p>
<p>These experimental genotypes are currently in the possession of cotton breeders from several 
different private seed companies. We are awaiting the release of the first variety utilizing this 
germplasm to see if it will perform up to expectations. </p>

<p>Dead fibers are defined in terms of fiber properties, developmental stage, and heat unit 
accumulation. Dead fibers cause dye-uptake problems in textiles. </p>
<p>Dead cotton is pinpointed as to where it comes from in terms of fruiting zone or fruiting position on 
the plant. Fruiting positions on the periphery of the plant have the greatest propensity for producing 
dead cotton, that is fruiting zone III and higher. </p>
<p>Varieties or breeding lines may be evaluated for their propensity to produce dead cotton. This 
technique requires harvesting of plants by fruiting zone or fruiting position and analyzing the fiber 
from these locations separately. The procedure, fractional harvesting, allows the identification of 
varieties and the selection of breeding stocks which are least likely to result in dead cotton 
production. </p>
<p>Individual cotton fields may be evaluated, using the fractional harvesting procedure, for the 
presence of dead cotton. This could be useful for optimum marketing of commercial cotton from 
such fields. </p>
<p>Plant population, plants/ft of row, can be a useful tool in minimizing the production of dead cotton. 
Population levels of 3.5 plants/ft or higher are indicated. </p>

<p>Occasionally on the High Plains of Texas, cotton is sticky in the absence of whiteflies and aphids. 
The fiber traits associated with non-insect related stickiness are thought to be low micronaire and 
high sugar contents. The purpose of this study is to determine the chemical and physical traits 
associated with West Texas sticky cotton, and to see if they are under genetic control. </p>
<p>In 1994, plants of twenty Upland cotton varieties were treated with Prep&#174; or exposed to a killing 
freeze. Bolls were harvested and segregated based on maturity. Prep treated cotton was relatively 
high in reducing sugar content and low in micronaire, but generally was not sticky as measured by 
carding. Surprisingly, cotton killed by frost was sticky due to the presence of many immature bolls. </p>
<p>In 1995, the same twenty varieties were treated with Prep or paraquat, or exposed to a killing 
freeze. A four-inch rain fell on the plants after the Prep and paraquat applications but before their 
subsequent harvests. The stickiest cotton again came from the immature cotton killed by the freeze. 
The Prep and paraquat treatments resulted in no sticky cotton. Overall sugar contents were lower 
in 1995 likely as a result of the washing rain. </p>
<p>There were no significant differences among varieties in regard to their stickiness. However, there 
were highly significant differences found in the varieties' sugar levels and other factors associated 
with non-insect stickiness. There is promise that a breeding program can be developed to reduce 
the likelihood of sticky cotton from West Texas. </p>

<p>The commercial value of cottonseed, especially in diets for non ruminants, is decreased by the 
presence of a toxic compound known as gossypol. One approach to obtaining gossypol-free 
cottonseed is to engineer gossypol breakdown specifically in the seed. This type of genetic 
engineering is relatively straightforward. The missing ingredient is a gossypol-degrading gene. </p>
<p>Microorganisms which have the ability to breakdown gossypol may be a source for a 
gossypol-degrading gene. We have screened microorganisms from several sources for their ability 
to degrade gossypol. The screen is performed by placing the microorganisms in 
gossypol-containing broth and monitoring the broth for microbial growth and gossypol levels. </p>
<p>Screens of microorganisms from cotton leaves, from other collections, or of microorganisms known 
to breakdown related compounds have not identified a single microorganism which reduces the 
gossypol levels. Screens of the microorganisms in the soil of cotton root balls, however, have 
identified 2 bacteria and 1 fungus which reduce the gossypol levels. These three microorganisms 
grow better on plates containing gossypol than on plates containing the solvent alone. One of the 
bacteria has been tentatively identified as <i>Acinetobacter</i>. We are in the process of isolating the 
gossypol-degrading gene from this microorganism. </p>

<p>The objectives of this research are: 1) to determine if DNA can be incorporated into germline 
tissues via silicon carbide &quot;whiskers&quot;; 2) to determine the conditions necessary for the recovery of 
young embryos; and 3) to determine if the incorporation of sequences frequently found in cotton 
genes resembling DNA scaffolding sequences would enhance stable incorporation of DNA. </p>
<p>Recovery of split shoot tips (meristems) after &quot;whiskers&quot; treatment, after <i>Agrobacterium</i> 
inoculation and under control conditions was optimized. Essentially 100% of untreated split shoot 
tips can be recovered but only 80% can be recovered when treated with <i>Agrobacterium</i> alone 
and a lower percentage when treated with whiskers alone. Only 50% of meristems can be 
recovered when treated with <i>Agrobacterium </i>and whiskers. Maximum recovery occurred when 
shoot tips were isolated 6 hours after radical emergence and when treatment was administered 36 
hours after culture. In order to further improve efficiency of the ultimate system, a selection system 
for transformation events in the meristem must be available. Normally shoot tips grow away from 
the selective source and escape. A time, dosage, and transfer system was developed that will allow 
use of kanamycin for selection of transformed germline tissue. </p>
<p>Because recovery after <i>Agrobacterium</i> infection was higher than with either method of &quot;whisker&quot; 
treatment and training of new personnel in the &quot;whisker&quot; protocol was necessary, the initial focus 
was on <i>Agrobacterium</i> transformation. GUS expression can be attained in germline tissues. 
However, transformation frequencies are still too variable from experiment to experiment. </p>
<p>For objectives 2 and 3, bolls were tagged and shipped from the field to our DOE collaborators for 
analysis of endosperm and to establish plants in the greenhouse for future work. Additionally, a 
chimeric gene was constructed that contains DNA sequences thought to enhance stable 
transformation. </p>

<p>Because previous work showed that the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions in full field 
modules (8-10 tons of seed cotton) were not reproduced in small lots (approximately 5-150 lb. of 
seed cotton), considerable efforts were expended to fabricate equipment that would make 
small-scale (micromodule) experiments more representative of field-scale modules. Eight 
temperature-control chambers were constructed and instrumented. The chambers can maintain 
constant temperatures, or impose dynamic temperature regimes that will follow temperatures 
generated in the cores of small lots of treated and/or hydrated seed cotton. Since previous work 
had also demonstrated that the microflora of seed cotton become quiescent after approximately six 
months, in the spring, permits were obtained to import seed cotton from Paraguay and Australia. 
These imported seed cottons were used in a systematic program to improve the reliability of the 
system and eliminate the possibility of the induction of false temperature regimes from electronic 
feedback loops. In the fall, local sticky seed cottons were also collected and purchased for further 
system testing and subsequent testing of enzyme treatments. </p>
<p>Work also continues on characterization of the larger oligosaccharides in <i><u>Bemisia</u></i> honeydew. A full 
bale of cotton was washed in hot water in a commercial washing machine, one kilogram (kg) at a 
time. The wash water was treated with ethanol to isolate the sugars. After the alcohol was 
evaporated and the remaining water lyophilized, the extraction yielded approximately 1.5 kg of 
crude, brown, highly hygroscopic honeydew. This material was fractionated on a large (5 X 
87-inch) column and the individual sugars eluted with n-propanol. Approximately 10 grams of large 
sugars were produced. This fraction was again separated by molecular size using gel filtration and a 
preliminary characterization made by HPLC. Preliminary results suggest the presence of two 
unknown tetrasaccharides, two pentasaccharides, and a hexasaccharide. One of the isolated 
compounds was glycine betaine, a compound found in high concentrations in drought stressed 
cotton leaves. </p>
<p>Analyses of sugar extracts from sticky seed cotton where also done in support of two field trials 
with Solvay Enzymes Inc.'s glucosidase. The experiments were done at Weslaco, TX and Brawley, 
CA. In both tests, glucosidase was oversprayed in the field on sticky seed cotton. In both 
experiments, results were largely negative. Insufficient enzyme and moisture were intercepted by the 
lint, thus carbohydrate breakdown was minimal. </p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated funds were used as matching funds for a grant from the Texas Advanced 
Research Program, &quot;Molecular Alterations of Source/Sink Carbohydrate Metabolism to Improve 
Cotton Yield&quot;, $136,370 for 1994-95, C.H. Haigler and Scott Holaday, co-P.I.s. The past and 
promised support of Cotton Incorporated was critical to the success of this proposal and the 
extension that was recently awarded to us by the Texas Advanced Technology Program for 
1996-97 ($149,872). This provides a good example of leveraging of Cotton Incorporated research 
funds so that progress in understanding cotton physiology occurs faster. </p>
<p>In 1995, Cotton Incorporated funds were used to carry out transformation of cotton possessing a 
gene that may allow more efficient fiber cellulose synthesis under the cool night temperatures that 
frequently occur on the Southern High Plains of Texas and in other temperate growing regions. If 
the gene has the expected effect, more mature fibers would be routinely produced during the limited 
growing season because more substrate would be available for cellulose synthesis at all times. 
Toward the end of 1995, the first primary transformed plants were recovered. In 1996, these 
primary transformants and future generations derived from them will be analyzed by molecular and 
biochemical techniques in the laboratory, and, finally, by field testing. If a heritable trait is present 
that confers advantageous results, the plants will be transferred to breeders for crossing with 
commercial cultivars. Even if this particular gene does not cause the hypothesized effect (due to our 
limited knowledge of cotton fiber biochemistry), the transformed plants will almost certainly aid in 
designing future transformation strategies. In addition, Cotton Incorporated funds were helpful in 
our continuing analyses of changes in fiber metabolism associated with cool temperatures, which 
will be helpful in designing future transformation strategies. For example, due to the work of Dr. 
D.P. Delmer and coworkers and our collaboration with them, we are now able to predict better 
than was possible even one year ago which specific genes in the cellulose biosynthetic pathway 
might be most advantageous to manipulate to achieve cool tolerance. We are optimistic that we 
have now reached the time when we will be able to solve the problem of fiber maturity in a limited 
growing season. </p>

<p>A series of paired tests was run during the third quarter on various cyclone inlet configurations and 
experimental cyclone designs. All tests were comparisons made against a standard 1D3D cyclone 
design as a control, using an inlet transition whose flat side is at the top. This cyclone design was 
selected as the control because it is accepted as best available control technology (BACT) in many 
states, and is the type of inlet commonly, though not universally, used. Approximately 12 different 
replicated test configurations were run during the testing series. </p>
<p>Data analysis was conducted primarily during the fourth quarter. Results showed that the design of 
the inlet transition to a 1D3D cyclone could affect its collection efficiency by a large factor. For 
example, the best inlet design collected 38% more particulate than the worst design. Both designs 
are commonly used in the ginning industry. Also, two experimental cyclone designs were found to 
be 20 to 30% more efficient than the standard 1D3D cyclone design. More detail is found in a 
report given at the 1996 Beltwide Conference in Nashville entitled &quot;Laboratory Evaluation of 
Various Cyclone Designs&quot; by S. E. Hughs and R. V. Baker. </p>
<p>The inlet transitions and experimental cyclones were small-scale models based on a design diameter 
of 12 inches. Those designs that are improvements over the 1D3D standard design will be tested 
full-size during the first and second quarter of 1996 by Roy Baker at USDA,ARS Lubbock. Also, 
some other new experimental designs will be tested as 12-inch models at the Mesilla Park Ginning 
Laboratory. </p>

<p>All of the 1995 project funds were used to pay the salary and benefits of a full-time research 
technician whose principle duties were to (1) conduct all phases of several experiments on cyclone 
collectors and pre-separation chambers, (2) assist with the ginning and sample evaluations 
associated with harvesting and ginning experiments, and (3) assist with data analysis of a wide range 
of ginning and harvesting experiments. </p>
<p>The experiments which occupied most of the technician's time during 1995 were: </p>
<p>1. Improved Dust Collection Systems - Experiments were conducted to evaluate 10 different trash 
exit designs for 1D3D cyclones handling trash. EPA Method 201A air sampling procedures were 
used to measure effects of trash from stripper-harvested cotton outlet design on dust emissions. We 
were successful in identifying 3 designs that eliminated the lint recirculation problems of standard 
outlets, and an additional test was conducted to evaluate a pre-separator in combination with one 
of the improved designs. The research technician supported by project funds conducted these 
experiments including both the field and laboratory phases of the air sampling procedures. The 
results of this work were reported at the 1996 Beltwide Cotton Conference (Ginning) in a paper 
entitled &quot;Influence of Trash Exit Design on Cyclone Performance&quot;. </p>
<p>2. Belt Drier Installation - The technician assisted with the installation of a full-scale belt drier in our 
gin plant here at Lubbock. This installation will provide additional data on the fiber quality aspects 
of this new seed cotton drying technique, and will provide a test bed for additional research on 
cottonseed coating techniques. </p>

<p>The objective of this project is to provide knowledge about the variability of fiber quality on the 
plant and in the field. This information will be used to determine the feasibility of modifying the 
quality distributions of cotton. Cotton plants were hand harvested by zones, in 20 cm increments 
above the ground. Lint micronaire and yield data were used to make preliminary feasibility 
assessments of quality variations. </p>
<p>Several computer models were developed to analyze the effect of separating cotton quality 
according to zones above the ground surface on a plant. Two models estimate values of seed 
cotton by zones on a plant, and the third model estimates the effect of combining two modules of 
different micronaire values at the gin. Quality was measured on seed cotton samples collected 
according to zones on a plant in three different fields - one at Corpus Christi, Texas and two at 
College Station, Texas. In addition, samples were collected at different locations in the field to 
examine field variability. </p>
<p>Lint micronaire distributions in the different zones showed only a small variation within zones. 
Micronaire values showed the effects of the blending that occurs by averaging the individual boll 
variations according to zones. Other data collected by &quot;boll position&quot; on the plant detects 
micronaire variations according to boll age and location from the main stem. Since bolls collected 
by height zones combine or blend different age groups, the results are fairly uniform within the 
zones. </p>
<p>Lint yield distribution according to zone shows over 96 percent of the lint was produced from zones 
less than 27.5 inches above the ground or two thirds of the plant height at the Corpus Christi 
location. At College Station, the two fields evaluated showed that about 95 percent of the lint was 
in the lower two thirds of the plant height. This indicates that scheduling harvest according to a 
quality parameter is feasible and additional data will be taken in 1996. </p>

<p>The southeast has become a highly significant production region. Domestic mills appear to be 
utilizing this readily accessible supply of cotton in larger quantities as availability increases. As a 
result, it seems important to review the quantity and quality of this cotton supply in greater detail. 
Yields were extremely low in Alabama (361 lb./acre), considerably higher in North Carolina (554 
lb./acre), but still rather low, and much higher in other states (630-700 LB/acre), with Virginia 
leading the way at 700 LB/acre. Yield, according to USDA, averaged 577 LB/acre for the entire 
southeastern region. This compares to an estimated national average yield level of 547 LB/acre. </p>
<p><b>MICRONAIRE.</b> Alabama, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina all averaged approximately 4.6 
in micronaire value, while North Carolina and Virginia averaged about 4.8 and 4.9, respectively. 
The overall average micronaire value for the region was 4.66. Distribution of micronaire values is 
probably more important, with regard to utilization of the crop, than the average value. In all states, 
50% or more of the crop had an average micronaire value of 4.6 or higher. More than 85% of the 
Virginia crop was 4.6 and higher in micronaire value, while nearly 50% of the bales were 5.0 or 
higher. North Carolina came in with nearly 80% of the crop at 4.6 and higher, and slightly more 
than 35% of the crop 5.0 and higher in micronaire value. The southeastern cotton crop has a very 
serious problem with high micronaire, which results in large discounts to producers and problematic 
spinning for mills. </p>
<p><b>COLOR-LEAF GRADE.</b> Approximately 70% of the Georgia and South Carolina crops had a 
color-leaf grade of 41-4 or better, while nearly 40% of the Georgia crop had a color-leaf grade of 
31-3 or better and a little more than 20% of the South Carolina crop was 31-3 or better in 
color-leaf grade. Less than 40% of the Alabama crop had a color-leaf grade of 41-4 or higher. 
Florida, North Carolina and Virginia had 52, 59 and 61%, respectively, of their crops with a 
color-leaf grade of 41-4 or better. </p>
<p><b>STAPLE.</b> Fiber length of the 1995 southeastern crop, like other regions of the U.S., is shorter than 
normal, averaging about 35.05, 32nds of an inch. Virginia produced the longest staple, averaging 
36.5, while South Carolina came in second at 35.7. Georgia produced the shortest staple, 
averaging 34.8. Alabama, North Carolina and Florida were in between at 34.9, 35.1, and 35.2, 
respectively. </p>
<p><b>STRENGTH.</b> Unlike staple and micronaire, the strength of the southeastern crop is outstanding, 
averaging nearly 29 grams/tex. South Carolina produced the highest average strength at 29.6 
grams/tex while North Carolina produced the lowest, averaging 28.4 grams/tex. </p>

<p>To meet textile mill demands for higher quality cotton fibers, many cotton gins have adopted the 
method of &quot;gentle ginning&quot;. This means ginning cotton without high temperatures and with minimal 
lint cleaning. The result is longer, more uniform cotton fibers delivered to the textile mill than when 
&quot;gentle ginning&quot; is not practiced. </p>
<p>With this reduced cleaning, however, the appearance of the cotton may not be as smooth. If the 
cotton reaches a certain level of roughness it can be classed by USDA, AMS as having rough 
preparation. Cotton classed with rough preparation results in discounts that cost the farmer about 
$20 a bale. Across the Cotton Belt, rough preparation averages only about 0.5 percent of the total 
bales. However in Alabama in 1994 rough preparation was noted on over 2 percent of the bales 
statewide resulting in a $275,700 loss to cotton farmers. In north Alabama, a concentrated area of 
cotton and gins had rough-preparation levels averaging over 5 percent. </p>
<p>An investigation into this high occurrence of rough preparation began in 1995. Farmers and gins in 
northern Alabama are cooperating in an effort to find possible causes of the problem. Mistiming of 
defoliants and picking cotton too wet are being investigated as possible factors. Ginning practices, 
and machinery used at the gins with the highest levels of rough preparation are also being 
investigated. Cotton samples from bales with rough preparation are being evaluated in spinning tests 
to find what effect this rough preparation may have at the textile mill. </p>

<p>This report describes an ongoing research project of the Cotton Defoliation Work Group and 
includes data collected from 16 growing regions over a four-year period (1992 - 1995). The 
objective of this Beltwide project is to develop effective, practical harvest-aid recommendations 
that contribute to harvest efficiency and high quality fiber, especially by evaluating performance of 
standard defoliation treatments on a uniform basis and relating this performance to biotic and 
environmental factors. </p>
<p>Seven core harvest-aid treatments were applied at 16 test sites located in Alabama, Arkansas, 
California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North and South Carolina, 
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas (4). These locations were combined into four regions, Southeast, 
Mid-South, Southwest and West (California only). The seven core treatments Beltwide are as 
follows: </p>
<ol>
<li>Untreated Check </li>
<li>Folex&#174;/Def&#174; (1.5 pt/acre) </li>
<li>Dropp 50WP&#174; (0.2 LB/acre) </li>
<li>Harvade&#174; w/ Crop Oil (8 oz/acre + 1 pt/acre) </li>
<li>Harvade w/ Crop Oil + Prep&#174; (6.5 oz/acre 1.33 pt/acre) </li>
<li>Folex/Def + Prep (0.75 pt + 1.33 pt/acre) </li>
<li>Dropp + Prep ( 0.1 LB/acre + 1.33 pt/acre) </li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, at least five treatments with specific regional applications were included at some 
locations. </p>
<p>Analysis of lint quality data revealed little differences among harvest-aid treatments when 
recommended production practices are followed. Most of the fiber quality differences between the 
untreated check and the harvest-aid treatments were of little practical significance. Harvest aids can 
reduce trash, reduce micronaire and improve color. Harvest aids did not increase white specks or 
neps, reduce strength, length or length uniformity. Even though differences in defoliation efficacy are 
measured, ginning and lint cleaning tend to prevent their being reflected by differences in lint trash 
content. </p>
<p>Data from the 1995 and planned 1996 production years will be incorporated into this study and 
analyzed. A final report will be prepared on performance and fiber quality evaluations. </p>

<p>Objectives: 1. Develop improved germplasm/cultivars adapted to Central and South Texas having 
improved yield potential; 2. Develop germplasm/cultivars having improved fiber properties for 
dryland and irrigated cotton production in Central and South Texas. </p>
<p>The mission of the Cotton Improvement Laboratory is to develop germplasm/cultivars of cotton 
that enhance the position of cotton producers or the cotton industry in Central and South Texas. To 
that end, germplasm/cultivars are developed that have improved yield potential, earliness of 
maturity, improved fiber quality, tolerance of abiotic stresses such as drought or early season cool 
temperatures, resistance to biotic pests such as the Silverleaf Whitefly, bollworm/budworm, 
fleahoppers and nematodes. All of these characteristics must be packaged in a plant phenotype that 
is amenable to mechanical harvest and husbandry. </p>
<p>Four germplasm lines were released in 1993 that possess fiber quality equal to or exceeding the 
New Mexico Acalas. Two of these lines were evaluated for yarn quality by the Texas Tech 
International Textile Research Center at Lubbock. Yarn produced from both lines performed equal 
to Acala 1517-88. Ten experimental strains that range in fiber length from 1.08 to 1.26 inches and 
have fiber bundle strengths ranging from 32 to 37 g/tex are under consideration for release as high 
quality germplasm lines in 1996. Seeds of the 1993 lines were requested by and provided to 15 
seed development companies; eight in Texas and seven outside of Texas. This type of activity and 
release to cultivar development companies insures that genes for adaption to Central and South 
Texas are incorporated into cultivars developed by these firms. </p>
<p>Cotton Improvement Laboratory (CIL) strains 88G-104, 89E-51, 90O-24L, and 91D-92 are 
under consideration as releases in 1995-96. CIL 91D-92 is an early-maturing strain that combines 
high yield potential and high strength. It has performed well in most of Central and South Texas. 
CIL 89E-51 combines a maturity level about like DPL 50 with excellent yield potential and 
excellent fiber quality. This strain also is unique in that it combines tolerance to the Silverleaf 
Whitefly with hairy leaves and stems that provide resistance to the cotton fleahopper. Strain 
88G-104 is a full-season genotype similar to DPL 90 while 90O-24L is an okra leaf genotype that 
is well adapted to Central and South Texas. </p>

<p>In plants, environmental stress such as drought, temperature extremes or herbicides generally 
causes oxidative stress which results in decreased growth and yield. Plants have a natural 
antioxidant defense system, and numerous researchers have shown that plants with the capacity to 
up regulate this defense system grow and produce better yields when subjected to environmental 
stress. In recent years, our laboratory has shown that salt stress causes oxidative damage in cotton. 
In 1995, we provided additional information which demonstrated that whole plants and callus tissue 
from those cotton cultivars that exhibit elevated antioxidant activity grow better under high salinity 
conditions than those cotton cultivars that exhibit lower antioxidant activity. In addition, we have 
initiated a series of experiments using ovule culture to examine the effect of salt stress on fiber 
development. </p>
<p>We have also used ovule culture to examine the effect of low temperature on fiber development. 
The adverse response of cotton fiber development to cool temperature has been shown to be at 
least partly an ovule/fiber specific event. To date, the exact mechanism of this event is not 
understood. Several low-temperature-related changes during ovule development are often 
associated with the induction of oxidative stress. Hence, it may be that chilling injury results in the 
production of activated oxygen species which then somehow interferes with cellulose synthesis. If 
this be the case, increased antioxidant activity might result in a greater tolerance to chilling injury. 
Variations in tolerance to chilling among cultivars have been demonstrated, and results from 
research in our laboratory during 1995 show that varietal differences in antioxidant enzyme 
expression also exist. The biochemical information gathered from these studies will be helpful in 
developing cotton cultivars which produce better yields under stress situations, and we are in the 
process of transferring additional antioxidant genes into cotton to determine if this will improve 
stress tolerance. </p>

<p>Cotton production (quality and quantity) on the High Plains of Texas is limited by the number of 
seasonal heat units. Because cotton is a &quot;cold sensitive&quot; plant, many producers wait until mid-to-late 
May to plant to ensure getting a good stand under the warm soil conditions. However, this means 
that the crop will likely be maturing under cool fall conditions and consequently, risk lower yields 
and fiber quality. This study was initiated to determine if varieties and breeding lines with late season 
cold tolerance could be identified during the seedling stage. This would mean that a relationship 
exists between both early and late season cold tolerance. Therefore, screening for this trait in a 
breeding program could be accomplished in a short growing period without initially having to take 
all lines to full maturity. </p>
<p>This study is being conducted in cooperation with Dr. John Gannaway (Cotton Breeder - TAES, 
Lubbock). During 1995 thirty-two entries (14 commercial varieties and 18 breeding lines in Dr. 
Gannaway's program) were evaluated for cold tolerance in both the laboratory and field. In the lab, 
the entries were subjected to 22 laboratory tests evaluating seed germination and seedling growth 
under cool/cold conditions. In addition, the entries were planted in the field at two planting dates 
(April 12 and June 9) and evaluated for yield and fiber properties at the end of the season. The 
laboratory data and field data were correlated to identify any laboratory data on seedling 
performance that was related to late season cold tolerance. </p>
<p>The best laboratory test for evaluating late season cold tolerance was the EC5 test. This involved 
soaking a sample of seed in water at 41&#176;F (5&#176;C) for 24 hours. After 24 hours the water was 
removed and the electrical conductivity of the wet seed measured after reaching room temperature. 
This suggested that seed not damaged by imbibing cold water was more cold tolerant during late 
season as evidenced by higher yield and fiber with higher micronaire, uniformity index, and strength 
values. Other tests that gave moderate correlations were the Cool Germination Test (seed 
germinated at 64&#176;F for 7 days) and the Pouch Test (seedlings evaluated for root and shoot growth 
in plastic pouches after being exposed to 41&#176;F for 24 hours followed by 4 days at 86&#176;F). </p>
<p>These and additional tests are being evaluated in 1996. </p>

<p>This project has the goal of improving cotton stress tolerance, with emphasis on developing cotton 
germplasm which can resist drought and high temperature stress better than existing cultivars grown 
beltwide. </p>
<p>We have taken a dual approach to solving this problem. First we have developed advanced strains 
selected from progeny of some superior plants drawn from Arizona- adapted upland and Pima 
materials. These hybrid-origin lines have been rigorously screened for excellent seed vigor and 
germinability, as well as for productivity judged by single plant boll yield and by superior fiber 
quality characteristics when field grown. In these field tests, significant drought stress was imposed 
on these strains at the same time high night temperatures occurred. One outstanding selection 
resulting from this strategy is now entering its second year of multiple location variety trials. </p>
<p>At the same time we have evidence that we can isolate a cotton gene that controls the synthesis of a 
protein which helps protect chlorophyll pigments in leaves from rapid breakdown during plant 
growth under high heat and high light intensity. We are presently using computer technology to 
verify that the DNA sequence of the protein of the gene we have isolated is correct, and to 
construct DNA &quot;primer&quot; molecules to pull out the entire gene. This complete gene will be 
ballistically &quot;injected&quot; into immature cotton embryos of the superior strains we are developing in the 
field component of this project. The embryos will be &quot;rescued&quot;; plants will be grown out in our 
recombinant DNA greenhouse and activity of the introduced pigment-protector gene confirmed. 
Field trials of these plants will then be undertaken to establish the potential benefit of the extra, 
protective proteins in maintaining the flow of nutrients from leaves into developing bolls under 
severe environmental stresses. </p>

<p>The future of transgenic cottons will depend upon the insertion of large multiple gene fragments. 
This project's goal was the development of the necessary procedures to permit the use of the large 
fragments. </p>
<p>Based on pBeloBAC11 system, we have constructed pBACKAN, a unique cotton plant 
transformation vector, which contains a plant selectable marker, NPTII gene for kanamycin 
resistance. Kanamycin resistance is introduced into the plant tissue to allow the elimination of all 
nontransformed material in the culture. Using this vector, we constructed a partial BAC library of 
2000 cotton clones. The cotton insert size ranges from 50 kb to 200 kb. </p>
<p>We have optimized the conditions for transient transformation using particle bombardment both in 
tobacco and cotton, which was followed by stable transformation. We have introduced 
pBACKAN vector with or without insert both in tobacco and cotton. The cotton clone selected to 
be used for stable transformation contains a 50 kb insert. We have one transformed tobacco form 
pBACKAN, vector alone, which showed resistance to kanamycin and specs of gus. The gus gene 
is used as a marker gene that imparts a distinctive blue color to the transformed tissue. It was 
co-transformed with pBACKAN and pRLT2GUS (described in previous report). Several shoots 
were obtained from same and other experiments with cotton which are yet to be analyzed. We 
have obtained 7 putative transgenic tobaccos and several cotton shoots transformed with 
pBACKAN with insert (pBACKAN50). The cotton line used for above experiment was MAR-2. </p>
<p>As previously reported before, regeneration of cotton through tissue culture in Coker 312 was 
followed by a stable transformation using agrobacteria containing pBI121. pBI121 contains a 
NPTII gene for kanamycin resistance and gus reporter gene for easy detection of transformant. At 
this point, we have obtained transformed calli from MAR-2 which showed very blue color when 
assayed for gus enzyme. </p>
<p>In addition, embryogenic cultures obtained through tissue culture from Coker 312 were subjected 
to bombardment with pBACKAN50 and pRLT2GUS. Stained tissues showed several blue spots 
3 weeks post bombardment. They are being selected on kanamycin. This project has achieved its 
goal of developing a method of placing large segments of genetic material into cotton plants and is 
not funded in 1996. </p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated funds were used as matching funds for a grant from the Texas Advanced 
Research Program, &quot;Molecular Alterations of Source/Sink Carbohydrate Metabolism to Improve 
Cotton Yield&quot;, $136,370 for 1994-95, C.H. Haigler and Scott Holaday, co-P.I.s. The past and 
promised support of Cotton Incorporated was critical to the success of this proposal and the 
extension that was recently awarded to us by the Texas Advanced Technology Program for 
1996-97 ($149,872). This provides a good example of leveraging of Cotton Incorporated research 
funds so that progress in understanding cotton physiology occurs faster. </p>
<p>In 1995, Cotton Incorporated funds were used to carry out transformation of cotton possessing a 
gene that may allow more efficient fiber cellulose synthesis under the cool night temperatures that 
frequently occur on the Southern High Plains of Texas and in other temperate growing regions. If 
the gene has the expected effect, more mature fibers would be routinely produced during the limited 
growing season because more substrate would be available for cellulose synthesis at all times. 
Toward the end of 1995, the first primary transformed plants were recovered. In 1996, these 
primary transformants and future generations derived from them will be analyzed by molecular and 
biochemical techniques in the laboratory, and, finally, by field testing. If a heritable trait is present 
that confers advantageous results, the plants will be transferred to breeders for crossing with 
commercial cultivars. Even if this particular gene does not cause the hypothesized effect (due to our 
limited knowledge of cotton fiber biochemistry), the transformed plants will almost certainly aid in 
designing future transformation strategies. In addition, Cotton Incorporated funds were helpful in 
our continuing analyses of changes in fiber metabolism associated with cool temperatures, which 
will be helpful in designing future transformation strategies. For example, due to the work of Dr. 
D.P. Delmer and coworkers and our collaboration with them, we are now able to predict better 
than was possible even one year ago which specific genes in the cellulose biosynthetic pathway 
might be most advantageous to manipulate to achieve cool tolerance. We are optimistic that we 
have now reached the time when we will be able to solve the problem of fiber maturity in a limited 
growing season. </p>

<p>The objectives of our project are to: initiate new transformation trials using TAES cotton and the 
TAMUS shoot apex/<i>agrobacterium</i>-mediated transformation method we developed (TAMUS, 
US Pat. No. 5164310); improve the efficiency of the plant transformation/regeneration process; 
and evaluate recovered plants for incorporation of transferred genes into chromosomal DNA. </p>
<p>We are using TAES lines: 91D-92, 94Q-18, 94L-26, Tamcot HQ &amp; Tamcot Sphinx from the 
breeding programs of C.W. Smith, K. El Zik &amp; P. Thaxton and Stovepipe from J. Gannaway's 
program. We have recovered rooted, transformed, shoots of &quot;Sphinx&quot; and &quot;Stovepipe&quot; and are 
exploring ways to increase transformation rate: by protecting <i>Agrobacterium</i> virulence, promoting 
transformability of plant cells in the apex, as well as investigating new genetic constructions that may 
help us improve transformation efficiency. We have decided not to assay regenerated plants for 
beta-glucuronidase activity (GUS). Instead, we will screen the DNA from each regenerated plant 
using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR primers were designed and a working method 
developed which we are using to screen regenerated cotton plants for the transferred genes (<i>uidA 
</i>and <i>nptII</i>), for <i>Agrobacterium </i>contamination, and for a low copy native cotton gene (an internal 
control). Seed from both F<font size=1>1</font> and F<font size=1>2</font> progeny of regenerated plants are being germinated and 
screened using this procedure. </p>
<p>We have received funding from the Texas TxCOT Biotechnology Initiative and from the Texas 
Applied Technology Programs for research to improve Texas cotton through genetic engineering. 
The projects will be carried out with Dr. Keller, Plant Pathology Department, TAMU. The goals of 
this research are to increase resistance to fungal pathogens and to reduce Aflatoxin production by 
transformation of commercial cotton genotypes with resistance genes isolated from other plant 
species, i.e., soybean. We will also be working in collaboration with Dr. Ed Cleveland's research 
group, USDA, New Orleans, which is well established in this area of expertise. </p>

<p>In the current Cooperative Agreement &quot;Development of Fiber Strength&quot; Project 95-242 we have 
investigated the development of fiber strength in 3 species of cotton i.e. <i>Gossypium arboreum</i> 
(Dessi), <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> (MD51ne) and <i>Gossypium barbadense</i> (Pima S-7) and in an 
immature cotton fiber mutant (TM-1). Our results with MD51ne for the 1994 season indicate (1) 
80% of the total fiber strength is developed in fibers 20-25 days post anthesis (dpa); (2) 60-80% 
of secondary wall thickening occurs after 25 dpa and only contributes 20% to the total fiber 
strength. </p>
<p>The expression of the homozygous recessive <i>im im</i> gene in field grown TM-1 cotton leads to a 
60.9% reduction in single fiber strength and a 69.2% reduction in crystalline cellulose content. In 
mutant TM-1 plants grown in the greenhouse in the winter, the single fiber strength was reduced by 
only 29%. The expression of the <i>im im</i> gene in field grown plants affects the secondary wall 
deposition of cellulose and associated fiber strength. The growing of plants in the greenhouse during

<p>The application of DNA diagnostics in cotton breeding is still in its infancy. Much of the work has 
been done using Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLPs) and other technologies 
cumbersome to apply to the thousands of samples which a single breeder typically examines in a 
single season. Molecular breeding programs thus require DNA diagnostic assays that are rapid, 
cost-effective and can be performed on thousands of samples. The long-term goal of our project is 
the development of such technology as will allow for the cost effective screening of breeding 
populations for agronomically important traits. Our current research involves primarily two areas: 
first, to pinpoint unique genetic tags consisting of single nucleotide differences called Single 
Nucleotide Polymorphic Markers (SNP's) in the composition of a sample's DNA and associated 
with specific traits. Second, the optimization of a new technique (TaqMan assay) to detect SNPs in 
the composition of a sample's DNA without using gels. We are currently testing this TaqMan assay 
on a tag for the amylose content in rice with very promising results. To find SNPs, we are using an 
F<font size=1>2</font> population derived from a cross between <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> TM-1 and <i>Gossypium 
barbadense</i> 3-79 (provided by Dr. Russel Kohel USDA/ARS). There are several groups using 
this population in their gene tagging programs. We are scanning for SNPs by a technique called, 
Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP). AFLP's use specific rather than random pieces 
of genetic to generate fragments which allows us to fine tune the number of fragments produced by 
testing various primer combinations. </p>
<p>All of our analysis was performed using Applied Biosystems AFLP Plant Mapping Kit which uses 
fluorescently labeled primers to mark the fragments that are subsequently analyzed on an ABI373 
Stretch Automated DNA Sequencer using GeneScan 672 software and Genotyper 1.1 for further 
data manipulation. This project began in mid 1995 and during this period, 64 primer combinations 
were screened using the two parents and two samples from the segregating population finding an 
average of 7 polymorphisms per primer combination. </p>
<p>By providing a cost-effective way to apply current and future DNA markers to ongoing practical 
breeding problems, this project should enhance the use of transgenetic breeding. </p>

<p>This project started funding September 1995. Supplies and equipment have been purchased for the 
continued glass-house propagation of cotton varieties DP 50, DP 90 and MD 51. Experiments 
were initiated to examine the biological control of fiber initiation. Previous work in my laboratory 
indicated that sub-cellular protein polymers, called microtubules, may be involved in regulating 
various aspects of fiber development (i.e., initiation, strength, fineness, and reversal patterns). To 
study the possible relationship between microtubules and fiber initiation, various chemical agents, 
known to modify microtubule function were applied to cotton ovules at the time of fiber initiation. 
To facilitate treatment and observation, cotton ovules were extracted from flowers and grown in 
culture, using well established techniques. Current experiments compare MD 51 and DP 50 cotton 
varieties. Ovules were treated for 2 days with Oryzalin, Colchicine (agents which disrupt 
microtubule stability and function) or Taxol (an agent that stabilizes and enhances microtubules in 
cells). After two days of treatment, ovules were examined for changes in fiber number (initiation 
rates) and morphology (size and shape). </p>
<p>Both MD 51 and DP 50 cotton varieties responded in a similar, but not identical manner to the 
chemical treatments. Agents which disrupt microtubules (oryzalin and colchicine) reduce fiber 
initiation between 20% to 40%. MD 51 appears more susceptible to these agents than is DP 50. 
Stabilizing microtubules with taxol increased fiber initiation by 8-10%, with DP 50 exhibiting greater 
response to taxol than MD 51. As data is limited, further data collection is necessary before it can 
be concluded that a significant fiber increase has been induced. Ovules in all treatments exhibited 
&quot;multicellular fibers&quot;, rows of cells with fiber-like morphology. Multi-cellular fiber production 
appears to be a function of the ovule culture technique and not the chemical agents applied since all 
samples, including controls exhibit these cells. It has not yet been determined if multicellular fibers 
are the result of dividing cells being induced to form fibers or fibers that have been induced to 
divide. </p>
<p>Together, these data indicate that fiber number can be manipulated by changing the growth 
conditions of the ovule. This can occur even after flower fertilization since all ovules were studied 2 
days post anthesis. Cell development into fibers is not fixed, but rather is pliable, capable of 
responding to changes in growth conditions. Ovule epidermal cells (which produce fibers) can be 
&quot;reprogrammed&quot; to either produce fibers or not, in response to chemical treatment or growth 
conditions. These data indicate that if conditions can be modified within the growing cotton boll, 
then fiber yield per boll can be changed. The experiments conducted indicate that microtubules 
within the epidermal cells are involved in the programming of fiber initiation. Understanding the 
parameters of fiber initiation can provide useful information for the improvement of yield in cotton. </p>

<p>Objectives of this research were to: 1) determine the optimum conditions for stable incorporation of 
DNA into germline cells by particle gun bombardment of split meristems, 2) determine the optimum 
medium for recovery of meristems after bombardment, and 3) determine if a &quot;window&quot; exists during 
which zygotic embryo development in which somatic embryogenesis can be induced in any 
genotype of cotton. </p>
<p>This project was not funded until September, 1995, however, the initial phases of the project are 
well underway. Equipment and supplies were purchased and new personnel trained. Three 
experiments designed to optimize particle size and type, target distance, and particle gun pressure 
were completed. However, there was a problem with the quality of the DNA isolated from our 
vector and we did not obtain good results. That problem is now being corrected. </p>
<p>Plants were established in the greenhouse to provide a uniform seed source for objectives 1 and 2, 
and embryos for objective 3. Harvest of embryos will begin immediately after the first of the year. 
We completed field harvesting of embryos and shipped them to our DOE collaborators in Idaho 
and Utah. The purpose of this collaboration is to develop a more defined medium for immature 
embryo recovery, callus formation, and/or direct somatic embryogenesis. The analysis of the 
contents of the nucellus is now complete and the data is being analyzed. A new medium will be 
designed by the group based upon the results. </p>

<p>The Insecticide Resistance Action Committee (IRAC) in conjunction with Cotton Incorporated and 
the National Cotton Council published a brochure and poster in 1995 on insecticide resistance 
management. The brochure, written in &quot;user-friendly&quot;, non-technical language explains why 
insecticide resistance develops and provides basic strategies for managing resistance. The 
accompanying poster lists the basic guidelines for resistance management. Brochures have been 
distributed 1) to attendees of the Crop Management Seminar-1995, 2) to attendees of the 1996 
Beltwide Cotton Conference and 3) included in mailings of the IMP Newsletter for the Lower Rio 
Grand Valley in Texas. Another 1,300 posters have been distributed to gins for display in their

<p>Knowing when to terminate insecticide treatments is one of the most perplexing decisions a cotton 
grower faces in managing a cotton crop. High control costs and possible resistance management 
problems must be balanced with the desire to protect any bolls that might contribute to lint yield. 
The key to this dilemma is the identification of the last effective boll population and the date when 
that cohort of bolls has reached physiological maturity and is no longer susceptible to boll weevil 
and bollworm damage. Decision rules developed in Arkansas suggest that the last effective boll 
population corresponds to the cohort associated with a Nodes Above White Flower (NAWF) 
equal to five and that after these bolls have accumulated 350 heat units (HU) they are mature 
enough to sustain a very low probability of insect damage and no further insecticide treatments are 
needed. An expert system, COTMAN, has been developed to facilitate the implementation of 
these decision rules. Cotton Incorporated initiated a multi-state project in 1995 to validate the 
insecticide termination rules of the COTMAN expert computer program. </p>
<p>The hypothesis being tested at two sites each in Texas and Mississippi and one site each in 
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Virginia is: Insecticide applications for protection of bolls can be 
terminated when bolls have accumulated 350-450 HU following cutout at NAWF = 5 with no 
negative impact on the quantity and quality of lint yields. </p>
<p>A set of standardized procedures is being followed at each of the multiple locations. Replicated 
treatments where insecticide applications are terminated at NAWF=5, NAWF=5 + 200HU, 
NAWF=5 + 350HU, NAWF=5 + 500HU and NAWF=5 + 650HU were established in small 
plots. </p>
<p>During the early part of the season several grower fields are monitored in order to locate sites with 
suitable conditions for large on-farm experiments. Sufficient late season infestations of boll weevil 
and bollworm are critical to adequately test the system. Strips of 7 to 10 acres each are set aside in 
the selected fields for these two treatments: insecticide applications terminated at NAWF=5 + 
350-450HU and termination occurring at NAWF=5 + &gt;500 HU representing the grower's normal 
practices. Economic analysis for the project is being conducted by Dr. Mark Cochran at the 
University of Arkansas. </p>
<p>Preliminary results for 1995 small-plot experiments indicate that there is probably no yield decrease 
from boll weevil and bollworm damage associated with terminating insecticide treatments at 
NAWF=5 + 350HU. Additionally, when all the on-farm data are analyzed as a group, regression 
analysis can show that the rule resulted in statistically significant and higher lint yields of 49 lb/acre. 
Similar analysis on the net revenue returns indicates statistically higher returns of $46 to $53 per 
acre. </p>
<p>In 1996, plans are to follow the same standard procedures as outlined above with an expanded 
range of conditions to include: 1. late planted/delayed crop; 2. fields of <i>Bacillus thuringensis</i> 
transgenic cotton; 3. infestations of late season defoliating pests; and 4. infestations of high numbers 
of late season boll-feeding pests. Also, in 1996 the working group will expand to include a greater 
contingent of Cooperative Extension Service representatives and literature suitable for the various 
end-user groups will be developed. In future years additional sites will be added to the validation 
process. </p>

<p>This is a summary of projects 94-107,-110, and -123, by Drs. C.C. Chu, T.J. Henneberry, and 
S.E. Naranjo of USDA-ARS, Western Cotton Res. Lab., Phoenix, AZ; P.C. Ellsworth, University 
of Arizona, Maricopa; R.L. Nichols and M.D. Watson of Cotton Incorporated; D.G. Riley, Texas 
A&amp;M University, Weslaco; N.C. Toscano, University of California, Riverside; and T.F. Watson, 
University of Arizona, Tucson. </p>
<p>A regional project was done in 1994 and 1995 to determine action threshold for the silverleaf 
whitefly. Populations were treated with a standard tank-mix of Danitol&#174; + Orthene&#174; by ground 
equipment whenever adults per leaf-turn (ALT) exceeded counts of 2.5, 5, 10, or 20. Non-treated 
plots served as checks. Treatments were continued through defoliation. All treatments were 
replicated five times in a latin square design. Whitefly eggs, nymphs, and adults were counted 
weekly from 30 days after planting. Other pests, such as lygus and pink bollworm, were treated as 
needed. All plots were harvested, hand-ginned, and lint yields determined. Samples of lint were 
tested by HVI and with a manual sticky cotton thermodetector. </p>
<p>While no treatable levels of whiteflies were found at the Bakersfield, CA site in 1995, whitefly 
populations at the other four sites were higher in 1995 than in 1994 and were very high in Weslaco, 
TX. The number of insecticide treatments triggered by the experimental protocol decreased with 
increasing threshold levels (ALT), and varied among sites, with higher numbers of treatments 
required at sites with relatively higher overall levels of whitefly infestation. Adult population densities 
did not differ between thresholds of 2.5 and 5 ALT or between 10 and 20 ALT; but differences 
were found between the lower and higher threshold ranges, and between the densities in these 
threshold ranges and those of the untreated check plots (P &lt; 0.05). Lint yields were adversely 
affected by high whitefly populations and cool spring temperatures in Arizona and California, and 
by other pest problems in Yuma (lygus) and Weslaco (aphid, beet armyworm). There were no 
differences in lint yields among treatments using thresholds of 2.5, 5, nor 10 ALT; while yields with 
all three of these treatments were higher than those using thresholds of 20 ALT or those of the 
untreated plots (P &lt; 0.05). Stickiness data were poorly correlated with treatment thresholds. In 
general most treatments within a site were sticky or non-sticky because of high whitefly populations 
or environmental variables, such as rainfall, and possibly humidity during the post-defoliation period. </p>
<p>Treatment at thresholds of 10 ALT prevented yield loss, but no treatment thresholds consistently 
prevented stickiness when infestations were high. Treatment at thresholds of 2.5, 5, and 10 ALT 
resulted in an average of 7.5, 5.8, and 4.6 applications at sites with heavy populations (5 of 9 
site-years). </p>

<p>Cotton aphids can be serious pests of cotton. Large populations stunt plants, delay maturity, and in 
the western U.S., cause sticky cotton. Cotton aphid populations are frequently decimated in 
midsouth cotton by a naturally occurring fungus. Fungus outbreaks (epizootics) have regularly 
occurred in July since 1988. The fungus frequently reduces aphid populations to levels below the 
economic injury level. Many cotton growers count on the natural control provided by this fungus 
and refrain from using insecticides for aphid control once the fungus has been detected in their area. 
Methods have been developed to sample fungus levels in cotton aphid populations to predict the 
occurrence of epizootics. Progress has been made in the culture, production, storage, and handling 
of the fungus. These advances have made it possible to test the fungus in augmentative and classical 
biological control releases. Unfortunately, this fungus does not appear to be present in the San 
Joaquin Valley of California. The objectives of this project are to: 1) develop methods for releasing 
the fungus into cotton aphid populations, 2) release the fungus into cotton aphid populations in 
Arkansas and California, 3) determine the types and densities of aerial spores of the fungus present 
in cotton fields during epizootics for use in predicting aphid declines due to the fungus. </p>
<p>Release of the fungus was successful in increasing fungus infections in field populations of cotton 
aphids. In Jefferson County, Arkansas, infection rates of the fungus were 22% higher in treated 
plots 5 days post-treatment than in control plots. In cotton plots in Shafter, California, significantly 
more aphids were infected by the fungus in treated plots and the fungus provided about 15% 
control for several weeks. Release of the fungus shows promise for increasing natural control of 
cotton aphids in western and midsouth cotton. If the fungus persists and adapts to climatic 
conditions in California it could provide significant permanent control of cotton aphid in the San 
Joaquin Valley. </p>
<p>Aerial spores of the fungus were monitored with Rotorod and Burkard spore traps. Enormous 
numbers of fungus spores were found in cotton fields during epizootic periods, reaching peak 
concentrations of 58,327 primary conidia per cubic meter of air. Spore discharge was periodic with 
greatest numbers discharged between 0100 and 0300 hours. Aerial spores appear to be an 
important factor in the rapid development of epizootics and may be involved in area wide 
development of epizootics. Monitoring of aerial spores may provide a method for predicting 
epizootics on a state-wide level. </p>

<p>The boll weevil is the primary insect pest of cotton (<i>Gossypium hirsutum L</i>.) in the Texas Rolling 
Plains. Control of this insect is key to successful cotton production. Uniform planting of cotton 
during the last half of May is a basic part of recommended boll weevil management practices in the 
area. When uniform planting is used, boll weevil control with insecticides during the growing season 
is seldom economical at yield levels &lt;1 bale/acre. Dryland cotton is grown on 90-95% of the 
acreage, and the average yield level is about 300 lb/acre. Alternative methods are needed to 
control the boll weevil. Effective harvest-aid chemicals used to terminate the crop before early 
October can reduce the number of boll weevils entering diapause and thus reduce winter survival. 
This should reduce or possibly eliminate the need for in-season insecticide applications. </p>
<p>Tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of harvest-aid chemicals on reducing fall boll weevil 
food supply and on yield and fiber quality of cotton. Ginstar&#174; was used in a test at Chillicothe 
(Herdsman County). Other materials were compared with Ginstar in tests in Wilbarger County 
(northern Rolling Plains). Ginstar also was used in a producer's field in Runnels County (southern 
Rolling Plains). </p>
<p>In the northern Rolling Plains, rainfall during the growing season (May 1 through September 30) 
exceeded the 90-year record by 8 inches. The excessive rainfall caused (replanted) cotton to 
develop and mature late, resulting in poor conditions for harvest-aid use. The harvest-aid treatment 
was effective in removing the boll weevil food source and reducing the amount of damaged fruit 
forms when it was applied In late September (LS), but yields were adversely affected. </p>
<p>Yield of HS-26 dryland cotton (Chillicothe) was reduced by the LS application of Ginstar to the 
later maturing variety. Yield of CAB-CS, the earlier maturing variety, was not reduced by the LS 
harvest-aid treatment, but CAB-CS yields were lower than those of HS-28. Lint grade factors 
determining CCC loan price were not adversely affected by harvest-aid treatments in this test. The 
number of boll weevils in the untreated check plots began declining in mid-October, coinciding with 
the declining food source. Because of the lateness of the crop, there was no opportunity for cotton 
regrowth which normally provides the primary source of squares and small bolls in October. </p>
<p>In the test in Runnels County (southern Rolling Plains), the harvest-aid treatment was partially 
effective, but an abundant food supply was available beyond the critical October 1 date because of 
the late maturity of the crop and mid-October harvest-aid application date. Color grade was lower 
for the untreated check, but there were no other major effects of harvest-aid treatments on lint 
quality in large scale tests in Wilbarger County, but low micronaire values for all treatments 
reflected the poor growing conditions. </p>

<p>In Arizona, 1995 resistance monitoring results confirmed significant resistance to specific 
insecticides in whitefly populations found across regions of Arizona. A high level of whitefly 
resistance was found for fenpropathrin (Danitol&#174;) and fenpropathrin + acephate (Danitol&#174; + 
Orthene&#174;) mixtures. Regional differences occurred. Yuma populations were most susceptible, and 
Buckeye populations least susceptible to most insecticides tested. Pyrethroid resistance, 
cross-resistance, and the resistance stability to pyrethroids needs continuing investigation. 
Endosulfan appears to remain effective and may have an important place in chemical rotations. 
New modes of action are urgently needed to increase the diversity of target sites being selected. 
Also, recent evaluations of the University of Arizona Resistance Team support California findings 
regarding the potential for rapid development of resistance to imidacloprid. </p>
<p>In California, after an extensive two and a half years of weekly monitoring of whitefly populations 
from throughout the Imperial Valley, no obvious signs of sustained changes in the relative 
susceptibilities of whiteflies occurred to any of the insecticides monitored. Mixtures of insecticides, 
new compounds with different chemistries, insecticide refuges that maintain susceptible genotypes, 
and high immigration rates into intensively treated fields from surrounding refugia may be mitigating 
resistance development. Greenhouse studies support the use of rotations to delay resistance, but the 
field studies were less conclusive, possibly due to the short time span of the study, relatively small 
size of the treatment plots, and heavy immigration pressure during the experimental period. The use 
of mixtures appears to be advantageous by increasing the toxicity of two chemicals to whiteflies as 
well as by delaying resistance. </p>

<p>There is increasing interest in biological control of insect pests in cotton due to problems of 
pesticide resistance, secondary pest outbreaks (aphids, beet armyworms) and the availability of 
more selective and more costly insecticides. The dramatic decrease in insecticide use following boll 
weevil eradication in the southeast has also provided new opportunities for biological control of the 
remaining insect pests. A necessary component of using natural enemies is the ability to recognize 
key beneficial species and understand their impact on pest populations. This project will publish an 
easy-to-use, pocket-size field guide on natural enemies of cotton arthropod pests for use by cotton 
growers, field scouts and consultants. </p>
<p>Accomplishments to date include a computerized database of more than 400 citations on beneficial 
species (predators, parasitoids and pathogens) attacking pest insects and mites of cotton in the 
United States. These citations were obtained from computerized citation indexes, and from books 
and proceedings not included in computerized sources. Hard copies of about 150 of these citations 
have been organized into a reprint file. These resources will provide the basic information in a 
readily accessible format for writing the text of the handbook in 1996. </p>

<p>Twenty-five field trials (each with 6 or 8 replications) in five San Joaquin Valley counties over a 
three year period included the following treatments: nontreated seed; seed treated with myclobutinol 
(NuFlow M&#174;) for the control of <i>Rhizoctonia</i>-induced damping-off, seed treated with metalaxyl 
(Apron&#174;) for the control of <i>Pythium</i>-induced damping-off, and seed treated with a combination of 
the fungicides. The following parameters were measured: healthy stands from each treatment, soil 
populations of <i>Pythium</i> spp. and <i>Rhizoctonia</i> <i>solani</i> at planting, soil temperature, soil particle 
analysis, salt, calcium, pH and organic matter. In 1993 and 1994, myclobutinol and the combination 
of the fungicides resulted in improved stands in 14 of 18 fields. Metalaxyl had no effect with the 
exception of one field, where metalaxyl significantly increased stands but not to the degree of the 
myclobutinol treatment alone or in combination with metalaxyl. In three fields in 1993-4, no 
treatment significantly increased stands. In 1995, the combination of fungicides increased stands 
relative to the nontreated seeds and was more effective in increasing stands than myclobutinol 
alone. <i>Pythium</i> populations were much greater in 1995 than in 1993-4 and may explain the 
synergistic effect of the fungicides. Covariate analysis of all the data indicated no relationship 
between stand increases due to the fungicide seed treatment and any soil parameters. Heat units 
following planting were not limiting and had no effect. Populations of pathogens were not related to 
benefits of fungicides with the exception of a negative correlation between stand increases due to 
seed treatment with myclobutinol and <i>Pythium</i> populations. Apparently, seed protected with a 
fungicide active against <i>Rhizoctonia</i> are more susceptible to infection by <i>Pythium</i> spp. In general, 
fungicide seed treatments are beneficial regardless of soil type and pathogen populations. </p>

<p>Whitefly-transmitted (WFT) geminiviruses are emerging as important viral pathogens of cotton, 
worldwide. Because they are new pathogens, very little is known about the identity of the viruses, 
how many viruses are involved, about the pathological characteristics of these new virus pathogens 
of cotton, or the level of risk they pose to regional and global cotton production. </p>
<p>In 1995, we initiated a survey of cotton geminiviruses present in cotton growing regions in the US, 
Central America and The Caribbean Basin, and relevant regions in the Eastern Hemisphere. We 
examined virus-infected cotton fields and weeds growing adjacent to those fields, documented the 
symptom types associated with infected plants, and estimated the disease incidence, when possible. 
All isolates were then examined in the laboratory to determine if the disease was caused by a WFT 
geminivirus. To do this, we developed a new assay that utilizes a powerful technology termed 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in which very low levels of geminivirus DNA can be amplified, or 
increased in quantity, in order to obtain more virus DNA for additional laboratory studies. We used 
the PCR-amplified geminivirus DNA to obtain DNA sequences of the virus coat protein gene. </p>
<p>These sequences have been placed in a database, and can now be used for comparative virus 
identification, and in studies to monitor the movement and distribution of these viruses in samples 
obtained from these same and additional study regions. These virus sequences can also be analyzed 
to determine how closely related the viruses are, and if they are new virus pathogens, or have been 
present in cotton growing areas previously. This information, in turn, is important when making 
predictions about the stability of cotton germplasm exhibiting disease resistance, as cultivars 
continue to encounter genetically different geminiviruses and strains of those viruses. </p>
<p>These are all essential steps in assessing the risk that emerging geminiviruses may pose to the 
production of cotton, from local, regional, and global perspectives. Also, we can now provide to 
cotton breeders a broad suite of cotton geminivirus isolates from the Eastern and Western 
Hemispheres disease resistance evaluation in potentially promising germplasm, or in existing cotton 
cultivars. </p>

<p>This was the last year of a three year study to evaluate winter cover crops for cotton production 
systems. Austrian winter peas and wheat cover crops were tested at two sites on the Chillicothe 
Research Station in the northern Rolling Plains of Texas. Tests compared the cover crops as an 
alternative to maintaining bare soil during winter and spring months. Site 1 was located in an area 
with an intermittent high water table, and site 2 was located in an historically drought prone area. </p>
<p>Both wheat and winter peas have the potential to provide a means of reducing erosion. Wheat 
emerges earlier and grows faster in the fall and winter than do peas. Both crops grow rapidly in 
early spring when temperatures begin to warm and have adequate ground cover on April 1st to 
meet NRCS Conservation Compliance Plan requirements for highly erodible soils. Pea cover crops 
do provide sufficient N for the cotton crop, about 30 lb/acre, and do not require the application of 
N as with the other systems. </p>
<p>The three-year average yield from site 1 was 447 lb lint/acre. Cotton in the wheat cover crop 
system produced 483 lb lint/acre compared to the 403 lb lint/acre mean yield of cotton in the pea 
cover crop systems. The continuous cotton rotation without cover crop produced an average lint 
yield of 467 lb/acre. The three-year average yield from site 2 was 330 lb lint/acre, with no-cover 
crop, winter peas, and wheat cover crop yields averaging 351, 342, and 298 lb lint/acre, 
respectively. The wheat cover crop was the lowest yielding system because in 1994, it was not 
terminated early enough and utilized all planting moisture. In subsequent years, the wheat cover 
crop has slightly out- performed the other systems. </p>
<p>In summary, wheat appears to be the best choice for a cover crop because it provides ground 
cover earlier and maintains the advantage longer than peas. Careful management is needed in 
determining when to terminate the cover crop so as not to deplete early season soil moisture. </p>

<p>Adoption of reduced tillage farming practices for irrigated and dryland cotton in the Lower Rio 
Grande Valley of Texas has been slow due to lack of knowledge of benefits and risks under a 
subtropical climate. Conservation tillage reduces wind and water erosion and increases water 
storage in the soil profile, but growers will generally not accept new management practices unless 
they are profitable. </p>
<p>Conservation tillage trials were initiated at dryland and irrigated sites using conventional tillage (CT), 
reduced tillage (RT), and no-till (NT) crop production systems in 1992. Three crop rotational 
schemes were used at the irrigated site and six at the dryland. In 1994, average lint yields among 
tillage treatments were not statistically different. In 1993, yield in RT was significantly greater, and in 
1995 both RT and NT yields were greater than CT. </p>
<p>At both dryland and irrigated sites, cost of insecticides among the three tillage systems was 
identical. Herbicide costs were greater in the RT and NT systems, however, these cost were more 
than recovered due to a reduction in tractor horsepower, equipment repairs and labor costs 
compared to the CT system. Data from this study strongly suggests greater profitability in 
conservation tillage (RT and NT) systems as compared to conventional cotton production. The 
system, however, requires a much higher level of soil and crop management. </p>

<p>Potassium deficiency is widespread in cotton growing areas around the world. Many of the cotton 
producing states have initiated research programs to re-evaluate current K fertilizer 
recommendations, with conflicting results. It is essential that soil scientists across the Cotton Belt 
work together to find principles that are applicable to all soil types. The objectives of this study 
were: 1) to develop a method for predicting cotton response to K fertilization across the U.S. 
Cotton Belt using the K buffering capacity (KBC), 2) to determine the relationship of commonly 
measured soil physical and chemical properties to KBC for a number of diverse, cotton-producing 
soils, and 3) to compare soil extractants and K fertilizer recommendations used across the Cotton 
Belt. Locations were chosen to represent the major soil types across the Cotton Belt. Variations in 
soil texture and clay mineralology are represented in this selection of 45 site-years. Each 
cooperator used varieties and management practices typical of their states. Yield was measured, by 
treatment, in tests with a randomized complete block design with three application rates (0, 50, and 
100 lb K<sub>2</sub>O/acre) and four replicates. Soil samples were taken to the 45 cm depth in 15 cm depth 
increments from each location prior to K fertilization. The following initial physical and chemical 
properties were determined: particle size distribution, clay mineralogy, organic matter content, 
cation exchange capacity (CEC), soil pH, ammonium acetate-extractable K, Ca, and Mg, 
Mehlich-1 extractable K, Ca, and Mg, and Mehlich-3 extractable K, Ca, and Mg. Potassium 
fixation percentage was measured using a seven-day incubation in 10mM KNO<sub>3</sub> with two 
sequential extractions. After clay mineralogy was determined by x-ray diffraction, the soils were 
grouped into seven mineralogical classes. </p>
<p>All of the experimental sites which had yield responses to K fertilizer were in mineralogical classes 
with moderate to high amounts of kaolinite. When K fixation was &lt;100% there was a 44% 
probability of yield response to K. When K fixation was between 100 and 110%, the probability of 
yield response was 23%; and when above 110%, the probability of yield response was 0%. 
Potassium fixation was positively correlated with CEC, and was more highly correlated with 
Mehlich-3 and ammonium acetate extractable K than with Mehlich-1 extractable K. The use of K 
fixation percentage as a predictor of cotton yield response to K fertilization shows promise across 
the Cotton Belt. </p>

<p>Extensive research has been conducted studying the effect of soil nitrogen (N) levels on cotton 
yields. Not only is the total application rate of N critical, the timing for applications has also been 
shown to affect yields. Additionally, variable-rate application of N could further reduce the 
possibility of over application in certain areas of the field while underapplying in others. The cost 
associated with over application has both economical and environmental dimensions. The objective 
of this project was to develop a real-time variable rate N application system based on chlorophyll 
levels in the cotton canopy. This project involves the sensing of N deficiencies within a cotton plant 
and applying supplemental N at a variable rate based on the plant's current need for N. </p>
<p>Field plots were established on the Agricultural Experiment Stations in Jackson and Milan, 
Tennessee for evaluation of the proposed technology. Each plot was 30-ft in length, two rows 
wide. Three plant varieties (DPL 50, Stoneville 132, DES 119) were selected based on their 
potential for plant canopy pigment variations. Each variety was replicated with 0, 30, 60, 90 and 
120 units of N per acre to establish a range of cotton chlorophyll levels, tissue N levels, soil N 
levels, and seed cotton yields. </p>
<p>A portable spectrophotometer was used to measure the reflected light energy in the visible and 
near-IR spectrum for plants in each plot. Each spectral reflectance curve was compared with leaf 
and petiole N analysis and leaf moisture. Tests were conducted at varying stages of plant growth 
between first square and first bloom. Despite the wide range of N levels applied to the test plots, 
little spectral variation and measured N variation was observed at pinhead square. As the growing 
season progressed, plant N levels dropped. The narrow range on N levels early in the season were 
partially due to higher levels of residual N in the soil than was expected. Despite the narrow test 
window for N, indications are that this sensing technology has some possibilities for predicting N 
deficiencies in cotton. These findings are preliminary and extensive analysis and further years of 
testing are necessary. </p>

<p>Potassium (K) deficiency symptoms have been noted on cotton fertilized according to soil test 
recommendations across the belt. Mottled leaves, with necrosis around the edges are clear 
evidence of a problem with K nutrition. Independent use of soil or plant tissue tests have been 
inconclusive. </p>
<p>Because the condition has been observed throughout the belt, a regional project is in progress. The 
objective is to correlate soil fertility tests, soil mineralogy, and plant tissue K levels to diagnose the 
K deficiency condition. Leaf and petiole samples were obtained from locations throughout the 
southern region. Samples were received from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, New Mexico, 
Mississippi, Texas, and Virginia. Leaf and petiole data were found to be highly variable among 
locations. Petiole K levels were found to be higher than those in leaves. There was no clear 
correlation between tissue levels of K and rate of soil applied fertilizer K. Tissue K levels at mid 
bloom were lower than those at first bloom. </p>
<p>At this time, it is not clear whether leaf-tissue or petiole K level is the better predictor of plant K 
status. K content in both tissues varied similarly among locations and sample dates. Large variations 
in tissue K levels among study sites and sample dates indicates that plant tissue data alone is not a 
good indicator of K sufficiency/deficiency in cotton. </p>

<p>Conservation tillage practices offer many benefits to cotton growers, but incorporation of preplant 
herbicides is more difficult using conservation-tillage systems. Maintaining effective residue cover 
while obtaining adequate herbicide incorporation is very challenging. Some growers have had to 
omit the use of a preplant-incorporated herbicide or at least forego incorporation, while others 
apply and incorporate preplant herbicides, but sacrifice much of their residue cover in the process. </p>
<p>A new incorporation tool was developed to allow adequate incorporation of herbicides in a wheat 
cover crop while maintaining residue cover. A flail mower was modified so that the plant residue 
was cut and directed backwards on a sheet metal slide. A spray nozzle and a rolling cultivator 
under the slide applied and incorporated herbicide before the residue fell back over the tilled area. </p>
<p>This concept was tested at the Macon Ridge Research Station in Winnsboro, Louisiana. The 
experimental machine was compared with manually removing and replacing the straw, two different 
ridge-tillage tools and no-till planting. Residue cover using the experimental machine was 
comparable to the other method. There were no differences in stand count or yield in this study. </p>
<p>Although the agronomic results were acceptable, operation of the experimental machine was 
troublesome, and an improved design is being fabricated for testing in 1996. </p>

budworm found in cotton. A common theme in several presentations was that one mutation in one 
gene can give a resistant target protein which is less sensitive to pesticide attack. Gary Thompson of 
Dow Elanco discussed Resistance Action Committees which have been formed by pesticide 
manufacturers to address this problem. Henri Darmency of the French Government INRA 
considered the movement of genes among plants and the related risks in genetically engineered 
crops. Sharlene Matten of the US EPA stressed that pesticide management is an important 
consideration in the government regulation of pesticides and engineered crops. </p>
<p>A book based on the conference and edited by Thomas Brown will be available this summer in the 
ACS Symposium Series. </p>

<p>This project is designed to determine the relationship between the fatty acid composition of both 
membrane lipid and storage oil fatty acid composition and the seed's and seedling's ability to 
germinate and grow under cold conditions (less than 60&#176;F). Both genetic and environmental 
influences during seed development are being evaluated as to their contribution to changes in the 
fatty acid composition of the lipid fractions of seeds and the resultant cold tolerance during 
germination. Seed properties, such as density, were strongly associated with cold tolerance. The 
concentration of saturated fatty acids in the storage oil was positively correlated with cold 
tolerance. This latter result is contrary to published literature and is being thoroughly investigated in 
our current efforts. Based upon the results of these efforts, we can begin to genetically improve 
seedling cold tolerance. </p>

<p>Feeding results indicated that a significantly higher amount of gossypol in expander-produced 
cottonseed meal is available to ruminants than in pre-press solvent extracted meal and screw 
pressed meal. Although gossypol in pre-press solvent extracted meal is more available to ruminants 
than that of screw pressed meal, the difference is not statistically significant. Ferrous sulfate is 
proven effective in inactivating gossypol in soapstock which normally has 4 to 10% gossypol on a 
moisture and volatile free basis. Ferrous sulfate can reduce more than 90% of the total biologically 
available gossypol in soapstock. Lamb diets containing soapstock treated with ferrous sulfate 
showed drastically reduced gossypol level in lamb's blood. At present, Texas A&amp;M Research 
Station in San Angelo is testing the gossypol availability in cottonseed meats, raw flakes, cooked 
flakes, extruded meal, extracted extruded meal, and final cottonseed meal which were collected 
from a Texas mill on the same day. To stop post-processing heat-related reactions, cooked flakes 
and extruded meal were quenched with adequate liquid nitrogen at the point of collection. Feeding 
results of these group of samples will permit the assessment of processing effect on gossypol 
availability in expander-solvent extracted meal. Selected feeding results have been reported at the 
1995 AOCS annual meeting. </p>

<p>Fungi and other microorganisms growing in soil at cotton plantations and gins were collected and 
screened for their potential in removal of free gossypol from cottonseed and cottonseed meal. 
Preliminary results indicate that three fungi, <i>Aspergelus sp</i>., <i>Scopulariopsis sp</i>., and <i>Tricoderma 
veridi</i> may satisfy some of the following criteria: (1) high detoxification rate, (2) rapid growth, (3) 
no toxin produced, and (4) suitability for large-volume and solid-state growth. </p>
<p>In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of how the fungi remove the free gossypol in the 
&quot;cottonseed meat&quot; powder, we have carried out the following experiments: the fungi were removed 
from the growing media by low speed centrifugation. The supernatant &quot;spent media&quot; obtained, i.e., 
the media which contains substances secreted from the fungi but without the presence of the fungi, 
were then added to the &quot;cottonseed meat&quot; powder, and tested as if the &quot;spent media&quot; were effective 
in removing free gossypol. </p>
<p>The &quot;spent media&quot; were not only capable of removing the free gossypol in the &quot;cottonseed meat&quot; 
powder, but they do it more effectively than the fungi. They removed an additional 30-35% of the 
remaining gossypol in the solid &quot;cottonseed meat&quot;. </p>
<p>The results of these studies clearly show that the removal of gossypol from the &quot;cottonseed meat&quot; is 
not the internalization of the gossypol into the fungi, and its metabolism by the fungi. Rather, the 
disappearance of free gossypol appears to be due to its reaction with substances secreted by the 
fungi, since the removal of the fungi does not affect the removal of the gossypol. Indeed, the &quot;spent 
media,&quot; which contain only substance(s) secreted by the fungi are actually more effective. </p>

<p>To increase the utilization of cotton seed and seed by-products, we are using a biotechnology 
approach to develop transgenic cotton germplasm exhibiting a gossypol-free seed phenotype. Our 
strategy is based upon the elimination of gossypol synthesis only in seeds by inactivating the enzyme 
responsible for assembling gossypol precursors. This approach essentially shuts down the entire 
pathway for synthesis of gossypol at the very first step. The energy normally consumed during the 
synthesis of gossypol can be utilized elsewhere and may also increase seed quality as a 
consequence. The gene we have targeted for inactivation in transgenic cotton is called HMG CoA 
reductase (HMGR). </p>
<p>To date, six distinct cotton HMGR genes from <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L. cv. Acala SJ-2 have been 
isolated and partially characterized. The greatest challenge at this point in time is identification of a 
gene or genes that are selectively turned-on or expressed only in glands of the seed and are 
therefore &quot;gland-specific&quot; genes. Efforts continue to analyze the cotton HMGR genes at the 
molecular level to determine which of the six genes is the most likely candidate to target for 
inactivation in transgenic plants. </p>

<p>Gossypol, a polyphenolic binaphthyl dialdehyde which is produced by the cotton plant, limits the 
use of cottonseed and cottonseed meal in rations for nonruminants. Traditionally, free gossypol as 
determined by the Official Method of the American Oil Chemists Society has been used to define 
safe levels of gossypol in animal feeds. However, in numerous studies with poultry, and ruminants 
(cattle and sheep) it has been observed that free gossypol levels in the diet do not correlate with 
either gossypol levels in tissue or toxicity. Recently it has been observed that free gossypol in whole 
cottonseed is much more toxic to chickens and the pre-ruminant lamb than is free gossypol in 
cottonseed meal. Whereas, in cattle and sheep with functioning rumens the opposite is true; free 
gossypol in cottonseed meal is much more toxic than is free gossypol in cottonseed. </p>
<p>Results from an experiment funded in 1994 (Knabe et al., 1995) found that free gossypol intake in 
pigs was highly correlated with gossypol contents of the liver (r=.99) and plasma (r=.96), whereas 
total gossypol intake was not similarly correlated (r=.37 and .49 for liver and plasma gossypol, 
respectively). Plasma and liver gossypol contents were highly correlated (P&lt;.001, r=.95). The 
availability of free gossypol in cottonseed meats appeared to be higher than in the cottonseed meals 
as measured by plasma gossypol contents. </p>

<p>Uncertainty about safe levels for long-term feeding, and concerns about adverse effects of gossypol 
on reproduction have had a negative effect on the use of cottonseed in dairy rations. Defining safe 
levels of cottonseed in dairy rations has been a problem because of the many factors that alter 
gossypol availability and toxicity. Gossypol levels in serum may be useful in determining levels of 
cottonseed that can be fed safely for extended periods. </p>
<p>Serum was obtained from 20 Holstein cows fed a total mixed ration which contained whole, linted 
cottonseed (15%) and cottonseed hulls (3.4%). Ten cows were in early lactation (69 &#177; 7.3 d 
post-partum) and 10 were in late lactation (410 &#177; 24.0 d post-partum). Gossypol was determined 
in cottonseed, hulls and freeze-dried serum by high performance liquid chromatography after 
pre-column derivitisation with (R)-(-)-2-amino-1-propanol. Whole cottonseed contained .677% 
total gossypol with 57.2%(+)- and 42.8% (-)-gossypol. The hulls contained .052% total gossypol 
with 57.7% (+)- and 42.3% (-)-gossypol. Total gossypol intakes ranged from 27.2 g/d (49.7mg/kg 
LW<sup>-1</sup>/day) for the cows in early lactation. Serum total gossypol ranged from 1.20 to 5.8 &#181;g/ml. As 
total gossypol in serum increased, the (+) isomer as a percentage of total gossypol decreased (r= 
-.58; P&gt;.01) and the (-) isomer increased (r= .58; P&lt;.01). The equation for the relationship 
between serum total gossypol in &#181;g/ml (X) and serum (+)-gossypol in &#181;g/ml was Y=.278 + .310X 
(r= .96; P&lt;.01). The equation for (-)-gossypol was Y= -.278 + .690X (r= .99; P&lt;.01). There 
were no signs of gossypol poisoning in these cows. </p>

<p>The elimination of gossypol from the cottonseed without reducing the levels in the plant has required 
the elucidation of the gossypol synthesis pathway. We have found that a key component of this 
pathway is a compound that is converted to the precursors of gossypol, delta-cadinene. A pathway 
for the production of delta-cadinene has been proposed and the mechanism of this pathway is 
consistent with the production of similar substances in the plant. </p>
<p>The enzyme that produces delta-cadinene has been identified and we are in the process of 
sequencing this enzyme. The antisense technology requires the insertion of the gene in a reverse 
orientation. Work is now underway using sequences of the delta-cadinene enzyme to make gene 
constructs that will use the antisense technology to block the formation of gossypol in the seed. </p>

<p>Several individual marketing research projects were conducted during 1995. A survey of 200 feed 
dealers provided additional insight into that market segment. The results clearly showed that the 
difficult handling and storage characteristics of cottonseed greatly limit its use by the feed dealer 
segment. </p>
<p>A survey of cow/calf producers helped establish a strategy for the marketing effort that targeted this 
segment during the fall of 1995. Another survey helped evaluate the effectiveness of our collateral 
marketing materials by contacting a sample of individuals who have received a packet of 
cottonseed information from us as a result of a reader response inquiry. </p>

<p>A series of laboratory studies in conjunction with animal studies was conducted to determine the 
optimum temperature for heat treating cottonseed to improve the utilization of protein when fed to 
dairy cows. The objective of heat treating is to increase the amount of protein escaping degradation 
in the rumen, but not at the expense of protein (lysine) availability in the small intestine. The optimum 
temperature for heat treating cottonseed was found to be the same as we had determined for 
soybeans, namely heating to 295&#176;F, and holding for 30 minutes before cooling. A large scale 
lactation study was conducted to determine the milk production response when properly heated 
cottonseed was fed as part of the daily diet. Fifty-one multiparous cows, divided into three 
treatment groups, were offered diets containing 50% forage and 50% grain. The forage portion of 
the diet contained 2/3 alfalfa silage and 1/3 corn silage. The grain portion of the diet contained high 
moisture ear corn along with either 12% soybean meal, or 6.8% soybean meal with 15% untreated 
linted cottonseed, or 6.8% soybean meal plus 15% heat treated linted cottonseed. Dry matter 
intake (lb/day) and milk production (lb/day) were measured. Heat treating of cottonseed appears to 
increase the nutritive value of cottonseed for lactating dairy cows. &#160;</p>

<p>A study of cottonseed storage structures was conducted to determine the pressure exerted on the 
building walls by cottonseed. Pressure on the wall of a scaled emulation chamber was studied to 
determine whether or not the wall pressure in a cottonseed storage building could be emulated. </p>
<p>Results from these studies indicate that cottonseed exert a pressure on the building as a function of 
the depth and width of the seed pile. A mathematical relationship for wall pressure was established 
as a function of vertical and lateral pressures. The maximum wall pressure in a cottonseed-storage 
building was found to occur at approximately 15 to 20 percent of the total seed depth above the 
floor. </p>
<p>To verify this chamber data, actual cottonseed storage buildings were instrumented with load cells, 
and wall forces were measured. The maximum wall pressure observed for a 19-ft eve-height 
storage building, with seed piled to the 28-30 ft level in the center of the building was 285 lb/ft&#178; and 
occurred at 4.5 ft above the floor. The maximum wall pressure observed in 1995 was 166 lb/ft&#178; for 
a 16-ft depth of seed in a partially filled house (blown against one wall until seed reached the center 
of the floor), without aeration. The maximum forces occurred about 3-4 ft above the floor level. 
Some increase in wall pressure was observed as the seed pile's lateral depth (the width or length of 
the seed pile) increased after reaching the final filling depth. This supports the simulation-chamber 
results that house width and length do have an effect on wall loadings. </p>
<p>Cooling rates of cottonseed were studied in 1994 and 1995 to determine how fast stored seed 
could be cooled with air flow rates of 2.5, 5.0 and 10 cfm/ton. The time required to move a cooling 
front past a level of 6-ft below the seed pile's surface and reduce the seed temperature from 90 to 
70 degrees F, was found to be 6.16 hr/ft for 2.5 cfm/ton, 3.67 hr/ft for 5 cfm/ton and 2.03 hr/ft for 
10 cfm/ton. This would translate into a 147, 88 and 49 hr, respectively, for cooling a 24-ft deep 
seed pile from 90 to 70 degrees F with 2.5, 5, and 10 cfm/ton aeration rates. The test 
demonstrated the need to operate higher aeration rates, such as 10 cfm/ton, on days when the 
relative humidity and ambient temperatures were low and favorable for good storage conditions. 
Slower aeration rates, 2.5 cfm/ton, could and should be operated continuously until seed pile 
temperature's have dropped below 70 degrees. </p>

<p>The production of many transgenic cottons in the future will depend on organ-specific promotors. 
The promotors will switch on genes in only the plant organs where the gene product is needed, thus 
conserving energy for fiber production. This project was initiated in mid 1995 to screen for genes in 
the seed development area but not limited to only that area. A differential display method was 
optimized to be used for the screen. In addition, a new method for promotor isolation called 
&quot;genome walking&quot; was investigated. This method allows the isolation of specific genes to be cloned. 
Cotton tissue is being collected from the germplasm of Dr. Kamal El-Zik, providing a base of 
Texas-adapted material. This project became a Texas State Support project in 1996. </p>
<p>Dr. Rod Wing, the co-investigator of the project, will move to Clemson University in mid 1996 
where he will continue collaboration with Dr. John Mullet who will take the role of lead investigator 
for the project. </p>

<p>Until recently, the production of poured feed blocks was not an option for utilizing whole 
cottonseed. The objectives of this project were to investigate the feasibility of using cottonseed in 
the production of poured feed blocks and to develop techniques to produce the desired product. </p>
<p>A hard block can be formed in a short time using 10 to 35% cottonseed, 30 to 60% molasses, 15 
to 20% water, 3 to 6% MgO and 5 to 7% synergistic binding chemicals. Other ingredients can be 
added to the formulation to balance nutrients of the block. Increasing the levels of cottonseed and 
reducing the amount of molasses resulted in a harder block. High levels of cottonseed in the 
formulation did not create a mixture that was difficult to mix. However, high-cottonseed mixtures 
need to be pressed to compact them enough to develop hardness and reduce volume after being 
poured into an edible cardboard box. </p>

<p>Cottonseed oil currently sells at a price premium over soybean oil because of its pleasant flavor and 
the longer shelf life it gives to potato chips and other snack foods. The shelf life improvement results 
from its higher content of saturated fatty acids. Unfortunately, these same components are raising 
concerns among professional nutritionists studying dietary fat intake. Cottonseed oil contains about 
4 grams of saturated fat per tablespoon serving &#151; approximately twice that of the other major 
vegetable oils produced domestically. In the worst scenario, advocates could urge the elimination of 
cottonseed oil from the domestic food supply - as happened with palm oil about a decade ago, and 
with beef tallow for preparation of french fries. </p>
<p>Although winterization, a process to chill oil and remove the fat crystals that solidify at low 
temperatures, has been used for years in making salad oils that remain clear even if refrigerated, it 
can only remove a minor fraction of the saturated fats. A process, called &quot;temperature directed 
interesterification,&quot; has been adapted at the Food Protein Research and Development Center, 
Texas A&amp;M University. The fatty acid building blocks in cottonseed oil are uncoupled from the fat 
molecules (triglycerides) and are allowed to regroup and precipitate. Through this technique, 
approximately 55-60% of the saturated fatty acids can be removed, putting cottonseed oil in the 
same labeling category as soybean, corn, sunflower, olive, and sesame oils. Cottonseed oil need no 
longer be known as the most saturated vegetable oil produced domestically. </p>

<p>Cottonseed advertising continues to focus on dairymen as the primary target of a marketing strategy 
that is designed to stimulate demand for cottonseed. Print advertising utilizes popular dairy 
publications such as &quot;Hoard's Dairyman&quot;, &quot;Western Dairyman&quot;, &quot;Dairy Today&quot;, &quot;Dairy Herd 
Management&quot;, and others. Sponsorship of the syndicated radio program known as &quot;Dairyline&quot; is 
also used to target dairymen. &quot;Dairyline&quot; runs on over 100 radio stations across the United States. 
Two Latin American dairy publications were used as a vehicle to stimulate demand for U.S. 
cottonseed. </p>
<p>A secondary marketing effort targets feed manufacturers, nutritionists, extension agents, and beef 
producers. Print advertisements in &quot;Feedstuffs&quot;, &quot;Feed Management&quot;, &quot;Progressive Farmer&quot;, 
&quot;Drovers Journal&quot;, and &quot;Beef&quot; were used to reach this audience. This budget item also includes the 
creation and placement of these advertisements. </p>

        year. Now that most dairymen and nutritionists have
        become familiar with the proper feeding practices for

        usually eager to not only sell cottonseed but to also
        provide information on the supply/demand situation. We
        have also put together some historical data that can be

        Being more familiar with the road improves you chances of
        a favorable outcome. In the absence of a crystal ball,

        always be evaluated relative to other feed ingredients.
        Dr. Paul Chandler has prepared a section in this

</b><a name="Overview"><strong>Overview</strong></a><br>
The 1995/96 crop year is one for the record books. Record level
domestic and export demand led to record setting prices for corn
while beans and wheat were strong followers. Little carry in the
market provided no incentive for the warehouseman to hold grain
in the elevator. Because of this, both flat price and basis
firmed in reaction to the large demand and tight supplies. The
following article will outline the fundamental factors that
created the market year passed, and list some of the factors to
watch for in the coming crop year. We will also look at some
tools the end user can use to better manage flat price risk. By
managing this price risk, a user can maintain consistent profit
margins rather than be exposed to huge market swings seen in this
years market. The goal of this information is not to predict
prices in the coming year, but to list the fundamental factors
which will affect or potentially direct this coming crop year's
prices and touch on some of the tools available to manage the
inherent risk of being involved in commodities. </p>

<p><a href="#top"><b><u><img src="images/UPA.GIF"

</b><a name="CORN"><b>CORN</b></a><b><br>
</b>The word <em>volatile</em> doesn&#146;t seem to do justice to
activity in the corn market during the 1995/96 crop year. History
was rewritten with $5.00+ prices amid unrelenting export demand
and limited domestic feed rationing. To help understand how the
market reached these new heights, it&#146;s important to review
the supply and demand fundamentals for this past year.</p>

<p>Many factors took a toll on the 1995 corn crop. First,
persistent rain throughout the spring delayed planting progress.
Frustrated producers were forced to wait until June to get the
crop in the ground in many areas, and yields suffered as a
result. In addition, blistering heat scorched the Midwest in July
and August further dampening production potential. As a final
insult, an early frost in September nipped the crop in some areas
reducing test weights. When all the dust had settled, production
totaled just under 7.4 billion bushel, a far cry from the 10.1
billion total posted in 1994. Beginning stocks of 1.6 billion
bushel helped cushion the decline somewhat, although total
supplies were down 18% from 1994/95.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, there were also some interesting
developments taking place on the demand side. China, once a
powerful competitor in the world export market, continued to
experience rapid economic growth and consumers demanded a more
meat oriented diet. That meant increased domestic livestock
feeding and less grain for export. As a result, China not only
discontinued its export program to various Asian destinations but
also turned to the U.S. for IMPORT needs. This resulted in a
tremendous swing of export business to the U.S. from such key
importers as South Korea and Japan. </p>

<p>On top of that, demand from other Asian countries was growing.
Incomes in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia were on the
rise and they too, wanted more grain to feed their domestic
livestock and poultry industries. Without China available to
service those needs, the U.S. was basically the &quot;only shop
in town&quot; for corn. As harvest progressed, export sales were
extremely brisk and basis levels unseasonably strong. This
pattern continued throughout the winter months, as a weak U.S.
dollar helped lessen the impact of higher prices to the foreign
buyer.</p>

<p>While exports were a driving force behind the stronger market,
changes in the domestic feeding sector also played a key role in
supporting prices. Over the past few years, extensive integration
in broiler and hog production altered the way these producers
viewed their input costs. Where $4.00 corn in the past would have
made them wince with pain and consider scaling back output or
liquidating their operation, they now considered it more a
&#145;cost of doing business&#146; they were able to absorb, at
least over the short-term. As a result, most were able to
maintain their normal buying patterns and corn continued to
disappear into various domestic feeding channels.</p>

<p>What we saw, then, was strong demand for corn from BOTH the
export and domestic sector in an environment of reduced supply.
This combination was enough to push prices above $5.00 this past
summer until values reached a point where some users decided to
re-sell their purchases back into the market at a substantial
profit. In addition, export demand finally started to weaken as
importers looked forward to greater supplies of new-crop at
harvest. While these factors eventually &#145;cooled off&#146;
the market, cash prices in many areas were still near $5.00 at
this writing as tight supplies and uncertainty about new-crop
persisted.</p>

<p>What can we say about 1996/97? It looks like a significantly
large harvest is on the way for 1996. While the USDA projected
the crop at 8.7 billion bushel in August, most believe the crop
has improved somewhat since that time and output could increase
later this fall. On the demand side, the export market may be a
little weaker due to record foreign wheat production, a boost in
coarse grain output and a larger harvest in China. Most believe
China will import less corn in 1996/97, and possibly could be a
small scale exporter. On the domestic scene, liquidation of beef
cows may eventually reign in feeding totals. In addition, hog
numbers will be below year ago levels, at least at the beginning
of the crop year.</p>

<p>In summary, the upcoming crop year could be significantly
different from the 1995/96 with a larger crop and potentially
weaker demand. With stocks remaining at historically low levels,
however, market volatility is likely to remain in place over the
next several months.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><b><u><img src="images/UPA.GIF"
alt="Return to Top" border="0" width="15" height="11"></u></b></a><b>
</b><a name="SOYBEANS"><b>SOYBEANS</b></a><b><br>
</b>While soybean prices were far more tame than corn, there were
nevertheless some interesting supply and demand developments in
1995/96. </p>

<p>Similar to corn, wet field conditions slowed spring fieldwork
in the spring of 1995, forcing more producers to plant in June.
Crops progressed rapidly when temperatures warmed during summer,
although beans seemed to fair better than corn. Still, the final
yield of 34.9 bushel/acre was far below the record setting 41.4
bushel per acre figure posted in 1994. Despite ample beginning
stocks of 335 mil. bushel, total supplies were down 9% from the
1994/95 marketing year.</p>

<p>The soybean market traveled a different path from corn
beginning at harvest. On the heels of a record crop in Brazil the
previous spring, the world market still had plentiful supplies to
meet demand needs. As a result, prices dropped to near $6.00. A
couple of factors were taking hold, however, which would help
support a recovery in values throughout the fall and winter.
First, world protein demand continued to grow, as importers
sought to feed their expanding livestock and poultry industries.
In particular, meal use in China reached a record level, and
other areas followed suit. In addition, relatively low domestic
prices combined with the trend toward integration described
earlier, encouraged U.S. producers to consume greater quantities
of soybean meal. The foundation for a solid demand base was
firmly in place.</p>

<p>As we moved into the winter and spring, it also became clear
the crop in Brazil would be lower than the previous year.
Difficulty obtaining credit hampered planting efforts, while
less-than-ideal weather conditions prevailed during the growing
season. These factors combined to generate a 10% cut in crop size
from 1994 record harvest. On the other hand, production in
Argentina was virtually unchanged from the record level seen the
year before.</p>

<p>After starting out the year on a brisk pace, domestic U.S.
crush levels slowed. Margins dropped considerably from the
exceptionally high levels seen the previous year, resulting in
increased processor downtime in the spring and early summer. The
addition of a number of new processing plants expanded total
capacity, but overall crush was below the record level seen in
1994/95.</p>

<p>While many producers were able to get their corn planted on
time during the spring, soybean progress was another story. More
rain during May and into early June resulted in a record late
planting of the 1996 crop. As with the 1995 crop, the delays
supported prices and reduced yield potential. Still, price never
approached the strength seen in corn due to ample Southern
Hemisphere supplies.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, several factors suggest bean prices could
remain strong during the 1996/97 crop year. First, few believe
the crop can achieve the lofty 36.2 bushel/acre yield projected
by the USDA. Late planting, dry conditions and the possibility of
an early frost could result in yields closer to those seen in
1995. If so, that would result in extremely low total supplies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the tight stock situation would be accentuated by
the potential for increased demand. Due to the smaller crop in
Brazil, U.S. export sales and shipments will likely be higher
than normal during September-February. World protein demand
remains firm, and some believe the USDA&#146;s usage estimates
for China are too conservative. Large imports by China would
likely have to be from U.S. origin. Under this scenario, there
will be great interest in crop growing conditions in Brazil and
Argentina this winter.</p>

than beans. After all, wheat topped its previous all-time high of
$7.00 and generate a great deal of excitement throughout the
grain industry. The factors that propelled the market to these
heights, however, were slightly different. </p>

<p>A combination of a major freeze in Kansas and flooding rains
in Oklahoma resulted in a significant drop in winter wheat
production in 1995. On top of that, planting of the spring wheat
crop was delayed by the same wet weather that plagued the Midwest
and final yields were just average. All told, supplies were down
7% from 1994/95.</p>

<p>On the demand side, exports were very strong for several
different reasons. First, Australia suffered a short crop in
1995, leaving them unable to supply their usual Asian customers.
Next, the wheat crop in Argentina was devastated by drought.
Finally, the European Union placed a tax on exports due to
dwindling domestic supplies. In each instance, the U.S. was ready
to step in and ship wheat to various countries/regions affected
by these developments. </p>

<p>Moving into the spring of 1996, however, the most important
factor affecting prices took shape: U.S. drought in the Central
and Southern Plains. Most of Kansas and Oklahoma received only
minimal precipitation throughout the spring, resulting in the
second consecutive short crop. Prices responded by rapidly
climbing above $6 and then $7 in an effort to ration available
supplies.</p>

<p>While all this was going on, the seeds were literally being
sown for an end to the bull market. Record high prices encouraged
countries throughout the world to boost production. In fact, the
USDA is forecasting record foreign wheat output for 1996/97.
After U.S. prices peaked in late April, the market traded
steadily lower as domestic production exceeded earlier
expectations and export demand prospects were dampened by the
prospects of strong competition from Canada, Australia and
Argentina. </p>

<p>What&#146;s ahead for 1996/97? The current domestic wheat
price scenario appears to be a case of a short crop-long tail
market pattern. Prices peaked early on a supply shortage, and now
are trending lower in an effort to uncover demand. Wild cards to
watch include weather developments in Australia and Argentina, as
well as final crop size in Canada. Unless one of these countries
encounters a significant shortfall in production, however, U.S.
export and price prospects appear dim for the remainder of
1996/97.</p>

</b>As is noted above, fundamentals of the markets listed above
affected the market and made flat price go to historically high
levels. We may see the same next year, or we may see prices drop
to sub three dollar levels, only time will tell. We do not know
what flat price will do in the future even though fundamentals
can give us some direction on the general direction of prices.
There are tools however which can help us manage the fluctuations
in flat price. </p>

<p>One of these tools would be using options. There are two types
of options: call options which is the right but not the
obligation to own, or be long futures at a specific strike
(futures), price, or put options which is the right but not the
obligation to sell or be short futures at a specific strike
price. Ownership of options is done by paying a premium for the
option. Options can be used by an end user to create a maximum
price for the grain which is purchased either on a basis or a
flat price contract. Let&#146;s look at actual examples of
maximum pricing on basis or flat price contracts. The location of
the trades have been changed.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><b><u><img src="images/UPA.GIF" border="0"
width="15" height="11"></u></b></a><b> </b><a
name="FlatPricePurchaseExample"><b>Flat Price Purchase Example</b></a><b><br>
</b>On July 23, Company A purchased 150,000 bushels of OND corn
delivered to Location A flat price (versus the CBOT December
option) at $4.16 per bushel. To manage flat price risk, Company A
purchased 30, December $3.30(strike price) corn puts for $0.19
per bushel (premium). Essentially what this does, is give us a
maximum price of $4.35 per bushel ($4.16 flat price + $0.19
premium). Purchasing these puts would give us downside protection
compared to where we priced the corn. If the price of corn
continues to go higher than what Company A locked in flat price
at, the option will be worth less than the $0.19, but the lower
flat price ownership will help compensate for the lower valued
option. If the flat price goes lower than the floor set by the
$3.30 put, the put will be worth more and thus will help offset
the difference between what you priced your corn at on July 23,
and the lower flat price of corn today (July 31 when this example
was put together). December corn closed at $3.31 ¼ on July 23.
On July 31, December corn traded as low as 3.17 ¼ and as high as
$3.21, giving us a mid range of $3.19. The $3.30 December puts
were trading at $0.25 cents. Flat price on July 31 is $0.12 ¼
cents lower than when the grain was priced, but, the put is worth
$0.06 cents more today than it was when Company A purchased the
option. This $0.06 per bushel could be used to offset the $0.12
¼ difference between today and the July 23 price.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><b><u><img src="images/UPA.GIF" border="0"
width="15" height="11"></u></b></a><b> </b><a
name="BasisPurchaseExample"><b>Basis Purchase Example</b></a><b><br>
</b>On July 29, Company A purchased 150,000 bushel of corn
delivered to Location A at +75Z for OND. In the case of a basis
contract where the flat price is not locked in, our risk is
upside movement in the board. To manage this upside risk, Company
A purchased call options to lock in a maximum price. On July 30,
December corn closed at $3.19 ¾ . Company A purchased 30,
December $3.20 corn calls for $0.17 ¼ . This gives them a
maximum price of $4.12 ¼ per bushel ($3.20 strike price of the
call (ceiling or maximum futures price) + the $0.17 ¼ cost of
the call plus the $0.75 basis). Again, mid range on the December
on July 31 is $3.19 which was not a big change and the December
$3.20 corn calls are trading at $0.17. By purchasing the call, we
know what our maximum flat price will be on this particular
purchase without pricing the contract, leaving our downside
potential to price later unlimited. If, for example, the board
were to drop to $2.50 on the December contract between now and
the day we price, we could pick up as much as $0.53 ($3.20 -
$2.50 = $0.70 lower flat priceless the cost of the call, $0.17 =
$0.53).</p>

<p>The above examples simply show how options can be used to
manage flat price risk. There are many factors to consider and a
thorough understanding of these tools is needed before a
successful hedge program can be implemented. These tools are
meant for risk management purposes and not speculation, to manage
flat price which in turn can maintain, or improve your current
operating margins. The risk of implementing a successful options
based hedge program is known up front in the premium paid for the
option as well as the cost of clearing. The risk of remaining
exposed to flat price risk and not implementing a hedge program
is unlimited. </p>

<p><a href="#top"><b><u><img src="images/UPA.GIF" border="0"
width="15" height="11"></u></b></a><b> </b><a name="Conclusion"><b>Conclusion</b></a><br>
So how big will the corn crop end up being? Will we see the
export demand from the Pacific Rim we saw in the
&#145;95/&#146;96 crop year? How much cattle feeding will we see
in the Southwest reemerge after the rationing we saw this year?
How tight will the bean crop be next year? How much world wheat
will we produce this year to compete with the U.S.? </p>

<p>These are all questions which were answered above for last
year but are yet to be answered for the new crop year. It is
impossible to know what flat price or basis levels will do in the
coming year. Many users did not anticipate and therefore were not
strategically placed for &#145;95/&#146;96, which exposed them to
flat price and basis volatility. The exposure may have cut into
the profit margins seen in years past. Options allow us to lock
in flat price while still remaining open to downside opportunity
as well as upside protection. Options allow us a way to manage
flat price risk knowing our risk up front, the cost of the
premium. Not using risk management exposes us to undefined risk
for an unknown cost.</p>

<p>It is not to late to begin learning and implementing a risk
management program. Now is a good time to be proactive in
managing risk to keep operating profit margins constant and
growing. </p>

<p align="center"><font face="Arial"><strong>AIR-TIGHT BAGS CAN
EFFECTIVELY<br>
STORE COTTONSEED</strong></font></p>

<p>Over several years, dairymen have moved to buying more bulk
commodities as their operations grew in size. With increasing
size, demand for bulk storage facilities has also grown.
Unfortunately, many dairymen do not have the capitol or the cow
numbers to effectively utilize a bulk storage facility.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Utilization of air-tight bags for storage vessels has
become popular among small, medium and large dairy operations
across the United States. The air-tight bags have effectively
been used for storing wet byproduct feeds, haylage, grain and
silage. Although air-tight bags may not be effective on all
operations, it has been an effective management tool for many
dairymen including:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ease of handling with a loader.</li>
    <li>Low capitol investment versus building storage.</li>
    <li>No property taxes on bags.</li>
    <li>Bags can be stored outside and filled at any time.</li>
    <li>Improved flexibility.</li>
</ul>

<p>The use of air-tight bags have allowed producers to purchase
cottonseed during the fall &quot;gin-run&quot; season when prices
are historically low. Some dairymen have purchased and stored all
of their cottonseed for the coming year by using air-tight bags.
Depending on the year, considerable cost savings have been
realized by some producers.</p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated has been researching the use of bags to
store cottonseed for the past two years. It has been determined
that a good rule of thumb is that 8-foot bags hold about .75 tons
per running foot and 12-foot bags hold about 1.5 tons per foot.
Grain style auger baggers work well with cottonseed. However, one
should not try to pack cottonseed too tightly into the bag with a
finger-packer, since damage to the seed could occur. A loose pack
is desirable. Unless the packer is equipped with a wide grain
feeder, it will be necessary to transload the cottonseed into a
forage wagon for delivery into the bagger.</p>

<p>Cotton Incorporated is currently funding an experiment at the
Georgia Coastal Plains Experiment Station. The experiment is
being conducted by Dr. Joe West, Associate Professor, and is
aimed at gleaning further information about bagging cottonseed.
On December 1, six separate bags were each filled with 10 tons of
cottonseed. These included using gin-run seed cooled to 80
degrees F, 90 degrees F, and 80 degrees F with moisture added.
Proprionic acid, a grain preservative was also added to one bag
in each trial. To simulate the on-farm storage environment, all
bags were placed in a lane near a grass field. Weather conditions
ranged from below freezing to over 100 degrees F. Temperature
readings in the core as well as the top 6 inches of cottonseed
were monitored daily for several weeks. Bags were also checked
periodically for mycotoxin levels.</p>

<p>Nearing the final month of the experiment, West notes that
overall the good, &quot;gin-run&quot; seed has remained
unchanged. He emphasized however, the poorer quality seed has not
improved. &quot;This trial points out that feed quality seed can
be maintained with air-tight bags,&quot; adds West.<img

<p>In recent years the practice of feeding whole cottonseed <strong>(WCS)</strong>
to dairy cattle has increased to the point that around 50 percent
of the available supply for the US is consumed in this manner.
The wide acceptance of WCS as a feed ingredient for dairy diets
is due to the fact that it can be utilized without further
processing and from a nutrient consideration, fiber, protein, and
energy are supplied. This becomes of major importance in the diet
for the very high producing cow, where energy is at maximum
demand, but yet it is critical to maintain acceptable fiber.</p>

<p>Questions are frequently asked as to the economical value of
WCS for dairy diets and specifically as to the appropriate price
for WCS relative to other feed ingredients. It should be obvious
that the market price of WCS is directly under the control of the
fundamental rules of supply and demand. However, the demand side
of the equation is strongly influenced by the prices of other
feed ingredients and the manner in which WCS nutritive value is
evaluated.</p>

<p>Published for the cottonseed industry on a weekly basis is the
WCS Net Product Value (<strong>Cottonseed Digest</strong>), which
reflects the value of whole seed based on market prices of
products produced in processing. These products include
cottonseed meal, cottonseed oil, linters and cottonseed hulls.
The total product value is adjusted for milling cost and freight
to arrive at a Net Product Value. This value certainly sets the
base for WCS in the industry, but frequently far different
numbers can result when the intact seed is considered as a feed
ingredient for dairy diets.</p>

<p>Through the use of linear programming (<strong>LP</strong>)
the value of feed ingredients, including WCS, can be accurately
established. However, this approach is not simple and it goes far
beyond determining, if an ingredient is in or out of a single LP
solution. Outputs of LP solutions are dependent on the manner in
which the nutritional model is set, prices used for competing
feed ingredients, limitations set for ingredients, and rates of
use for the ingredient in question. With these considerations in
mind, it was deemed important to evaluate WCS value for dairy
diets based on the market conditions at present and considered
likely to continue into 1997.</p>

<p><a href="#Table 1.">Table 1</a> <a name="returnfromT1tobody">presents</a>
the nutritional parameters established for diets of high, medium,
and low energy for lactating dairy cows. These nutritional
guidelines resulted from a feeding model for lactating cows,
considering protein and fiber factors for high fat diets and
allowed milk potentials of 96, 88, and 80 pounds, respectively,
for 50 pounds dry matter intake of the high, medium, and low
energy diets. Total dietary fat was held at equal or less than 6
percent of dry matter and WCS supplied all the necessary
supplemental fat for achievement of this value when prices were
low. As WCS price increased alternative fat sources replaced the
fat from WCS, especially in high energy diets.</p>

<p><a name="returntobodyfromT2">The</a> feed ingredients and
their respective prices that were used for solving the
nutritional constraints are given in <a href="#Table 2.">Table 2.</a>
Corn silage and alfalfa silage were controlled with minimum and
maximum constraints to reflect acceptable use rates from the
farm. Cottonseed was priced at variable values to generate use
rates as a function of price for the three diets. Initial runs
were made with WCS price at zero dollars per ton with subsequent
runs conducted at the margin price for which WCS use would be
reduced. This repetitive process was continued until WCS use was
removed from the formula.</p>

<p>Prices for other feed ingredients were based on market
analysis for July 1996 and the first two trading days of August.
Future prices for the proceeding months through July 1997 were
averaged for corn and soybean meal. Other ingredients were priced
relative to markets at this time. Ingredients were selected to
result in identical nutritional balanced diets for the three
energy densities chosen with or without the use of WCS.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><strong><img src="images/UPA.GIF" border="0"
width="15" height="11"></strong></a><strong> </strong><a
name="RESULTSANDDISCUSSION"><strong>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</strong></a></p>

<p><a href="csbg1211.htm">Figure 1</a> presents the use rate of
WCS as a function of price, expressed as a percent of total
ration dry matter, for the three energy density diets. Note that
at zero price WCS use rate varied between 11 to 14.5 percent for
the three energy levels. Based on 50 pounds of dry matter intake,
this projects to 5.9 to 7.8 pounds of actual intake of WCS. Use
rate as a function of price can basically be explained as a two
step process. For high and medium NEL diets use rate did not
decline until prices exceeded $160 per ton. This first drop in
use rate for the low NEL diet was observed in a price range of
$100 to $120 per ton.</p>

<p>At the step 1 break in use, the medium NEL diet reduced WCS by
around 50 percent, whereas in the high NEL diet the use was
reduced by around 20 percent. For the low NEL diet at step 1, the
use was reduced by more than 60 percent. The step 2 break
occurred at between $220 to $240 per ton for the high and medium
NEL diets with use dropping to basically zero. For the low NEL
diet this step 2 break occurs immediately after the $160 price
with use being zero.</p>

<p><a name="backfromfig2">It is</a> of interest to follow the
feed utilization on a solution by solution basis and observe what
combination of feeds replaced the use of WCS as the price
increased. <a href="csbh1211.htm#top">Figure 2</a> provides a
view of rates of WCS use compared to other feeds for the high NEL
diet. In <a href="csbh1211.htm#2a">Figure 2a</a>, it is noted
that forages are significant in providing space for WCS use as
both corn and alfalfa silage go to their set minimum at use rates
of 9.2 percent and higher. Dried brewers grain was used at low
WCS rates but the major replacement was bypass fat and roasted
beans (<a href="csbh1211.htm#2c">Figure 2c</a>). Little variation
was noted in the use of corn and soybean meal and soy hulls
seemed to be an essential component of the high NEL diet
regardless of WCS use (<a href="csbh1211.htm#2b">Figure 2b</a>).</p>

<p><a href="csbi1211.htm#Fig3top" name="textatfig3">Figure 3</a>
presents other feed utilization for the medium NEL diet. The most
prominent patterns observed were drops in corn grain use when WCS
use exceeded 6 percent (<a href="csbi1211.htm#3b">Figure 3b</a>)
and reliance on roasted bean use when WCS rates were low (<a
href="csbi1211.htm#3c">Figure 3c</a>). However, the roasted bean
replacement was not consistent as diets between 4 to 8 percent
WCS use were produced without roasted beans. In the low NEL diet
increasing use of WCS reduces the use of alfalfa silage and
brewers grain (<a href="csbj1211.htm#4a">Figure 4a</a>) and shows
a strong reduction in the use of corn (<a href="csbj1211.htm#4b">Figure
4b</a>). Also corn silage use is pushed to the maximum allowed
(40%) with WCS use between 6 and 12 percent in the low NEL diet (<a
href="csbj1211.htm#4a">Figure 4a</a>).</p>

<p>This exercise strongly supports the fact that <strong>two
basic factors</strong> control the determined value associated
with WCS when considered in lactating dairy diets. The <strong>first</strong>
and most important is the nutrient density of the diets that are
being considered for a specific herd situation. In high producing
herds where demands are placed on energy and at the same time
minimum fiber requirements are maintained, WCS is worth at least
$60 to $80 more per ton than in herd situations where energy
levels are not as critical.</p>

<p>The <strong>second</strong> factor involves the types,
amounts, and cost of other feed ingredients that are available to
compete with the nutrition supplied by WCS. In the situation
studied, the prices for medium protein feeds such as brewers
grain, fiber suppliers like soy hulls, bypass fats, and fat and
protein suppliers as roasted beans have a strong influence on the
established value of WCS.</p>

<p><a href="#Table 3.">Table 3</a> <a name="returnfromT3tobody">provides</a>
a summary of the value of WCS for this study. This value was
derived by considering for specific energy levels the formulation
where WCS was used at a maximum, compared to the formulation
where WCS was removed. The cost differential between the two
formulas and the maximum use allows a computation of the value of
WCS dry matter which relates to a value per ton. The value of
$224 per ton for the high NEL diet demonstrates the role of WCS
in providing energy, fiber, and protein for high producing dairy
cattle. Reducing demands for nutrient density resulted in a $36
and $94 per ton lower value for medium and low producing cows,
respectively.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><strong><img src="images/UPA.GIF" border="0"
width="15" height="11"></strong></a><strong> </strong><a
name="SUMMARY"><strong>SUMMARY</strong></a></p>

<p>Whole cottonseed has in the past and will continue in the
future to serve as an important component of the diet for
lactating dairy cattle. The actual economical value of WCS is
much greater in the diet for the high producing cow because of
the demands placed on energy, fiber and protein. Setting this
true economical value for WCS is more strongly associated with
the prices of alternative feeds such as fiber suppliers, fat
sources, and medium protein feeds than the direct prices for corn
and soybean meal. But the corn and soybean complex does exert a
very strong secondary action as this complex controls the price
for alternative feeds directly competing with WCS.</p>

<p>The true economic value of WCS must be established for
individual dairy situations. The type, amount, and quality of
home grown forage supply must be considered as well as readily
available supplies of alternative feeds and their market price.
One very important advantage with the use of WCS is that
it&#146;s presence in the formulation will likely reduce the need
for two or possibly more ingredients. This can improve feeding
efficiency by requiring less ingredient storage and reduced
management time involved in purchasing and inventory control.</p>

RULES FOR FEED GRADE COTTONSEED</strong></font></p>

<p>It is important for anyone who buys or sells cottonseed to be
aware of the Trading Rules. The National Cottonseed Products
Association maintains the set of rules printed in this
publication. The Trading Rules specify specific quality standards
for feed grade cottonseed that offers buyers and sellers a
certain level of assurance that a quality product will be
delivered. The Trading Rules also allow for adjustment when a
variation in quality occurs. Members of the Association also have
access to arbitration to resolve disputes.</p>

<ol>
    <li>National Cottonseed Products Association (NCPA)<br>
        The NCPA is a national trade organization that represents
        cottonseed crushers, WCS merchandisers, dealers, brokers,

<p><strong>NOTE: When cottonseed is traded under any of the above
rules, the sales contract should indicate the organization and
the specific grade designation.</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Terms and Definitions</u></strong></p>

<p>Whole Cottonseed (WCS) &#151; This term refers to fuzzy seed
from upland varieties of cotton.</p>

<p>Pima Cottonseed &#151; This is the seed from pima varieties of
cotton, also known as extra long staple (ELS) cotton. It
represents a small percentage (about 2%) of US cotton. Pima seed
is genetically devoid of linters, the fuzz that covers the seed
of upland varieties. Some nutritionists recommend that Pima seed
be cracked prior to feeding.</p>

<p>Delinted Cottonseed &#151; There are two processes used for
delinting cottonseed, mechanical and acid. Mechanically delinted
is the most common form of delinted seed available in the feed
trade. Mechanically delinted seed retains about 1-2% residual
linters which usually appear on the ends of the seeds. Acid
delinting is a process that completely removes all linters. This
process is used for the production of planting seed. At certain
times during the year, quantities of culled, or leftover planting
seed, become available to the feed trade. Beware of such planting
seed unless one can demonstrate that is does not contain chemical
seed treatments.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="3"><strong>GOSSYPOL: RESPONSE OF
DAIRY<br>
CATTLE TO THE DIETARY ADDITION OF<br>
COTTONSEED PRODUCTS</strong></font></p>

<p align="center"><font size="2">by L.W. Whitlow</font></p>

<p>When feeding cottonseed meal in place of soybean meal,
questions always arise about how well cottonseed meal will
support milk production and the potential for gossypol toxicity,
particularly when cottonseed and cottonseed meal are fed
together. </p>

<p>Recent work from Arizona looked at these questions and
provided some answers of importance.</p>

<p>The primary differences in the rations were as follows:</p>

<ol type="A" start="1">
    <li>Soybean meal as the supplemental protein source.</li>
    <li>Cottonseed meal at 7% of the ration. (At 50 lb. DMI,
        cottonseed meal would be fed at 4 lb./cow.)</li>
    <li>Whole cottonseed at 13.5% of DMI. (At 50 lb. DMI,
        cottonseed meal would be fed at about 7.5 lb./cow.)</li>
    <li>Whole cottonseed at 6.75% of DMI and cotton seed meal at
        3.5% of DMI. (At 50 lb. DMI, cottonseed intake would be
        about 3.75 lb./cow and cottonseed meal 2 lb./cow.)</li>
    <li>Whole cottonseed at 13.5% of DMI and cotton seed meal at
        7% of DMI. (At 50 lb. DMI, cottonseed intake would be 7.5
        lb. per cow and cottonseed meal 4 lb./cow.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Total gossypol intake was calculated to be 0 for diet A, 900
ppm for diets B,C, and D, and 1800 ppm for diet E. Therefore
diets B, C, and D would have provided about 20 grams of total
gossypol and diet E about 40 grams of total gossypol. Free
gossypol intake by diet would have been about A: 0, B: 90 ppm or
2 gram/cow/day, C: 850 ppm or 19 grams/cow/day, D: 470 ppm or
11.5 grams/cow/day, and E: 940 ppm or 21 grams/cow/day.</p>

<p>Additions of whole cottonseed increased plasma gossypol,
erythrocyte fragility and plasma vitamin E levels but apparently
not enough to affect the cow because there were no other signs of
gossypol poisoning seen.</p>

<p>Milk production was also increased by cottonseed additions to
the diet. Milk production was the following for each treatment;
A: 63.0 lb., B: 67.8 lb., C: 67.8 lb., D: 68.5 lb., and E: 71.8
lb.</p>

<p>Thus, partial replacement of soybean meal with cottonseed meal
resulted in similar levels of milk production and the addition of
whole cottonseed increased milk production.</p>

<p>In this study whole cottonseed contained .69% total gossypol
and .63% free gossypol and cottonseed meal contained 1.32% total
gossypol and 0.13% free gossypol. These results help confirm that
the free gossypol is much more important than total gossypol in
that the whole cottonseed significantly raised plasma levels of
gossypol while cottonseed meal did not. Gossypol that is bound by
heat as in cottonseed meal may not be toxic to ruminants. The
study also suggests that 7.5 lb. of whole cottonseed can be fed
in addition to 4 lb. of cottonseed meal without gossypol
toxicity, at least for limited duration. The study also suggests
that cottonseed meal can support milk production similar to that
seen with soybean meal as the protein supplement.</p>

<p>This study does not tell us what would happen over the long
term since this was an 84 day study. Continuous feeding of
gossypol might be of more concern. Upper limits of cottonseed
feeding were not defined. Performance with higher levels of
cottonseed meal were not determined.</p>

<p>Similar work is now being conducted at NCSU (North Carolina
State University). It is hoped that such work will better define
any feeding limits which will then allow dairyman to take better
advantage of the lower priced cottonseed products with a better
knowledge of feeding limits and possible effects on performance
and health.</p>

<p>This and other work suggests that cottonseed meal can replace
a large part of soybean meal without concern for gossypol
toxicity or loss in productivity as long as the total ration is
balanced to meet protein and energy requirements. Cottonseed meal
is lower in energy than soybean meal and thus the ration must be
balanced for energy. When feeding cottonseed meal, the upper
level of whole cottonseed may need to be reduced by one lb. for
each five pounds of cottonseed meal added.</p>

<p>Cottonseed and cottonseed meal continue to be economically
priced and excellent feeds for the dairy ration. Concern over
gossypol is real but may sometimes be overly emphasized. <img

<p align="center"><font size="4"><strong>COTTONSEED FEEDING
LIMITATION</strong>S</font></p>

<p><i>When WCS is a particularly good buy, a reasonable question
is: how much can one feed?</i></p>

<p>Most dairymen in the South and West feed from 5 to 8 lb per
cow per day. As a percentage of the total diet dry matter in a
TMR, this is about 15%. But this doesn&#146;t really tell one how
much could be fed for extended periods, say more than 6 months.
The concern about the safety of high levels stems from the
presence of a compound called gossypol. Research conducted at
Auburn University suggests that 24 grams of free gossypol is the
approximate upper limit for the lactating cow. This would allow
the feeding of up to 10 lb per cow per day if the free gossypol
is 0.50% or less in the whole seed. When feeding more than 8 lb
per cow per day, one should have an analysis for gossypol run in
order to determine the exact amount of free gossypol being fed.
The analyses are usually expressed as a percentage of the kernel
(meal plus oil); to convert the percentage of gossypol in the
kernel to the percentage present in the whole seed, multiply by
.68. For example; if a kernel contains 0.92% gossypol, the
equivalent amount in the whole seed would be 0.63%. If cottonseed
meal and/or cottonseed hulls are also being fed, their
contribution to the total free gossypol intake needs to be
included also, even though they have much less free gossypol than
WCS.</p>

<p>Problems have also been encountered with aflatoxin production
by molds in cottonseed. Molds may develop either in the field or
in storage. Purchasing agreements should state clearly that the
WCS should have less than some specific amount of aflatoxin (20
ppb is the legal limit for feed used in dairy rations). Then the
seed should be stored on a well-drained pad protected from rain.<img

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Cotton has a number of advantages
when used in carpets and rugs. As in apparel and other home
products, cotton is a rugged and durable fiber. At the same time,
it exhibits a soft hand and is available in pleasing colors. When
disposed in a landfill, it is biodegradable. In use, it lowers
the level of atmospheric contaminants in the home. At the same
time, cotton floor coverings are easy to clean and maintain.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Cotton does have some unique
physical and chemical properties that have an influence on
maintenance recommendations for floor coverings. Unlike nylon and
polyester, cotton is hydrophilic and porous in structure. It has
a natural tendency to attract and hold onto water. When wetted
and air dried, cotton fibers tend to adhere to one another.
Although cotton does not have an affinity for most stains, some
stains are trapped on cotton&#146;s irregular surface or diffused
into the interior of the fiber. Cotton is not affected by common
organic solvents and mild acids. Alkali when dried on cotton
tends to promote yellowing. Strong acids (particularly sulfuric)
and strong oxidizing agents (particularly concentrated chlorine
bleach) severely damages cotton. Being a biological material,
cotton, if not specially treated, is subject to damage by mildew.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In spite of the best care,
accidental spots will occur. It is important that stains be
removed as soon as possible to minimize diffusion into the fiber
and insolubilization. In most cases, the first step should be the
use of a clean, absorbent cloth followed by a damp cloth. If the
stain persists, further steps will depend on the nature of the
stain. For any removal procedure, try on an inconspicuous area of
the carpet to determine if there would be any adverse effect on
color.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">Stubborn food stains on cotton
carpets are removed in most cases with a combination of household
ammonia and hydrogen peroxide from the first aid section of the
supermarket. For other stains, see the copy of &quot;Carpet and
Rug Spot Removal&quot; by the Carpet and Rug Institute, P. O. Box
2048, Dalton, GA 30722.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Arial">In the selection of a general
cleaning procedure for cotton carpet, there are several
considerations. These factors include effectiveness of cleaning,
drying time, and appearance of pile when the cleaning is
completed. The methods available for cleaning are absorbent
compounds, absorbent pad (bonnet), foam, shampoo, and hot water
extraction. For cotton carpets, methods that minimize the
absorption of water are best with respect to time of drying and
appearance of the pile after drying. The cleaning for these
&quot;dry&quot; systems is also excellent. One of the preferred
systems is Host. Other successful methods of interest include the
use of Capture and Von Schrader Dry Foam Extraction. These
products and services are available through local dealers and
some department stores. The Von Schrader Dry Foam Extraction <br>
is available through a carpet cleaning service found in the
Yellow Pages.</font></p>

</b></font><a name="COTTONFIBER"><font face="CG Times"><b>COTTON
FIBER</b></font></a><font face="CG Times"><b>, ITS PROPERTIES,
AND PRODUCTION</b>&nbsp;<u><br>
</u>Cotton accounts for 48% of the total fiber consumption
worldwide. Cotton fiber differs from man-made fiber in many ways:
cotton fiber does not melt; it has no glass transition
temperature; it can be decomposed by microbiological organisms
under certain conditions; it transports water vapor; and cotton
fiber can absorb many times its weight in water. Obviously, the
production of cotton fiber is very different from synthetics.
Cotton must be planted, harvested, and ginned before it is
delivered to the mill. The unique properties of cotton fiber can
be attributed to a combination of synergistic properties, from
its molecular backbone to its overall fiber morphology. These and
other inherent and unique features of cotton are discussed.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times"><b>Cotton Production Worldwide<br>
</b>World cotton production was 91.48 million bales in the
1995/96 crop year. Cotton is grown in about 80 countries around
the globe, with the top two producing countries consistently
being the United States and China. Cotton is the world's most
widely used fiber. In 1995, 46% of all the fiber used worldwide
was cotton. This compares with market shares of 40% for the
non-cellulosic fiber, 6% man-made cellulosic, and 6% wool.<b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times"><b>U.S. Cotton Production<br>
</b>The 1995/96 U.S. cotton crop was 18.8 million bales, while
the average production over the last four years was 17 million
bales. Roughly, 45% of the U.S. cotton crop is exported. Cotton
is grown in the United States in four major geographic areas --
Southeast, Mid-South, Southwest, and West.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">The Southeastern producing area includes
the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, and Virginia. This region produces about 19% of the
total U.S. crop, with the majority of production consumed by the
domestic textile industry. In this area, planting is from
mid-April to mid-May and harvesting is from early October to late
November.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">About 35% of the total crop is grown in
the Mid-South area, which includes the states of Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee. A large portion
of this production is also consumed domestically. Planting begins
in mid-April and lasts until early June. Harvesting is from late
September to late November.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">The Southwest region comprises Oklahoma
and Texas, and produces 25% of the total crop, one- half of which
is exported. Planting in South Texas begins in late February with
harvesting running from late July until mid-September. In the
remainder of the region, planting starts in May. Harvesting
begins in late October and lasts through December.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">The states of Arizona, California, and
New Mexico make up the West region, where 19% of the total crop
is produced. Most of the cotton grown in this region is exported.
Planting begins in late March and harvesting lasts from
mid-October to early December. To the surprise of most, Texas is
the largest cotton producing state, followed by California.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">In the U.S., 98% of the crop is of the
upland cotton species. The remaining 2% is the longer staple Pima
cotton species, which is grown in West Texas, New Mexico,
Arizona, and California. In the U.S., about 45% of the crop was
irrigated in 1995/96.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times"><b>Crop Growing and Harvesting<br>
</b>The cotton plant is a warm season, woody perennial shrub that
is grown as an annual field crop. Since the plants are grown in
different environments, the cotton farmer has a choice of many
varieties of cotton seeds that are bred to be productive in
various environmental and cultural conditions. There were 35
principal American upland varieties grown in the U.S. in 1995/96.
The USDA identifies almost 150 varieties of cotton that are grown
in the U.S.; however, the 10 most popular varieties account for
65 to 75 percent of the acres planted in the U.S. After the seeds
are planted and the plants begin to grow and develop, they must
be protected from insects, diseases, and weeds. After flowering,
the cotton fibers (lint) develop in the boll in three periods.
The first period is the elongation period in which the thin
primary wall is developed with a large vacuole (0-27 days).
During the second period (15-55 days), the circumference of the
protoplast shrinks progressively while inside the primary wall a
mass of almost pure cellulose is deposited as a secondary wall.
By the time of boll maturation, the third period, the secondary
wall fills the major part of the cell volume, leaving the lumen,
the small central cavity containing the cytoplasm and the
vacuole. As the boll opens, quick desiccation occurs and the
tubular cells collapse longitudinally and assume a ribbon-like
form with twists called convolutions. Prior to harvesting, the
plants are defoliated, thus reducing large amounts of foliage on
the cotton plant that might interfere with mechanical harvesting.</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">There are two methods of mechanically
harvesting cotton. Machine pickers harvest cotton from open bolls
and leave unopened bolls and empty bolls on the plant. This is
accomplished by revolving spindles that pluck the fiber out of
the boll. Machine strippers strip the entire plant of opened and
unopened bolls. As expected, fiber picked by strippers contains
more plant parts than that which is harvested by pickers. The
fiber removed from the plant also contains the cotton seeds and
is referred to as &quot;seed cotton&quot;. The average U.S.
cotton yield in 1995 was 537 pounds per acre. Yields have
increased an average of 10 pounds per year since 1977/78.<b>&nbsp;</b></font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times"><b>Ginning<br>
</b>Ginning, in its strictest sense, is the process of separating
cotton fibers from the seeds which is what Eli Whitney's
invention of the cotton gin accomplished in 1794. Today's modern
cotton gin is required to do much more. To convert mechanically
harvested cotton into a marketable product, gins have to dry and
clean (remove plant parts and field trash) from the seed cotton,
separate the fiber from the seed, further clean the fibers and
place the fiber into an acceptable package, while preserving as
nearly as possible the quality of the fiber. American upland
cotton is saw ginned, which is a process different from roller
ginning used for American Pima cotton. Saw gin stands can operate
at capacities as high as 12 (480 lb/218 kg) bales per hour. The
saw gin removes the fiber from the cotton seeds using a cylinder
that has saw teeth around its circumference. There are
approximately 1350 gins located throughout the cotton belt. In
the U.S., roller ginning is limited to the 10 counties in West
Texas, New Mexico, California, and Arizona that produce Pima
cotton.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times"><b>Cotton Classification<br>
</b>Cotton classification, or classing, is the process of
describing the quality of cotton in terms of grade, staple
length, and micronaire. In the past, this classing has been done
with the hand and the eye.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">Classification is essential to the
cotton pricing systems, but additional testing is required for
high level quality control in textile production. Therefore, an
instrument was developed to measure additional properties as well
as the properties that were made subjectively using the hand and
the eye. This instrument is referred to as the High Volume
Instrument (HVI) and its classification system currently consists
of instrument measurements for fiber length, strength, length
uniformity, micronaire, trash, and color. Since 1991, 100% of the
U.S. crop has been classified by the HVI.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times"><b>Physical Cotton Properties<br>
</b>The three cotton properties most often referred to in textile
uses are micronaire, length, and strength.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">Micronaire is an airflow measurement
that is performed on a 3.24 grams (modern instruments are capable
of using variable weight samples) test specimen which is
compressed to a specific volume in a chamber. Air is forced
through the specimen and the resistance to the airflow is
proportional to the linear density of the fibers expressed in
micrograms per inch (for detailed information, see attachment
&quot;Micronaire&quot; page 15).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">Cotton fiber length varies genetically
and has a fiber length array or length distribution. The HVI
reports fiber length as the upper-half-mean length in hundredths
of an inch. The lengths of linters and comber noils are less than
0.5 inches. The upper-half-mean length of U.S. Upland raw cotton
is normally between 1.0 and 1.2 inches, averaging about 1.10
inches. Pima cotton can be as long as 1.6 inches, averaging about
1.42 inches..</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">Fiber strength is measured by HVI using
1/8 inch spacing between clamp jaws and reported in terms of
grams force per tex. A tex unit is equal to the weight in grams
of 1000 meters of fiber; therefore, the strength reported is the
force in grams required to break a bundle of fibers one tex unit
in size. U.S. cotton averages approximately 28.0 grams/tex.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">Another quality of cotton that is often
referred to is nep content. A nep is a small tangled knot of
fiber often caused by mechanical processing. Neps can now be
measured by an AFIS nep tester and are reported as total neps per
gram of cotton and average diameter in millimeters. Properly
equipped and set machinery will minimize nep formation during
processing.&nbsp;</font></p>

    determined that a 90/10% cotton/low melt polyester blend and
    92/8% cotton/polypropylene 210/34 denier filament yarn
    twisted together with 2 ends of 100% cotton will suffice and
    produce good results in both loop and cut pile. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Symbol">·</font><font face="CG Times"> Heat
    set conditions to melt the low melt polyester were
    established using both Suessen and Superba equipment. Both
    are satisfactory in melting the low melt polyester and spot
    adhere the cotton fibers within the blended yarn. It appears
    that using the high pressure steam technique (Superba) that
    the yarn has additional bulk. The yarn containing
    polypropylene is best heat set using thermal heat methods,
    i.e. Suessen or other suitable equipment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Symbol">·</font><font face="CG Times"> All
    yarn ends, when tight together, should be spliced if
    possible. If knotted, a thin weavers knot should be used and
    the long knotted ends should be cut off. This will allow yarn
    to go smoothly through needle holes while tufting. When
    tufting cotton yarn into primary backing material, woven
    monks cloth or other plain weave fabrics are recommended for
    piece dyeing cotton rugs. Nonwoven synthetic substrates can
    also be used; however, some are not dyeable. Depending upon
    customer preferences, manufacturer have a wide range of
    choices to satisfy all requirements.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Symbol">·</font><font face="CG Times"> All
    rug and carpet tufting and weaving equipment are suitable for
    cotton yarn. Gauge, stitches per inch, and loom set up
    depends upon yarn size selection. Both ring spun and open end
    spun yarns are suitable.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Symbol">·</font><font face="CG Times"> Dyeing
    of cotton fiber, yarn, or piece goods is well known in the
    apparel and home products business. The technology transfer
    to rugs and carpets can be adopted quickly. Cotton can be
    dyed from pastel to very bright colors and many dyestuff
    classes have affinity to cellulose. This area will be covered
    in more detail under &quot;Dyeing and Chemistry
    Research&quot;. </font></p>
    <p><font face="Symbol">·</font><font face="CG Times"> When
    flame retardancy is an issue, a chemical formulation
    developed by Cotton Incorporated can be applied to the
    surface of the rug or carpet by spray or foam methods (see
    Flame Retardant and Soil Resistant Finish, page ).</font></p>

    Manufacturers have several options using 100% cotton or
    blends. To reduce surface shedding, it is recommended to use
    low melt synthetic fibers at levels recommended on page 5.
    If, however, one would choose to produce 100% cotton rugs,
    the following recommendations are made:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font face="CG Times">(a) After piece dyeing or
        washing of already colored rugs, the use of cellulase
        enzymes in the last rinse cycle is very effective (see
        page 24 for procedure)&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="CG Times">(b) The customer (consumer)
        could also use &quot;Color Guard Detergent&quot; sold by
        Procter &amp; Gamble under the trade names
        &quot;Cheer&quot;, &quot;Tide&quot;, and
        &quot;Ivory&quot; in home laundry machines.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="CG Times">(c) When proceeding with (a),
        (b), or (a) and (b) combined, the reaction will be such
        that the loose cotton surface fibers dissolve by the
        activated enzymes during the rinse or wash cycle. </font></p>

        warehouse. One dye lot can be 50-1000 kg. or higher.
        This, of course, will depend on the size of the Kier
        (dyeing machine). In production, one suggestion is to dye
        many lots of the same color and, after dyeing, bale
        compress and store. Bales can then be pulled as desired,
        blended, and spun into yarn for tufting.</font></p>
        <p><font face="CG Times">After tufting, the carpets are
        finished. The only time that limited moisture would be
        evaporated is when the carpets are steamed and a topical
        finish (flame retardant and soil release) is
        applied.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="CG Times">Stock dyed cotton fiber can be
        blended to subtle colored tonal effects. Designers will
        have the opportunity to achieve an almost unlimited
        number of tonal effects styling rug and carpet concepts.</font></p>

The cleaning procedure should be conducted for the first time on
an inconspicuous area of the carpet to determine if there will be
an adverse effect on the appearance.</font></p>

<p><font face="CG Times">As much stain as possible is first
removed with a damp cloth. The stain is saturated with full
strength Parsons' Ammonia All-Purpose Cleaner followed
immediately with a liberal amount of hydrogen peroxide available
in the first aid supply section of the supermarket. The area is
massaged gently, permitted to soak for thirty minutes, and
blotted with a paper towel. This procedure is repeated until the
stain is removed. After cleaning, the area is dampened with water
and blotted several times to remove any residual cleaner that
would otherwise hurt the soil resistance. The drying may be
accelerated by using a hair dryer. If necessary, the carpet pile
may be re-oriented by vacuuming or brushing.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>This summary report analyzes trends in the quality of USA
upland cotton since the mid-1970's. Information used for this
analysis, except for yield data, comes from the publication,
&quot;Quality of Cotton Classed Under the Smith-Doxey Act.&quot;
This is a USDA publication which is issued weekly during the
harvest season beginning in August. </p>

<p align="left">The final 1994/95 USA upland cotton yield
estimate was placed at 707 pounds per acre (792 Kg/hectare), the
highest yield on record. The current 1995 crop yield estimate
shows a significant decrease from the 1994 upland crop average.
The 1995 projected yield of pounds per acre is the lowest average
yield since the 1983 crop. This is far below the trend line in
the chart below, which shows that the average yield of the USA
crop has been increasing at the rate of 10.5 pounds per acre per
year since 1975. Total production estimates for 1995 are
approximately 17.9 million bales of upland cotton, which is
slightly below the 1994 production which was the largest USA
upland crop on record.</p>

<p align="left">The final national average for micronaire for the
1995 crop is 4.35. The 1994 crop had an average micronaire of
4.25. The long term micronaire average is 4.15 for USA upland
cotton. The higher micronaire in the 1995 crop is due to higher
micronaire averages in the Southeastern and Midsouth classing
areas.</p>

1994. For the 1994 crop, the average staple length was is
35.2/32's of an inch which slightly exceeded the record 1992
average. As the long term trend line in the chart below
indicates, staple length has been increasing at the rate of about
2/32 of an inch (0.07 inches) each 10 years. Staple length for
the past 5 years has been stable at slightly over 35/32's.</p>

index data have been supplied in crop reports from the USDA. The
1995 crop has a national average for length uniformity index of
81.2, which is slightly below the eight year trend line. As shown
in the chart below, the trend line indicates that length
uniformity index has been increasing at the rate of approximately

<p align="left">The 1995 crop had an average strength of 29.1

set in 1993 and matched in 1994. Since HVI strength records were
started in 1980, the annual increase in strength has been just
over 0.25 grams/tex per year. The 1995 crop average strength
slightly exceeds the long term trend line, reflecting the
continued plantings of higher strength cotton varieties. Premiums
and discounts have been paid for fiber strength since 1991, when
100% HVI testing was initiated in the classing system.</p>

<p>The chart below illustrates the classer grades of USA upland
cotton crops since 1975. There was a gradual decline from 1975 to
1986 in the percentage of the crop classed into &quot;white&quot;
grades. This trend was reversed in the 1987 crop, and the average
percentage of white grades stabilized near 80% for eight years.
The 1995 crop had 77.1% classified as &#147;white&#148;. </p>

<p>Beginning in 1993, the classer grade was split into color
grade and leaf grade. The grade is not reduced because of the
presence of extraneous materials such as bark or grass. The
percentages given in the graph below for the crops beginning in
1993 are for the color grades, but each color grade includes all
leaf grades in that color group. The data for the last three
years are biased from data for the previous years because there
are no reductions in color grade for extraneous matter. </p>

offices located throughout the cotton production regions of the
USA. The classing offices previously located in El Paso and Altus
have been closed and the classing operations consolidated with

<p align=left><font color="#000000"><strong>The evolution of High Volume Instrument (HVI) testing has 
been the most significant development in the cotton 
industry in the part thirty years. Over the past decade, 
Cotton Incorporated through its Fiber Processing Research 
Division, has led the cotton industry in the development of 
technology which allows textile manufacturers to gain 
consistent cotton quality with its Engineered Fiber 
Selection</strong><sup><font size=1><strong>&#174;</strong></font></sup><strong> Cotton Fiber Management System. The EFS</strong><sup><font size=1><strong>&#174;</strong></font></sup><strong> 
System is a group of programs that provide powerful cotton 
management and analysis capabilities as well as electronic 
communication between mills, ginners, producers and 
merchants using HVI data.<br>
<br>
MILLNet enables mills to control the natural variability of 
cotton by providing an electronic means of cotton mill 
management. In addition to furnishing a contract 
management system, MILLNet assists mills to acquire and 
warehouse cotton based on HVI information. An advanced 
mix selection program included in MILLNet also prints 
laydown reports, complete with a schematic showing bale 
positions for selected opening line laydowns.<br>
<br>
Cotton Incorporated introduced a value-added network 
named CI~EDI</strong><sup><font size=1><strong>SM</strong></font></sup><strong> Service to help facilitate the electronic 
exchange of information among cotton buyers and sellers. 
It offers performance at less expense than existing third 
party electronic mailbox services.<br>
<br>
Currently, MILLNet is used by over 50 mills in the United 
States, Europe, the Far East and Mexico. In 1994, over 
nine million bales were processed by the EFS</strong><sup><font size=1><strong>&#174;</strong></font></sup><strong> System . In 
1995, an estimated 10 million bales will be handled using 
the Engineered Fiber Selection</strong><sup><font size=1><strong>&#174;</strong></font></sup><strong> System.</strong></font></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> ~ This is the <font
color="#804040"><strong>Knits</strong></font> section of the web
page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where To Find It ~
Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>. This useful
directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> ~ This is the <font
color="#804040"><strong>Knits</strong></font> section of the web
page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where To Find It ~
Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>. This useful
directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> ~ This is the <font
color="#804040"><strong>Knits</strong></font> section of the web
page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where To Find It ~
Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>. This useful
directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> ~ This is the <font
color="#804040"><strong>Knits</strong></font> section of the web
page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where To Find It ~
Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>. This useful
directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> ~ This is the <font
color="#804040"><strong>Knits</strong></font> section of the web
page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where To Find It ~
Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>. This useful
directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> ~ This is the <font
color="#804040"><strong>Knits</strong></font> section of the web
page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where To Find It ~
Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>. This useful
directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

<p>Description: ~ This is the <font color="#804040">Knits</font> section of the web page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where To Find It ~ 
Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>. This useful directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit 
and woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich (fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). 
Cotton Incorporated maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>&#174;</sup> Fabric Library around the world, including New York, 
Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this directory, with 
fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>

<p>Description: ~ This is the <font color="#804040">Knits</font>
section of the web page version of Cotton Incorporated's <strong>Where
To Find It ~ Directory of Mills, Knitters and Converters</strong>.
This useful directory will help you source cotton in lace/trim, knit and
woven constructions that contain 100% cotton or are cotton-rich
(fabrics containing 60% cotton or more). Cotton Incorporated
maintains THE COTTONWORKS<sup>®</sup> Fabric Library around the
world, including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, Singapore, Osaka
and Mexico City. Our fabric library is an extension of this
directory, with fabric samples that have been sent for viewing by
over 300 mills, knitters and converters. </p>
