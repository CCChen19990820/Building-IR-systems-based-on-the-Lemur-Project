Dr. Trani established an active administration at VCU.  He has formalized VCU's relationship with the community through a number of programs, including the Community Service Associates Program, which pairs faculty with members of the community on special projects.  He has guided the development of "A Strategic Plan for the Future of Virginia Commonwealth University," which has produced significant organizational and administrative changes within the university.  It also has led to new faculty roles and rewards policy, a new architectural plan for VCU's two campuses, and a comprehensive technology plan.
<P>
Among Dr. Trani's most important strategic accomplishments is enhancing VCU's role in economic development in Virginia.  He has guided the establishment of the Virginia Biotechnology Research Park, only the third life-science park in the nation to go into development.  He has worked to establish a unique engineering school in the region, which played a major role in attracting Motorola, Inc. to Virginia.  Dr. Trani also has guided the development of a strategic plan for the academic medical center to secure the financial future of medical education and patient care at the MCV campus.
<P>
Dr. Trani's academic and community leadership was recognized in 1992 with the Central Richmond Association's Leadership and Achievement Award, in 1994 with the Distinguished Leadership Award from the National Association of Community Leadership, and in 1995 with the Richmond Humanitarian Award from the National Conference of Christians and Jews.
<P>
Dr. Trani serves on the boards of Crestar Financial Corporation, Lawyers Title Corporation, the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce, the Richmond Ballet and Richmond Symphony, among others.  His involvement in economic development initiatives included board memberships with Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology and the state's Innovative Technology Authority.  He also has served as state chairman of the combined Virginia Campaign regional chairman of the U.S. Savings Bonds Campaign.
<P>
Dr. Trani held scholarly positions at the U.S. Department of the interior, Princeton University, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, and the University of London, where he serves on the Board of Advisors for the Institute for United States Studies.  He has held faculty positions at Ohio State University, Southern Illinois University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison and VCU.  In 1981, Dr. Trani taught at Moscow State University as a Senior Fulbright Lecturer in American history.  In the summer of 1995, he went on sabbatical to the University of London, where he completed research for his book on Woodrow Wilson and the beginning of American-Soviet relations.
<P>
A prolific essayist and speaker, Dr. Trani has remained a scholar and teacher of history and U.S. foreign affairs throughout his career.  His areas of expertise include, among others, economic development, the international role of America higher education, and U.S. foreign policy.

<A NAME="history"><LI><H2>History</H2></A>
<P>
CIT was created by the General Assembly of Virginia in 1984 as a non-profit 
organization designed to enhance the research and development capability of 
the state's major research universities in partnership with industry.  
In its first decade, CIT implemented that original legislative intent 
by bringing Virginia businesses and institutions of higher education into 
relationships that promote a climate of cooperation and technological 
innovation.

<P>
CIT co-funded 836 research and innovative technology projects at 
Virginia's public universities, involving 786 companies which 
attracted over $155 million in private and other funds for Virginia 
universities.

<P>
In its first decade, CIT implemeted that original legislative 
intent by bringing Virginia businesses and institutions of higher 
education into relationships that promote a climate of collaboration and 
technological innovation:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>CIT co-funded 836 research and innovative technology projects at 
Virginia's public universities, involving 786 companies which 
attracted over $155 million in private and other funds for Virginia 
universities;
<P>
<LI>CIT established 13 technology development centers and institutes 
at Virginia's research universities, increasing R&amp;D capabilities in such 
leading-edge technologies as fiber-optics, composite materials, advanced 
computer technology, biotechnology, wireless communications;
<P>
<LI>CIT's technology assistance and transfer program, based primarily 
at Virginia community colleges, completed over 1,900 industry 
projects, often with the assistance of college university faculty; and
<P>
<LI>CIT was instrumental in raising Virginia's ranking among the states 
from 18th to 6th in the number of patents issued to universities and 
nonprofit institutions from 1987-1993.
<P>
</UL>

<P>
Now, more than ten years after CIT's founding, Virginia faces increased competition 
from other states and countries in an era characterized by faster 
technological innovation.  Virginia and CIT must enhance the 
Commonwealth's ability to compete globally.  The new CIT recognizes 
this challenge and embraces it.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="newCIT"><H2>Mission</H2></A>
<P>
Guided by amended legislative mandates, CIT will:

According to Dr. Penn, "Our Intellectual Property Program needs to move to the next level, concentrating on a more business-like approach and strengthening the partnerships with the universities."
<P>
Dr. Penn comes from industry. Prior to joining CIT, Penn served as Director of New Products Information and Evaluation with Marion Merrell Dow where he evaluated licensing opportunities. Dr. Penn also served as a manager of clinical research at Merrell Dow and vice president of business development for a developmental stage drug delivery system company.

<P>

<B>Regional CIT offices are located across the state to provide 
businesses with one place to come to access CIT services.  Key 
resources are also deployed regionally.  This allows CIT to become 
better integrated with other regional service providers such as the 
SBDCs and the new manufacturing and advanced technology centers.  
It also allows CIT to work more closely with local chambers of 
commerce, regional technology councils and economic 
development entities, and to focus on local issues.</B>

<P>
<LI>If a winning entry is submitted by a team, the distribution of prize money among team 
members is the responsibility of the team members.

(parts of this text were excerpted from <CITE>Progressive Architecture</CITE>,
August 1989)
<P>
The CIT headquarters, completed in 1987, is located in Herndon on a hill 
overlooking Dulles Airport. In 1985, shortly after the General Assembly 
of Virginia created CIT, the National Endowment for the Arts helped 
sponsor a national ideas contest to generate concepts for the new building.  
The purpose was to design a new type of building, one that embraced 
innovative developments in 20th century technology.  Although one of the 
contest submissions significantly influenced the final design, 
Architectonica in Florida and Ward-Hall Associates AIA in Virginia were 
the architectural firms who designed the structure.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT VSPACE=0 HSPACE=8 SRC="./images/bldg-arial.interl.gif">
<P>

The 5th and 6th floors of the tower is home to the CIT administrative 
offices and the 2nd through 5th floors are home to companies and 
organizations of the CIT network.  The Software Productivity Consortium 
occupies the parallelogram &#34 wedge &#34  next to the tower.
<BR CLEAR=RIGHT>

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=0 HSPACE=8 SRC="./images/bldg-front.interl.gif">
<P>

The building totals 150,000 square feet and consists of offices, 
a multi-media auditorium, cafeteria, research labs, commons, briefing 
center and a 430-car parkling garage.
<BR CLEAR=LEFT>
<P>

For tour information, please call Innovative Management at 
(703) 742-6971.

<H1>TEN YEARS AND $111 Million LATER</H1>
<P>
by Peter E. Ohlhausen<BR>

<P>
Before becoming president of Virginia's Center for 
Innovative Technology ... before he headed up Thomas Nelson 
Community College ... long before economic development was a 
burned-out buzzword, Robert G. Templin Jr. was studying the 
economic impact of emerging technologies and university research.
<P>
His W.K. Kellogg Foundation fellowship convinced him that
relocating companies aren't so interested in nonunion work 
forces and one-time tax deals. What they really want is 
responsive universities, good transportation and a smart 
work force.
<P>
Templin's economic development philosophy seems to fit the
recent refinements in the mission of Virginia's Center for 
Innovative Technology.  Formed to help commercialize 
university research, the CIT has spent $111 million in its 
first 10 years.  The return on those taxpayer dollars has been 
difficult to measure, and that has troubled Democrat and 
Republican governors alike.
<P>
The value of the state-supported CIT was first questioned by 
Gov. Doug Wilder's budget cutters and more recently by Gov. 
George Allen's government reformers. Both groups sponsored 
studies of CIT performance, and both groups ultimately called 
for greater accountability and more emphasis on economic 
development.
<P>
In its early years the CIT made no attempt to track the number 
of jobs it helped create.  But Templin, who took over as CIT 
president this year, is focusing on the organization's economic 
impact.
<P>
"The goal," he says, "is high-wage jobs to raise the standard 
of living for all Virginians."
<P>
The CIT has traveled a bumpy road.  Founded in 1984, it is the 
nonprofit operating arm of the Innovative Technology Authority, 
which was established by the General Assembly at the recommendation 
of the 1983 Governor's Task Force on Science and Technology.
<P>
From the beginning the CIT suffered from annual turnover at the
top and a persistent problem of proving its worth.  During the 
past five years, however, its sixth president, former Gov. 
Linwood Holton, established a measure of stability that has 
enabled CIT to survive funding cuts and political scrutiny.
<P>
Under Holton the CIT made many friends in high-tech places. The 
center has helped 800 businesses through its technology 
development and commercialization program in which CIT helps 
companies fund university research to solve specific problems.  
Other business-boosting programs range from "incubator" office 
space and support services to technology assistance and transfer 
centers at Virginia community colleges.
<P>
In fiscal 1993 these centers initiated 472 projects. Responding to
a CIT survey, 25 percent of those clients estimated that CIT services 
would increase their sales by $11.5 million over the first year and 
$38.4 million by the end of three years.  They reported that the 
CIT had helped them save 310 jobs and create 96.  The actual figures 
would be higher if all clients had responded to the survey.
<P>
The CIT also funds technology development centers at Virginia 
Tech, the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth 
University.  These centers focus on specific fields such as ceramics, 
magnetic bearings, bio-based materials, pharmaceuticals and wireless 
telecommunications.  In addition the CIT helps companies license 
university technologies, build prototypes and gain access to
technology data bases.
<P>
Measured against the goal of coordinating the R&D capabilities of
universities with the requirements of businesses, CIT has been 
successful.  Perhaps the most dramatic example is Fairfax-based
Orbital Sciences Corp.
<P>
The company's growth has skyrocketed since the CIT began working
with it in 1989. Beginning with 25 employees and $2 million in 
start-up capital, Orbital Sciences now employs 420 people in 
Virginia plus 1,380 in other states. Last year the company racked 
up revenues of $190 million.
<P>
"We found them, offered our services and structured a plan with them,"
says Michael Miller, CIT general manager and space program director. 
"We then brought them help from Virginia Tech, where researchers 
performed studies to test the viability of their satellites."  Last 
February Orbital Sciences launched a satellite designed to demonstrate 
a new mobile communications system that would be based on a 
constellation of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO).
<P>
"Once the satellites are up," says miller, "the company will start
selling services. LEO will be a worldwide industry focused in Virginia."
<P>
Holton tells another success story about Bristol Compressors Inc.,
which was making a noisy, inefficient air conditioning compressor. 
With help from the CIT and Virginia Tech, the company developed a 
better product.  Its sales improved, and Southwest Virginia gained 
more than 1,200 jobs when the company expanded its plant in Bristol.
<P>
Even farmers have benefited from CIT assistance.  Montague Farms,
halfway between Tappahannock and Saluda, is a good example. 
"In the early '80s, we started looking for ways to stay in 
business," says Bill Taliaferro, one of three brothers who 
own Montague Farms, a soybean producer.  "Crop agriculture was 
really going through the wringer."
<P>
The brothers turned to Virginia Tech and the CIT for help in
developing a superior soybean variety for natto, a Japanese 
dish.  Robert Schwartz, CIT's director of biotechnology development 
and commercialization, says Virginia Tech's genetic research is 
continuing as it analyzes beans in the quest for ideal sugar content, 
size and hardness.  CIT and Montague Farms each put up half the 
research money.
<P>
"With worldwide competition, the only way to get a decent price is
to have something the others don't," says Taliaferro.  At one point 
Montague Farms had about 20 percent of the natto soybean market in 
Japan.  Then the brothers decided to recruit other Virginia farmers. 
"We Determined that to be a good supplier with plenty of good crop, 
we couldn't do it all ourselves," Taliaferro explains. "So we got a 
grain dealer's license and began to spread out geographically for a 
consistent supply."  That meant contracting with about 100 growers 
across the state.
<P>
"We're just a little company," he says. "CIT has helped us achieve
the critical mass to fund the research and get it done.  CIT will 
eventually backout, and then we'll have the ability to continue 
the applied research.  From our standpoint, CIT's help was vital."
<P>
Several technologies that CIT has touted in the past as evidence of 
its success are still in the fledgling state.  The EyeGaze system, 
developed by Fairfax-based LC Technologies from research conducted 
at UVa, enables severely handicapped people to control computers by 
fixing their gaze on different parts of a computer screen.
<P>
This ClT-funded technology is miraculous, but sales have been
slow.  Since 1988 LC Technologies has sold only 60 of these 
systems at an average price of $20,000.  "The sales may not sound 
like much, but for a small company that has been struggling and 
for a product that is expensive and new, it's significant," says 
company President Joseph Lahoud.
<P>
Barbara Cooper, CIT's director of public information, points to that
as "a poignant example of the problems of undercapitalized start-up 
companies.  CIT can only take them so far."
<P>
Technology often takes a long time to develop, says Templin.  "It can
take eight to 15 years to tell whether an invention becomes a 
successful product."  A video tumor fighter, developed by 
Charlottesville-based Stereotaxis Inc., has been under development 
for years, but it's stuck in regulatory testing.
<P>
Fairfax-based FM Technologies, a longtime CIT client, has seen
its revenues grow from $235,000 in 1987 to $1.3 million last year 
and its work force grow from six to 14.  But none of that growth is 
based on sales, according to company President Frederick Mako.  FM 
Technologies is still in an R&D mode, devising a range of high-tech 
instruments and techniques with funding that comes from large 
corporations, the federal government and the CIT.  None of the 
products it has developed since 1987 has made it to market.
<P>
A ny examination of CIT must temper high-tech excitement with taxpayer
skepticism.  From a high of $13 million in fiscal 1990, CIT's state 
funding is down to $8.2 million for fiscal 1995.
<P>
Four years ago when the Wilder Administration had to cut $2 billion out
of the state budget, the CIT almost lost its funding. "The Virginia 
Department of Planning and Budget put everything on the table, 
including CIT,"  says senior budget analyst Phyllis Palmiero.
<P>
Wilder's biennial budget that started in 1991 called for a 15 percent
cut in CIT funding the first year, followed by no money in the second 
year. The budget bill also mandated a review of CIT performance. 
"With funding for CIT left out of the budget for the second year," 
Palmiero notes, "CIT was forced to cooperate with the study."
<P>
The General Assembly, however, voted unanimously to restore the CIT's
funding even before the report was released.  The review committee 
concluded that CIT had "basically implemented the original legislative
intent, despite problems in the areas of mission, governance, 
administration and accountability."  The study recommended that CIT 
continue to serve as "an engine of long-term economic growth,"
emphasizing three strategies: developing and transferring
university-based technology, increasing its efforts to support 
high-tech industry and aggressively pursuing R&D work for the 
federal government and the private sector.
<P>
The report also recommended restructuring the CIT board of
directors to include more industry representatives and the 
Virginia secretaries of education and commerce and trade.  
Those changes have been made.
<P>
The report found the 1991 appropriation adequate and encouraged the
CIT to pursue supplemental funding from other sources.  CIT is in 
fact making money by handling the licensing of university technologies.
<P>
The review committee also fretted over the lack of measures for
CIT Performance.  "As an independent entity receiving substantial 
state general funds," the report noted, "CIT must be more accountable 
for how tax dollars are spent.  CIT needs to develop a 'culture of 
accountability.'"
<P>
Further scrutiny of CIT's value has come from the Governor's
Commission on Government Reform. Formed By Governor Allen's first 
executive order, the commission consists of 60 unpaid citizen advisors,
mostly businesspeople.  Executive Director Thomas Towberman says the 
commission's committees have looked at CIT and found it valid.  In a 
recent public hearing, however, a few commission members again raised 
the issue of eliminating state funds for the CIT.
<P>
"Anecdotal results don't necessarily impress legislators and
businesspeople," Holton acknowledges, "but I can say, without 
question, that CIT is a good buy for Virginia."
<P>
The accountability issue is complicated by the proprietary nature
of many CIT projects.  The CIT will not release complete lists of 
its clients, citing confidentiality agreements with many companies. 
Small companies are afraid that larger competitors will steal their 
ideas and beat them to market, explains Barbara Cooper, CIT's director 
of public information.
<P>
CIT officials insist that the center has helped create many jobs,
but they don't name a particular number.  "I have an aversion to 
claiming credit for jobs when there were a lot of factors involved," 
says Holton. "I like to think of us as a catalyst.
<P>
Even the review committee report recognizes the inherent difficulty
of measuring job creation.  "The impacts of CIT programs are difficult 
to discern from those of other factors, such as economic recession or 
changes in interest rates."  The report warns, however, that 
"overemphasis on short-term outcomes could negatively affect the 
long-term research and development process."
<P>
Templin wants the CIT "to become more business-oriented and
market-sensitive," he says.  He wants the center to develop a 
strategic plan that fits into Virginia's economic plan. And he 
wants to address the complaint that CIT hasn't focused enough on 
any one technology to push Virginia into the forefront of it.
<P>
Templin talks about combining regional high-tech specialties to
make Virginia unique.  For example, he says, "If laser technology 
becomes a defining characteristic of the peninsula area and I-64 
becomes the medical corridor, we could recruit and attract companies 
that are interested in the intersection of laser technology and 
biomedical research."
<P>
CIT should look worldwide, he says. "Virginia's competition is not
Maryland or North Carolina, but Korea, Eastern Europe, the European 
Community and Brazil."
<P>
Closer to home, Templin wants the CIT to help develop an
entrepreneurial investment pool to encourage Virginia capitalists to 
invest in Virginia companies.  There's even talk of turning the CIT's 
striking, $34.5 million headquarters into an economic development 
showroom for Virginia localities. "The governor has indicated that 
he would like to use this space to showcase the state to companies 
looking to move here," says Holton.
<P>
Templin likes the concept. "Our Facility could be companies' first
stop on their tour of Virginia. We'd fly them into Dulles and take 
them to a building that says this is a progressive state looking to 
the future."
<P>
The mission of the CIT seems to be coming into focus.  Even university 
researchers are echoing Templin's economic development theme.  Glenn 
Stoner, director of UVa's Center for Electrochemical Science and 
Engineering, says, "We aren't just a bunch of scientists sitting 
around the lab thinking about the universe.  We're Helping businesses 
be in business."

<P>

The age of the Internet Economy is upon us! The new buzzword in business is no longer 
reengineering, but innovation.  Redeployment of old ideas is no longer effective.  The 
focus now is on defining, developing, and utilizing  innovation to create new processes, 
new industries, and new markets.
<P>

In the words of Dr. Teresa Amabile, Professor of Business Administration at Harvard 
University and an expert on entrepreneurial creativity:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 "Creativity is the only way humans progress.  Keep doing things the way they have 
always been done, no matter what the circumstances are, and you define insanity.  
Change is our only constant, and demands novelty of response." (<CITE>Success</CITE>, September 
1996, pg. 36)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
In the Internet Economy, the conceptual model for doing business has changed.  The 
prospective customer first interacts with an organization through technologies such as the 
World Wide Web, and then decides on a future course of action.  This represents
 
opportunity as well as risk for organizations.  Companies that can make effective use of 
Web technology are positioned to survive and grow; those that cannot may decline or 
even perish.  Change creates opportunity, and the opportunity here is to use Web 
technology to enhance business through electronic commerce (broadly defined).  This is 
your chance to get involved!
<P>

The WWW Business Innovations Contest encourages Virginia's college and university 
students to innovate, collaborate, and exploit the Internet Economy for their own benefit.  
The contest provides a vehicle for researching, defining, and developing new Web-based 
concepts and applications.  While one incentive is the total of $15,000 in scholarships, an 
even more important one is that students can gain significant visibility for their 
entrepreneurship.  Who knows?  Maybe the innovation, exploration, and collaboration 
encouraged by this contest will launch the next Netscape Communications!

<H1>VIRGINIA'S UNIVERSITIES' RESEARCH BEARS FRUIT</H1>
<H2>How Brains Bring Jobs</H2>
<P>
Frank Batten Jr.<BR>
President and Publisher<BR>
<P>
Bruce Bradley<BR>
Vice President and General Manager<BR>
<P>
Cole C. Campbell<BR>
Editor<BR>
<P>

A recent study of 40 research universities 
in 14 Southern states showed that the vast majority 
of money being made from the professors' discoveries 
is being made in other parts of the nation.
<P>
While Stanford University discoveries benefit Silicon 
Valley companies nearby, the fruits of Southern 
brainpower are being harvested by companies 
elsewhere.
<P>
On average, only 3 percent of the royalties 
paid for a Southern university's discoveries came 
from companies within the same state as the university, 
and only 29 percent of the royalties came from companies 
somewhere in the South.
<P>
Thanks to the Center for Innovative Technology, 
a not-for-profit organization in Northern Virginia 
funded by the General Assembly, the record in Virginia 
is much better and rapidly improving.
<P>
Since 1989, CIT has granted 70 licenses to companies 
for inventions at Virginia universities; 32 of 
the licenses, virtually half, went to companies within 
Virginia.
<P>
In the first six months of the current fiscal year, 
CIT granted 12 licenses to 11 companies to develop and 
commercialize inventions made at Virginia universities, and 
10 of the licenses went to Virginia companies - a whopping 83 percent.
<P>
In many cases, CIT has helped start companies in Virginia to 
use discoveries from local universities, rather than sell licenses 
for the discoveries to companies out of the state or country.
In fact, since late 1993, CIT's main purpose has been to use 
the discoveries of Virginia universities to promote economic 
growth within the commonwealth.
<P>
The new report is titled "Benchmarking University-Industry 
Technology Transfer in the South: 1993-94 Data," 
and it was compiled by The Southern Technology Council, a 
nonprofit organization formed in 1986 to promote the 
transfer of technology from universities to business. 
Jim Guy Tucker, governor of Arkansas, is the council chairman. 
Academics and ex-academics from 14 states are involved.  The National
Science Foundation partially funded the study.
<P>
The report says two-thirds of 47 licenses granted through 
CIT during the study period went to start-up companies.  And it 
says, "Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology seemed to be 
accomplishing its mission of seeding technology-based enterprise 
growth in the state.  Of a six-figure royalty revenue flow, 74.24 
percent was from in-state licensees."
<P>
The report is terrific news for CIT, which barely 
escaped with its life earlier this year. A government-reform
commission had recommended eliminating it, but Gov. George 
Allen and the General Assembly approved almost all of CIT's 
$8.2 million budget request.
<P>
Louis Berneman, CIT director of licensing and business 
development, said universities began about 1988 to try to
protect and commercialize research results.
<P>
While CIT seeks to create jobs, companies and high-tech competitiveness 
for Virginia, Berneman said, the universities seek closer 
ties with industry, motivation for their researchers and 
research funding from industry.
<P>
Universities don't make a lot of money from their discoveries, 
Berneman said.  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with an 
annual research budget of about $700 million, received less 
than $20 million in license fees last year, he said.
<P>
But the best researchers are more motivated to work and 
more likely to remain with their schools, if their discoveries 
go beyond the laboratory and make a difference in the world. 
Also, the professors get a percentage of the royalties from their work.
<P>
And when the fruits of the professors' research lead to new jobs and 
companies within the state, everybody wins. 
<P>

If your business needs help developing or improving a technology-based product or process, or help accessing a technical expert to solve a problem, AND needs someone to share in the investment risk, CIT's Technology Award$ program is the answer.
<P>
CIT's Technology Award$ program helps reduce your company's investment risk by introducing you to <A HREF="../resources/resources.html">intellectual resources in Virginia</A>, such as universities, colleges or federal laboratories, and by sharing the costs of technology development.
<P>
<A HREF="../VA.technology.html">Companies located in Virginia</A> and interested in working with <A HREF="../resources/resources.html">Virginia's intellectual resources</A> are eligible to participate in this program.
<P>
The following information describes the three types of awards offered and the requirements for each.  The process is simple, however it is important that you contact your <A HREF="../reach/howto.html">CIT regional director</A> to help you through the process.  Dial 1-800-3-TECHVA and you'll automatically be routed to your regional director.
<P>
Proposals submitted to the program are judged on the potential for economic impact-creating or retaining jobs, creating new companies or directing defense-based businesses toward commercial markets, and contributing to the company's bottom line through improved competitiveness-and the likelihood of technical success.

<H3>SBIR Conferences</H3>
<P>
There are two SBIR conferences in our area in the next month. 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The first is the National SBIR Conference, October 16-18, 1995, 
at the Hyatt Regency - Crystal City, Arlington. This
conference is always a great way to get started with SBIRs as you 
can learn about the individual programs in each agency, attend 
seminars on proposal preparation and other key topics. It costs
just $150 to attend -- call (407) 791-0720.
<P>
<LI>The second conference is sponsored by Virginia's Department of 
Environmental Quality and will focus on environmental technology 
commercialization through SBIR/STTR contracts.
This conference will be November 9, 1995 at the Richmond Marriott. 
For more information, contact K. C. Das at (804) 762-4184.
</UL>
<P>

<H3>DOD SBIR Fast Track Program</H3>
<P>
Starting October 1995, the DOD SBIR program will feature a 
new "Fast-Track" SBIR process for companies which, during their 
Phase I projects, identify independent third-party investors that
will match both Phase II SBIR funding and interium funding in cash. 
Companies which obtain such third-party investments and thereby 
qualify for the SBIR Fast Track will receive 
<OL>
<LI>interium funding between Phase I and Phase II;
<LI>DOD's highest priority for Phase II funding; and
<LI>an expedited Phase II selection decision and award.
</OL>
<P>
This program is described in more detail in the DOD SBIR solicitation 
just out. To receive a copy, call 1-800-DOD-SBIR or e-mail 
<A HREF="mailto:rsparks@DTIC.dia.mil">rsparks@DTIC.dia.mil</A>. 
If you have questions, you can call the DOD SBIR hotline at 
(800) 382-4634.
<P>

<H3>Capital Hill Action</H3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Advanced Technology Program is not funded as of this writing 
in either the House or Senate versions of the Commerce Appropriations 
bill. There is some hope for additional funding for the MEP - 
Manufacturing Extension Program.
<P>
<LI>The TRP looks like it will re-emerge as DUAP - Dual Use
Applications Program - still under Lee Buchanan at ARPA. It could be 
more linked to existing weapons systems and therefore to
existing defense contractors. More next time.
<P>
<LI>Three DOE Labs - Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore -- 
were granted stays of execution by the President last week. 
But DOE Labs are still under scrutiny.

<TITLE>THREE STUDIES REPORT THAT CIT IS EFFECTIVE AND HAS EXCEEDED ITS FIRST YEAR GOALS BY 10 PERCENT</TITLE>

<H1>THREE STUDIES REPORT THAT CIT IS EFFECTIVE AND HAS EXCEEDED ITS FIRST YEAR GOALS BY 10 PERCENT</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Herndon, VA -- Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology (CIT), 
announced today that during FY95 it saved, created or converted 3,500 
jobs and 27 companies in Virginia and created $75 million in increased
competitiveness for Virginia.  These results indicate that the New CIT
has exceeded its first year goals by at least 10%.  In addition,
clients reported a satisfaction rating of 4.1 on a scale of 5.0 and 
91% of CIT clients said they would use CIT services again.
<P>
Goals were established as a key component of the CIT strategic plan, 
approved by its Board of Directors in December 1994, that called for 
accountability - the establishment of clear, measurable goals for
economic impact and the commitment to annual, independent client surveys 
to determine progress against the goals.  The goal for the first year
of the three year cycle was 1000 new, saved or converted jobs; 25 new,
or retained companies; and $25 million in improved competitiveness.  
The three-year goal is to assist in the creation, attraction or
retention of 6,000 jobs, 150 companies and $100 million in increased 
company competitiveness.
<P>
The results came from a sample of nearly 400 client companies.  The
first study was performed by Battelle Memorial Institute on projects 
initiated before FY95.  The second study, conducted by The Institute
of Public Policy (TIPP) at George Mason University, collected data
about activities initiated during FY95 and for which the economic
impact occurred during FY95.  Results of the Battelle and TIPP studies
were combined to provide both the current and cumulative effects of 
CIT's efforts.
<P>
CIT President, Dr. Robert G. Templin, Jr., recently expressed his
thanks to the many CIT clients who responded to the surveys.  "We
really appreciate the support of our clients in this effort.  We 
know it was time-consuming and often painstaking to reconstruct
results related to our assistance, but with this feedback, we will be 
able to serve all Virginia companies better in the future."
<P>	
According to Battelle Memorial Institute, "Virginia is...the first
state to examine the overall impact of its entire program portfolio.  
CIT's effort serves as a national benchmark for further work in 
this area."
<P>
Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology was created by the General
Assembly in 1984 as a private, non-profit corporation.  Its mission is
to enhance the Commonwealth's competitiveness by providing businesses 
with access to the state's technology resources and assist in the
creation and retention of high technology jobs and businesses.

The Federal government sets aside research and development funding each year for small business.  This funding is administered through a program called the Small Business Innovation Research program (SBIR).  A companion program, the Small Business Technology Transfer Pilot program (STTR) is also available.  Because this funding often helps new technology firms get started, CIT provides assistance in applying for SBIRs and STTRs.
<P>
SBIR Awards support SBIR/STTR Phase I winners based on letters of commitment solicited by companies from CIT for inclusion in their proposal to the Federal government.  CIT can commit up to $15,000 to the university subcontractor.

<H1>CIT Seeds Roanoke Incubator</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Herndon, VA -- Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology's
President, Robert G. Templin, Jr., announced today the award of 
$200,000 to the City of Roanoke in support of
the development of a small business incubator. The Incubator is 
a joint project of the City of Roanoke and the Roanoke Regional 
Chamber of Commerce, and is strongly supported by the
business community in the form of endorsements by the New Century 
Council Technology Committee, the Roanoke County Board of Supervisors,
the Fifth Planning District Commission and the Roanoke Regional
Chamber of Commerce Board of Directors. CIT's
funding joins $200,000 from the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
$60,000 in CBDG funds through the City of Roanoke and $100,000 
in private investment.
<P>
CIT, through its entrepreneurship program, continues to support 
the development of incubators and entrepreneurship centers because 
they form the backbone of an entrepreneurial climate in the state 
that is associated with high growth from the small,
technology business sector.
<P>
The small business incubator will be furthered by a planning 
committee which includes Gary Atkinson, Regional Director, CIT; 
John Jennings, Blue Ridge SBDC; Hope Player, CPA; Phil Sparks, 
City of Roanoke; and John Stroud, Roanoke Regional Chamber of
Commerce.
<P>
Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology was created by the 
General Assembly in 1984 as a private, non-profit corporation. 
Its mission is to enhance the Commonwealth's competitiveness 
by providing businesses with access to the state's technology 
resources and assist in the creation and retention of high 
technology jobs and businesses.
<P>

<H1>Supercomputing Resources Acquired for Virginia's
Entrepreneurial Companies</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Herndon, VA -- Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) and
the MCNC's North Carolina Supercomputing Center have signed an
agreement which will allow Virginia's growth companies to access 
supercomputing resources at little or no charge. The
program, Stimulating and Enhancing Entrepreneurial Development 
(SEED), targets small businesses with the near-term potential to 
exploit a value-added, high-growth, technology-oriented market, if
they could access specialized computing expertise and capacity. Most
applications would be in product development, engineering analysis 
and design in the pharmaceutical, chemical, plastics injection
molding, engineering, health technologies and environmental industries.
<P>
Under the agreement, CIT will market the resources available at the 
North Carolina Supercomputing Center in Virginia, will assist 
Virginia companies who are eligible to prepare brief proposals
regarding their projects, including Virginia technical assistance as
required, and will submit those proposals to the MCNC. Approximately 
three proposals will be funded for the state of Virginia over 
the next year.

<H2>Final Report and Policy Recommendations</H2>
<H2>Presented to the Secretary of Commerce and Trade</H2>
<H3>By:</H3>
<H3>The Virginia Technology Council</H3>
<H3>December 20, 1995</H3>
<HR>
</CENTER>
For a full copy of this report with appendices, please contact Maxine Pitter

<HR>
<P>

<A NAME="summary"><H2>I.  Executive Summary</H2></A>
<P>
The idea for convening a series of telecommunications summits around the Commonwealth arose out of the recommendations of <CITE>Opportunity Virginia: A Strategic Plan for Jobs and Prosperity</CITE>, which was presented by Governor Allen on December 7, 1994.  To undertake this effort, the Governor asked the Virginia Technology Council, in conjunction with the Office of the Secretary for Commerce and Trade and the Center for Innovative Technology to organize a series of "Telecommunications Summits" around the state.  Summits were scheduled as follows:  Fairfax at George Mason University, on October 11,1995; Danville at Averett College on October 25, 1995; Norfolk at Old Dominion University on November 9, 1995; and Wytheville at Wytheville Community College on November 21, 1995. 
<P> 
In all of the summits presenters and organizers noted with some surprise that businesses do have a growing awareness of the existing and potential telecommunications infrastructure in the Commonwealth.  However, they have a real desire and need to learn how to apply the technology to improve their competitive position and for general economic development. They also are faced with certain regulatory and legislative barriers to full access.  Finally, they are concerned with keeping a competitive edge vis a vis local industry and in relation to other states.  Given the common issues which were raised at the four summits, the Virginia Technology Council has ten recommendations in four policy areas.  These areas are:
<P>

<OL>
<LI><CITE><B>Technology Awareness and Economic Development.</B></CITE>  Virginia currently has one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the United States. The Commonwealth and its localities must more aggressively market this infrastructure.
<P>
<LI><CITE><B>Regulation.</B></CITE>  The regulatory bodies in state government should acknowledge the need for rapid deregulation of many aspects of the rapidly-changing telecommunications marketplace. Many vendors now report that they are able to prepare new products for the market long before they can receive regulatory approval to offer them.  
<P>
<LI><CITE><B>Access, Cost and User Facilitation.</B></CITE>  A coordinated effort must be undertaken to facilitate equal low-cost access to Virginia's advanced telecommunications infrastructure by all businesses and citizens in the Commonwealth.  
<P>
<LI><CITE><B>Education and Training.</B></CITE>  Schools and institutions of higher education need to be linked in a planned and coordinated fashion.  This will allow students and faculty to have the full advantages of an information technology infrastructure and ease the provision of specialized educational services to all regions of Virginia.  In support of this policy, the Governor has recently announced a $100 million initiative, the first of several installments, to fund this education network.  
<P>
</OL>
<P>

<A NAME="intro"><H2>II.  Introduction </H2></A>
<P>
The idea for convening a series of telecommunications summits around
the Commonwealth arose out of the recommendations of a report presented by <A HREF="http://www.state.va.us/governor/gov.html">Governor Allen</A> on December 7, 1994.  Entitled <CITE>Opportunity Virginia: A Strategic Plan for Jobs and Prosperity</CITE>, this report was prepared by a group of 800 business and civic leaders from throughout Virginia under the direction of Gerard Ward.  The outcome of the Information Technology and Telecommunications Industry Sector Committee, headed by David Lucien, included a goal to "(c)apitalize on Virginia's technology assets and infrastructure to compete in the 21st century."  The first strategy presented under this goal was to "(p)romote the completion of advanced telecommunications and information infrastructure throughout the Commonwealth."  The best means of implementing this strategy was determined  to require the input of business leaders in order to learn what exactly they would require in order to maintain and promote their competitive edge.
<P>
To undertake this effort, the Governor asked the <A HREF="http://knowledgeway.org/milestones/orgs/va_techno_council.html">Virginia Technology Council</A>, in conjunction with the Office of the Secretary for Commerce and Trade and the <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Center for Innovative Technology</A> to organize a series of "Telecommunications Summits" around the state.  A steering committee was established in August, 1995, which included the following members:  David Lucien (President, Interpro, and Committee Chair), Christopher Bright (Assistant Secretary of Commerce and Trade), Michael Daniels (Sr. VP, <A HREF="http://www.saic.com/">SAIC</A>), <A
HREF="http://www.state.va.us/cim/croasdal.html">Hud Croasdale</A>
(Director, <A HREF="http://www.state.va.us/cim/cim.html">Council on
Information Management</A>), Valerie Perlowitz (President, Reliable Integration Services), Rosemarie Piepenhagen (Secretary, <A HREF="http://knowledgeway.org/milestones/orgs/va_techno_council.html">VTC</A>) and <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/wtolle.html">Wolfgang T&ouml;lle</A> (Managing Director, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</A>).  The steering committee, in conjunction with Robert T. Skunda, Secretary of Commerce and Trade, established the key messages and format of the upcoming summits as well as a summit schedule and a target audience.  
<P>
Summits were scheduled as follows:  Fairfax at <A
HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</A>, on October 11,
1995; <A HREF="http://ns.gamewood.net/danv/danville.html">Danville</A> at <A HREF="http://www.averett.edu/">Averett College</A> on October 25, 1995; <A HREF="http://hampton.roads.net/nhr/norfolk/">Norfolk</A> at <A HREF="http://www.odu.edu/">Old Dominion University</A> on November 9, 1995; and <A HREF="http://www.bnt.com/~wytheco/">Wytheville</A> at Wytheville Community College on November 21, 1995.  The Fairfax summit was co-sponsored by the <A
HREF="http://www.nvtc.org/">Northern Virginia Technology Council</A>,
under the direction of Ray Pelletier, and had an attendance of about
200.  The <A HREF="http://ns.gamewood.net/danv/danville.html">Danville</A> summit was arranged by the CIT Regional Director, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/lhgreen.html">Linda Green</A>, and was attended by about 100 participants.  The <A HREF="http://hampton.roads.net/nhr/norfolk/">Norfolk</A> summit was coordinated by Mike Montgomery of the <A HREF="http://www.patc.org/">Peninsula Advanced Technology Center</A>, and had about 125 participants.  The <A HREF="http://www.bnt.com/~wytheco/">Wytheville</A> summit was arranged by Dr. Jay Tice of the Southwest Virginia Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center, and had about 90 participants.  
<P>
Senior business executives from a wide range of sectors were invited to give feedback to the administration on their telecommunications needs.  The goal was to complete all summits before the Thanksgiving holiday, and to meet again with the <A HREF="http://knowledgeway.org/milestones/orgs/va_techno_council.html">Virginia Technology Council</A> in order to draft a "technology policy agenda" to submit to Governor Allen.   The purpose of this document, therefore, is to serve as a discussion paper in preparation of the "technology policy agenda."  
<P>
The key messages of the summits were: (1) to act as a follow-up to the
<CITE>Opportunity Virginia</CITE> Initiative, (2) to describe what
directions the Commonwealth is taking as a purchaser of goods and
services which could drive related private sector responses, (3) to make clear that the administration desires feedback from a broad industry perspective, and (4) to explain the administration's need to understand the opportunities and barriers to further development of a telecommunications infrastructure.  In order to present these messages, and create a mechanism for dialogue and feedback, the summits were to follow a similar format, with some leeway for regional differences in panel discussion.  Sample agendas are attached in the <A HREF="./telfinal.html#appx">appendices</A>, and a general overview of the agenda is presented in <A HREF="./telfinal.html#synopsis">Section IV</A>.  The cross-cutting issues raised by these discussions and the surveys that were returned are summarized in <A HREF="./telfinal.html#issues">Section III</A>.  Policy alternatives related to those issues are also presented in <A HREF="./telfinal.html#issues">Section III</A>.

<B><CITE>Survey Methodology</CITE></B>
<P>
In order to provide the VTC with additional input in generating policy recommendations, a multi-part survey (see Appendix) was distributed to attendees of all of the regional telecommunications summits, soliciting feedback on various telecommunications-related issues. Surveys were included in the summit packages, and a follow up mailing from Secretary Skunda's office also included a copy of the survey.

</TABLE>
<BR>
Note: Bold indicates priority issues
<P>
Table 1 presents a matrix of the key policy issues of concern that
were raised both by the surveys and during the individual
summits.  (Issues raised in the individual locations are described in anecdotal form in the Appendix.  Some references were also drawn from the surveys.  Bulleted comments by participants and speakers are cross-referenced to the above table.)  These can be clustered into the categories described below.  In addition, issues of particular regional concern are noted in boldface in the table.  The survey response column serves two purposes - it captures comments that were not raised during summit discussions, and it expands upon and re-emphasizes particular points of view that were also addressed at the summits.  To date, 49 surveys have been returned, and it is expected that Secretary Skunda's follow-up letter will generate several more.
<P>
Generally speaking, while most of  the survey respondents were fairly well linked into the telecommunications infrastructure (approximately 88% of the respondents had access to either email or the Internet), many expressed concerns about being able to keep up with the rapidly changing industry, either as a user or as a provider.  Respondents from smaller enterprises particularly expressed an interest in having the Commonwealth assist them by acting in an overall coordinating, or information management capacity.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Training/Jobs:</B>
<P>
	Most frequently concern was expressed that businesses (particularly the smaller operations) were failing to keep up with the rapidly advancing industry, and hence losing the advantages that the telecommunications industry can provide to users.  Interest was expressed in some sort of information coordination, training, or "matching" operations that would allow some group benefits for smaller businesses.
<P>
<LI><B>Regulation and deregulation issues:</B>
<P>
Respondents had an interesting divergence in terms of regulatory issues.  Where many respondents expressed a desire for some regulation of the Internet, particularly as related to security and electronic commerce issues, they also expressed a desire for less regulation in terms of local controls on business operation.  Respondents expressed support for deregulation of telecommunication in general in the anticipation that it would result in lower prices from competition.
<P>
<LI><B>Bandwidth:</B>
<P>
Given the wide range of potential technology applications outlined during the opening presentations and panel discussions, participants were concerned about their current and future bandwidth needs and whether they would be able to take full advantage of the products and services offered in the marketplace.
<P>
<LI><B>Access/cost concerns:</B>
<P>
While many respondents recognized and welcomed the opportunities provided by use of telecommunications and information technologies, they frequently were concerned about the cost of equipment (considered a potential barrier to entry) needed to access and take advantage of the networks as well as the additional cost of  telecommunication services. 
<P>
<LI><B>Standards/open systems:</B>
<P>
Ability to interconnect with other services, and to access state and other governmental information and services was of interest.
<P>
<LI><B>Security:</B>
<P>Concerns were expressed most commonly about the risks of conducting electronic commerce over the Internet without adequate safeguards.
<P>
<LI><B>Awareness /Economic Development:</B>
<P>
Advocacy of business interests, and a coordination role was suggested as a useful policy.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
Some regional differences were also apparent, although the number of survey responses were not sufficient from the different regions to make meaningful distinctions.  However, as might be expected, most respondents were more concerned with deregulation and intellectual property and security concerns, while respondents from the more rural parts of the state expressed concern over access and cost issues.  
<P>

<H3>B.  Policy Recommendations</H3>
<P>
Given the common issues which were raised at the four summits, the Virginia Technology Council has ten recommendations in four policy areas:  Technology Awareness and Economic Development; Regulation; Access, Cost and User Facilitation; and Education and Training.
<P>
They are described in detail below:
<P>
<OL>
<P>
<LI><CITE><B>Technology Awareness and Economic Development.</B></CITE>  Virginia currently has one of the best telecommunications infrastructures in the United States.  It is essential, however, that existing and prospective Virginia businesses readily understand this capacity and aggressively capitalize on it.  The Commonwealth and its localities must more aggressively market this infrastructure.  Businesses in Virginia need also to be aware of the potential partnerships which could result from, and the possible beneficial applications of, advances telecommunications technology. 
<P>
Specific actions in support of this option include:  
<P>
<UL>
<LI>providing state grants to localities or economic development organizations to assist in the financing and maintenance of "home pages."  These "pages" are proving to be increasingly popular sources of information and all localities should have the opportunity to fully leverage them for their benefit.
<P>
<LI>marketing the unique capabilities and infrastructure in some Virginia communities, such as that in the Blacksburg Electronic Village, in Winchester, and the portions of Virginia served by the new Bell Atlantic video service.  
<P>
<LI>promoting those state telecommunications policy decisions (such as those which result from <CITE>Road Map to the Future</CITE>) which are complementary to guiding, leveraging, and encouraging private sector investment and compatible decisions.
<P>

<P>
<LI><CITE><B>Regulation.</B></CITE>  The regulatory bodies in state government should acknowledge the need for rapid deregulation of many aspects of the rapidly-changing telecommunications marketplace.  With telephone, video, computer, broadcast, and cable services combining, merging and increasingly inter-operating, the old system of regulation and monitoring of service provision is unnecessary and retards rapid application of emerging beneficial technologies.  Many vendors now report that they are able to prepare new products for the market long before they can receive regulatory approval to offer them.  
<P>
Specific actions in support of this option include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>reexamining state and local business licensing, permitting, zoning, taxation, and depreciation regulations to identify barriers to new telecommunications technologies and their application.  This includes a considerations of promoting "on-line" licensing and permitting, for example, and continued promotion of conducting public meeting using new technology.  This necessarily includes careful consideration given to the related issues of information privacy and security, and public access.
<P>
<LI>acknowledging that, while service costs should no longer be regulated, in some limited instances it will be necessary in order to ensure access to telecommunications services for relatively short periods of time until market forces adequately respond.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<LI><CITE><B>Access, Cost and User Facilitation.</B></CITE>  A coordinated effort must be undertaken to facilitate equal low-cost access to Virginia's advanced telecommunications infrastructure by all businesses and citizens in the Commonwealth.  
<P>
Specific actions in support of this option include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>extending and accelerating the implementation of the existing telecommunications initiative of Virginia Tech, Old Dominion University, and the Virginia Community College System ("Virginia Virtual Campus") to allow access for local businesses, citizens, governments, schools, and libraries in joining the network using the community colleges as nodes, particularly in rural areas.
<P>
<LI>promoting the continued creation of privately-funded local technology councils across the Commonwealth to advocate on behalf of high technology and the benefits of an expanded infrastructure. Such councils could best identify and develop local and regional networking opportunities, lobby for lowered regulatory barriers, and highlight the existing services demand.
<P>
<LI>providing challenge awards, matched by private and local resources, to create incentives for regions and localities to develop plans for telecommunications infrastructure development and deployment.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
<LI><CITE><B>Education and Training.</B></CITE>  Schools and institutions of higher education need to be linked in a planned and coordinated fashion.  This will allow students and faculty to have the full advantages of an information technology infrastructure and ease the provision of specialized educational services to all regions of Virginia.  In support of this policy, the Governor has recently announced a $100 million initiative, the first of several installments, to fund this education network.  
<P>
Other specific actions in support of this option include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>deploying additional technology resources directly into workplaces.  This will simplify and ease the provision of workforce training and will help ensure the training meets the specific needs of the employers.
<P>
<LI>ensuring that the education offered by school systems in Virginia provides adequate foundations in the necessary reading, writing, communication, and mathematical skills to enable students to fully utilize the telecommunications network and services.

<A NAME="synopsis"><H2>IV.  Synopsis of the Summits and Regional Issues</H2></A>
<P>
The summits opened with a greeting from the local sponsor, who introduced Secretary Skunda.  Secretary Skunda emphasized the importance of this effort and of feedback from industry executives, reinforced by a videotaped message by the Governor.  The Secretary then presented a video on <CITE>Opportunity Virginia</CITE>, followed by a summary of the telecommunications strategy.  This was done by a member of the <CITE>Opportunity Virginia</CITE> group in Fairfax and Danville, and by the Secretary in Norfolk and Wytheville.  
<P>
The next information presentation was done by <A
HREF="http://www.state.va.us/cim/croasdal.html">Hud Croasdale</A>, Director of the <A HREF="http://www.state.va.us/cim/cim.html">Virginia Council on Information Management</A>.  He summarized the strategic plan to develop the Commonwealth's information technology infrastructure <CITE>"Roadmap to the Future."</CITE>  "The focus of this effort was to gain a broad understanding of the needs of the Commonwealth and thus promote a solution that can meet the requirements of government, business, localities and citizens." ("Roadmap," p. v)
<P>
Before breaking, and in order to explain all of the players interested in business feedback, a member of the Virginia Technology Council presented a short summary of VTC involvement in this effort.  He then explained the purpose and composition of the Virginia Technology Council.  This role was filled by George Newstrom in Fairfax, Kirk Schroder in Danville, Terry Riley in Norfolk, and Jim Lowe in Wytheville.  
<P>
The latter part of the summits was devoted to panel discussions.  While the broad purpose of the panels was similar, local and regional concerns were also addressed.  The first panel was entitled "Current Regional and Institutional Initiatives."  For this panel, each of the four summits had contributions by: (1) Dr. Anne Raymond-Savage of the Teletechnet program coordinated by Old Dominion University - a distance learning and workforce training and retraining initiative using telecommunications infrastructure extensively; and (2) a representative from Virginia Tech, who explained the development of the Blacksburg Electronic Village - a means of bringing the local citizenry into contact with advanced technology as well as streamlining many government functions.  In addition, Dan Malone, of the Winchester-Frederick County Economic Development Commission, participated in the summits in Fairfax and Norfolk, and demonstrated how one locality in partnership with Shenandoah Telecommunications Company  (ShenTel) succeeded in attracting private Internet providers and establishing a telecommuting center and a teleport.  
<P>
Regionally, there were some specialized presentations.  The first panel in the Fairfax summit included a presentation by Mario Morino, on the <CITE>Potomac KnowledgeWay</CITE>, a regional partnership spearheaded by the Morino Institute, which encourages regional efforts to leverage and integrate the Northern Virginia information industry.  In Danville the local initiative presented was by Scott Langhorst of Virginia Community College, who gave an overview of various local information infrastructure initiatives underway in the community college system.  In Norfolk, Duncan McIver presented the work of SEVAnet, the Southeastern Virginia Free Net, which provides public access to computerized information and communications services to all of the communities of the Southeastern Virginia Region.  SEVAnet's goal is to use communications technologies to improve the quality of life in the region through assisting economic development,  and providing technological assistance to the business community.  Finally, in Wytheville, Bruce Mathews, of the Southwest Virginia Education and Training Network discussed an initiative begun with the support of ninth district Congressman Rick Boucher.  This project has implemented a fiber optic network that will improve classrooms, share courses and teachers and introduce new media into school systems and institutions of higher learning in 13 southwestern Virginia counties.  
<P>
The second panel was entitled "Future Technology and Possible Network Capabilities."  All four panels had in common the presence of Ralph Frye, the Executive Vice President of the Virginia Telecommunications Industry Association.  His principal message was that a digitally switched broad-band network is being deployed rapidly by private industry, and it is having an impact in many sectors - from education and health to criminal justice, government and electronic commerce.  Beyond this presentation, the second panel reflected regional priorities and industry mix.
<P>
In Fairfax, because of northern Virginia's concentration of businesses in the information technology sector, the presentations focused on providers' plans to focus on this sector. Gabe Batista, President and CEO of Cable and Wireless spoke on technology and policy implications resulting from changes in the telecommunications environment.  Stephen VonRump, Vice President, MCI, explained telecommunications network development from a common carrier's standpoint.  Finally, Marco Rustici, Vice President Sales and Marketing, Bell Atlantic Video Services presented Bell Atlantic's plans in the area of video-on-demand.
<P>
In Danville the focus was more on telecommunications technology applications, and business return on investment for telecommunications technology.  Karen Puckett, of GTE Mobilnet, explained the new wireless technologies that were to be introduced into the region and their potential applications.  Mike Rieley of Bell Atlantic, discussed the regional provider's link to the information highway and plans for future capabilities.  Ed Wolborne of Gamewood Data Systems explained how their small company was filling the niche of Internet provision in a region with no large providers.  Finally, Edwin Evering of B&W Nuclear Technologies explained the return on investment his company was getting through their private development of a global corporate telecommunications infrastructure, and their plans for the future.
<P>
The Norfolk regional panel's focus was on regional providers' plans, and included  Dana Coltrin, Technical Operations Manager for Cox Cable and General Manager for Cox Fibernet discussed current initiatives by the cable industry.  Tom Manos, President, Network Services, InfiNet presented growth trends in the Internet services industry.  Norman Neal, Jr., General Manager of Operations for Eastern Virginia Bell Atlantic noted that his company plans to make use of every possible electronic medium as opportunities present themselves.
<P>
Finally, in Wytheville, the second panel's focus was on future possibilities for infrastructure development.  Neal Vines, Director of Virginia Cooperative Extension Services explained the current activities that the extension service is undertaking to allow full Internet access to all its city and county extension offices, and the future implications of keeping residents in rural areas and bringing the technology to them.  Ralph Frye noted that Southwest Virginia's proximity to one of the largest national fiber optic network spines and the rapidly growing number of entrepreneurial providers who were springing up in the area. Finally, Stephen Laek of Sprint United Telephone, presented the directions Sprint is taking and may be taking in terms of local service provision.  He noted the growing deployment of digital ISDN technology because of lowered costs and better technology. He also noted his optimism for the long-term possibility of local Internet access, with the caveat that a good business case has to be made first.  
<P>
There was an opportunity for question and answer to the panelists, the presenters and the Secretary either following the panels or during the luncheon.  The discussions that arose in each of the individual summits are summarized and broken down in the Appendix.
<P>

<A NAME="appx"><H2>V.  Appendices</H2></A>

<H2>HIGHLIGHTS OF REGIONAL SUMMITS</H2>

<H3>A. Fairfax</H3>
<P>
The Northern Virginia summit differed somewhat from the other summits.  There were several reasons for this, including a list of attendees who were already involved in the information and communication sectors, and therefore quite knowledgeable about the subject matter.  Also, it became clear, after running out of time at several sessions, that the timetable of the conference would have to be altered to allow for greater participant feedback. The comments below reflect the abbreviated period available for the attendees to raise issues at the lunch session, though additional issues were gleaned from the surveys: 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>One of the main issues of concern that came out in the luncheon
discussion at the Fairfax summit had to do with training and re-training.  Many comments were directed toward learning how the state would support the need for a workforce skilled enough to handle advanced telecommunications infrastructure.  Other participants expressed interest in applications of information technology in schools, and stressed the importance of ensuring the there were adequate opportunities for learning, as well as a commitment to making sure that adequate computers and related technology  were available for students. <CITE>(issue: Training/Jobs)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Comments were briefly made about the importance of avoiding excessive
local regulation that would hinder business growth and development. <CITE>(issue: Regulation)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>One participant noted that there is a significant lack of start-up/venture capital available,  and inquired as to what the Commonwealth doing to encourage these types of financing streams.  Several other participants noted that the area covered by the summit encompassed several different regions, ranging from high-density information infrastructure-rich locations, to areas that were barely served by Internet without long distance charges.  A question was raised as to what the Commonwealth was doing to promote infrastructure development to encourage telecommunications-related growth. <CITE>(issue: Access/Costs)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Another participant expressed a concern that general standards be set to ensure the ready exchange of information. Conflicting or incompatible standards would slow down the abilities of business to take advantage of networks. <CITE>(Issue: Standards/Open Systems)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>In order to encourage information related commerce especially over networks several issues need to be addressed from a regulatory standpoint.  For example, what efforts are being undertaken by the Commonwealth to ensure that networks are secure in terms of financial and information content?  Secondly what sorts of protections are possible to prevent improper use or misappropriation of the intellectual content of the information flows?  <CITE>(Issue: Security)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>One respondent noted that given the nature of the conference he was rather surprised that the survey had to be returned by fax or mail, and that there were no email addresses provided for feedback to state officials and agencies.  Provision of these would provide technology leadership by example.  <CITE>(issue: Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>
</UL>
<P>

<H3>B.  Danville </H3>
<P>
The discussion in Danville highlighted the level of awareness that businesses already have about existing infrastructure, and their curiosity about how best to integrate this technology into their activities.  The key barriers participants noted had more to do with regulatory and tax concerns.  Some representatives of rural counties expressed apprehensions about costs of service and access to providers.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A question was raised regarding the possibility of on-line business permitting in localities.  It was noted that the Blacksburg Electronic Village is working on offering such a service, but there is a perception of security and privacy worries, resulting in regulations against issuing certain permits.  <CITE>(issue: Awareness/Economic Development; Regulation; Security)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Within the discussion of Blacksburg, a question was raised as to whether this was a Virginia Tech initiative, or if it included municipalities, and whether there were state/local ties to the private sector.  This concern highlighted the lack of a state university in the region, and an interest in who might undertake such an initiative, such as a private group or a community college.  <CITE>(issue: Access/Costs; Awareness/Economic Development; Regulation)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>An Internet provider raised a question about local exchange costs for dial-in access, but users seemed unconcerned by these issues.  Additionally, he noted the inadequacy of existing 128 k lines and the imminent need for broader bandwidth.  <CITE>(issue: Access/Cost; Bandwidth)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Providers were asked what can be done to facilitate access to the web?  In response it was noted that Blacksburg has a program to provide small grants for creation of home pages, etc. In addition, a representative from Virginia Tech noted that they can provide access.  <CITE>(issue: Awareness/Economic Development; Access/Cost)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>A representative of the local education authority was concerned with heightened disparities in education, and wondered if efforts were underway to ensure high bandwidth access to every school in Virginia in order to prepare a competitive workforce for the future.  <CITE>(issue: Jobs/Training; Bandwidth)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Concerns were raised from several perspectives regarding rate structures for telecommunications services.  One question noted state agencies' difficulties in negotiating definitive phone rates for areas such as compressed data and video, and asked how the Commonwealth could clarify ambiguities.  The response was that there is a proposal underway through the Department of Information Technology to integrate rates.  Increased understanding and consistency in the rate structure would aid economic development if private businesses were later able to link in with public infrastructure.  <CITE>(issue: Regulation; Access/Costs; Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>An unintended consequence of the Danville session was the enthusiasm generated for the formation of a regional technology council.  On the urging of Kirk Schroder, businesses were encouraged to work together to address their technology needs and concerns. The local C.I.T. office and the A.L. Philpott Center in Martinsville have subsequently received strong letters of interest in pursuing this further.  <CITE>(issue: Training/Jobs; Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>.  
<P>
</UL>
<P>

<H3>C.  Norfolk</H3>
<P>
The main issue, according to Terry Riley, of the Virginia Technology Council, concerned the ongoing efforts of private businesses in developing telecommunications infrastructure.  There was also  agreement that government should promote, but not overly regulate further development.  For example, one businessman with a core of consultants expressed dismay that in promoting this kind of a flexible worksite, the state cannot control local jurisdictions taxation and zoning structures which make accounting and adherence to tax codes very difficult.
<P>
A majority of the issues that were generated from the attendees arose during the morning session. Many of the respondents expressed the feeling that the Commonwealth has a very important role to play in these telecommunications and information technology sectors, and that "it's time they got on with it." 
<P>
There seemed to be a sense that local (and to some extent, state) regulations and tax codes are "way out of date" with regard to changes in both technology, and how the end-users apply these technologies.  A couple of the comments address this issue.  One respondent noted that there should be sufficient technical knowledge on the part of legislative staffers to provide support in crafting appropriate laws and policies consistent with technological advances.  Further, this might be expected to encourage economic development generated by technology deployment.
<P>
Other issues raised:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>If business/government is going to operate over an open network, then security becomes a key issue.  Appropriate technological solutions such as encryption technology will help, but complementary law and enforcement are needed to assure proprietary information is not misappropriated. <CITE>(issue: Security)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Optimal application of communication technologies requires establishment of an integrated net (high bandwidth) with access available in every region of the state. Virginia's role should be to ensure that  this happens.  This might range from provision of incentives to actual implementation/construction of infrastructure. Once this type of "backbone" is provided then it is the role of local and regional public/private entities to put together the regional nets which will link to the backbone. <CITE>(issue: Bandwidth)</CITE> 
<P>
<LI>Remove or reduce the penalties and costs (taxes, zoning, and depreciation rules) associated with broad use of computers (particularly PCs) in telecommuting.  Currently local rules & laws hold back companies' use of this approach.  Further, phone company pricing for interconnection across political boundaries (e.g., between adjacent counties) sets cost barriers to regional net access.  It would also be useful to be able to register, file forms, file reports, and pay taxes to the state over the Internet (State Corporation Commission, VEC, taxing authorities were mentioned). <CITE>(issue: Regulation)</CITE>
<P>
</UL>
<P>

<H3>D.  Wytheville</H3>
<P>
In Wytheville, located in southwest Virginia, and poorly served by providers, concerns were raised regarding rural access to the Internet.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>One participant noted his difficulty, as a private business, of gaining the same kind of access as that his son, a university student, enjoys.  In response, it was suggested that by promoting competition among providers, with continued deregulation, there would be opportunities to create multiple hubsites - through schools, community colleges, local government authorities, etc.  As long as compatibility was ensured, businesses could soon have the same type of access as the better equipped universities. <CITE>(issue: Access/Cost; Regulation; Standards/Open Systems; Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Along these lines, a participant wanted to know what the criteria were for measuring demand and bringing in services.  While the larger companies might make more calculated business decisions, it was pointed out that the growth of entrepreneurial start-up providers indicates that some businesses believe that demand exists.  <CITE>(issue: Access/Cost; Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Another participant was interested in electronic commerce possibilities.  It was pointed out that it was up to the businesses themselves to develop, once the infrastructure was in place.  Clearly, however, there is the opportunity to bring non-metropolitan areas into the global economy. Cost will continue to be an issue, however, and the administration feels that this needs to be factored into private business decision making.   <CITE>(issue: Access/Cost; Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>In terms of statewide goals for retaining and creating jobs, a participant asked if information technology could be harnessed to develop a network to communicate capabilities between small businesses.  In response, it was suggested that this type of effort was in mind with the creation of the Virginia Technology Council and in encouraging the formation of regional technology councils. <CITE>(issue: Training/Jobs; Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Several participants expressed concern about access through different perspectives.  One participant, for example, suggested that the Commonwealth keep in mind the importance of Internet access for the general public, and noted that the library system was the best venue.  The Secretary agreed and discussed an ongoing initiative in this area through the state library system.  <CITE>(issue: Access/Costs; Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>A local businessman brought up the issue of regulatory, legislative, (and in this case constitutional) barriers to deployment of infrastructure.  As a small Internet provider, they would like to be able to negotiate long-term contracts with state entities, such as the community colleges.  These institutions, however, are constitutionally bound not to commit to contracts for longer than a year, which complicates private business plans.  While there is no immediate solution to this particular problem, the need to reevaluate certain regulations was noted.  This need is highlighted by the graying of differences between hardware configurations and software applications. <CITE>(issue: Standards/Open Systems; Regulation)</CITE>
<P>
<LI>Finally, the issue was raised about the absence from the VTC of a representative from  southwestern Virginia.  The region was encouraged to follow up on this with the Governor's office, and to take a proactive stance by forming a regional technology council. <CITE>(issue: Awareness/Economic Development)</CITE>

<H1>Grand slam</H1>
<P>
RAY PELLETIER OF THE Northern Virginia Technology Council 
calls the IBM and Toshiba deal to build a $1.2 billion 
semiconductor plant in Manassas "an economic home run." 
No. It's a World Series grand slam.
<P>
It is hard to overstate the impact of the plant announced yesterday. At
the beginning it will employ 1,200 people to build the next generation
of computer chips; eventually 4,000 people could work there. It will 
mean a more diversified regional economy. It will be a larger
investment than the doomed Disney plan (with smaller taxpayer
incentives), and the plant's shell is already built.
<P>
The manufacturing end of the technology industry will form a
synergistic parallelogram with Northern Virginia's high tech 
systems integration companies (BDM, PRC) the red-hot Internet 
service providers (America Online, Psi, UUNet), and research sponsored 
by George Mason University and the Center for Innovative Technology.
<P>
That critical mass is second only to Silicon Valley, and will lure more
technology jobs, money and prestige to the region and to the state, 
which already is excited about the $3 billion Motorola semiconductor 
plant planned west of Richmond.  In case anyone doesn't get it yet, 
Gov. Allen has it right: "This decision confirms Virginia's emergence
as the new technology center of the eastern United States."
<P>
The governor can take partial credit for the decision; he and his
people worked on the IBI/Toshiba group for months. The state's 
pro-business environment and comparatively low tax burden, 
Northern Virginia's well educated, highly skilled workforce, IBM's 
knowledge of the Manassas site (it made chips there before leaving
1992), and the proximity of Dulles International Airport also get credit.
<P>
So how does Virginia, and especially Northern Virginia, take advantage
of this critical mass?  The Northern Virginia Technology Council 
points the way.
<P>
Maintaining and improving that pro-business environment is
paramount.  Tax and regulatory policies- especially the onerous 
and counterproductive Business, Professional and Occupational 
License tax assessed by local governments- must be revisited by 
the General Assembly.
<P>
Finding ways to attract more venture capital in the state- the
Virginia Retirement System invests in venture capital funds out of
state- are important to helping businesses grow. And improving 
technology education in public schools, from elementary school 
through the community colleges and the universities, will be important 
for supplying those businesses with qualified workers.
<P>
The technology council is right. Unlike the World Series, this 
competition for economic development, stability and security never 
ends.  Virginia is doing well, and Northern Virginia is leading the 
way. But the region and the state must find ways to keep winning the 
game.

<H2>GOVERNOR ALLEN ANNOUNCES DYNAMIC ENGINEERING EXPANSION</H2>

<B>-Space and Defense Propulsion Technology Converting to Private Sector Use-</B>
<P>
<B>-Company Expected to Create More Than 100 New Jobs-</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
RICHMOND - Virginia Governor George Allen today announced that Dynamic 
Engineering Inc. (DEI), will expand its current operations at the Oyster 
Point Industrial Park in Newport News.  With an initial investment of $1.4 
million, DEI is expected to create up to 100 jobs in the first year and 
additional jobs in the next two to three years.
<P>
"I am pleased Dynamic Engineering found that the 'Silicon Dominion' has the 
best business climate for their high technology production," said Governor 
Allen. "Dave Mullins, DEI's president and CEO, has demonstrated tenacious 
leadership qualities by converting this employee-owned company from a 
military dependent firm to a private sector competitor. DEI's decision to 
choose Virginia will keep this successful company flying high above its 
competitors."
<P>
DEI is a leader in aerospace and marine prototyping and development that 
has long heldcontracts with NASA, the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy.  
The company is now expanding its development and manufacturing capabilities 
for private sector use.  Included in its myriad of products are low speed 
hypersonic wind tunnel models, rotor blades, aircraft structural components, 
propulsion systems hardware and deep dive and salvage hardware.
<P>
"Virginia has the right atmosphere for the creation of high paying, high 
skilled jobs," said David Mullins, DEI president and CEO.  "We are extremely 
grateful for the assistance that we got from the professional staffs at the 
Department of Economic development, the Peninsula Advanced Technology 
Center, the City of Newport News and Virginia's Center for Innovative 
Technology."
<P>
The expansion was made possible by a $700,000 loan from the Virginia Small 
Business Financing Authoritys Defense Conversion Loan Fund, and a CIT 
award of $100,000 for the development of a virtual manufacturing resource.

<H1>Something ventured: Tech sector gets funds</H1>

<P>
By CAROLYN HIRSCHMAN<BR>
Staff Reporter<BR>
<P>

Slowly but surely, Washington-area
high-tech companies are attracting more
venture capital, said participants in this
year's annual venture capital conference
sponsored by Ernst & Young.
<P>
The D.C. area still pales in comparison
to California and Massachusetts in attracting 
venture financing. In 1991, investors
had $98 million in private companies in the 
mid-Atlantic vs. $661 million in northern     
California and $155 million in                
Massachusetts, according to the latest figures 
from the National Venture Capital                     
Association.
<P>
D.C.'s "government town" image is
starting to change as the high-tech sector
matures in size and sophistication, experts
said. The area has more than 2,300 technology firms, 
many of them small, cash-starved startups in Virginia and Maryland.
"The level of investor interest seemed
higher, enthusiasm was higher" at this
year's conference, said Catherine Renault,
managing director of Virginia's Center for
Innovative Technology. The conference
was held June 28 at the Ritz-Carlton in
McLean.
<P>
"There's no doubt we're starting to have
winners," added William H. Washecka,
Ernst & Young's local director of high
technology. He pointed to two early conference 
presenters - Vienna-based
America Online, a computer online service, and 
Columbia-based Martek
Biosciences, a biotechnology firm - that
have made it big.
<P>
About 150 investor groups, mainly East
Coast venture-capital firms and investment
banks, heard presentations by 27 local
high-tech companies hoping for a financial
shot in the arm. Judging by the past six
conferences, about five companies will win
an investment in the next few months.
<P>
The hot areas are telecommunications,
online computer services and computer
hardware, experts said. Later-stage funding
is more likely than early seed funding.
<P>
How much gets invested year to year
fluctuates wildly depending on Wall
Street's affections. how many companies
are trying to raise money and the amount of
information divulged, according to financial sources.
<P>
At this year's conference, companies in
software engineering, multimedia, life sciences 
and other fields each sought from
$300,000 to $15 million in funding; most
asked for $1 million to $3 million.
<P>
Presenters were upbeat, saying the conference offered 
publicity and contacts, if
nothing else. "It puts you in the network a
little more," said Vincent W. Sedmak, president of 
Arlington-based Apogee 2000, a
voice-mail network company that lost $1.9
million last year. It's seeking $5 million to
$15 million.
<P>
The conference's main hosts were Ernst
& Young, the Center for Innovative
Technology and the Northern Virginia
Technology Council. The Washington
Business Journal was also a sponsor.

<H1>Va. Bets future on chips</H1>
<H2>State becoming technology center</H2>
<P>
By Martha Slud<BR>
The Associated Press<BR>
<P>

RICHMOND<P>
It began in northern California's Silicon Valley, 
then spread north to Oregon and south to Texas. Now, 
the computer chip industry is beginning to till what 
could be dubbed "The Silicon Plantation."  
<P>
Virginia scored a coup Tuesday when IBM and Japanese electronics
giant Toshiba Corp. announced plans for a $1.2 billion semiconductor 
chip plant in the outer Washington suburb of Manassas. In April, 
Motorola Corp. announced it will spend up to $3 billion on a silicon 
chip-making plant outside Richmond.  
<P>
Virginia, whose economy once was rooted in tobacco, is leaving its
plantation past behind and heralding its future in high technology. 
Gov. George Allen, who has promised to create 100,000 new jobs 
during his administration, has made no secret of his desire to lure 
major high-tech firms that have previously flocked to California, 
Austin, Texas, the Pacific Northwest and Boston.  
<P>
"I do think this decision shows that Virginia has emerged as the new
technology center for the eastern United States," Allen said. 
"We can compete with anyone."  
<P>
Allen, gleeful over estimates that IBM-Toshiba and Motorola will
create up to 4,000 new jobs with average salaries of $35,000, 
has offered the companies generous incentives packages.
<P>
But unlike last year's fiasco in which the state agreed to give
the Walt Disney Co. millions for a theme park project that the 
company later abandoned, state and local officials say they are 
tying the chip-makers' incentives to plant performance.
<P>
The $48.2 million in incentives promised to IBM-Toshiba
includes guarantees that construction is completed and 
jobs are created, said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Robert Skunda. 
He said the state's cash payments would not begin for five years 
and would continue as long as the companies expand their facilities 
and meet production goals.
<P>
Earlier this year, Allen proposed $85.6 million in incentives
for Motorola that also will be tied to plant performance and 
job creation.  The Virginia legislature is expected to approve 
both proposals.
<P>
Other states, including North Carolina and Indiana, are increasingly
using performance incentives when negotiating with companies to 
guard against firms "taking the money and running," said Bill Schweke,
program director for the Corporation for Enterprise Development, 
a nonprofit thinktank and consulting firm in Chapel Hill, N.C.
Schweke said Virginia must be careful not to promise other high-tech 
firms incentives that its economy cannot support. He pointed to
New Mexico, the home of an Intel Corp. chip plant, which has come
under fire by some citizens who say state officials jeopardized 
the area's tax base by offering the company too many breaks.
<P>
Virginia has spent about 20 years developing a technological
infrastructure, including its well-regarded university system, 
that computer chip companies like to draw upon, said Robert G. 
Templin Jr., president of the state-supported Center for 
Innovative Technology in Herndon. The state's many existing 
high-tech firms also create a support network for chip companies, 
he said.
<P>
Toshiba officials initially pushed for an Oregon site, but the
Motorola announcement helped change their mind, Skunda said. 
The Motorola project has been welcomed by the local community 
and its job information line has been humming.
<P>
"Success tends to breed more success," said Kevin Brett, a 
spokesman for the Semiconductor Industry Association in 
San Jose, Calif. "When a company makes a decision to locate 
in a given region...that prompts other companies to take a 
look at that area as well."
<P>
This "clustering effect" occurs because most high-tech companies look
for similar attributes in plant sites, said Jody Bolstad, a
spokeswoman for Schaumburg, Ill.-based Motorola.  Virginia offers
good water sources essential for chip-making, reasonable land costs
and a good quality of life, she said.
<P>
The industry's expansion reflects strong demand for
semiconductor components worldwide, said Linley Gwennap, 
editor of the Microprocessor Report newsletter in Sebastol, 
Calif. Chips are used to power computers, cellular phones,
cars and home appliances.
<P>
Global chip sales are expected to exceed $100 billion this year
from just over $90 billion in 1994.  Robust computer sales and the
launch this year of Microsoft's new Windows 95 operating system are
fueling the demand, Gwennap said.  Virginia wants to be the home of
more computer chip plants, Skunda said, although he and Allen
declined to comment on whether any other chip-makers were 
scouting the state.
<P>
"We've known about it in Virginia for some time, but there wasn't 
a good enough job marketing it before," Skunda said of the state's
high-tech potential. "But when highly respected companies of the
caliber of IBM, Toshiba, Motorola decide to come here, it makes a
statement that the rest of the world understands and takes note of.

<H1>Spaceport Could Rocket Va. Into the Future, Officials Say</H1>
<H3>First Commercial Flight Canceled, but Backers Say Facility Would Mean Jobs, Money</H3>

<P>
By Rajiv Chandrasekaran<BR>
Washington Post Staff Writer<BR>
<P>

WALLOPS ISLAND, Va., Aug. 13- If a few
scientists, business leaders and state officials
have their way, Virginia could have one of the
nation's busiest ports two years from now on
this finger-shaped marsh just off the state's
Eastern Shore, attracting cargo from all over
the world.
<P>
The facility won't be for ships, airplanes or
buses, but for commercial rockets that will propel 
satellite and scientific experiments hundreds of miles into space.
<P>
With the backing of Gov. George Allen (R),
proponents recently have moved forward with
an ambitious plan to build a state-run "spaceport"
on a sprawling National Aeronautics and
Space Administration complex here that could
launch several dozen mid-size rockets a year.
<P>
Their efforts are expected to get a boost
with the launch of the first commercial spacecraft 
from the Wallops Flight Facility - a 52-
foot rocket, designed and owned by a Vienna
firm, that is to take 14 experiments into orbit
250 miles above the Earth. The launch, originally 
scheduled for tonight from a $5 million
complex the firm built on NASA soil, was canceled 98 
seconds before blastoff because of a
loss in pressure in two of the rocket's six engine 
nozzles.
<P>
A state-operated spaceport, which would include one or more 
launch pads and towers as
well as a facility to prepare satellites and experiments, 
would cost $2 million to $7 million
to construct, supporters estimate.
<P>
"Our goal is that if you ask a man on the
street in Kansas a few years from now, 'Where
do you launch rockets from?' he'll say Wallops,"
said Billie M. Reed, associate Director of the
Center for Commercial Space Infrastructure at
Old Dominion University in Norfolk.
<P>
Supporters of the spaceport plan say it
could transform Wallops, one of the earliest
rocket-launching sites in the country, into a
busy complex once again. When fully operational, 
the spaceport could generate hundreds
of new jobs and pump $30 million to $50 million 
into the Eastern Shore economy, Reed
said. He said it also could provide jobs to Wallops 
workers if NASA closes the complex, a
budget-cutting move proposed several times
in recent years.
<P>
The project could attract companies that are
getting into the fast-growing business of small
satellite launches, backers say. Between 1996
and 2004, industry specialists estimate that at
least 550 satellites will be launched in the United 
States, many of them to meet the burgeoning
demand for global communication and 
higb-tech navigation.
<P>
"Right now, the market for commercial 
launches is moving into a
new era, and we're trying to be a
part of it," said Joseph C. Casas,
president of Hampton-based Space-Tec
Inc and a  member of the newly
appointed Virginia Commercial
Space Flight Authority. The board,
named last month by Allen, is expected to 
direct the planning and operation of tbe facility.
<P>
But there's no guarantee yet of a
successful liftoff. The authority has a
little more than $500,000 in the
bank from an appropriation by the
General Assembly in the spring and
a contribution by the quasi-public
Center for Innovative Technology in
Herndon.
<P>
Backers pian to ask the U.S. Department of 
Commerce for a $l milion grant later this year, 
said Laurence Richards,
a professor at Old
Dominion who has spent the past 3 1/2
years studying the feasibiiity of a
commerciai launching facility at Wallops. Richards 
said that if they receive the grant, he expects private
companies to provide the additional
money to begin construction.
<P>
Some members of the board, however, 
question whether the state and
federal government need to spend
millions to build launch pads when
existing facilities at Wallops could be
borrowed and renovated.
<P>
"We should utilize the facilities
that exist before we put too much
money into this," said Thomas J.
Savage Jr., a retired engineer and a
member of the space flight board.
<P>
The Wallops site also is expected
to face competition from other
planned commercial projects - including 
those at Cape Canaveral in
Florida, Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California and Kodiak Island, Alaska - 
that already have far more
state and federal funding.
<P>
Despite the slow start, Richards
said, Wallops has an advantage over
its rivals because it will have a 
shorter waiting list for launches and will
provide a liftoff direction favorable
for many types of communication
satellites.
<P>
A new launch date has not been
set yet for the 100-ton rocket 
that was to blast off tonight. Developed
at a cost of approximately $100 million by EER Systems Inc., 
the endeavor is being closely watched by
backers of the spaceport proposal.
<P>
The engine failure, the cause of
which engineers couldn't immediateiy 
determine, could take weeks to
fix, said Jim Hengle, EER's vice
president and general manager. 
"It's iike a flat tire: you know you have a
flat, but you don't always know
where the hole is," he said.
<P>
The EER launch pad and tower is
the first such commercially built 
facility in the United States.
<P>
The experiments on board
EER's rocket include projects such
as the gravity-free growth of protein 
crystals to treat cancer and the
study of how sustained weightlessness 
affects plant life. The firm is
charging customers other NASA,
which has eight projects
on the rocket, $60,000 a pound, Hengle said.
<P>
Some of the experiments are intended 
to stay in orbit aboard a small
spacecraft called METEOR-1 for as
long as two years, sending data daily
to EER's control facility in McLean.
Other experiments, housed in a recovery 
module attached to the main
spacecraft, are expected to fall back
to Earth after 2O days, landing in the
Atlanitic Ocean about 85 miles
east of here.
<P>
The delay will force EER to
replace perishable material in the 
plant and crystal experiments.

<H1>Technology Dominates the Region's Economic Strength</H1>

<P>
A recent regional study shows technology businesses - not real estate or
retail - reaching a new level of prominence, emerging fast as the chief drivers
of the Washington area's economic
engine.
<P>
The technology sector, which posts
above-average earnings, generates
approximately $21 billion in total industry output, or 10 
percent of the region's
total, according to the report, prepared
for the Greater Washington Board of
Trade and the Greater Washington
Initiative by George Mason University's
Center for Regional Analysis at the
Institute for Public Policy.
<P>
In fact, the report says, the
Washington area is the fastest-growing
large technology region in the U.S., out-pacing employment growth in the
Silicon Valley and Boston 128 areas by
at least 3O percent berween 1988 and
1992.
<P>
The report was motivated by a need to
quantify and define the breadth of technology's impact on the local economy
and to recognize that much of the
region's fast growth during the last 20
years was driven by the development of
a large cluster of tech-intensive companies - 
two things with which area technology executives agree.
<P>
"I think that most of the great technologies are coming from relatively
young companies," MAXM Systems
Corp. president Jack Reis said at a reccnt
Washington Business Journal technology
roundtable. "But companies like ours
don't  have national notoriety or international notoriety."
<P>
Other key findings of the report include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There are major differences in where
technology-related activity is based
around the region;

<LI>Northern Vrginia, with 155,675
technology employees, accounts for
almost 60 percent of the region's technology workforce, while suburban
Maryland's tech sector employs an additional 102,654. Although relatively small
in D C., the technology sector, with
4,008 employees, ranks 23rd among the
54 studied.

<LI>Tota1 earnings in the tech sector
amount to $9.3 billion and are distributed 
across the region in a manner similar to employment. 
Although the sector accounts for only 1.7 percent of all 
private sector firms, it directly generates
16 percent of all private sector earnings.

<LI>Economic impact analysis shows
that the 262,337 jobs in the technology
sector indirectly support an additional
234,733 jobs in other sectors of the
regional economy.

<LI>Earnings associated with indirect
employment: $5.5 billion. Direct, indirect and induced earnings 
of the tech sector account for 24 percent of a11 private-sector earnings.

<LI>Technology directly generates $2.3
billion of revenue to state and local governments; 
the study estimates an additional $l.5 billion annually of indirect
fiscal impact.

<LI>Local governments in Northern
Virginia get $546 million annually from
direct tech-related activity, while loca1
governments in suburban Maryland
receive $440 million. In the District, $14
million in revenue is generated.

</UL>
<P>
Debunking the myth that the region's
technology businesses are totally dependent 
on the federal government, the
report points to significant restructuring
in the industry - within defense-related
technology in particular - and fast
growth of the region in information tech
and services, system integration and networking.
<P>
"When people say Washington, the
first thing they think about is government, 
and that's a big deal for anywhere in the country," said Roger
Cooper, vice president of I-NET. "I
think (there's) a problem with 'Washington is government'. Everybody
thinks that, so you sort of have to break
through it."
<P>
The region, observers say, has taken
great strides in breaking that mold.
Because of numerous headquarters in
the area of companies devoted to
Internet-based technologies and online
information systems, the Washington
region has been dubbed "The Netplex,"
a huge data communications/information 
infrastructure that surrounds the beltway.
<P>
A recent Fortune report ranked
Washington second only to Silicon
Valley in terms of number of technology
companies doing business there.
Silicon Valley has 1,845 tech firms;
Washington 1,206; Boston 128 has
1,160; and North Carolina's Research
Triangle has 241.
<P>
The Greater Washington Board of
Trade/GMU study also measures total
tech industry output as a piece of overall
volume of economic activity in the
region. Technology's total industry output 
reaches about $203 biilion, with suburban Maryland 
accounting for the
lion's share of it: 41 percent is produced
in surburban Maryland; 37 percent in
Northern Virginia; and 22 percent in D.C.

<H1>Virginia and NASA Partner in Pathfinder Experiment on the Russian Mir Space Station</H1>
</CENTER>

<P>
Hampton, VA; November 29, 1995 -- Robert G. Templin, Jr., president of
Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology and president of the
Virginia Commercial Space Flight Authority announced that Virginia and
NASA have teamed up to fly the Measurement of Air Pollution from
Satellites (MAPS) instrument as the first commercial earth resource 
scientific payload on the Russian Mir space station.  The launch is 
scheduled for June 28, 1996 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Baikonur, 
Russia and will fly for six months.
<P>
SpaceTec, a high technology aerospace engineering company, is leading 
the way and validating several innovative concepts for using 
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components in space applications.  
"This pathfinder experiment could reduce the risk associated with
space experimentation and significantly reduce the time and effort 
required to prepare an experiment for flight," said Joe Casas, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for SpaceTec.  "It's the first 
commercial payload for not only Virginia but for the U.S. as well."
<P>
MAPS, a space-borne instrument that determines the concentration of 
carbon-monoxide in the troposphere, was first developed by NASA in 
early 1980 and has flown several times previously on NASA's Space Shuttle.
<P>
"Because of the number and diversity of organizations involved in
making this effort a success, this project represents a truly
innovative approach to space systems development and implementation," 
said John Jerke, industry director for aerospace and transportation at
CIT.
<P>
The major participants in the "MAPS-on-Mir" program are the Boeing 
Company, Honeywell, the Russian company RSC Energia, NASA and
Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology.  Assistance was also
given by the Peninsula Advanced Technology Center (PATC), the Small 
Business Development Center at Thomas Nelson Community College, Signet
Bank, Advex and several commercial space hardware developers.
<P>
Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology was created by the General
Assembly in 1984 as a private, non-profit corporation.  Its mission is
to enhance the Commonwealth's competitiveness by providing businesses 
with access to the state's technology resources and assist in the 
creation and retention of high technology jobs and businesses.

<H1>The CIT: Back on track</H1>
<H2>Templin credited with long-awaited turnaround</H2>
<P>
By WILLIAM A. RODGER<BR>
Staff Reporter<BR>
<P>
After Virginia Gov. George Allen's task force produced its report on the 
Center for Innovative Technology in November 1994, few thought the 
beleaguered organization would survive.  
<P>
After nearly 10 years and 
$100 million in state expenditures, task force members said the CIT had 
failed to demonstrate its worth to the taxpayer.  
<P>
Its recommendation: Eliminate the CIT.  
<P>
Yet 15 months later, that same govenor is one of the 
Herndon-based group's biggest boosters, praising the state-funded center 
for its role in attracting new businesses to the Commonwealth. And he's 
pushing to add $1.5 million to the CIT's current $8.2 million budget. 
<P>
Businesses that once thought the CIT was a waste of time couldn't be happier.
<P>
The difference, business people say, is Director Bob Templin.
<P>
Templin "has been remarkably effective," says Ed Bersoff, CEO of BTG Inc. and 
chair of the Fairfax County Chamber of Commerce.  Adds the one-time CIT 
critic: "They're getting a lot of support from people who had never heard 
of them before."   
<P>
Says David Lucien, president of the Interpro consulting 
firm and a technology advisor to Allen, "if it wasn't for Templin's role, 
(the administration) would have tried to kill it."   
<P>
Templin, an aggressive yet courtly administrator, takes the praise in stride. 
"All it takes is a little leadership," he says.  
<P>
Since taking over the reins in September, 
l994, Templin has shaken up the power structure at the CIT.  
<P>
Once a one-building affair in Herndon with a dozen, one-person outposts at 
community colleges across the state, the CIT now boasts offices in 
Hampton, Roanoke, Blacksburg and Richmond.  
<P>
In Hampton, the CIT shares space with the Peninsula Advanced Technology 
Center, a center that licenses technology from local federal laboratories 
to industry.  
<P>
In Roanoke, CIT officials share space with the local chamber of commerce,
while in Blacksburg, tech promoters sit next to the town's corporate 
research center, an outgrowth of Virginia Tech's electronic village project.  
<P>
And after years of silence, the CIT recently funded two reports that 
show it has far exceeded goals set for the center in 1994.  
<P>
None of this is incidental to Templin's strategy of involvement in the 
business community.  
<P>
Before assuming his latest post, Templin spent eight 
years as president of Thomas Nelson Community College in Hampton. While 
there, he garnered recognition for role in founding the Peninsula Advanced 
Technology Council as well as overhauling the college's curriculum to meet 
the needs of area businesses better.  
<P>
Templin is matter-of-fact about his way of doing business. "First you find 
out who the leaders in the technology community are, then you ask them what 
they need," he says. "You open the doors and you hold meetings."  
<P>
Once invisible to most of the business community, the CIT now has its finger 
in seemingly every economic development initiative in the area.  
<P>
By signing up as the first investor in the Potomac Knowledgeway community-
networking project, CIT cemented support from Morino Institute head Mario 
Morino and other players in the local technology community.  
<P>
Templin also reinforced an already close 
relationship with George Mason University by joining GMU President 
George Johnson's Northern Virginia Roundtable.  As if that wasn't enough, 
the CIT invited the Northern Virginia Technology Council to take up 
residence in CIT headquarters as well.  
<P>
The near-collapse of the GMU incubator last summer at the CIT following 
clashes between tenants and management did little to enhance the center's 
image, but even disgruntled tenants vented their frustration at George Mason 
officials, not the CIT.
<P>
"CIT was trying to do the best under the situation," says Valerie 
Perlowitz, president of former tenant Reliable Integration Systems. 
"They're trying to bring (an incubator at the center) back to life."  
<P>
Best of all, though, was the massive publicity surrounding two semiconductor 
plants - one planned for the Richmond area by Motorola and another in 
Manassas under an IBM/Toshiba joint venture.   
<P>
The CIT, only recently placed under the command of Sec. Robert Skunda's 
Department of Commerce and Trade, helped lure Motorola and IBM, each of 
which showed keen interest in the state's ability to train workers as well 
as assist in research and development.   
<P>
Perhaps best of all were two studies completed in the past 
year  - one by Columbus' Battelle Memorial Institute, another by GMU -
showing the CIT was responsible for generating or retaining several 
thousand jobs in Virginia since 1988.   
<P>
The CIT began in 1984 as a centerpiece of the former Robb Administration.  
Operating out of the politically vulnerable Department of Education, the 
quasi-public agency concentrated on funding the brightest ideas Virginia's 
universities had to offer.   
<P>
Early efforts included processes for extracting more coal from 
mines, development of an eye-controlled computer that could be used by 
paraplegics and transforming incinerator ash into cinderblock. The CIT 
brokered research and development deals between researchers and companies 
that could benefit from their work, paying for much of the research 
as it did so.   
<P>
Important as CIT officials thought their work was, they 
did little to publicize the work they did.  The center was so confidential, 
in fact, it refused to release the names of the companies with which it
worked.   
<P>
Constant turnover among directors -  one nearly every year for the 
Center's first five years of existence added to its weak image.   
Compounding the CIT's serious PR problems: exemption from state laws
including the Freedom of Information Act, conflict of interest regulations 
and personnel regulations, among others.   
<P>
These problems and others prompted a 1997 investigation of the CIT by 
Democratic Senate Majority Leader Hunter Andrews and other members of the 
Senate and House. Their conclusions: The group needed more industry 
representation, and it needed to target specific industries more closely 
than it had. It also had to start supporting industry first- and academia 
second.   
<P>
Since then, area tech leaders say Templin has done all the panel 
recommended and more. Though out of the woods now, the CIT will likely 
remain in legislators' good stead only as long as it can point to further 
success, observers say.

<HR>
<H1>CIT Opens Office at New Virginia Biotechnology Center</H1><P>
<BR>
On January 17, 1996, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center
for Innovative Technology (CIT)</A> and two client companies opened
new offices in the <A
HREF="http://views.vcu.edu/html/biomede/vbrp.html">Virginia
Biotechnology Research Park</A> as part of the grand opening of the
Virginia Biotechnology Center.  The $5 million center is part of Phase
I of the Biotechnology Research Park project.
<P>
     "We will now be able to assist biotech companies quickly and more
effectively by being in the same location," said <A
HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/twwoodworth.html">Terry Woodworth</A>,
CIT regional director.  "These companies can take greater advantage of
the wealth of resources right at their fingertips, including
state-of-the-art laboratories for testing, <A
HREF="http://www.cit.org/resources/resources.html">CIT intellectual
resources</A> and <A
HREF="http://views.vcu.edu/html/mcvhome.cgi">VCU's Medical College of
Virginia</A> Campus with $80 million in sponsored research and
numerous biomedical researchers."
<P>
     Hemodyne, a company that researches and develops blood diagnostic
devices, was created as a result of licensing technology from CIT and
now has a laboratory and office in the center.  Hemodyne is working on
producing two new tests &#139; one that measures the functions of
blood platelets and one that analyzes blood for fibrinolysis &#139;
the body's ability to dissolve clots.
<P>
     "Being in the Research Center is convenient because we are close
to the medical campus while we are in the middle of clinical trials.
But the real advantages are ancillary things &#139; the board room,
the auditorium and the electronic library that are available to us,"
said Marcus Carr, M.D., one of Hemodyne's founders.
<P>
     Insmed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a CIT client that develops
diagnostic and therapeutic products for the detection and clinical
management of insulin resistance, also has offices in the park.
<P>
     "Isolation is a frightening thing for start-up companies," said
Geoffrey Allan, president of Insmed.  "Being located within the
biotech community amongst our colleagues gives us a greater chance of
survival."
<P>
     The Research Park will be a key component in growing the biotech
community in Virginia, a key industry sector for the state's economic
growth.  "Biotech in Virginia is already growing at a rate faster than
the national growth rate," said <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/rschwartz.html">Bob Schwartz</A>, CIT industry director
for biotechnology and biomedical applications.  "This park will be an
intellectual magnet and engine for the development of a biotechnology
infrastructure in Virginia, attracting more biomedical and
pharmaceutical companies."
<P>
     Virginia is ideally located within the Eastern
U.S. pharmaceutical/biotechnology corridor, home to 52% of the
nation's pharmaceutical industry and 40% of its young and dynamic
biotechnology industry.  "This is a prime location to link the East
Coast biotech corridor that spans from Boston to North Carolina," said
Dr. Eugene Trani, chairman and president of the Virginia Biotechnology
Research Park's Corporation Board.  "Until now, when you looked at a
map of biotech parks on the East Coast, you would have found a blank
when looking at Virginia."
<P>
     In 1992 the Biotechnology Research Park project was launched by a
public/private partnership of university, government and industry
leaders to serve as the center of a growing enclave of 72 Virginia
biotechnology companies. The 22-acre complex, located on the north end
of Richmond's downtown will, in its final development phase, represent
$220 million in capital investment.
<P>
     Phase I includes the development of Biotech One, a 100,000 square
foot facility for established companies involved in life science
research and the Virginia Biotechnology Center that will support the
development and promotion of the biotechnology industry in Virginia.
Phase II is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 1996 and will
house new facilities for the Virginia Division of Forensic Science and
the Virginia Office of the Chief Medical Examiner.  When completed,
the Research Park will employ 3,000 scientists and support staff and
will offer state-of-the art laboratories to both established and
start-up companies.

<H1>Regional Technology Councils Provide Targeted Resources To Virginia Regions </H1>
<P>
Technology in Virginia has grown tremendously over the past few years,
affecting the lives of every region, business and citizen in Virginia.
In May 1995, the <A HREF="http://legis.state.va.us/">General
Assembly</A> established the <A
HREF="http://knowledgeway.org/milestones/orgs/va_techno_council.html">Virginia
Technology Council (VTC)</A>, an advisory body to "assist the
executive branch of the Commonwealth of Virginia in the overall
development, enhancement and growth of the technology industry in
Virginia."  However, it soon became clear that the needs and resources
of each Virginia region differed, creating the need for more
specialized organizations within each region.
<P>
     <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative
Technology (CIT)</A>, in partnership with the VTC, has helped
establish regional technology councils in each diverse region of
Virginia.  With many of them in the start-up phase, these councils
nurture the technology industries within each region and encourage
industry participation from technology companies in order to make the
regions more competitive.
<P>
     "The regional technology councils help identify the needs and
resources of each region and as a group help provide a common vision
for technology issues in the Commonwealth," said <A
HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/wtolle.html">Wolfgang T&ouml;lle</A>,
CIT managing director for technology industry development.
<P>
     Dan R. Bannister, president and CEO of DynCorp, and chairman of
the <A
HREF="http://knowledgeway.org/milestones/orgs/nv_tech_council.html">Northern
Virginia Technology Council (NVTC)</A>, has been an industry advocate
and supporter of each of the technology councils and the VTC.  "Prior
to the establishment of the councils, each region had no center of
industry activity," said Bannister.  "The regional technology councils
pull the technology communities together and give each company a sense
of belonging and a voice."
<P>
     To NVTC, the first Virginia-based regional technology council
created four years before the VTC, the need to provide a sense of
belonging was obvious.  "At our first annual banquet, I would have
been happy if 150 members of the business community attended.  When
640 showed up, we knew there was a desperate need for this type of
organization," said Bannister.
<P>
     Although each regional technology council is organized
differently and has different objectives, the NVTC has served as a
model for some.  "CIT and NVTC fully support each of these regional
councils and are excited about their role in growing the various
regions," commented Bannister.  "They are important to growing
Virginia's technology base."
<P>
<UL>
  <LI><B><A HREF="http://knowledgeway.org/milestones/orgs/nv_tech_council.html">Northern Virginia Technology Council</A> (Herndon, VA) </B>
<P>
NVTC is the voice of Northern Virginia technology businesses,
supporting the success of member companies in their fields and the
recognition of Northern Virginia as the global leader in technology
development and implementation.  Since its inception in 1991, NVTC's
membership has grown 100 percent annually and now has 400 member
companies.  The NVTC sponsors a wide variety of events including
legislative activities, educational programs, CEO, CIO forums, a
monthly breakfast series and many more.  NVTC has introduced more than
15 bills which have become law, including the legislation that created
the VTC. These bills dealt with tax relief, improving competitiveness,
capital formation and workforce preparation.
<P>
   "We plan to continue our role as a resource for Northern Virginia
and foster economic development by expanding and growing technology
businesses," said Ray Pelletier, executive director of NVTC.

<P>
     The mission of the R2TC is to promote regional development,
growth and implementation of technology in business, government,
education and the region as a whole, in a way that will benefit the
communities in the region and their economic well- being.  The council
steering committee is determining what technologies already exist in
the region and how the council can best utilize existing technologies
and introduce new ones to meet the needs of the business community.
<P>
      "We have technology companies spread over 2,000 square miles,"
said Jeff Taylor, Region 2000's program manager.  "We want to create a
pro-active organization that networks our companies and communities
with each other and with other groups in the state."

     Uniquely, the HRTA is an umbrella organization formed by ten
technology-focused industry associations.  "In the Hampton Roads area
we have many different types of technology based businesses spread out
over such a large area," said Mike Montgomery, head of the alliance.
"By forming this way, we're fulfilling the need for more cross-talk
and networking among the companies within these organizations."
<P>
            Since its inception, the alliance has helped existing
firms grow, reduced exportation of jobs from the region and increased
the effectiveness of economic development departments and

<HR>
<H1>Science and Technology Task Force - 1996 Report </H1><P>
The Joint Legislative Task Force on Science and Technology in Virginia
completed its report for the <A
HREF="http://www.state.va.us/governor/gov.html">Governor</A> and <A
HREF="http://legis.state.va.us/">General Assembly</A> of Virginia.
This report follows the original Science and Technology Task Force of
1983, reporting on the status of its recommendations and coordinating
a statewide strategic plan for science and technology.
<P>
     The 1996 Task Force stated the following principles:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The Commonwealth should capitalize on Virginia as a technology leader.
<LI>The Commonwealth should have a workforce second to none.
<LI>The Commonwealth should acknowledge that science and technology initiatives and a strong education system are integral parts of Virginia's economic policy.
<LI>The Commonwealth should make necessary investments in science
     and technology initiatives.
<LI>The Commonwealth should make vital investments in education.
</OL>

<P>
Against this backdrop, the Task Force made 37 separate recommendations
to include the following recommendations which relate to CIT:<P>
<UL>
<LI>That there should be continued oversight of science and technology
     in the form of a Joint Commission on Technology and Education and
     that the science and technology Task Force should be continued.
<LI>That Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) should be considered the Commonwealth's lead science and technology mechanism.
<LI>That education for a new knowledge-based economy and world is critical, especially higher education.  Statewide efforts such as CIT, Graduate Engineering and Old Dominion University's Teletechnet must be encouraged and supported.
<LI>That the Commonwealth should continue to expand and exploit the capabilities of the state's major research universities in partnership with industry and CIT.
<LI>That the Commonwealth should strengthen support for existing research and technology development capabilities where commercialization potential is very strong by funding the creation of a new generation of CIT technology centers.
<LI>That the Commonwealth needs to have a strong competitive position in science and technology and the financing available to support the commercialization of new technologies.
</UL>
<P>
Several of the Task Force's recommendations received strong support in
this session of the General Assembly.  For instance:
<UL>
<LI>The bill amending the Business, Occupational and Professional License tax (BPOL), did include a provision exempting venture capital funds, as recommended by the Capital Access Task force as well as the Science and Technology Task Force.
<LI>A bill was passed asking the Virginia Retirement System to study ways to invest in Virginia companies.
<LI>A bill to study tax credits for investment in Virginia businesses was introduced, but held over to next year.
<LI>CIT was appropriated $500,000 to pursue a seed capital initiative for technology-based companies.

<H1>CIT Welcomes Golden Cat Plant To King William County </H1>
<P>
<BR>
The <A HREF="http://www.goldencat.com/">Golden Cat Division</A> of the
<A HREF="http://www.ralston.com/">Ralston Purina Company</A> recently signed
a contract to build a mining and processing operation in King William
County, VA.  The $17 million absorbent clay products plant will
provide 80 jobs initially with plans to provide over 100 jobs in three
years.  The new plant is the result of a three-year endeavor by the
Virginia Clay Company and <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's
Center for Innovative Technology (CIT)</A>.
<P>
     In March 1992, David S. Robinson, president of the Virginia Clay
Company, approached CIT to find a new application for his highly
absorbent clay mineral deposits.  CIT, under the direction of <A
HREF="../../../people/drmills.html">Dan R. Mills</A>, regional
director for the Central Virginia/Greater Richmond region, provided
the access to a number of Virginia's technology resources.  These
resources included the <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/resources/vtic.html">Virginia Technical
Information Center (VTIC)</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.eng.vt.edu/eng/mining/coalplab.html">Coal and
Minerals Technology Center</A> at <A HREF="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</A> in <A
HREF="http://www.bev.net/">Blacksburg, VA</A>, as well as the
expertise of CIT's staff.  Both centers receive funding from CIT.
<P>
     Specifically, CIT conducted on-site assessments and technical
briefings on the best utilization of the clay, identified potential
companies to mine and process the clay, reviewed test results and
production trials and provided technical data on air emissions, clay
mineralogy and moisture analyses.
<P>
     "CIT was critical to the success of this project.  Not only did
they provide me with ways I could use the clay, but they focused my
search for a manufacturer who could utilize it," said Robinson.  "This
project would not have survived if CIT had not been involved from the
beginning. "
<P>
     CIT teamed with the Virginia Department of Economic Development
to coordinate on-site reviews, test production of the clay and assist
the principals of both companies in finalizing project costs,
engineering plans and permitting.
<P>
     Construction of the plant is scheduled to begin in mid-1996 with
plant operation by spring of '97.  Ralston Purina will operate the
estimated 150,000 sq. ft. plant on 43 acres of land purchased from
Virginia Clay.  The plant will initially process 150,000 tons of cat
box filler per year, with the clay being supplied from its mining
operations adjacent to the plant.  Ralston Purina, headquartered in
St. Louis, is the largest producer of cat and dog food in the world.
King William County is located in a primarily agricultural area some
30 miles east of Richmond.
<P>
     "This commitment by Ralston Purina will provide Virginia with
additional jobs and the opportunity for future economic growth," said
Mills.  "Our technology resources and the CIT network will continue to
assist Ralston Purina and Virginia Clay during start-up and initial
operations to further enhance the competitiveness of the operation
during these critical periods."

<HR>
<H1>Richmond Roundup </H1>
<P>
The General Assembly's recently completed session was a successful one
for <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative
Technology (CIT)</A>.  It started with <A HREF="http://www.state.va.us/governor/gov.html">Governor Allen</A> proposing a $1.5 million increase for CIT's budget
for each of the two years of the biennium and ended with the General
Assembly adding an additional $600,000 a year.  This yields a total
annual appropriation of $10.3 million for CIT&#139; the amount that
fully funds CIT's current strategic plan.
<P>
     CIT has operated for several years at an appropriation of $8.2
million from the State general fund.  The remainder came from CIT's
own reserves which are budgeted to be exhausted by July 1996.  The
action of the General Assembly means that CIT will continue to operate
at $10.3 million for each of the next two years.
<P>
     In related actions, the General Assembly allocated an additional
$500 thousand to CIT for seed capital.  This funding, proposed by
Senator Joseph Gartlan (D-Fairfax), Delegate Vince Callahan (R-McLean)
and others, was supported by the <A HREF="http://knowledgeway.org/milestones/orgs/nv_tech_council.html">Northern Virginia Technology Council</A>,
the Science and Technology Task Force and others concerned with the
issue of capital access for small technology companies.  CIT is in the
planning process for using this funding to provide seed capital.
<P>
     Other issues of interest to the CIT community include:
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>The General Assembly passed a resolution "confirming and supporting CIT as the broker of technology development and entrepreneurship in the Commonwealth."
  <LI>The Science and Technology Task Force was continued for another
       year, with a revised membership, as a joint legislative
       committee.  Dr. Robert G. Templin, Jr., president of CIT, was
       added as a member.  Some of the issues for consideration by the
       Task Force are the appropriate role of the Virginia Retirement
       System in local venture capital, and the feasibility and
       desirability of a Secretariat for Science, Information and
       Technology and digital signatures.
  <LI>The Department of Business Assistance was created out of the
       Department of Economic Development and the merger of the
       Virginia Employment Commission.  This will include the Small Business Development Centers and other assistance programs for
       existing Virginia businesses.  Attraction of new businesses to
       the state will be the purview of the new Economic Development
       Partnership starting July 1.

<H1>Dynamic Engineering Expands </H1><P>
<P>
<B><I>Partners With CIT To Create A Virtual Product Development Resource</I></B>
<P>
In November 1995, Dynamic Engineering Inc. (DEI) turned to the <A
HREF="http://www.patc.org/">Peninsula Advanced Technology Center
(PATC)</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for
Innovative Technology (CIT)</A> to help solve a dilemma.  DEI, a
leader in aerospace and marine prototyping and development, had just
won several new contracts, one from a major US commercial aircraft
engine manufacturer, and needed to decide whether to expand in
Virginia at their current <A HREF="http://hampton.roads.net/nhr/newportnews/">Newport News</A> location or relocate to another
US location.
<P>
     In addition to the expansion, DEI wanted to create a resource
facility in propulsion and rotary technology for aircraft that would
address a variety of disciplines related to the design and
manufacturing of aircraft and propulsion systems.  DEI also wanted to
link industry and university resources to this facility in order to
strengthen its capabilities and make its resources available to a
broader group of users.  With spending for this facility at $1 million
initially, DEI was looking for assistance in funding this effort.
<P>
     Immediately responding to DEI's call for help, PATC and CIT
worked with Virginia's Department of Economic Development to retain
this company in Virginia.  The results:  With an initial investment of
$1.4 million, DEI is expanding in Virginia and is expected to create
up to 100 jobs in the first year and assist in the development of a
virtual product development facility for university researchers and
industry users.
<P>
     "Virginia has the right atmosphere for the creation of high
paying, high skilled jobs," said Dave Mullins, DEI president and CEO.
"We are extremely grateful for the assistance we received from the
professional staffs at the Department of Economic Development, the
Peninsula Advanced Technology Center, the City of Newport News and
Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology."
<P>
     Governor Allen stated, "I am pleased Dynamic Engineering found
that the 'Silicon Dominion' has the best business climate for their
high technology production.  DEI's decision to choose Virginia will
keep this successful company flying high above its competitors."
<P>
<I>Shared Resource Facility</I>
<P>
The shared resource facility, focusing on "Virtual Product
Development" (VPD) and serving university researchers and industry
users, will create 86 additional full-time jobs within Virginia over a
two-year period.  The facility, the nucleus featuring CAD/CAM hardware
and software and information management systems, allows
"manufacturing" of a device by a 3-D computer in advance of actually
producing a model.  Several major aerospace companies and the US
Department of Defense have shown great interest in this concept, which
simulates the manufacturing process and identifies and corrects
problems before they occur, thereby reducing product cycle times and
preventing cost overruns.
<P>
     "<A HREF="http://www.odu.edu/">Old Dominion University</A> has already signed a Memorandum of
Understanding to use this facility once it is available," said <A HREF="../../../people/jmjerke.html">John
Jerke</A>, industry director for <A HREF="../../../industry/transport.html">aerospace and transportation</A> at CIT.
"VPD is a breakthrough that far exceeds the benefit of any one
specific technology."
<P>
     With new jobs for the Hampton Roads area and a new resource facility 
for the state, Virginia and CIT have once again demonstrated their
ability to re-spond quickly and effectively to the needs of Virginia's
business community.

<H1> SVAMTC Mobile Lab:  Ready Access To Job Training in Southwestern Virginia</H1><P>

<P>
A partnership between <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center
for Innovative Technology (CIT)</A> and a consortium of community
colleges in Southwest Virginia is designed to help area manufacturers
become more competitive.  The <A
HREF="http://www.naxs.com/wcc/svamtc.htm">Southwestern Virginia
Advanced Manufacturing Technology Center</A> was officially formed in
September of 1994.  The Center has received grants from CIT,
Appalachian Regional Commission, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation</A>, the
A. P. Sloan Foundation, Virginia's network of Small Business
Development Centers and the Commonwealth of Virginia to begin
servicing the manufacturers of the Southwestern Virginia Region.  The
center's mission is to enhance competitiveness, increase profitability
and improve economic opportunity for Southwestern Virginia industry.
<P>
     Community colleges included in the consortium are <A
HREF="http://www.me.cc.va.us/">Mountain Empire</A> (Big Stone Gap,
VA), <A HREF="http://www.nr.cc.va.us/">New River</A> (Dublin, VA), <A
HREF="http://www.sw.cc.va.us/">Southwest Virginia</A> (Richlands, VA),
<A HREF="http://www.eva.org/eva2/edu/vhcch/vhcchpg1.htm">Virginia
Highlands</A> (Abingdon, VA) and <A
HREF="http://www.naxs.com/wcc/">Wytheville</A> (Wytheville, VA).  The
Center is headquartered at Wytheville Community College, which is
centrally located in the 17-county service region.
<P>
     One of the primary projects that will help the Center meet its
mission is a mobile training/technology demonstration laboratory.
Because Southwestern Virginia is very rural, access to educational
facilities for job training and demonstrations of new technologies is
very limited for many companies and their employees.  The mobile lab
is a vehicle equipped with the necessary systems to allow independent
self-contained operation at any given site in the region.  It will
provide service to two main customer groups:
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>The region's 700+ manufacturers.  Training and demonstrations
     will be provided to assist them in advancing their current
     technology and employees' skill level in a convenient and
     effective manner.
<LI>The region's secondary schools and their students.
     Manufacturing technologies will be demonstrated to promote
     educational and career opportunities in the manufacturing field.
</OL>
<P>
     The mobile lab vehicle will be a modified tractor trailer unit
with on-board power and environmental systems.  Its current interior
design is versatile.  It may be configured as a traditional classroom,
a computer training center, a demonstration or working lab, or various
combinations of these configurations.  Up to 14 personal computer
systems in a networked configuration will be available for use in the
mobile lab.  These will be capable of employing a variety of software
applications for computer training from basic skills to CAD/CAM.
Plans to purchase demonstration and learning station equipment for
hands-on training include table top CNC machine tools, robots and
portable training stations for areas such as hydraulics, pneumatics
and electronics.  The needs of the individual customers will determine
the variety of curriculum provided.

<H1>IRS Brings Interactivity to Consumer Homes </H1><P>
A small Virginia company is revolutionizing the telecommunications
industry.  Interactive Return Services, Inc. (IRS), based in Herndon,
VA, worked with Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) to
develop an innovative product that brings interactivity to the consumer market
inexpensively by using the Internet and World Wide Web.
<P>
     The Audio-Link is a wireless alarm monitoring service using a
sound sensor capable of sending an alarm message from homes or
businesses to neighborhood fire or police departments.  When an
activated smoke detector is heard or a motion detector is activated,
the sensor can send an alarm message to an alarm monitoring service.
IRS plans to install small radio frequency repeaters in neighborhoods
to transmit the signals from homes to a central computer or alarm
monitoring center.  Currently, alarm monitoring systems transmit over
the telephone which can be slow, expensive and easily tampered with.
<P>
     The product, developed by IRS, could also revolutionize the
television industry.  Using the neighborhood repeaters, the Audio-Link
has the ability to decode audio signals emitted by t.v. ads allowing
viewers to order consumer products at the click of a button on a
remote control.  Imagine sitting in your own living room and ordering
a product as you're watching the product's commercial!
<P>
     Remarkably, the key to these new products is the cellular phone.
IRS's technology utilizes the current national telephone
infrastructure allowing a message to be transmitted with error
detection, retransmission so that no data is lost and data encryption
to secure transmissions.  Using this method eliminates the need for
expensive home set-ups and gives the public the ability to interact
with the mass media.
<P>
     Fernando Morales, president of IRS, developed these innovative
technologies with assistance from the Center for Wireless
Telecommunications (CWT), a technology development center sponsored by
CIT.  "CIT has an unsurpassable network of resources," said Morales.
"Not only did they help me license my technologies, but they located
manufacturing, venture capital and industry resources, and helped
develop my product at the technology development center."
<P>
     "Even more significantly, all the manufacturers we located for
IRS are Virginia companies," said Charles W. Bostian, director of CWT.
"This project is not only improving the competitiveness of numerous
Virginia companies but Virginia as well."
<P>
     Commented <A
HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/wtolle.html">Wolfgang T&ouml;lle</A>,
CIT industry director for information technology and
telecommunications:  "this is a great example of how CIT can help a
small Virginia company take a leadership position in a new market."

<H1>InfiNet--Case Study in Entrepreneurship Assistance</H1>
<P>
InfiNet is currently providing local access to the Internet in ten
cities with a sophisticated operation that employs over sixty people.
However, two years ago the situation was quite different.
<P>
Richard Corkran, Tom Manos, and a "silent partner", had invested their
own money in a start-up company called Wyvern Technologies, Inc. They
were all technical experts with different computer skills honed in the
Navy and private industry.  Richard talks wistfully about the "good old
days" in '93 when the entire company was located within 300 square
feet of space in Norfolk and they knew most of their customers by
name.  The main form of internal communication during those days was
mumbling under your breath about a problem and having the person next
to you mumble the answer.  Tom Manos tried several different market
planning approaches with various experts, but they were never able to
solve the mysteries of marketing and sales.  They were a company with
a good idea.
<P>
Upon a recommendation, Tom called the Old Dominion University
Entrepreneurial Center.  Dennis Ackerman, Director of the Center,
looked at the operation and signed an agreement to provide assistance
in the Spring of 1993.  The Center believed that if the computer
literate (hackers) in the general community were informed about
Wyvern, then the easy sales could be achieved.  The Center talked to a
local business news reporter and within two weeks a story was in
print.  The phone hasn't stopped ringing since the publication of that
story.
<P>
Soon after the story in the newspaper was released, and while the new
business plan was still on the drawing board, Tom told the Center that
Landmark Communications, Inc. had come into their office to talk about
the business.  Landmark Communications, Inc. was associated with the
company that owned the local newspaper as well as other businesses
throughout the United States.  Tom and Richard were concerned that the
large and all powerful company was going to take their idea and do it
themselves.  The Center provided the education that enabled both
parties to discuss their concerns and to eventually agree upon a joint
venture called InfiNet.
<P>
As the company grew at exponential rates, the ODU Center was asked to
assist with identifying the necessary human resources, providing
assistance to the President, and serving as a mechanism for spotting
problem areas.  The Center helped identify the Vice President for
Marketing, the Controller, and the Director of Custom Business
Applications.  An Old Dominion University graduate student is currently
working with the Custom Business Application division for credit.
<P>
The company has developed a unique approach for providing local access
to the Internet services.  The multifaceted approach was developed
with the assistance of the Center and includes a mandate to provide
"easy to use" or "user friendly" systems.  Technical people keep
forgetting how difficult it is for most people to learn how to operate
their personal computer, which is relatively easy compared to
"surfing" the information highways of the Internet.
<P>
The company will be employing over 100 people by the end of the year
and with the introduction of the Custom Business Application division
this year, the number of additional direct and sub- contracted
employees will accelerate even faster.
<P>
When speaking at a Board of Directors meeting held by the Hampton
Roads Chamber of Commerce, Richard Cockran stated, "Without the
assistance of the ODU Entrepreneurial Center, InfiNet would not exist,
and we would not be part of a rapidly growing operation.

<P>

Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology has been awarded the
outstanding "Project of the Year" award for its work to keep coal
combustion by-products out of the state's landfills.  The project won
the "special assistance" award in a competition that is conducted
annually by the National Association of Management and Technical
Assistance Centers.  This award is not given each year, but only when
there is a project that achieves exceptional results.  This marks the
third year in a row that CIT has won an award in this competition.
<P>
The task force organized by CIT was made up of over 30 businesses,
state agencies, and university faculty in Virginia. They developed
demonstration projects, conducted seminars on beneficial utilization,
worked with regulatory agencies in developing new regulations for use
of combustion by-products, and provided technical data to Virginia
businesses.  In 1991, the economic benefit to Virginia will be $10.2
million.  Utilization of ash will save six acres of landfill at a
value of $500,000 per acre or $3 million and utilize over 1.2 million
tons of ash at a commercial value of $6 a ton or $7.2 million.
<P>
Robert W. Harrell, Jr., CIT's Director of Technology Assistance and
Transfer in Tidewater said when accepting the award, "This
demonstrates what can be accomplished when Virginia business,
government agencies, and university expertise work together in a
partnership to implement new technology that is economically feasible
and environmentally sound."

<H1>EDD: From University Research to Industrial Use</H1>
<P>

A new company has spun-out of Virginia Tech as a result of a joint
research project there with the Electric Power Research Institute
(EPRI) co-funded by CIT.  Electrical Distribution Design (EDD) now
resides in the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Park.  Headed by
Dr. Robert Broadwater and joined by several private investors and
former graduate students, including Jeff Thompson, Paul Dolloff,
Hesham Shaalan and Irislav Dregza, EDD has developed an advanced
computer-aided engineering workstation which addresses electrical
distribution system analysis, design and operations.
<P>
The Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI, is headquartered in Palo
Alto, California, and represents a majority of the electrical
utilities in the United States along with many foreign affiliates.  In
1992, EPRI evaluated the workstation being developed at Virginia Tech,
and decided to use it as a prototype for an EPRI-developed
workstation.  A computer firm, Power Computing Company, located in
Dallas, Texas, together with Virginia Tech, were then contracted by
EPRI to develop the EPRI Distribution Engineering Workstation, or
DEWorkstation.
<P>
The first version of DEWorkstation has been completed, with many
unique features.  DEWorkstation has the most comprehensive data design
of any EPRI workstation, placing the workstation in a position to take
advantage of all types of utility data in engineering calculations.
Furthermore, DEWorkstation provides a means for utilities to readily
incorporate existing design programs.  Several utilities have already
started incorporating their unique programs.  Once these programs are
incorporated, the capabilities offered by the programs become
available to other workstation users.  Testing of DEWorkstation by a
select group of utilities is currently being completed, and the first
release of the workstation is scheduled for July 1, 1995.
<P>
Dr. Broadwater stated, "In the past, EPRI has represented
approximately 80% of electric utilities. This gives the company an
opportunity to tap into a huge market."  EDD is currently working with
Virginia Tech and the Center for Innovative Technology on the
creation of advanced capabilities for the workstation. EDD plans to
provide and support the most comprehensive set of engineering
applications available for electrical distribution systems.  Within
the next two years, EDD hopes to be supporting approximately one-third
of the EPRI membership in their use of the workstation.

<HR>
<H1>CIT, VA Power and Baker Equipment Team to Build an Electric Vehicle Fleet</H1>
<P>

In 1888, the first electric trolley system in the nation was
established in Richmond, the state capital.  Today, CIT is helping
Virginia play a leading role in the development of a new generation
of electric vehicles.
<P>
Virginia Power is a national leader in the development of Electric
Vehicles (EVs).  One of only five utilities nationwide to take an early
stance on EV technology development, the company began aggressively
addressing the needs of the industry in 1993.
<P>
In September, Virginia Power hosted electroexpo '94, the largest event
of its kind in the U.S., to demonstrate the many advantages of EV
technologies.  Targeted at utilities, public officials, fleet
operators, small business owners, and the public, the event featured
the largest collection of EVs in North America.
<P>
By 1995, Virginia Power will have the largest EV fleet of any utility
company in the nation--80 vehicles in use.
<P>
Virginia Power has teamed with Baker ElectroMotive, a division of
Baker Equipment Engineering Company in Richmond, to build the Baker
EV100: the nation's first full-size electric pickup truck to be part
of this EV fleet.
<P>
The EV100, as it's called, represents an alliance of Baker Equipment;
Virginia Power, the first customer for the vehicle; and General
Electric Co., which manufactures the truck's electric motor at its Drive
Systems factory in Salem.
<P>
The effort has been aided by CIT, research at state universities, and
support from the state's economic development department.
<P>
Baker Equipment, a division of JGB Industries Inc., has operations in
six other East Coast cities and California, and employs 170 people.  In
Richmond alone, Baker employs 337 people, most of them in shops where
they manufacture, assemble and finish vehicles for specialty markets.
<P>
Baker has created a division, Baker ElectroMotive, to exploit the
opportunity created by federal mandates for clean running cars and
Detroit automakers' need for someone else to fill the heavy end of the
electric vehicle market.
<P>
It's a market that Baker Equipment also expects will benefit the
company's core business of outfitting specialty vehicles for utility
customers, such as electric, telephone and cable television
companies.
<P>
Dan Mills, director of CIT's Richmond Office of Technology Assistance
and Transfer, and Wayne Hawkins, CIT's director of Manufacturing
Technology, have been working extensively with Baker, helping them
access new technologies, and locate resources at Virginia's
universities that are critically needed to meet important performance
deadlines for the truck development.
<P>
CIT's Virginia Power Electronics Center at Virginia Tech is working
with both General Electric Drive Systems and Baker ElectroMotive to
develop more efficient and lower cost power electronics and motors for
EVs.
<P>
The University of Virginia's Department of Mechanical, Aerospace and
Nuclear Engineering, is working with Baker ElectroMotive to improve
the load-bearing features and crash-worthiness of EV frames through
CIT's Manufacturing Action Program.
<P>
The EV100 was displayed at electroexpo '94 and received rave reviews.
Development and testing are continuing with CIT's help.  Research on
EV charging systems is underway at Virginia Tech in an effort to
maximize vehicle performance.  Baker has commitments from Virginia
Power and another utility to build eight additional trucks with
potential orders for many more.
<P>
For more information call Skip Baker, Vice Chairman for Baker
Equipment Engineering Co. at 804/358-0481.

<H1>Friendly Mobile Barrier (FMB) Successfully Crash Tested</H1>
<P>
Consolidated Launcher Technology, Inc. (CLT) of Chesapeake has
completed the development and manufacture of a prototype of its
Friendly Mobile Barrier for high-speed rail. The $700,000 project is
funded by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), CLT, B.F.
Goodrich Aerospace, Environmental Solutions, Inc., Kamatics, and the
Center for Innovative Technology.  CIT has provided matching funds
for the computer modeling and finite analysis of materials at the
Technology Applications Center at Old Dominion University.
<P>
CLT crash tested a 4500 lb vehicle at 45 mph into the Barrier on March
10 at ENSCO's Springfield, Virginia, Federal Highway
Administration-certified test site.  ENSCO provided monitoring and
sensoring equipment to test the G-forces on the vehicle.  The test
results indicated that the 4,500 pound truck was stopped in 6.5 feet,
and with a G-force on the occupants of 12 Gs, which is well within the
20 G limit of survivability standards recognized in highway safety
circles.  Dan Lynch, Project Manager for the development of the
barrier said, "The test met or exceeded every standard we had set
forth to meet."
<P>
The next step in the development of the Barrier was a second crash
test in May.  Following this test, CLT will conduct a 60-day life
cycle test at the Technology Applications Center at Old Dominion
University.  The life cycle test will be followed by an Environmental
Life Test at the Transport Test Center in Pueblo, Colorado in October.
<P>
The Friendly Mobile Barrier project truly is a joint venture with a
multi-faceted team assembled by Consolidated Launcher with the
assistance of CIT's Regional Director, for Norfolk, Robert
Harrell.  The Barrier was designed by Chuck Coker, President of
CLT.  The linerite crash panels on the unit were manufactured in a
joint venture project between B. F. Goodrich Aerospace and Birdsong
Peanuts.  The panels contain 30% peanut hulls cellulose filter and
are a result of 5 years of research conducted with several departments
at Virginia Tech including Dr. Don Baird (Chemical Engineering), Dr.
Wolfgang Glasser (BioMaterials), and Dr. Joe Loferski (the Brooks Wood
Products Center).  Environmental Solutions, Inc. of Richmond is
developing the vault system for the barrier from recycled combustion
by-products along with several industry partners and the Department of
Energy.
<P>
Harrell stated, "There has already been one spin off new product and
several other versions of the Barrier are expected in order to meet
specific applications identified during the development stage."

<H1>CIT and USGS Sign Cooperative Research Agreement</H1>
<P>

Working together in technology partnerships will be the key to
successful innovation and prosperity for the Commonwealth of Virginia.
<P>
CIT and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) signed a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) whereby technology and
technical assistance available through USGS will be made available to
businesses throughout the State.
<P>
USGS is organized around four areas: l) Hazards--both geological and
meteorological; 2) Environment; 3) Resources--water, minerals, energy;
and 4) Data and Information Exchange--geological information systems,
etc.  USGS will make available to Virginia businesses both technical
information in these thematic areas, as well as on-site technical
assistance.  AT NO COST TO THE COMPANY, USGS scientists will spend up
to four (4) days with a firm, trouble-shooting a technology-based
problem.  If needed, more extensive assistance could be provided, the
costs of which would be negotiated between the company and USGS.
<P>
The USGS CRADA is patterned after the very successful Naval Research
Lab (NRL) CRADA.  Signed in May, 1993, interest in the NRL CRADA has
generated 20 requests for technical assistance from business and
industry across the Commonwealth.  To date, ten companies have
benefited from four days of on-site technical assistance and
trouble shooting, or testing at NRL.  The technologies have run the
gamut from medical waste to signal antennas to radar devices.
<P>
A northern Virginia firm with an alternative technology to sterilize
medical waste needed to test the efficacy of the process. The testing
was done at NRL; the process proved successful. While the company
states that it is too early to evaluate the commercial potential of
this process, it is known that healthcare facilities will now be able
to sterilize their medical waste on-site, thereby reducing costs to
the facility and improving ambient air quality by reducing waste
incineration.
<P>
A Tidewater company manufactures radar detectors for the Defense
Department and wanted to break into civilian markets.  It began
manufacturing radar systems for the small pleasure boat market, but
lacked the necessary equipment needed to benchmark the device and
produce technical data.  Again, NRL tested the device, providing
the necessary technical data to begin commercialization.  The device
won "Best New Product" at the 1994 Annapolis Boat Show.
<P>
A central Virginia company produces a "portable fm radio station,"
which weighs 5-10 lbs. and is no larger than a briefcase.  The device
has multiple applications but the company wanted to test antennas
for use on delivery trucks and to determine the best way to cover an
entire perimeter such as grocery stores, department stores, etc.  NRL
provided the testing and technical data and the company is proceeding
with plans to commercialize its product.
<P>

<H1>CIT and <I>Virginia Business</I> Magazine Create Business
Intellectual Resource Guide </H1>
<P>
Virginia's public colleges and universities, as well as other
intellectual resources within the Commonwealth, provide a wide range
of services to the business community, including continuing and
executive education, research and development, workforce training and
consulting.  Small to medium-sized businesses often need the
assistance of these intellectual resources to become more competitive
and survive in the rapidly advancing technology community.  Virginia's
Center for Innovative Technology's (CIT) mission is to link these
businesses with the state's intellectual resources to increase the
competitiveness of the businesses and ultimately, the Commonwealth.
<P>
     CIT and <I>Virginia Business</I> Magazine have created a venue
for universities and colleges to convey information about their
business resources to the business community.  'Brainpower for
Business' will utilize print and electronic media, in three phases, to
help companies identify capabilities provided by the state's colleges
and universities.
<P>
     The first element consists of a 28-page advertising supplement in
the May issue of <I>Virginia Business</I> Magazine.  Colleges and
universities will describe the array of services they offer and
businesses will be able to identify immediately the types of resources
they need.
<P>
     The second proposed element consists of an internet gateway that
will provide a directory of intellectual capabilities and resource
services.  With a completion date of September, the gateway will link
business users directly to pertinent information on university
homepages.  The third proposed element is a monthly fax broadcast
service that will make information summaries available to businesses
not using the internet.
<P>
     "Many businesses are unaware of the academic and R&D resources
that are available to them," said Eileen Heveron, CIT director of
intellectual resources.  "We want to facilitate a linkage between the
two and provide more opportunities for both."
<P>
     The resource guide will be published in the May issue of
<I>Virginia Business</I> Magazine.  The internet gateway is proposed
to be completed in August and the fax broadcast service is proposed to
begin in October.  If you would like a copy of the guide, please call
<I>Virginia Business</I> Magazine at (804) 649-6998.  If you are a
Virginia university or college and would like to participate, please
contact Eileen Heveron, at (703) 689-3000 or eileen@pcmail.cit.org.

<H1>LigoChem, Inc. Formed to Commercialize Bioseparation Technology</H1>
<P>

CIT has granted an exclusive, world-wide license to LigoChem, Inc., a
venture capital backed start-up company to be based in Blacksburg,
Virginia, to commercialize cellulose-based bioseparation technologies
developed by Professors William H. Velander and Wolfgang G. Glasser at
Virginia Tech.
<P>
These technologies were developed in the CIT funded Bio-based
Materials Technology Development Center at Virginia Tech.  Under the
direction of Wolfgang Glasser, the center developed a variety of
potentially important bio-based materials technologies.  In cooperation
with Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties, Inc.  (VTIP) under the
direction of Ted Kohn, CIT and VTIP patented and licensed the
technologies.
<P>
CIT's priority, successfully accomplished, was to commercialize
these technologies in Virginia, rather than licensing them to one or
more non-Virginia companies.  The license agreement requires LigoChem
to fund three years of research at Virginia Tech to further develop
the technologies and to manufacture products based on the technologies
in Virginia.
<P>
The licensed technologies include cellulose-based hydrogels and a
revolutionary two-step ligand attachment process.
<P>
These cellulose gels are inexpensive to make and possess a number of
distinctive physical and chemical properties making them ideal for
bioseparation applications.  These hydrogels are far superior in terms
of faster flow rates, higher sensitivity and better selectivity for
separation applications.
<P>
Potential uses of LigoChem's products developed from the technologies
include large-scale separation and purification of pharmaceuticals and
biopharmaceuticals such as proteins, peptides, enzymes and other
biochemical substances as well as blood and its plasma
derivatives. "Our aim is to be the market leader in of hydro-
gels--marketshare and profits," said Harry Rosengart, President and
CEO of LigoChem.
<P>
Mr. Rosengart has assembled an experienced management team led by
Dr.  Carmine C. Mascoli, Dr. Abraham O. Zoss and others to accelerate
development of VA Tech's technologies.  Brecc K. Avellar will consult
to LigoChem on manufacturing and marketing issues.  Mr. Avellar is
the current associate director of the Bio- based Materials Center and
is coordinator of R&D for Bio-based Materials in the Department of
Wood Science and Forest Products at Virginia Tech.

<H1>ATCC to Bring 230 Biotech Jobs to Virginia</H1>
<P>

The American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) is moving to Prince
William County, Virginia from its current location in Rockville,
Maryland.  Their decision to move is the result of the year-long work
of a consortium that includes CIT, George Mason University, Prince
William County, and the Commonwealth of Virginia.  ATCC is the foremost
archive of living cultures in the world, comprising a collection of
over 65,000 different samples of bacteria, viruses, recombinant DNA,
and cell cultures.  ATCC contains the raw materials on which the
biotechnology industry is based.
<P>
CIT's role in attracting ATCC to relocate to Virginia is a promise to
work with ATCC to commercialize their collection.  This could take a
number of forms, including spinning up new biotech companies and
licensing bacterial or viral strains to companies attracted to
Virginia by ATCC's presence here.  CIT has already begun working on a
project with ATCC and a small, start-up company from the Norfolk area.
<P>
ATCC is nearly 70 years old and was originally spun out of the
National Institutes of Health.  It employs approximately 230 people,
half of whom are scientists.  Construction of their new facility alone
(see artist rendering above) is expected to pump $16.5 million into
the state and local economy.
<P>
ATCC acquires, classifies, preserves, and distributes microorganisms
to academic, industrial, and government laboratories as well as acting
as a repository for patented strains.  Their research partnership with
George Mason University in the emerging area of bio-informatics was
key to their relocation decision, and their new location across the
street from George Mason's Prince William Institute will strengthen
those research ties.  CIT has committed money and the efforts of its
Biotechnology program director, Dr. Bob Schwartz, to supporting the
commercial aspects of this partnership.  According to Dr. Schwartz, "We
expect ATCC to be the cornerstone, or using another analogy 'our
anchor tenant,' in developing biotech companies in Northern Virginia,
having a positive impact on the growth of the biomedical industry in
Richmond and environmental biotech in Southwest Virginia."
<P>
For more information contact Bob Walden at ATCC at 301/231-5572.

<H1>CIT Services Offered Regionally</H1>
<P>
Starting July 1, all of Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology's
programs and services will be accessible through four regional teams.
This brings to fruition another one of the pledges made by new CIT
President Robert Templin in the strategic plan approved last winter.
<P>
Previously, programs and services were accessible through individual
program managers, primarily located in Herndon.  Limited services were
available through the Technology Transfer and Assistance Program,
operated in conjunction with the Virginia Community College System.
<P>
Under the new Regional Office system, every CIT client will have an
advocate in a local office whose responsibilities will include
understanding the challenges faced by the individual client and
bringing the appropriate resources to bear on those challenges.  The
resources will include those offered by CIT directly, those offered by
CIT Partners, and those offered by other state agencies.
<P>
In addition, the Regional Directors will have the responsibility of
being involved in local economic development efforts, including the
emerging regional planning efforts such as the Northern Virginia
Project, the New Century Council, and the Greater Richmond
Partnership.
<P>
The Regional Offices are located in areas of the state with large
concentrations of technology-based companies or emerging technology
centers.  Statewide coverage is achieved in partnership with the
Virginia Alliance for Manufacturing Competitiveness (to be deployed in
late 1995), the A.L. Philpott Manufacturing Center, the Peninsula
Advanced Technology Center, and the Southwest Virginia Advanced
Manufacturing Technology Center.
<P>
The CIT Program and Services available through the Regional Offices
include:
<P>
1) Helping Companies Acquire Technology:
<P>
This can include licensing one of over 400 technologies that CIT owns
that have been developed at Virginia's state universities.  Another
alternative is doing joint research and development with a Virginia
university, possibly at one of the Technology Development Centers
supported by CIT.  A third possibility is transferring technology from
a Federal Laboratory under one of the agreements that CIT has set up
for Virginia companies.  These agreements exist with the Naval
Research Laboratory, the United States Geological Survey, NASA, and
the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility.
<P>
2) Turn Technology into a Product
<P>
Sometimes additional development work is required to "productize" a
technology.  CIT can help find you a university partner to do this
work.  Another option is to work with the CIT-funded Technology
Application Center at Old Dominion University for prototypes or
testing.
<P>
3) Get Technology-Based Product to Market
<P>
CIT has a variety of entrepreneurship programs designed to help early
stage companies bring new products to market.  Attend one of our
seminars focused on the needs of technology entrepreneurs.  Work with
one of four Entrepreneurship Centers to receive in-depth assistance
from university and private sector volunteers.  Work directly with
experts on staff on sources of funding in the Federal sector, as
well as angels and venture capital.
<P>
Industry-based experts assist through state industry associations,
intellectual resources, matches for strategic alliances and
partnering, suppliers, manufacturers, or marketing partners.  The
Regional Offices can be reached by calling the numbers listed above.

<H1>CIT Adds Muscle to Nautilus</H1>
<P>
A partnership between Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology,
Virginia Tech, and Nautilus has produced fitness equipment now being
used by the Washington Redskins. The new technology was put to the
test recently at the All-Pro, All Sport Strength & Conditioning
Clinic held at Lansdowne Resort in Leesburg.
<P>
Nautilus fitness equipment's success has been in part because of the
unique design of its linkages and wrapping cam mechanisms.  Virginia
Tech and CIT have worked with engineers at the Nautilus facility in
Independence, Va. to develop novel analytical methods for producing
linkages and wrapping cams.  This includes integrating these methods
into Nautilus' existing CAD-based software and creating and adapting
mechanisms for improved machine performance.  The significance of this
work was recognized with the Proctor & Gamble Award of Merit at the
1992 ASME Mechanisms Conference.
<P>
The partnership between Virginia Tech, CIT and Nautilus has produced
improved accuracy in hardware design, a 40% reduction in engineering
development time, and much greater flexibility in the product
development process, setting the stage for more innovative products
for the company.
<P>
Nautilus, based in Independence, Va., is a world leader in the design
and manufacture of exercise equipment.  The company recently expanded
their efforts to develop new, innovative products.  They currently
sell over 100 different products in the health and fitness market.
<P>
For two years, Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology (CIT) has
partnered with Nautilus in supporting the ongoing efforts of
Virginia Tech's Dr. Charles Reinholtz and his students to integrate
these methods into their existing CAD-based software and then create
and adapt mechanisms for improved machine performance.
<P>
Prototype equipment was based on the results of the new software. This
led to the construction of new products now being tested by the
Washington Redskins.

<H1>Opportunity Virginia and CIT</H1>
<P>
Opportunity Virginia: A Strategic Plan for Jobs and Prosperity,
initiated by Governor Allen, was unveiled in December
1994. Opportunity Virginia is a business-driven, statewide, strategic
plan for economic development.  It was developed under the guidance of
Commerce and Trade Secretary Robert Skunda, 18 regional economic
<P>
CIT's importance for the future of Virginia was underlined by the fact
that Governor Allen identified 25 tasks for CIT to implement the
strategies for the five overriding goals.  Seven of the tasks are
closely aligned with CIT's new focus.
<P>

An example of this are the two tasks which support goal #3: Improving
the economic success and competitiveness of Virginia's established and
emerging base of companies. These tasks are:
<UL>
<LI>support ongoing industry round-tables in high-technology segments;
and
<LI>support the development of on-line networks for technology-related
businesses.
</UL>
<P>
Furthermore, in order to capitalize on Virginia's technology assets
and infrastructure to compete in the 21st century (Goal #4), CIT
anticipates being very involved in the following five areas:
<OL>
<LI>develop the Science & Technology Policy for the Commonwealth;
<LI>create a strategic plan to support Opportunity Virginia and the work
of the Science and Technology Task Force, increasing leadership for
cosponsored technology development projects and centers;
<LI>hold technology expos and encourage the development of on-line
business networks, such as SEVAnet on the Peninsula (see separate
article in this newsletter), to share ideas, resources, and commercial
opportunities;
<LI>study the possibility of providing research seed grants or loans to
private sector researchers and entrepreneurs; and
<LI>identify ways to help Virginia researchers and students
commercialize their ideas/inventions in Virginia.
</OL>
<P>
A total of 10 key economic sectors were identified in which Virginia
should plan and invest for long-term economic growth.  Included are
four of the five key industry sectors which CIT is targeting for
Virginia's future: Aerospace, Biotechnology, Information Technology &
Telecommunications, and Manufacturing.  (The fifth CIT industry
sector, Energy and Environment, supports all ten of the economic
sectors.)  CIT's President, Dr. Templin, was appointed to the Steering
Committee of Opportunity Virginia; CIT's Directors of the various
industry sectors served on their respective business-driven task
forces, and CIT's Technology Transfer Directors were involved in
regional meetings.

<H1>Geotextiles Say "Goodbye" to Potholes</H1>
<P>

Every year, the Commonwealth of Virginia spends nearly 600 million
dollars on roadway maintenance and resurfacing.  Yet during the
spring of each year, our roads are again plagued with cracks and
potholes.  This yearly rite seems to be inevitable.
<P>
Now, new technology promises to solve this costly problem.  Research
by Dr. Imad Al-Quadi and Dr. Thomas Brandon of Virginia Tech has found
that this happens because traffic pushes the pavement aggregate into
the underlying rain-softened soil, mixing the aggregate and soil until
the pavement system weakens, causing those dangerous and damaging
cracks and potholes.
<P>
A cooperative research project funded by Virginia's Center for
Innovative Technology (CIT), Atlantic Construction Fabrics of
Richmond, Amoco and the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT)
found that using high strength fabrics called "geotextiles" beneath a
roadway can extend pavement life and cut maintenance costs up to
$35,000 per mile of roadway over a 20-year life.  The geotextile
eliminates the intermixing of aggregate with the underlying soil as
shown in the accompanying diagram.
<P>
Last summer, the technology went into the field demonstration phase
when it was installed in an electronically instrumented section of a
newly constructed road in Bedford County made available by VDOT for
this project. The road included nine different pavement designs and is
the most heavily instrumented roadway of its type.  The road's
performance is monitored in real time and evaluated in response to
traffic loading.  The researchers will use the results of this study
to develop a design methodology that incorporates the benefits of this
new technology into roadway design.
<P>
Until now, no one had successfully quantified the benefits of
geotextile separators in roadway pavements.  Without cold hard facts,
county, city and state engineers have been reluctant to use this new
technology.  "You cannot expect engineers to design with a new
technology if you don't give them supportive data and a design
approach," states Jack Heinemann, CIT's Industry Director for Energy
and Environment.  Mr. Arthur Barnhart of VDOT agrees, "This research
will be able to tell us objectively about the benefits of the fabric."
<P>
Expanding the use of this technology benefits Virginia companies.  One
of the project sponsors, Atlantic Construction Fabrics (ACF), is
actively involved in geotextile manufacturing, distribution and
installation.  The company added 40 employees in 1995.  Mr. Rennie
DiLoreto, President of ACF, attributes a two million dollar increase
in l995 sales to the results of this research. "Not only has this
research increased sales in Virginia, it has dramatically increased
the sales of our satellite offices in Delaware, Pennsylvania, Florida
and Maryland.  Engineers are finally learning about the impact of this
new technology. It has revolutionized roadway design."

<H1>BioEast '95</H1>
<P>

On January 9, 1995, the Virginia Biotechnology Consortium opened their
booth at BioEast '95 in Washington, D.C.  A consortium booth was first
conceived by Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology's (CIT)
Biotechnology program in September as a vehicle for selling Virginia,
Virginia companies, and the products those companies make.
<P>
The theme of the booth was the infrastructure and support Virginia
has developed for Biotechnology.  "When we first began talking about
it, I pictured six or eight Virginia biotech companies scrambling to
make sales from the booth and at the same time making a statement
about how we are supporting Biotechnology growth in Virginia," said
Bob Schwartz, the Director of CIT's Biotechnology Program.  That
vision is what emerged at the four-day show in January--Virginia
supports Biotech and is growing Biotech companies.
<P>
Dr Dick Freer of Commonwealth panel of the booth where they sold their
Biotechnologies was typical; he said, "I not only made some strong
contacts for sales but also lined up a couple of very good leads for
financing."
<P>
"What pleased me were the two or three Virginia companies that
introduced themselves and wanted to join us the next time," said Terry
Woodworth, the Associate Director of CIT's Biotechnology Institute at
Virginia Commonwealth University.  Over 85 business cards were
collected by the group, in addition to individual contacts.
<P>
Heard most often in the four days of the show was the statement, "I
didn't realize there was so much going on in biotechnology in
Virginia," according to Bob Schwartz.
<P>
The Consortium was led by CIT and included the Greater Richmond
Partnership and Prince William County as major sponsors.  Cruachem,
BioConversion Technologies, Dominion BioSciences, Hemodyne,
Commonwealth Biotechnologies and Ocean View Biotech each paid for a
panel of the booth where they sold their products and helped sell
Virginia.
<P>
The Virginia Biotechnology Park, Medicorp of Fredericksburg, and the
Virginia Biotechnology Association rounded out the participants at the
show.  Virginia's Department of Economic Development provided the gift
for the show's Bio Bingo.  Veterinary Technologies and Virginia Tech's
Corporate Research Center provided support and literature.

<H1>Virginia Electronics EXPO</H1>
<P>
The inaugural Virginia Electronics Expo, sponsored by the Chesapeake
Electronic Representatives Association in cooperation with Virginia's
Center for Innovative Technology, was held June 5-6, 1995 at the
Pavilion in Virginia Beach.
<P>
This event illustrates the industry sector approach being pursued by
CIT.  Several years ago, John Jerke, now Industry Director for
Aerospace, started a small scale effort to organize and promote the
electronics industry in Virginia.  Among his accomplishments in this
area, John counts the establishment of a local chapter of the Surface
Mount Technology Association (SMTA) and a directory of over 200
electronics companies in the Commonwealth.
<P>
Because of this work, the Chesapeake Electronic Representatives
Association contacted John when they decided to have an event in
Virginia.  John brought in two colleagues in the Hampton Roads
region--Steve Cooper (now Executive Director of the Peninsula Advanced
Technology Center) and Robert Harrell, CIT Regional Director for
Norfolk.  Together, they helped the Association plan and promote the
event which featured over 75 exhibits including many Virginia
electronics manufacturers.
<P>
In addition, Harrell hosted a panel discussion featuring CIT partners
Clair Dorsey, Technology Applications Center, Old Dominion University;
Lani Hummel, Mid-Atlantic Technical Assistance Center; Dr. George
Niel, CEBAF; and Steve Cooper.  Two of CIT's Technology Development
Centers in electronics related fields also exhibited.  These were the
Center for Semicustom Integrated Systems and the Power Electronics
Center.

<H1>Richmond Roundup: Strong Bipartisan Support for CIT</H1>
<P>

The 1995 Session of the Virginia General Assembly produced several
bills and resolutions which directly affect CIT.  In addition, state
support of the CIT budget was adjusted.
<P>
The Budget Bill which passed the General Assembly provided for an
overall stable budget for CIT in that the annual General Fund
appropriation for CIT was held at the $8.2 million level, with CIT
making a one-time deposit of $1.5 million to the General Fund.  This
action is consistent with the Governor's budget plan for CIT to reduce
reserve funds which CIT uses to supplement its state appropriation for
its operating budget.
<P>
CIT received strong support from Republican and Democratic legislators
from all parts of the state.  Supportive budget amendments for CIT
were submitted by Delegates Vince Callahan (R) of McLean, Alan
Diamonstein (D) of Newport News, Bob Harris (R) of Fairfax, Ken Plum
(D) of Reston, and Senator Hunter Andrews (D) of Hampton.
<P>
<B><CITE>HB 1482</CITE></B>, a bill proposed by Delegate Bob Harris (R) of Fairfax County,
passed unanimously calling for the Innovative Technology Authority
(ITA), the "parent" public authority to which CIT serves as the
private not-for-profit operating arm, to be under the auspices of the
Secretary of Commerce & Trade rather than the Secretary of Education.
<P>
This change in reporting should be very smooth since both Secretaries
currently serve on the Board of Directors for CIT, and because there
exists close coordination with both Secretariats.  This bill was
promoted by members of the business community.
<P>
<B><CITE>HB 2199</CITE></B>, a bill proposed by Delegate Bob Bloxom (R) of Mappsville
passed unanimously creating a Commercial Space flight Authority to
establish a flight launch center on Virginia's Eastern Shore and
acknowledges the CIT-chartered Center for Commercial Space
Infrastructure (CCSI) at ODU.
<P>
CIT is proud of its pace-setting role in helping to develop this
important facility for the commercial space industry in Virginia.
<P>
<B><CITE>HB 1828</CITE></B>, a bill proposed by Delegate Jim Scott (D) of Fairfax County
also passed unanimously calling for CIT to provide the staff support
for the Virginia Technology Council (VTC).  Previously, the Northern
Virginia Technology Council was charged with this responsibility.
<P>
The VTC is a statewide Council appointed by the Governor which has
complementary purposes with CIT.  Specifically, VTC is chartered to
develop a statewide technology blueprint and advocate
technology-related issues to all levels of government and within the
business community.
<P>
CIT welcomes this new task; in fact, CIT has already been working with
the VTC.
<P>
<B><CITE>HJ 447</CITE></B>, a resolution proposed by Delegate Bob Ball (D) of Richmond,
passed unanimously and will continue the Science and Technology Task
Force created to develop a strategic plan for science and technology
for the Commonwealth.  CIT is charted with helping to staff the task
force.

<H1>CIT, NASA LaRC Forge New Alliance</H1>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology</A> and <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">NASA Langley Research
Center</A> in Hampton signed an agreement in April that will bring one of
the largest inventories of technology capabilities to Virginia
businesses and entrepreneurs.  Under the "Memorandum of Understanding"
between the two organizations, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</A> and <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">Langley</A> will "actively
cooperate together in providing NASA-derived technologies to the
private sector in Virginia."
<P>
The agreement, which involves no exchange of funds, essentially means
that <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</A> will act as a facilitator, seeking Virginia businesses that
could benefit from the use of NASA developed technology and putting
them in contact with <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">Langley</A>.  <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</A> President <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/rtemplin.html">Robert G. Templin, Jr.</A>,
and NASA Center Director Paul F. Holloway signed the agreement as
part of <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">Langley</A>'s 3-day Technology Opportunities Showcase (TOPS'95).
<P>
"This new agreement between <A HRE="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</A> and NASA <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">Langley</A> is consistent with
<A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</A>'s new mission that calls for expanding access to all of the
Commonwealth's science and technology resources," said Templin.
<P>
To implement the agreement, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">CIT</A> plans to fund a position at the
Peninsula Advanced Technology Center (PATC) in Hampton.  The incumbent
will be responsible for appraising and marketing technologies from
NASA <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">Langley</A> as well as other intellectual resources in the Hampton
Roads region including the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator
Facility, William and Mary, Old Dominion University, and Eastern

<H1>VA Technology Infrastructure '95</H1>
<P>

"Opportunity Virginia: A Strategic Plan for Jobs and Prosperity"
placed a great emphasis on the development of a comprehensive plan
for telecommunications and information technology throughout the
Commonwealth. To support this, the Council on Information Management
convened a series of public forums, including one held February 27 at
the Center for Innovative Technology headquarters in Herndon.
<P>
The four forums, each of which was attended by over 100 vendors,
telecommunications users and members of the business community,
focused on the applications needs of the Commonwealth and the
existing products and services available to meet those needs.
<P>
In addition, the forums identified roadblocks to implementation that
might exist, applications which would have great cost benefits and
efficiencies if implemented on a statewide basis, and applications
critical for economic development, especially those critical for
localities.  The next step will be a strategic plan for implementing
applications providing the greatest benefits.

<HR>
<H1>The New CIT - Q&A with CIT's President</H1>
<P>
Dr. Robert Templin, President of CIT, recently answered questions
about the new focus of CIT, Opportunity Virginia and the budget cuts.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> What is the New CIT?
<P>
<B>A:</B> The New CIT is a strategy developed in response to new legislation
and discussions with Virginia's technology businesses.  It was
approved by the Board of Directors and was presented to Governor Allen
in mid-December.  It describes our new focus in light of an evolving
mission and the changing needs of Virginia businesses.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Why change CIT?
<P>
<B>A:</B> Like all organizations, in order to progress, CIT needs to adapt to
changing times.  When CIT was founded ten years ago, a challenge
facing the Commonwealth was that the universities were an untapped
resource for the business community.  CIT was created to build a bridge
between the universities and businesses.  Today, Virginia is known
for the climate of cooperation between business and higher
education.  We are proud to be a part of that success.
<P>
Now, building on that foundation, there are other unmet needs in the
business community.  Opportunity Virginia describes some of
them--capital, access to new technologies to modernize our
manufacturers, information technology infrastructure, and more
training for entrepreneurs, for example.
<P>
The New CIT reflects these emerging challenges to the competitiveness
of businesses in Virginia.  The New CIT is refocusing on these issues
that are important to the business community today.
<P>
At the same time, customer demand and budget realities are pushing
business concepts like customer service and productivity into the
vocabulary of organizations like CIT.  We need to be more efficient
and effective to better use the taxpayer's investment in us.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> What are the main features of the New CIT?
<P>
<B>A:</B> There are six.  First, we will assist Virginia companies in being
competitive in a global economy by expanding access to all of the
Commonwealth's science and technology resources including Virginia's
colleges and Universities, federal laboratories and private sector
resources.  Second, we will focus on technology-based business and
manufacturing by organizing regionally and by industry sectors.
Third, we will use partnerships to broaden our programs and services,
and continue to bring together key resources to meet industry needs.
Fourth, we will build Upon ten years of experience in enhancing the
research and development capability of Virginia.  Fifth, we will be
more accountable, efficient and effective.  Finally, we will
incorporate the tasks identified in Opportunity Virginia (see story on
left).
<P>
<B>Q:</B> What does this mean to an individual business?
<P>
It will mean that you will find working with CIT easier--we will have
regional offices around the state where you will be able to
access all CIT programs and services.  We will expand some of the
current services so that they are available in more locations and we
will be adding new resources to our offerings.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> How will you measure your results under the New CIT?
<P>
<B>A:</B> We will measure ourselves by asking our clients how we are doing
and how our assistance has helped them.  In addition, we will set
measurable, attainable goals such as to assist in creating or
retaining 6,000 jobs, and be instrumental in starting, retaining or
converting 150 companies by the end of 1997.  During this same period,
we plan to assist 1,500 companies improve their competitiveness by
applying technology to their products and services.  We expect that
these companies will report an economic impact of $100 million during
the first year after receiving our services.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> Tell me more about the relationship with Opportunity Virginia.
<P>
<B>A:</B> Opportunity Virginia is the result of an exhaustive process which
included hundreds of business leaders and many of CIT's professional
staff.  The recommendations are consistent with the New CIT and
mirror many of CIT's new initiatives.  CIT hopes to play a leadership
role in several of the recommendations and will be working on these
action items over the next year.
<P>
<B>Q:</B> How do you feel about the future of CIT?
<P>
<B>A:</B> I'm optimistic about CIT.  We have a lot of work to do to implement
the New CIT, but we are looking forward to the challenge and the
opportunity to better serve the businesses in Virginia.  The important
thing is that the Governor, the General Assembly and the business
community have expressed their support for CIT and have encouraged us
to continue on our new course.

<H1>New Defense Conversion Loan Fund</H1>
<P>

The Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development has set
up a $2.9 million revolving loan fund for defense conversion.  The
focus of this program is small-to-medium sized businesses hurt by
defense downsizing.  Qualifying companies will be able to borrow as
much as $200,000 at or below market interest rates for as long as ten
years to help finance projects that reduce their dependence upon
defense contracting.
<P>
Funding for the program comes from the U.S. Department of Commerce's
Economic Development Administration, which provided $2.1 million. The
balance comes from the State of Virginia.
<P>
To qualify for the loan, a company must get at least 15 percent of its
revenue from defense-related activities and demonstrate actual or
impending financial damage from defense downsizing.  The state will
only provide financing for half of a project's cost.  Companies must
finance the rest with at least 10 percent cash and bank loans.
<P>
The purpose of this revolving loan fund is not to compete with banks
but to supplement them.  For every $10,000 borrowed, at least one
permanent, full-time job must be created or retained.
<P>
Loan funds can be used for buying land and buildings, constructing new
or improving existing facilities, purchasing machinery and equipment,
working capital and work training.  A loan can't be used to subsidize
a business that is able to borrow from traditional sources, to
relocate a business, to refinance debt or to compensate for a
fundamental business weakness.
<P>
Loan applications will be reviewed and handled by the Department's
staff.  Any loan must be approved by the Department's board.  The
Department will then loan the money to a local industrial development
authority to be reloaned to the company.
<P>
For more information, call Ray Richeson (804) 371-7070, Charles
Gravatt (804) 371-7028, or contact your local CIT Regional Office.

<H1>New CIT Doubles Entrepreneurship Assistance: Va Tech and Hampton Centers Funded</H1>
<P>

Implementation of the New CIT started in January with the addition
of two new entrepreneurship assistance resources to CIT's list of
partners.  The new programs at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and the
Hampton Incubator in Hampton augment already existing programs at
George Mason University in Herndon and Old Dominion University in
Virginia Beach.
<P>
The entrepreneurship assistance programs provide in-depth assistance
to small and emerging technology-based firms. The assistance, provided
by the program's staff, faculty, graduate students and private sector
professionals, includes topics such as business planning, marketing,
financing and intellectual property.
<P>
<B>Business/Technology Center</B>
<P>
The Business/Technology Center (BTC) recently funded at Virginia Tech
is a unique venture of the university's Corporate Research Center, the
Pamplin School of Business, Virginia Tech Intellectual Properties and
the towns of Blacksburg and Christiansburg.  The BTC will be located
at the Corporate Research Center and will assist firms located there
as well as other entrepreneurs in the New River Valley and Roanoke
areas.
<P>
Herbert Cork, currently the director of the Small Business Institute
at the Pamplin School of Business, will also be the director of the
Business/Technology Center.
<P>
"The BTC will ensure that emerging or early stage companies in a
high-tech field will have every opportunity to succeed by providing
high quality business assistance," says Joe Meredith, president of
the Corporate Research Center.  This success, he adds, would result in
an increase in the area's growth rate, an increase in high quality
jobs and a demand for skilled workers and professionals.
<P>
<B>Technology Entrepreneurship Program</B>
<P>
The City of Hampton will combine its resources with the Small Business
Development Center of Hampton Roads to offer the Technology
Entrepreneurship Program to technology oriented businesses and
start-up entrepreneurs on the Virginia Peninsula and Southside Hampton
Roads.  The program will be located at the Hampton Small Business
Incubator facility in Hampton.
<P>
The program will be overseen by Herbert Mallette, Small & Minority
Business Manager of the City of Hampton's Department of Development.  A
full-time entrepreneurship director will be hired to be located at the
incubator itself.  The director will be assisted by the current staff
of the SBDC, Bill Holleran and Steve Coplon.
<P>
Donald Maxwell, Director of Development for the City of Hampton
says, "The City is interested in assisting existing and emerging
technology-based companies in our region. The growth of existing
companies is as important to economic development as recruiting
new ones."
<P>
<B>Results of Entrepreneurship Assistance</B>
<P>
The New CIT calls for increased investment in entrepreneurial
assistance because it is critical to making many small companies
successful.  Especially with technology-based companies, the
entrepreneur will typically have a technical or scientific background
and little or no training in business management, marketing or finance.
<P>
These programs have been very successful in Virginia.  The oldest
program, the Entrepreneurial Center at Old Dominion University, is
run by Dennis Ackerman.  Since 1988, Dennis has assisted almost 100
companies, producing a total of 440 jobs with aggregate salaries of
over $27 million.  The companies Dennis has assisted have raised almost
$20 million in outside capital to start new companies, products or
services.  In 1994, the ODU Entrepreneurial Center served twenty
clients who created 98 jobs in their first year.
<P>
Other entrepreneurial assistance programs in the state have become
financially self-sustaining since their early funding by CIT.  The best
example is the Business Development Centre in Lynchburg, VA.  This
program received CIT funding from 1988 to 1992.  The Incubator has
since expanded its facility by 200% to 40,000 square feet. The current
director, Catherine McFaden, says that the program now has 14
tenants; five additional companies have graduated within the last six
months.  Several of the Incubator's graduates, including Electronic
Design & Manufacturing (EDM), have become quite successful in
Lynchburg, employing a total of 30 employees.  EDM entered the Business
Development Center in July 1990 with only three employees and in
January 1995 moved to a 15,000 sq. ft. facility.

<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 VSPACE=1 SRC="./images/inn2.gif">
<P>
Some of CIT's challenges include acquiring or developing new technologies, turning these technologies into products and bringing these products to the market.  To meet these challenges, CIT has spent the last ten years putting in place the <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/resources/tdcs.html">technology development centers</A>, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/resources/institutes.html">institutes</A> and partnerships that assist Virginia in its economic development efforts.  Now, Virginia is beginning to see the rewards of these centers as they create new companies and jobs, and help secure Virginia's position as a <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/news/VAIsTechState.html">high-tech state</A>.
<P>
     No one company better depicts the success of these challenges and demonstrates the new mission of CIT (jobs, companies, competitiveness) than Fiber & Sensor Technologies (F&S) in <A HREF="http://www.bev.net">Blacksburg, VA</A>.  Founded in 1990, F&S was created principally to commercialize intellectual property developed at the <A HREF="http://www.ee.vt.edu/ee/research/fiber.html">Fiber and Electro-optics Research Center</A> at <A HREF="http://www.vt.edu/">Virginia Tech</A> (FEORC), a <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/resources/tdcs.html">technology development center</A> created by CIT in 1986.  This past September, F&S held an inaugural celebration for its new 8,000+ square foot facility in the Blacksburg Industrial Park in <A HREF="http://www.bev.net">Blacksburg, VA</A>.
<P>
     "We're starting to see that CIT's long term investments in technology development centers do pay off and are necessary in creating a high-tech infrastructure in Virginia," said <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/wtolle.html">Wolfgang T&ouml;lle</A>, CIT's managing director for technology industry development.
<P>
     F&S exclusively licenses several optical fiber sensor technologies from CIT, including patents for the Extrinsic Fabry-Perot Interferometer (EFPI) optical fiber sensor, the Sapphire Fiber Interferometer (SFI) and the Split-Spectrum Intensity-Based (SSIB) optical fiber sensor.  In addition to manufacturing several optical fiber sensor-based measurement instruments, F&S offers application-specific instrument design and prototyping services and is internationally recognized for its leading-edge research and development of fiber-optic sensors for applications including structural health monitoring of aerospace and civil structures, intelligent process monitoring and characterization of advanced material systems.
<P>
     <A HREF="http://www.bev.net">Blacksburg</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.co.roanoke.va.us/">Roanoke Valley</A> are considered to have one of the most sophisticated fiber optics training and development programs in the world.
<P>
     "The establishment of F&S is a significant manifestation of CIT's goal to utilize innovation at <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/resources/universities.html">Virginia's universities</A> to bolster the Commonwealth's economy," said Kent Murphy, president of F&S.  In the five years of F&S's existence, the company has received in excess of $8 million in federal grants, grown to employ over 25 Virginians and has been involved in two nationally recognized research programs.  The new building will house F&S employee offices and features state-of-the-art research & development labs.
<P>
     "This gathering is not just for our new building, but to recognize the fruitful culmination of a synergistic effort among universities," said Murphy.
<P>
     "There are so many new innovations at the universities that we need to take advantage of economically." said <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/wtolle.html">T&ouml;lle</A>.  "F&S and <A HREF="http://www.ee.vt.edu/ee/research/fiber.html">FEORC</A> show that we can use these innovations to stimulate and promote high-tech growth in Virginia."

<H1>IBM/Toshiba Plant to Provide Jobs, Companies and Competitiveness</H1>

On August 8, 1995, IBM and Toshiba announced plans to build a
chipmaking plant in Manassas, VA. Dennis Gabriel, CIT director for
entrepreneurial financing, was a part of the team that attracted the
two companies to Virginia.<P>

The deal, formally announced by representatives from IBM, Toshiba and
the governor's office, promises to ultimately create 4,000 jobs and
represent a total capital investment exceeding $4 billion.  Not only
will this boost the Virginia economy by creating jobs and attracting
companies, it will help provide the infrastructure Virginia needs to
emerge as a competitor in the electronics industry as well as
demonstrate that Virginia is the next emerging high technology region.<P>

"Obviously, we don't know what the exact impact is going to be;
however, look at what this type of event has done for other areas of
the United States, such as Route 128, and Silicon Valley," said Dr.
Robert G. Templin, Jr., president of CIT.  "This is an important win
for the Commonwealth because it brings to Virginia the last component
to creating a healthy, thriving electronics industry.  Virginia now
has a serious shot at becoming the next Silicon Valley."<P>

Virginia is already home to over 200 electronics companies ranging
from small companies that produce unique electronic products to large
manufacturers that produce thousands of printed circuit boards per
month.  "Virginia has been missing the one component that could
transform the state into a booming electronics industry," said John
Jerke, industry director for aerospace and transportation at
CIT.  "That has been the actual chip manufacturers."<P>

To put this into a better perspective, imagine a four-legged stool.  A
stool needs four legs to balance, and similarly, four components are
needed to create a balanced and thriving electronics industry.  One
leg represents the basic chip manufacturers--the IBM/Toshibas of the
world.  The second leg represents the printed circuit board
manufacturers-- once the chips are built, they're mounted onto these
boards.  Printed-circuit board manufacturers, such as MSI, Inc., in
Manassas, are located all over the state.  The third component, or
leg, represents the software that provides the functioning capability
to the chip.  Northern Virginia is one of the leading centers of
software development in the world with companies such as Legent and
Software AG.  The fourth leg represents the future development of new
chips.  University research and development capabilities throughout
Virginia, especially the Power Electronics Center at Virginia Tech and
the Center for Semicustom Integrated Systems at the University of
Virginia, both of which receive CIT funds, are leaders in this
industry.  Virginia now has the four building blocks to be a
world-class competitor in the electronics industry.<P>

With the recent announcement of Motorola's plans to build a $3 billion
chip making plant in Richmond and the IBM/Toshiba deal, Virginia has
created a magnet that will attract other companies to the
Richmond-Northern Virginia technology corridor as well as create
possible spin-off companies.  "There will be a clustering of support
industries, including those who buy and those who provide basic
materials and test equipment," said Jerke.  "These companies, who will
also be providing jobs, would benefit from having the high-tech
supplier right down the street."<P>

Added Dr. Templin, "This is another indication to the outside world
that Virginia is a technology state."<P>

<H1>Praise But Caution for U.S. Competitive Position</H1>
<P>

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
recently released the "National Critical Technologies Report," the
third in a biennial series, which reviews the United States'
competitive position in seven broad technology categories, and 27
specific technology areas, in comparison with the positions of Japan
and the European Community.  While the report concludes that the
U.S. is either leading or at parity with its competitors in all 27 of
the categories identified, it warns that the size of the U.S. lead
in many areas is declining.
<P>
The categories and areas examined are:
<UL>
<LI>Energy: energy efficiency; storage, conditioning, distribution, and
transmission; and improved generation.
<P>
<LI>Environmental Quality: monitoring and assessment; pollution
control; and remediation and restoration.
<P>
<LI>Information and Communication: components; communications, computer
systems; information management; intelligent complex adaptive
systems; sensors; and software and toolkits.
<P>
<LI>Living Systems: biotechnology; medical technology; agriculture and
food technology; and human factors.
<P>
<LI>Manufacturing: discrete product manufacturing; continuous materials
processing; and micro/nanofabrication and machining.
<P>
<LI>Materials: materials; structures.
<P>
<LI>Transportation: aerodynamics; avionics and controls; propulsion and
power; systems integration; and human interface.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
The five industry sectors identified in the New CIT strategic plan
correspond closely to these identified critical technologies.  CIT's
five sectors are: energy and environment, information technology and
telecommunications, biotechnology, advanced manufacturing (including
materials) and aerospace and transportation.

<H1>CIT President Appointed to Commercial Space Flight Authority</H1>

On July 13, 1995, Virginia Governor George Allen announced the
appointment of Dr. Robert G. Templin, Jr., president of Virginia's
Center for Innovative Technology, to the Virginia Commercial Space
Flight Authority.  The authority, a result of House Bill 2199 passed by
the Virginia General Assembly this year, will benefit the life
sciences, telecommunications and environmental protection fields by
assisting in creating a commercial space flight center at Wallops
Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore.<P>

The creation of a commercial space flight facility on Wallops Island
has been a three and a half year endeavor supported and partly funded
by CIT.  "CIT has always seen and understood the opportunities that
exist in bringing a commercial space flight center to Virginia," said
Dr. Templin.<P>

In 1992, a CIT initiative created the Center for Commercial Space
Infrastructure (CCSI) at Old Dominion University, to support the
development of commercial space flight infrastructure in Virginia.
CIT funded its operations for the first year and a half and since
then, has assisted CCSI in generating grant proposals and providing
matching funds for the creation of a commercial space flight center at
the Wallops Island facility.  "Market surveys have strongly indicated
the growth opportunities at Wallops," said Wayne Woodhams, assistant
director of CCSI.  "That's why we've been interested in this
opportunity for so long."<P>

"Think of the possibilities--new jobs, increased tourism--millions
of dollars in new revenues for the Eastern Shore and Hampton Roads
areas.  The state will attract more aerospace companies as well as
better service the more than 250 aerospace companies currently in
Virginia," said Dr. Templin.<P>

The commercial space market is rapidly turning into a booming
business.  Virginia is now among four states, California, Alaska and
Florida, racing to establish commercial spaceports.  "Wallops Island
is advantageous due to its tremendous vantage point for accessing
certain orbital paths, its recovery location next to the Atlantic
Ocean and its remote location, reducing the liability risk," said
John Jerke, industry director for aerospace and transportation.<P>

The currenft facility has been in existence for over fifty years and
has already launched more than 15,000 small to medium-sized rockets
and balloons for experimental purposes.<P>

In order for the facility to transform into a viable commercial
spaceport, a new launch pad and tower need to be built to handle the
large-scale rockets.  Funds are currently being raised from outside
sources and private companies such as Lockheed-Martin and Orbital
Sciences who have expressed interest in helping to fund the
project. The project could also qualify for a $1 million federal grant
if the matching funds are raised.<P>

<H1>VA Tech Electric Car in National Competition</H1>
<P>

Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology is among the corporate
sponsors for a team of Virginia Tech students who are modifying a
Chrysler Neon to compete in the third annual Hybrid Electric Vehicle
Challenge.
<P>
The Challenge is an intercollegiate competition created by the
Department of Energy and the Society of Automotive Engineers.  During
the Challenge, students demonstrate new hybrid-electric technology on
cars which have been converted from conventional gasoline power to a
"hybrid" of electricity and other energy sources such as compressed
natural gas, methanol, ethanol or reformulated gasoline.
<P>
The Virginia Tech team is being supervised by Dr. Jaime de La Ree,
Professor of Electrical Engineering.  Professor de la Ree is
enthusiastic about both the technology and the experience for the
students.  "It is good for Virginia to take the lead in electric
vehicle technology," he said.  "And the students have learned a lot
about teamwork and design.  This project has enhanced the
communications skills of the students."
<P>
Other Virginia corporations sponsoring the Virginia Tech team include:
Volvo-GM, General Electric-Salem, Virginia Power, Appalachian Power,
Roanoke Gas Company, BFP, Inc., and Reynolds Metals.
<P>
Wayne Hawkins, CIT's Industry Director for Advanced Manufacturing, and
the chief proponent of several electric car projects in Virginia,
explained the significance of this project.  "The electric vehicle
projects are driven by the desire to clean up severe air pollution by
having more zero emission vehicles.  The challenges include increasing
the range of the vehicles, including all of the components within the
size of current subcompacts, and bringing costs into a competitive
range with gasoline-powered vehicles.  Hybrid electric vehicles are an
alternative to completely electric vehicles.  Although they do not
provide zero emissions, they do produce a car with more pep, a greater
range, better economy and more comfort and durability.  We have almost
forty motor vehicle or motor vehicle parts manufacturers in the state
who could take part in this emerging industry."

<TITLE>CIT Sponsors Research In Burn Therapy (January 1996)</TITLE>

<H1>CIT Sponsors Research In Burn Therapy</H1>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=left HSPACE=15 VSPACE=1 SRC="./images/inn5a.gif">
<P>
For the past 50 years, antibiotics have been the treatment of choice by doctors and pharmaceutical companies for most bacterial infections.  The emergence of drug-resistant bacterial and viral strains, the increased use of implants (temporary and permanent) and the growing number of elderly and immunocompromised patients now require the development of new ways to treat and prevent disease and infection.
<P>
     GAMMA-A Technologies, a biopharmaceutical company in Northern Virginia, has been pioneering research since 1994 using the amplification of natural immune responses for disease and infection.  This new method of treatment entitled, "Passive Local Immunotherapy," recently received a $75,000 award from <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology</A> to research the use of Gamma Globulin (IgG) in the treatment of burns and other infections. 
<P>
     "Preliminary results indicate that this method for the treatment of burns is successful," said Dr. Anthony G. Gristina, MD, president of GAMMA-A Technologies.     
<P>
     The product, applied topically and locally, uses an optimal dose of IgG in a solution, cream or wound dressing to achieve significant antibacterial activity and immune system enhancement to prevent and treat infection.  IgG is a protein fraction of blood containing natural antibodies that is currently administered systemically to prevent a broad spectrum of bacterial diseases and infection.  This can be ineffective when used intravenously due to low levels of antibodies reaching the damaged and infected tissue.
<P>
     "They're using medicines currently approved for treating disease and infection in a logically different way and achieving better results," said Bob Schwartz, CIT industry director for biotechnology and medical applications.  "Nobody ever considered this application for IgG...now everyone's saying, 'Why didn't we think of that?'"
<P>
     Although currently in the pre-clinical stages, pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest because burns are a major medical problem in the US.  Burn injuries are the fourth leading cause of death in the US.  Each year, 2,500,000 burn victims are treated clinically as outpatients, 100,000 are hospitalized, 25,000 require skin grafts and 12,000 die -- primarily from infection and toxic shock associated with burn wounds. The total cost to American healthcare related to burn injuries exceeds $11 billion annually.
<P>
     Upon completion of the research at the pre-clinical stage, the product will be submitted for <A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/">FDA</A> approval.  As IgG is already in use, fewer problems are expected in securing <A HREF="http://www.fda.gov/">FDA</A> approval for the use of this product in the treatment of burns.  The next step will be conducting research for the use of this product to fight other types of disease and infection.
<P>
     "Compositions such as this should be applied to all sorts of trauma -- treatments that involve catheters (which almost always cause infection), vascular grafts and artificial organ implants will have a reduced rate of infection," Gristina added.  "This is potentially one of the most straightforward andimportant medical breakthroughs of the decade."

<H1>CIT Measures Its Effectiveness</H1>
<H3>Client Surveys Show CIT's Economic Impact</H3>
<P>
A key component of the Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology Strategic Plan, approved by its <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/facts/board.html">Board of Directors</A> in December, 1994, was accountability -- the establishment of clear, measurable goals for economic impact and the commitment to annual, independent client surveys to determine progress against the goals.
<P>
     In the plan, CIT pledged to assist in the creation, attraction or retention of 6000 jobs, 150 companies and $100 million in increased company competitiveness by the end of 1997.  The two independent surveys conducted during the summer indicate that CIT has exceeded its first year goals by at least 10% (see charts below). 
<P>
     The goal for the first year of the three year cycle was 25 new or retained companies, 1000 new, saved or converted jobs and $25 million in improved competitiveness.  The results of the survey were 27 companies, 3,500 jobs and over $75 million in competitiveness.  In addition, CIT's clients reported a satisfaction rating of 4.1 on a scale of 5.0. Ninety-one percent of CIT clients said they would use CIT services again.
<P>
     The results came from a sample of nearly 400 CIT client companies. The first study was performed by <A HREF="http://www.battelle.org/">Battelle Memorial Institute</A> on projects initiated before FY95.  The second study, conducted by The Institute of Public Policy (TIPP) at <A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</A>, collected data about activities initiated during FY95 and for which the economic impact occurred during FY95.  Results of the Battelle study and the TIPP FY95 results were combined to provide both the current and cumulative effects of CIT's efforts.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="./images/inn1.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
     CIT President, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/rgtemplin.html">Robert G. Templin, Jr.</A>, recently expressed his thanks to the many CIT clients who responded to the surveys.  "We really appreciate the support of our clients in this effort.  We know it was time-consuming and often painstaking to reconstruct results related to our assistance, but with this feedback, we will be able to serve all Virginia  companies better in the future."

<H1>CIT Joins Commerce and Trade</H1><BR>
<H2><EM>Appoints New Entrepreneurial Financing Director</EM></H2>

Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology reports to the Secretariat
of Commerce and Trade effective July 1, 1995.  Virginia's Department
of Economic Development (VDED) (also in the Commerce and Trade
Secretariat) and CIT have jointly appointed Dennis E. Gabriel as the
Director of Entrepreneurial Financing.  This new position was
developed in response to the capital access needs of Virginia
businesses and forges an even stronger partnership between CIT and
VDED.<P>

"CIT has worked to build a climate of cooperation between businesses
and higher education.  Now, we're building on that foundation to help
create jobs and assist companies to be more competitive," said
Catherine Renault, managing director of CIT.  "One of these needs is
venture capital and financing for Virginia businesses.  This
partnership with VDED and Dennis' role demonstrate how critical
capital is to the success of Virginia businesses."<P>

Gabriel, a Certified Economic Developer, will aid in developing more
avenues and quicker access to venture capital for existing and new
high-tech companies.  "We want to help existing Virginia companies
with their financing needs," said Gabriel.  "We also want to create a
smooth transition for new companies.  Once they've committed to moving
to Virginia, we don't want them to encounter any financial stumbling
blocks."<P>

Gabriel comes to CIT and VDED as the former CFO and vice president of
finance and administration of Air South, Inc., a regional airline
based in Columbia, S.C.  During his tenure there, he was a key
strategist in putting together an $18.1 million capitalization
package.  Prior to this, Gabriel served as the manager of finance and
resource development at the South Carolina Department of Commerce,
where he was the founding director of the South Carolina Economic
Developer's School.<P>

<H1>CIT Excels in Patent Benchmark</H1>
<P>

The Southern Technology Council recently released a study which
benchmarked university-industry technology transfer in the South.  The
benchmark showed that the Center for Innovative Technology's efforts
in intellectual property protection and licensing were superior to the
South as a whole on specific economic development impacts.
<P>
For instance, the report states that universities in the
South are rapidly increasing their rate of patenting.  CIT was
instrumental in raising Virginia's ranking among the states from
28th to 6th in the number of patents issued to universities and
nonprofit institutions from 1987-1993.
<P>
As CIT's focus has shifted from serving universities to assisting
Virginia companies, its patent and licensing activities shifted to a
Virginia focus with emphasis on in-state business development and
start-ups.
<P>
Overall, the benchmark found that the median percentage of licenses
granted to in-state companies from patents developed in the South was
only 28%.  In comparison, CIT reported l7 licenses to companies within
the state for the year studied--81%.
<P>
An additional measure of state and regional impact is the extent of
licensing to start-ups. This is because most start-ups will be located
relatively close to the source of their technology.  The median value
of all the institutions studied was 11%.  Again, CIT was mentioned as
a special case: 67% of CIT's licenses go to start-ups.  When combined
with the University of Virginia (32%) and Virginia Tech (19%), it is
clear that Virginia is keeping much of its innovation close to home.
<P>
Finally, royalties from licensees represent a further validation of
the commercial value of academic inventions.  To the extent that these
royalty revenues derive from in-state licensees, they also imply that
the creation of wealth and jobs through sales of goods and services is
"staying home."  The median percentage of in-state royalties was 0.3%,
with 16 of 33 reporting institutions having 0% of royalties from
companies within their state.  Again, CIT was dramatically different,
reporting 75% of its six-figure royalty revenue flow from in-state
licensees.

<H1>New Safe Bait Stops Cockroaches</H1>
<P>

A nemesis of society may finally have met its match thanks to the
innovative approach of a Virginia Tech scientist.  Dr. Heather Wren,
a research entomologist, has developed an ingenious method of
cockroach control that will greatly reduce the population of these
creatures, and in an environmentally safe, non-pesticide manner.
<P>
Dr. Wren's technology development program is being cosponsored by CIT
and Dominion BioSciences, Inc., a new biotechnology firm located in
the Corporate Research Center in Blacksburg.  This company, headed by
Steve Banegas, has licensed this technology from Virginia Tech
Intellectual Properties, Inc. and is conducting laboratory research
and safety testing.  The company has also licensed from CIT a
technology for detecting viral contamination in water supplies.
<P>
According to the Entomology Society of America, over half a billion
dollars are spent annually on professional pest control of
cockroaches, and the market for cockroach baits alone is over $100
million annually.  Control is medically important because hundreds of
human pathogens and parasites have been found in and on
cockroaches.  At the same time, rising public awareness of
environmental issues, more stringent government regulations, the
increasing threat of litigation and the increasing resistance of
insects to existing insecticides is driving the need to develop safer
alternatives.
<P>
The scientific approach being developed is still proprietary and will
not be revealed until all patents have been completed, but it has
already been shown to reduce the number of roaches in successive
generations in the laboratory tests currently taking place at Tech.
The research team identified two compounds which are combined to
produce a bait additive that is mixed with food that is attractive to
cockroach populations.  The two compounds are "natural" and
"environmentally friendly," and one is actually found in frequently
consumed human food.  In addition, since the approach is not based on
a chemical pesticide, there is no indication that these insects will
build a resistance to the process.
<P>
Since there is a world-wide market for effective cockroach control,
several large companies have already approached Dr. Wren and Dominion
BioSciences to express an interest in working with them to rapidly
take this product to the marketplace and make it available to
consumers.
<P>
According to Banegas, President and CEO of Dominion BioSciences, Inc.,
"The primary focus of the new company is unique products for marketing
to agricultural and environmental markets.  Since there are no other
insecticide manufacturers in Virginia, this project was important to
bringing a new, environmentally safe product to the state."
<P>

<H1>Partnerships for Virginia Conference</H1>
<P>

As part of the Center for Innovative Technology's continuing effort to
make Virginia's science and technology community more competitive, we
are sponsoring Partnerships for Virginia, March 20-21, 1995 at
Westfields International Conference Center, Chantilly, VA.
<P>
The lesson of the nineties is that "going it alone" isn't a winning
strategy--partnering is!  With all the competitive forces out
there, partnering offers a way to access a new market, introduce or
enhance a product line, finance an expansion, acquire a new
technology or technical expertise and win new business.
<P>
Day One of the conference will be a tutorial on how to make partnering
work.  Included will be information on key issues such as intellectual
property protection and federal funding for partnerships.  The
conference will also feature a panel discussion by Virginia companies
who are making partnerships work for them.  As a special bonus, on the
evening of Day One there will be a reception at CIT's landmark
headquarters building.
<P>
Day Two will feature five industry tracks covering key CIT and
university resources available to companies.  In these tracks,
companies will meet others with similar interests.  At the lunches on
both days, there will be the opportunity to attend roundtable
discussions on various technical topics which will provide another
place to meet potential partners.
<P>
At this two-day conference, attendees will learn: the best practices
in partnering; key issues in technology licensing; sources of federal
funding for partnerships and consortia; federal laboratory resources
available in Virginia; leading edge technical work being done at
Virginia universities; and state and local resources available to
solve your business and technical problems.
<P>
For more information, call our conference hotline at 703/689-3025.

<H1>The New CIT Budget</H1>
<P>

The Center for Innovative Technology's Board of Directors approved
an operating budget for FY 1996 which implements the New CIT.  Two
significant changes are evident from the pie charts on the right.  One
is that the percentage of the budget (as well as the absolute dollars)
devoted to general and administrative expenses has declined compared
to FY 1992, the year of the Joint Commission study on CIT.  Second, the
budget devoted to long-term research projects has declined in favor of
more short-term entrepreneurial resources.  This balance was also in
the Joint Commission recommendation.

<H1>Richmond Retrieves New Jersey Bird That Flew The Coop</H1>
<P>
<CITE>
by Richard J. Husick
<BR>
Reprinted with permission from <B>Virginia Business</B> November 1995
</CITE>
<P>
Most robins migrate farther south than Virginia, but the corporate  variety is once again roosting in <A HREF="http://www.grpva.com/">Richmond</A>.  In late September, Whitehall-Robins Healthcare announced that it is consolidating all its research and development operations in Richmond to maximize efficiency.  The $1.4 billion drug company is closing down its research center in Hammonton, NJ, and plans to build a multimillion-dollar complex at its current Richmond site.  The decision to build the facility in Virginia marks a dramatic reversal of Richmond's luck with Whitehall-Robins.  In 1989, when <A HREF="http://www.internetwtc.com/amerhome/amerhome.htm">American Home Products Corp.</A> bought Richmond-based A.H. Robins Co. out of bankruptcy, more than 300 researchers lost their jobs.
<P>
     Whitehall-Robins, a subsidiary of American Home Products, is one of the largest producers of over-the-counter drugs in the world.  The company manufactures <A HREF="http://199.97.97.11:80/advil/">Advil</A>, Robitussin and Centrum, three of the country's top five over-the-counter medicines.
<P>
     In recent months, the company was considering locating its consolidated research and development facilities in New Jersey or in some other East Coast state.  If that had happened, Richmond would have lost another 100 high-paying research jobs.  Instead Richmond will gain 150 positions as New Jersey scientists migrate south to the new facility.  The city expects the company to create another 150 jobs in the next three to five years, says Joseph J. James, director of Richmond's Office of Economic Development.
<P>
     Renovations at the Richmond location are expected to begin early next year.  The new center will cost $34 million, and the company could invest another $5 million in nearby facilities, according to a memo from James to the Richmond City Council.  James would not confirm the figures in the memo, which was obtained by the Richmond-Times Dispatch.  Scheduled for completion in three years, the 240,000-square-foot facility will provide enough space for 400 scientists, says Carol Dornbush, Whitehall-Robins' director of public affairs.
<P>
     Product development at the company has been hampered because its basic formula research is conducted in New Jersey, while its advanced research is done in Richmond.  "We needed to have closer communications and interactions between the scientists," said Dornbush.  "A lot of things were factored into the decision to relocate to Richmond."
<P>
     For one thing, the Richmond site is more conducive to expansion, she said, and Richmond International Airport provides good air service to the company's headquarters in Madison, NJ.  The city also offers an excellent road network, a growing economic base, a high quality of life and low taxes, she said.
<P>
     Another factor was Richmond's efforts to extend the boundaries of an enterprise zone to include the Whitehall-Robins site, which qualifies the company for tax breaks.  Other advantages of being in an enterprise zone include $1,000 grants for each job filled by a resident of the zone.  The city was able to eliminate a rule that would have required Whitehall-Robins to have 50 percent of its operations within the zone's boundaries.  "The city's ability to customize the enterprise zone program was critical to the deal," said James.  "Without it, the investment and the jobs would have gone somewhere else."
<P>
     Virginia offered other inducements, including an undisclosed package of tax breaks and cash.  Also, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology</A> will co-sponsor the company's technology development efforts at <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/resources/universities.html">Virginia universities</A>.
<P>
     In announcing the deal, <A HREF="http://www.state.va.us/governor/gov.html">Gov. George Allen</A> said, "We are so appreciative and pleased that Whitehall-Robins recognized Virginia for its pro-technology, pro-business environment, and as the right place to expand its research and development functions."
<P>
     The Richmond site is only three miles from the <A HREF="http://views.vcu.edu/html/mcvhome.cgi">Medical College of Virginia</A> and the <A HREF="http://views.vcu.edu/html/biomede/vbrp.html">Virginia Biotechnology Research Park</A>, two major magnets for medical and pharmaceutical research.
<P>
     "This decision attests to Virginia's rising leadership as the <A HREF="http://intercom.virginia.edu/VA.technology.html">home to the world's top high technology and biotechnology companies</A>," Allen said.  "This investment bolsters the continuation of our Virginia Renaissance."

<H1>Virginia 19th in Funding for Science and Technology</H1>
<P>

A recently released report, Partnerships, a Compendium of State and
Federal Cooperative Technology Programs ranks Virginia 19th in per
capita spending on science and technology.  This compares to 14th for
Maryland, 4th for North Carolina and 11th for Pennsylvania.
<P>
The report, which covers CIT-like organizations in all 50 states, was
prepared by Battelle under the auspices of the State-Federal
Technology Partnership, a unique joint endeavor established in 1993 to
promote state-federal cooperation in science and technology.
Describing the development of cooperative technology programs, the
report notes that they "stem from two fundamental assumptions: there
are market failures in the development and application of technology,
and public-private technology partnerships create mechanisms that
can address those market failures."
<P>
In many states, nurturing strength (that is, existing companies and
capabilities) is also an important goal.  North Carolina pioneered the
application of science and technology for economic growth in the 1960s
by its investments in education and Research Triangle Park.  North
Carolina is considered a major success--new investments in the
billions, hundreds of thousands of new jobs, unemployment below the
national average.
<P>
In the early 1980s, a desire to emulate North Carolina and engage
higher education, along with the recession, sparked the formation of
most of the state cooperative technology programs.  (CIT was formed
in 1984.) By 1994, all 50 states had programs; annual expenditures are
$385 million in FY94.
<P>
To obtain a copy of this report, call 1-800-451-3543 or
614-424-6393. Copies are $39.95 each.

<H1>Virginia's First NICE3 Grant Awarded To CIT And Environmental
Solutions</H1>

Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology and Environmental
Solutions of Richmond, Virginia, recently won the state's first NICE3
grant.  Valued at $425,000, this project, Pallet Manufacturing Process
Utilizing Thermoplastic/Cellulose Composites Made From Recycled
Materials, will demonstrate a new technology and material by building
a $2 million facility capable of manufacturing 250,000 pallets per
year.  The thermoplastic/cellulose pallets will be made entirely of
waste peanut hulls and waste thermoplastic.  This facility will save
over 56 billion BTUs of energy, remove 6,250 tons of solid waste from
area landfills and reduce the number of trees required for pallet
manufacturing by 19,230 oak trees in its first year of operation.  The
wooden pallet industry is second only to construction in the use of
lumber in the U.S.<P>

The project is a joint development effort between Environmental
Solutions, Birdsong Peanuts, CIT and Virginia Tech.  The thermoplastic
material will be marketed by Environmental Solutions; the prototype
product will be tested at the Sardo Pallet and Container Research
Laboratory at Virginia Tech; and the plant will be located at Birdsong
Peanuts in Suffolk.  CIT will provide technical assistance and some
additional funding.<P>

This project is the result of many years of work between CIT,
Birdsong, Environmental Solutions and Virginia Tech including research
on the reuse of peanut hulls, the assistance of CIT in locating this
grant source for the project as well as preparation of the proposal.<P>

The National Industrial Competitiveness through Energy, Environment
and Economics program (NICE) is a Department of Energy program
designed to demonstrate new technologies that prevent industrial
pollution and produce benefits to the Nation's economy, environment
and energy use.<P>

<H1>Landmark Communications Develops "CareerWEB" for Internet</H1>
<P>

CareerWEB, spearheaded by its general manager, Christina Bublick,
launched May 1st; it is one of the most unique of a growing number of
ventures on the Internet, the rapidly global web of computer networks.
<P>
Bublick stated, "Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology has been
very helpful to CareerWEB.  The Center's expertise and services are
uniquely positioned to be of great assistance in bringing new products
to the market over the Internet."
<P>
Robert Harrell, Regional Director, has worked with Bublick to supply
technical commercialization data and support in bringing this new
technologically unique product to market on the information super
highway, Internet.
<P>
CareerWEB, developed by Landmark's Virginia-Pilot, will be an on-line,
"one-stop" employment service.  Internet users from around the world
who turn to CareerWEB's "home page" will be able to respond to job
listings, research employers and sign up for various
career-development services.
<P>
Employers and career-services companies will pay CareerWEB to
electronically post information about themselves--everything from
company histories to messages from company presidents, complete with
photos, maps, charts, voice messages and movies.
<P>
The electronic medium is just another stop in the whole evolutionary
process of matching people and jobs. Bublick has recruited a who's who
of employment (technical and human resource) experts to CareerWEB's
advisory team, including senior human resource executives at Motorola
Inc., Boeing, Bechtel Corporation and Northrop Grumman.
<P>
Another advisor and partner is Peter D. Weddle, chairman and chief
executive of McLean-based Job Bank USA, which describes itself as the
nation's largest electronic employment service.  Weddle said that his
company has more than 30,000 candidates on file and more than 2,000
employer clients.  Job Bank plans to profile its entire service on
CareerWEB.
<P>
"We're in an era of what I call warp-speed jobs," Weddle said, "which
means that probably people will go through 15 or 20 job changes in the
course of their lives."
<P>
Electronic services like his and CareerWEB's, he said, stand to
prosper in this rapidly changing environment.  Bublick said,
"CareerWEB on the Internet, partnering with Job Bank USA, will create
countless new jobs in Virginia and will help thousands locate jobs
worldwide through the new information super highway network."

<H1>CIT First To Measure Impact of Entire Program</H1>
<P>
David Osborne's 1993 book, <CITE><A HREF="http://www.ingrambook.com/TITLEWAVE/PRODUCT_INFO/TITLEANN/551196.html">Reinventing Government</A></CITE>, defined entrepreneurial government, including the need to measure results, not inputs and effectiveness, not efficiency.  Now, many state entities, particularly those in the science and technology sector, are embracing economic development performance measures.  The <A HREF="http://www.southern.org/">Southern Growth Policies Board</A> surveyed 31 state agencies in January 1995 and found that:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>States are giving serious attention to goal-setting.
<P>
<LI>A significant number of states have established measurable goals and objectives.
<P>
<LI>While many states still use output based measures, a sizable number are looking at  outcome based measures, such as impact and quality of services.
<P>
<LI>Client surveys are the most frequently used gauges.
<P>
<LI>States often compare results to goals; benchmarking against "best practices" of other states is also being done.
<P>
</OL>
<P>
     According to <A HREF="http://www.battelle.org/">Battelle</A> Memorial Institute, "Virginia is...the first state to examine the overall economic impact of its entire program portfolio.  CIT's effort serves as a national benchmark for further work in this area."<P>

<H1>CIT Provides Funding To Help Aurora Fly</H1>

As world concerns mount over issues such as ozone depletion and
greenhouse gases, the science community has required increased
performance, reliability, and cost effectiveness in the aerial
platforms used to carry its instruments into the atmosphere.  Aurora
Flight Sciences was founded in 1989 to produce a new class of
high-altitude, unmanned aircraft to support scientific research into
global climate change and meet the needs of the science community.
Since then, the Manassas company, with the help of Virginia's Center
for Innovative Technology, has successfully tested two classes of high
altitude aircraft, has designed prototypes for two additional aircraft
and has grown into a $10 million company with close to 100 employees.<P>

"CIT had been suggested early on when I first thought about starting
this company," said John Langford, president of Aurora.  "I met with
one of their directors and formed a partnership in which CIT
co-sponsored the research of the second aircraft."<P>

Perseus A, the first aircraft, is a robotic aircraft designed to study
the global climate.  Aurora won a NASA contract to further develop the
aircraft.  Soon after the contract award, the Department of Energy
expressed interest in developing a second class of aircraft that would
fly at a higher altitude and maintain greater endurance.  With the cost
to develop and build one aircraft in excess of $1.8 million, Aurora
turned to CIT for additional assistance.<P>

"This type of aircraft had been developed before; however, it was
only for military purposes and never for scientific purposes," said
Langford.  "Our costs were significantly lower."  CIT, in a special
agreement, loaned Aurora the $600,000 it needed to build their second
class of aircraft.  Last fall, the Perseus B, was successfully tested
and is currently scheduled to be leased by the Department of Energy
and Harvard University this fall.<P>

The Perseus aircraft allows scientists to gather more accurate data of
the global climate at a lower cost.  Scientific experiments are
currently conducted through satellites, located hundreds of miles away
from test sites and costing significantly more.  Unfortunately, Aurora
is not equipped to start leasing and selling their aircraft in large
volumes because only one prototype of each aircraft exists.  It is
Aurora's goal to acquire the capital it needs to begin manufacturing
more of their aircraft and lease them to scientists, universities
and national laboratories all over the world.  CIT will continue to
provide assistance in helping Aurora succeed in their quest.<P>

<H1>Growth Companies with University Ties Have Productivity Gains</H1>
<P>

A recent Cooper & Lybrand, LLP survey found that only four in ten
fast growth companies have ever availed themselves of college and
university resources, such as training and recruitment or
cooperative research and development.
<P>
But those growth companies that use university resources boost
productivity rates 59% higher than their peers without such
relationships, in terms of revenue per employee.  This active group
also had higher projected annual revenues (21 percent higher), more
recent bank loans (32 percent more), and more major capital
investments (23 percent more) planned in the next twelve months, the
survey found.
<P>
"It is unfortunate that less than half of America's growth companies
have developed these relationships, considering the substantial
university-related resources that are available to them," says George
Auxier, national director of entrepreneurial advisory services for
Coopers & Lybrand, LLP, the international professional services
firm.  "It is obvious that those which do become involved with the
academic world reap substantial benefits in increased productivity."
<P>
<B>Students and Faculty Prove to be Good Resources</B>
<P>
Growth companies with university relationships said they most
frequently use students as a resource: 70 percent hire student interns
for business projects and 40 percent recruit employees from the
student population.  It is interesting to note that more than
one-third of these growth companies send their own employees to nearby
universities for training.
<P>
More than four in ten (44 percent) said they employ faculty as
technical resources.  Smaller groups use faculty to help with business
planning (17 percent) and for assistance with manufacturing technology
(13 percent).
<P>
<B>For Some Firms, Relationships Become Collaborations</B>
<P>
A sizable number of growth companies have expanded their university
relationship beyond training and recruitment.  Twenty-nine
percent of firms with university ties are involved in cooperative
research and development, 20 percent use university laboratories or
equipment, and 5 percent license a specific technology from university
laboratories.
<P>
<B>CIT is Virginia's Resource for Making University Connections</B>
<P>
CIT exists to help companies in Virginia create jobs and companies and
to be more competitive by accessing the state's technology resources,
including the universities.  For more information about how CIT can
help your company increase its productivity, call your local CIT
office.

<H1>Small Business Technology Showcase</H1>
<P>
For the sixth year, CIT is sponsoring the Small Business Technology Showcase  in conjunction with the Century Club of <A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</A>.  This unique event will be held on May 29, 1996 at the McLean Hilton.
<P>
Showcase has grown out of the belief that the most effective way to assist small technology businesses with financing is to help them meet potential customers and strategic partners.  This is the idea behind Showcase's one-day-long trade show. Sixty small technology companies from the Mid-Atlantic area are chosen to exhibit and twenty-five large companies who are looking for partners, subcontractors, suppliers and, sometimes acquisitions, sponsor the event.  In addition, Showcase is open to the general public and is well attended by the Northern Virginia technology community.
<P>
     In past years, small companies have met venture capitalists, have ended up in long-term business partnerships with the company that was in the booth next to them, have met key decision makers from large companies they could not reach any other way, and have closed subcontracting deals on very large government contracts. 
<P>
     CIT is actively recruiting small technology companies to be exhibitors and welcomes large companies who wish to be sponsors.  For more information, contact your <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/reach/howto.html">regional director</A> at 1-800-3-TECHVA or call the Showcase hotline at (703) 277-7749.

<H1>CASRM Wins Federal Funds to Stem Ship Repair Toxics</H1>
<P>

A partnership between CIT, Old Dominion University, the City of
Norfolk and the South Tidewater Association of Ship Repairers (STASR)
has won a $1 million federal grant that will promote competitiveness
and environmental protection in Virginia's shipyards.  Projects are
already underway to improve techniques for removing paint from ship
hulls to solve the problem of stormwater run-off from dry docks, and
to reduce biofouling of shipboard cooling and firefighting systems.
<P>
These parties have formed the Center for Advanced Ship Repair and
Maintenance, Inc. (CASRM), a not-for-profit corporation that will
coordinate the development of new technologies critically needed by
this industry to attract a larger share of the world's 80,000 merchant
vessels to Hampton Roads.  To be competitive with yards in Singapore,
Greece, Korea, Germany and Bahrain, STASR's members must be able to
overcome higher labor costs and stringent environmental regulations
with higher productivity and better logistics.  CASRM will develop and
put in place ways to reduce the cost of ship repairs, and improve
the quality of services, while helping the yards meet environmental
standards.
<P>
The ship repair and maintenance industry is a major part of the
economy of the Hampton Roads region.  This industry has been in
operation on the banks of the Elizabeth River since the colonial
period, and is among the first established in Hampton Roads.  Some 115
companies, employing over 40,000 workers now make up STASR.  These
companies have an economic impact of nearly $400 million annually
to the Tidewater region.
<P>
The two-year grant from the Advanced Research Projects Agency of DoD
was matched with funds from CIT, significant in-kind contributions of
labor, equipment and facilities from STASR, and office space in
downtown Norfolk from the City.  Four additional years of federal
funding are optional to support this project, which is part of the
federal program to support defense conversion in industries affected
by downsizing of U.S. defense forces.  CASRM will also be searching
for additional funding and support, as well as other partners, so it
can expand its capabilities and speed up the implementation of newer
technologies.
<P>
Dr. Jack Heinemann, ClT's director of Energy and Envirotechnology and
CASRM Board Director, cites CASRM as, "The perfect example of how CIT
provides leadership in bringing together public and private
organizations to form strong, technology-based partnerships that
promote economic growth and competitiveness.
<P>
CASRM operates under a board of directors consisting of five shipyard
executives, and one from each of the other three partners.  An
executive director runs the day-to-day operations and a technical
steering committee guides the university researchers and shipyard
personnel as projects move from the laboratory to field testing in the
yards.  For more information, call Dr. Thomas Fox, CASRM's Executive
Director, at 804/622-2137.

<H1>CIT Supports Roanoke Incubator; New Business Resource</H1>

Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology recently awarded a
$200,000 grant to the City of Roanoke in support of the development
of a small business incubator.  The Incubator is a joint project of
the City of Roanoke and the Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce, and
is strongly supported by the business community in the form of
endorsements by the New Century Council Technology Committee, the
Roanoke County Board of Supervisors, the Fifth Planning District
Commission and the Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce Board of
Directors.  CIT's funding joins $200,000 from the Commonwealth of
Virginia, $60,000 in CBDG funds through the City of Roanoke and
$100,000 of private investment.<P>

CIT, through its entrepreneurship program, continues to support the
development of incubators and entrepreneurship centers because they
form the backbone of an entrepreneurial climate in the state that is
associated with high growth from the small, technology business
sector.<P>

The small business incubator will be furthered by a planning
committee which includes Gary Atkinson, Regional Director, CIT; John
Jennings, Blue Ridge SBDC; Hope Player, CPA; Phil Sparks, City of
Roanoke; and John Stroud, Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce.<P>

The small business incubator will join a network of other incubators
and entrepreneurship centers across the state either started by or
currently funded by CIT: Lynchburg Business Development Center,
Hampton Incubator, George Mason University Entrepreneurship Center,
Old Dominion University Entrepreneurial Center and the Virginia Tech
Business/Technology Center.  Incubators and entrepreneurship centers
help start-up and early stage businesses improve their chances of
long-term survival and success by providing business assistance and,
in some cases, office space and office services.  These programs are
part of a national network of over 750 similar programs around the
country and many others internationally.<P>

<H1>CIT & SpaceTec Partner with NASA in "MAPS-on-Mir"</H1>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HSPACE=15 VSPACE=1 SRC="./images/inn3.gif">
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.seva.net/bus/spacetec/spacetec.html">SpaceTec</A>, a small high technology aerospace engineering company in <a href="http://www.infi.net/pilot/community/">Hampton Roads, VA</A>, is gearing up to fly a commercial payload on the <A HREF="http://www.amdahl.com/internet/events/shuttle-mir.html">Russian Mir space station</A>.  The project is a partnership between <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.patc.org/">Peninsula Advanced Technology Center (PATC)</A>, <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">NASA</A> and the Hampton Roads Small Business Development Center at Thomas Nelson Community College.
<P>
     This project uses commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and software components in space experiments and other applications.  COTS, a new paradigm for space commerce, is designed to reduce the need to transform all laboratory set-ups into a space qualified payload - the traditional approach.  This commercial off-the-shelf system reduces overall cost of a space project by 50% and avoids additional costs associated with specialized development efforts, enhances scientific return by reducing the development time for space apparatus and provides greater access to space activities from commercial, academic and governmental entities.  
<P>
     "This experiment could have a tremendous impact on future space hardware development," said <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/jmjerke.html">John Jerke</A>, CIT's industry director for <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/industry/transport.html">aerospace and transportation</A>.
<P>
     <A HREF="http://www.seva.net/bus/spacetec/spacetec.html">SpaceTec</A>'s initial product using the COTS concept is a new engineering processing unit called the Technology Advanced Controller for the 21st century (TAC-21).  This product serves as a space laboratory for hardware and software used to acquire, store, process and transmit information from a space payload.  
<P>
     The device will be used as part of NASA's <A HREF="http://stormy.larc.nasa.gov/press.html">"Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellites" (MAPS)</A> experiment, a project <A HREF="http://www.seva.net/bus/spacetec/spacetec.html">SpaceTec</A> has been involved with since its inception.  <A HREF="http://stormy.larc.nasa.gov/press.html">MAPS</A> is a space-borne instrument that determines the concentration of carbon monoxide in the troposphere.  Managed by the <A HREF="http://www.larc.nasa.gov/">NASA-Langley Research Center</A>, <A HREF="http://stormy.larc.nasa.gov/press.html">MAPS</A> has already flown four times in space and is presently being reconfigured for this experiment.
<P>
     The uniqueness of this project was the tremendous amount of effort put forth by CIT, <A HREF="http://www.patc.org/">PATC</A> and the Small Business Development Center in a short span of time to meet the proposed June 1996 launch date.  <A HREF="http://www.seva.net/bus/spacetec/spacetec.html">SpaceTec</A> contacted CIT last August for its assistance when it first embraced this opportunity.  CIT contacted Bill Holloran at the Small Business Development Center and within one month, a business plan was developed and the partnership between NASA, PATC and CIT was finalized.
<P>
     CIT and NASA invested funds in the project and <A HREF="http://www.signet.com">Signet Bank</A> established an early line of credit to the company in order to get the project underway.  CIT's funds are being used to test and validate the COTS concept during project implementation.
<P>
     "This technology will demonstrate a new approach to spacecraft hardware development," said <A HREF="http://www.seva.net/bus/spacetec/stvjcc.html">Joe Casas</A>, chairman of the board for SpaceTec.  "The space industry is expected to experience significant growth over the next ten years.  There's already a market nationally and internationally for this type of system."
<P>
     <A HREF="http://www.seva.net/bus/spacetec/spacetec.html">SpaceTec</A> is currently in negotiations with <A HREF="http://solar.rtd.utk.edu/~jgreen/npoe.html">Energia</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.boeing.com/">Boeing Company</A> and <A HREF="http://www.honeywell.com/">Honeywell</A> to finalize the project.

<H1>CIT Helps Buoywear Float</H1>

Buoywear--an interesting idea that turned into a money-making
opportunity--is a unique flotation device for children.  Responding to
the need for flotation devices that could not be removed by their own
young children, three Virginia Beach entrepreneurs found a way to
incorporate soft flotation foam permanently inside a swimsuit and
zipped it up in the back so it could not be removed by a child.
Watching it work on their own three children aged 1 1/2 to 3, Buoywear
was born.<P>

Buoywear was created by Robert and Marise Michalochick, and Colleen
Damweber in the summer of 1991.  Together, they patented their product
and presented prototypes to the swimming marketplace but were
unsuccessful in getting their company off the ground.  The three
founders searched out Dennis Ackerman, Director of the Entrepreneurial
Center at Old Dominion University and Virginia's Center for Innovative
Technology Regional Director, Bob Harrell, to help them solve their
business and production problems and proceed with getting their
product to the market.<P>

CIT, with the help of the VA Tech Information Center, provided a
list of available swimsuit manufacturers and suppliers, then helped
comb the list until an established manufacturer of children's swimwear
and relatively inexpensive suppliers were located.  "After five years
of trying to jump start our company into a profitable business, CIT
came in and immediately assessed what we needed to do to become
successful.  Through their network, we were able to locate quality
manufacturers and suppliers," says Marise Michalochick, President of
Buoywear, Inc.<P>

With some of the building blocks in place, Buoywear is now moving
forward into the marketplace and has the potential to grow into a
multimillion dollar company in the next few years.  Buoywear is also
undergoing formal testing and listing for U.S. Coast Guard
approval. Having received preliminary approval, they will be the o~
flotation swimwear that is Coast Guard approved by Underwriter
Laboratories.<P>

CIT continues to help Buoywear locate better suppliers to improve
quality and consolidate with management to improve profitability. "CIT
will continue to be a part of our team," says Michalochick.  "There
are always resources that must be sought out, expertise provided and
knowledge shared. And we know where to begin to find the solutions we
need.<P>

<H2>Business plugs into electronic commerce</H2>
<H3>What are now on-line "fads" will become corporate essentials</H3>
<B>By Carolyn Hirschman - Staff Reporter</B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<CITE>Inquiring business people want to know:  What is "electronic commerce," 
and how can it help them?</CITE>  The phrase is ill-defined, even in the high-tech 
circles where it circulates.  More conceptual than concrete, the term 
encompasses a multitude of ways to conduct business in the information age.  
Electronic commerce includes emerging consumer trends such as on-line 
banking and shopping.  In business, it can mean publishing on-line journals, 
ordering supplies via e-mail and advertising on the Internet.  "It's all the
stuff a company would do normally, but it's doing it electronically," says 
Ronald Linehan, co-owner of Electric Press Inc., a Reston firm that helps 
companies develop an on-line presence.  Buying and selling products and 
services.  Providing customer support. Researching markets.  Getting sales 
leads.  Giving information.  Making contacts.  To perform these tasks,
companies are moving beyond such traditional methods as the telephone and 
mail to a new range of computer-based tools, including on-line services, 
CD-ROMs and video conferencing.  "Our region is well positioned to benefit 
from electronic commerce," says Nitin Pradhan, associate director of 
information technology at Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology, a 
state-run economic development center in Herndon. The D.C. area's 
concentration of info-tech companies and affluent consumers makes it a
perfect breeding ground.  The infrastructure for electronic commerce is 
small but growing.  The number of U.S. households with PCs at home grew 
from 22.7 million in 1994 to 27 million now, according to Forrester Research, 
Cambridge, mass.  That's still just 28 percent of all households. 
(Forrester had no figures for Washington, but many sources say that computer 
owner-ship here is higher than average.) In addition, about 7 percent
of on-line subscribers shop on-line, spending $350 million a year, Forrester 
says.  It predicts an astounding volume of $6.9 billion by the year 2000.  
The Web at work  Though the term electronic commerce is new, examples are all 
around - and, practitioners say, it works.  Life Technologies Inc., a $235.3 
million Gaithersburg company that sells supplies to biomedical researchers 
worldwide, saw sales of one product rise after starting a home page on the 
World Wide Web, the Internet's multimedia portion. Before, customers ordered 
custom-made DNA by typing or writing a string of as many as 60 letters 
and faxing it in.  Life Technologies verified the order by phone, "an endless 
process" prone to errors, says Lynn Kieffer, declining to reveal dollar 
figures.  "It's met and exceeded our expectations." Customers' "excellent" 
response to the new ordering system may stem from the fact that 
they are scientists already comfortable with the Internet, she adds.
"You have to be selective of your audience.  Our customers are already in 
a comfort zone."  Other local examples of electronic commerce at work: 
<P> 
<LI>The Fairfax Chamber of Commerce this week began selling a $250 software 
program for international-trade leads.  Developed by the International 
Business Exchange, a group of eight national companies and organizations, 
the program draws on a database of 8 million businesses in 20 countries.  
Users can post requests for partners or customers, then are notified of any 
matches via fax or e-mail.  Each transaction costs $10 or less.  The PC-based 
service, billed as a "virtual agent," isn't part of the Internet or an on-line 
service but uses AT&T mail to communicate securely.  Documents such as price 
lists and draft contracts can be sent around the world.
<P>
<LI>Government Technology Services Inc., which resells computer products to 
governments, in March became he first federal contractor to allow on-line 
ordering with credit cards.  Its "GTSI On-line" is an on-line catalog that 
links NASA, GTSI and product manufacturers by integrating the government's 
required electronic data interchange system with the Internet.  GTSI On-line 
allows daily price updates, 24-hour ordering and an all-around easier time, 
says Betty Green, civilian program manager at the Chantilly-based company.  
"We turn around orders within 24 hours.   Before, it was literally weeks," 
she adds.
<P>

<CITE>Fad or future? </CITE>Whether electronic commerce is a  rosy vision or a
business revolution remains to be seen.  Though there are fads - witness the 
craze about Web sites- the trend is here to stay and grow, experts say.  
But it must be done appropriately.  "Much of what's out there is a fad and 
will fail, but behind the scenes are sustainable models, " says Mario Marino, 
chairman of the Potomac Knowledgeway, which is working to link Northern 
Virginia businesses, government, residents and schools through a central 
Web site.  As with any strategic decision, a business must choose its 
electronic tools and methods carefully, considering what it's really trying 
to accomplish, he adds.  The CIT's Pradhan agrees, saying electronic commerce 
involves more than scanning print documents into a computer and posting them 
to the Internet.  Rather, businesses should take advantage of the Internet's 
interactivity to provide value-added services.  Mail-order catalogs weren't an 
instant hit when introduced 20 or 30 years ago, Pradhan notes.  Likewise, 
electronic commerce will take time to catch on - but he predicts it'll catch 
on big.  "It's going to go across all regions and industries," Pradhan says. 
"Companies need to get involved now.  You need to understand the culture and 
spend some money."  Some obstacles remain, namely, ensuring the privacy of 
data sent over the Internet and on-line services.  Though theft of credit-card
numbers isn't a problem now, fear of a new kind of consumer fraud keeps some 
home users from shopping and banking on-line.  In addition, consumers as 
well as businesses just have to get used to the whole idea.  Consumers are 
used to using their phone.  It's just starting to extend to the PC," says 
Robert L. Smith, executive director of the Interactive Services Association.

<H1>Southern Technology Council Report:<BR>Working With Start-Up Companies</H1>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.mcnc.org/HTML/ITD/NCSC/Seed/stc.html">The Southern Technology Council</A> has conducted a study of university technology transfer involving start-up companies.  The key findings are that several factors within the control of the university can improve their results. These include:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The conduct of academic research should be linked to the growth opportunities in the state and regional economies.
<P>
<LI>Economic development needs to have a prominent place in the university's mission.
<P>
<LI>University personnel policies should be as minimally restrictive as possible ... to enable greater faculty involvement with new ventures and with industry.
<P>
<LI>Universities should expand their support of and linkages to entrepreneurial business support systems. 
</OL>
<P>
     There are also some approaches that can be undertaken at the state level to improve performance in this area including expanding access to capital, providing funds for early stage technology development, and looking at conflict-of-interest laws to remove hindrances to technology transfer.  According to the Southern Technology Council,<P> <BLOCKQUOTE>
"As the most demonstrably successful in fostering start-ups, <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology (CIT)</A> functions as, in effect, a statewide business development organization focusing on technology-based enterprises.  It works closely with all of the major research universities in the state....A variety of services are provided in pursuit of its mission of 'jobs, companies and competitiveness.'  There is a strong emphasis on fostering Virginia-based commercialization of technology and a definite emphasis on start-ups."

<H1>Going Global: Virginia Businesses Team Up With Scotland</H1>
<P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT VSPACE=1 HSPACE=15 SRC="./images/inn6a.gif">
<A HREF="http://www.cit.org/">Virginia's Center for Innovative Technology</A>, in partnership with the Washington Airports Task Force and <A HREF="http://www.thebiz.co.uk/scottrad.htm">Scottish Trade International</A>, arranged for representatives from twelve Virginia businesses to travel to Scotland December 3 - 7, 1995 and participate in an extensive program of software demonstrations, networking seminars and industry briefings.  The goal was to create business opportunities between the high-tech industries in <A HREF="http://www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html">Scotland</A> and <A HREF="http://www.state.va.us/">Virginia</A>.<P>
<P>
     Scotland's Silicon Glen is one of Europe's high-tech centers and is home to many well known international companies which have manufacturing and development facilities in Scotland.  With over 400 software companies in Silicon Glen and an estimated 200 software development groups based at 13 universities, the software community numbers more than 20,000 employees!  Companies such as IBM, AT&T, Compaq, Adobe, HP, Motorola, National Semiconductors, British Telecom, as well as others are located in the Silicon Glen, a region between <A HREF="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/misc/uk/glasgow.html">Glasgow</A> and <A HREF="http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/misc/uk/edinburgh.html">Edinburgh</A>.
<P>
     The first mission of this nature was held in 1994 when representatives from more than 25 Scottish companies traveled to the US.  Prior to this, the Scots were unaware of the wealth of business opportunities in the growing <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/news/VAIsTechState.html">Silicon Dominion</A>.  "We've now put Virginia on their screen," said Lisa Smith, vice president of the Washington Airports Task Force and organizer of the mission.  "They now see Virginia as fertile ground for their business partnerships."
<P>
     The idea originated from a United Airlines need to keep the direct airline route to Glasgow.  "We figured stimulating business at each end of a non-stop flight would not only save the route but introduce new industries to each other and spur software growth and development in Virginia," said Smith.  Unfortunately, the United Airlines route did not survive but, based on surveys from the 1994 mission, more than $10 million of business was created on both sides of the Atlantic as a result of that four-day mission.
<P>
     "Expectations at the start of the mission were extremely low," said Smith.  "We only intended for each company to leave with 3 very strong business prospects and, as a delegation get a better insight into the Scottish software industry."
<P>
     "The real success was that we worked extremely hard to match their 25 companies with Virginia companies that would actually DO business and not just meet and talk," said <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/wtolle.html">Wolfgang T&ouml;lle</A>, CIT managing director for technology industry development.  
<P>
     Matchmaker, described as the "heart and soul" of this mission, was the company that laid the groundwork by reviewing the objectives of the participating companies and setting the business itineraries for each.
<P>
     Due to the tremendous success of the two missions, both countries are looking to maintain the momentum and make this an annual event.  Smith added, "All the key players are planning to do this continuously.  To the Scots, Virginia is right up there with <A HREF="http://www.silvalonline.com/">Silicon Valley</A> and the Boston Corridor."

<H1>WANTED:Business Plans</H1>
<P>
Are you looking for venture capital?  Would you like the opportunity to present directly to over 150 qualified investors at once? How about having your business plan reviewed by leading players in the local venture capital industry?
<P>
     By submitting your business plan to CIT, you will be considered to be one of 30 presenters at the 1996 Greater Washington Venture Capital Conference to be held in June, 1996.  This event, sponsored by Ernst & Young, CIT and the Century Club of <A HREF="http://www.gmu.edu/">George Mason University</A>, is one of the best forums on the East Coast for young companies.  Limited to technology ventures, the GWVCC is looking for exciting start-ups, fast growing early stage companies as well as second stage financing opportunities. 
<P>
     A committee made up of the sponsors and local venture capitalists screens the business plans and chooses the top 30 to present.  Ernst & Young organizes the conference and invites venture capitalists and other sources of capital from around the country.  The day-long conference includes the opportunity to have a display of your technology and to meet informally with the other participants.     
<P>
     If you would like to submit a plan, please contact your local <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/reach/howto.html">regional director</A> at 1-800-3 TECHVA or <A HREF="http://www.cit.org/people/csrenault.html">Cathy Renault</A> at (703) 689-3023.

District</I></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=5>W</font>elcome to Oswego
County!</P>

<P>    Whether you are a longtime resident, just visiting from cyberspace, or looking for a place
to locate your business, Oswego County government provides many services which help to
provide a high quality of life.</P>
<P>    Businesses are attracted to our community because of our ample water supply, reliable
electric energy, enterprising business climate, and well-trained and talented work force.  Oswego
County maintains two industrial parks and two economic development zones.  Our excellent
infrastructure includes well-maintained highways and an extensive road system, a county airport,
and a nationally recognized comprehensive solid waste management system.</P>
<P>    A variety of industries such as Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, Hammermill
International Papers, Nestle, General Foods, Alcan Aluminum Corporation, Sithe Energies, and
others are major employers in Oswego County.  Agriculture produces $56 million each year and
provides 7,000 jobs.</P>
<P>    If you enjoy your free time, Oswego County is the place to be.  World-class sport fishing,
lively festivals, auto racing, power boating and sailing, snowmobiling, museums, golf courses,
parks, cultural events, and many, many other attractions make Oswego County a sportsman's
paradise and a great place for a family vacation.</P>
<P>    Although Oswego County is a large county made up of many towns, villages and cities,
we think of it as a single community with excellent business, educational, and recreational
opportunities.</P>
<P>    On behalf of the Oswego County Legislature, it is my pleasure to welcome you, and
extend my sincerest wish that you will enjoy the high quality of life that the people, businesses,
and governments of Oswego County have established.</P>

<BR><P><B>The updates below are provided by volunteers who live and snowmobile in the areas described.</B></P>
<P><I>Oswego County was blanketed by lake effect snows Tuesday.  <BR><BR>In the Kasoag Lake area the conditions are very good for snowmobiling.  There is a good base of snow, with more falling, and the trails have been groomed.  <BR><BR>Near Williamstown there is over a foot of fluffy snow on the ground, and people are riding the trails.  <BR><BR>In the Pulaski area, most of the snow has packed down in to the mud and there are several wet areas on the trails.<BR><BR>
Much more snow is expected this weekend for Oswego County.</I></P>

<P>The weather forecast changes frequently in Oswego County because of Lake Ontario.  Therefore, you are encouraged to check the <A HREF="http://covis.atmos.uiuc.edu/covis/visualizer/fcst_text.html">National Weather Service Forecast*</A> frequently between the weekly updates on this page.

	<P>The Oswego County Health Department's immunization clinics did not use any of the flu vaccine being recalled by Parke-Davis, but some county residents may have received the recalled vaccine through other health care providers, according to Steven D. Rose, Commissioner of Human Services.
	<P>Commissioner Rose said 11 lots of the influenza virus vaccine, also called "Fluogen," were recalled by Parke-Davis in November because a component of the vaccine for the A/Nanchang strain of influenza has decreased in potency.  The recalled lot numbers are 00176P, 00276P, 00576P, 00586P, 00676P, 00686P, 00786P, 00886P, 00966P, and 00986P, and 01066P.
	<P>According to the New York State State Health Department, the safety of the vaccine is not in question, but the recalled vaccine may not be effective in preventing influenza, especially for people at high-risk, including people age 65 and over and people with asthma, cardiac disease, diabetes, immunosuppression, or other chronic illnesses. 
	<P>Anyone at high risk of getting the flu who received a flu shot containing the above lot numbers is advised to receive another flu shot.  The county health department will provide the flu shot free of charge to people who received a vaccine from one of recalled lots.
	<P>"If you received a flu shot from someone other than the county health department, and if you're not sure of the manufacturer and lot number of the vaccine you received, you should check with your health care provider to find out if the vaccine you received is effective," said Commissioner Rose.   "People who are at high risk of catching the flu, who received the recalled vaccine, should be re-immunized."
	<P>The County Health Department will provide flu and pneumonia shots until Dec. 31 at the following immunization clinics:
<UL>
<LI>Oswego: Dec. 20 and 27, 9 to 11:30 a.m. and 1 to 3:30 p.m., County Health Department, 70 Bunner St.
<LI>Fulton: Dec. 26, 9 to 11 a.m., Fulton Municipal Building, South First Street.
<LI>Hannibal: Dec. 27, 9 to 11 a.m., Town Hall, Auburn Street.
<LI>Pulaski: Dec. 20 and 27, 9 to 11 a.m., H. Douglas Barclay Courthouse, Jefferson Street.
</UL>
	<P>For more information about the flu vaccine or immunization clinics, call the Oswego County Health Department, weekdays, at 349-3547, 298-2233 or 1-800-596-3200, extension 3547.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="art.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=130 HEIGHT=191 VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7 ALT="Art Ospelt">Oswego County Administrator Arthur W. Ospelt will retire at the end of this year, bringing to a close three decades of public service to residents of the Town of Schroeppel and Oswego County.
	<P>Ospelt has served as Oswego County Administrator since 1990, and previously served as county superintendent of public works, chairman of the legislature, legislative majority leader, and town supervisor and legislator for the Town of Schroeppel.
	<P> As one might imagine, Ospelt has seen many changes in Oswego County. When he first took office as town supervisor in 1970, many of the services that today we take for granted were fragmented or non-existent. Each town had a local health officer, the towns were responsible for managing their own dumps, and there were no countywide mental health programs, youth services, or programs for the elderly.
	<P>Today, Oswego County is considered a leader among the nation for its comprehensive solid waste management system. Improvements have been made to infrastructure throughout the county, the county is actively involved in economic development efforts, including industrial parks and tourism promotion, and the county airport continues to grow.
	<P>"I was very fortunate and privileged as legislator and as public works superintendent to serve with a group of legislators who were progressive and willing to plan ahead to improve our quality of life," he said. "Our solid waste management system is functioning as it was designed. Oswego County is known throughout the state for its leadership. I'm tremendously proud of Oswego County and of the achievements we've made." 
	<P>As county administrator, Ospelt said the county has been able to improve government's efficiency, keep county property taxes down, and reduce county spending while continuing to provide quality services.
	<P>Ospelt credits his colleagues on the legislature and county department heads for the leadership they've shown, especially over the past few months when all county departments were directed to cut their budgets across the board.
	<P>What does the future hold?
	<P>Ospelt plans to continue to work his farm in Pennellville, and promises to stay involved in the community. 
	<P>He's very optimistic about the future of Oswego County, and supports the deputy county administrator, Jack Tierney, for his replacement as county administrator.
	<P>"Jack and the department heads share a progressive view of Oswego County and want to advance the county," he said. "They've made my job a lot easier."</P>

<CENTER><H3>Oswego County: Promoting Economic Development</H3><P><I>By Legislator Theodore Jerrett, 13th District, New Haven,
Chairman of the Oswego County Legislature</I></P></CENTER>
     <P><FONT SIZE=5>P</FONT>romoting "an environment conducive to economic development" is among the four primary
goals included in Oswego County's mission statement.  Oswego County government is working to
enhance economic opportunity in a number of ways.
     <P>One of the best ways to stimulate economic development is to reduce the cost of doing
business.  For the past five years, the Oswego County Legislature has lowered the property tax levy
a total of 22 percent.  This was accomplished by cutting spending and restructuring the county tax
system to include a broader revenue base.  
     <P>By cutting the total amount of taxes collected by county government, and by reducing
government's reliance on commercial and residential property taxes, the Legislature is working to
create an economic environment favorable to investment and growth.
     <P>Operation Oswego County (OOC), the county's designated economic development agency,
oversees the incentive programs of the county's two economic development zones (EDZs) and two
industrial parks.  These programs help local businesses expand and diversify.  OOC also promotes
Oswego County to prospective new industries.
     <P>As the old saying goes, the three most important keys to any business's success are "location,
location, and location."  Wouldn't you like to have a location in an area with major transportation
routes and a viable infrastructure, a location near abundant energy and resources, and a location near
population centers?  Oswego County is blessed with all three.
     <P>The Oswego County Department of Public Works maintains and develops an infrastructure
which makes our county competitive in attracting new businesses.  We maximize the benefits of our
location along Interstate 81 and state routes 481 and 104 by maintaining an excellent county
highway system.  Our solid waste management and recycling systems are widely acknowledged by
the solid waste industry as among the best in the nation.  By working to attract air freight services
and an aeronautical university to the county airport, we're striving to fulfill the airport's potential as
an economic development tool, as well.
     <P>Our waterways, including Lake Ontario, Oneida Lake, Oswego River, and Salmon River,
provide ample water supplies and hydropower for industry.  Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation,
Sithe Energies, and the New York Power Authority all produce abundant and reliable electric energy
for commercial and residential consumers.
     <P>Businesses large and small must have talented and well-trained workers to remain
competitive in today's markets.  County government works with local businesses to arrange
vocational and on-the-job training.  The County Office of Employment and Training was recognized
by "Enterprise" as being one of the nation's best worker assistance agencies.
     <P>Employment programs are not the only way county government seeks out the talent and
expertise of the business community.  Many business leaders serve on county advisory boards which
range in scope from tourism promotion and traffic safety to youth services and senior citizen
programs.
     <P>In 1995, 15 business leaders were asked to serve on the Goals 2000+ Task Force and review
county fiscal procedures and services.  The task force returned 14 recommendations they believed
would increase government efficiency over a five-year period.  
     <P>Oswego County government has begun implementing the task force recommendations,
including the adoption of a mission statement, merging county departments, improving the
budgeting process, and creating an intermunicipal council.
     <P>Oswego County is undertaking many projects which will
affect the economy and quality of life in Oswego County.  These include the Oswego County
Comprehensive Plan, Progress 2000+, promoting the county on the World Wide Web, the Jobs First
program, and improved emergency communications.
     <P>A successful business climate depends on a high quality of life for workers and residents just
as much as it does on other factors.  Perhaps no other industry illustrates this relationship better than
the tourism industry.  County government's tourism promotion program not only helps support a
$166 million industry which employs over 5,600 people year round, it also helps maintain high-
quality recreational opportunities for local residents and families.
     <P>As we approach the 21st century, new challenges will face the Oswego County business
community.  These challenges may come in the form of new technologies, competitive energy
markets, and other changing economic conditions.  Oswego County government is committed to
promoting an economic climate that will help local businesses turn these challenges into
opportunities for prosperity.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Platform: Unity in Diversity</H3></CENTER>

<P>The United States of America was founded and settled over 200 years ago by people with a dream. Their dream was to establish a country where "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" were considered inalienable rights for every human being.  Because of discrimination in their homelands, they came bringing concepts of morality, beauty, appropriate gender roles, sexual orientation and ideas concerning various ethnic groups. These concepts are still considered "the norm" upon which we base our opinions as to what is "normal."</P>
<P>However, in 1996 we are still discriminated against because of personal factors such as physical appearance, sexual preferences, ethnic background, mental capabilities and the like. The truth is, we are all human beings, fallible and vulnerable. We all, in some way or another, fall outside the pre-existing "norms," and thus we are all capable of being discriminated against.</P>
<P>To begin to address the problem of discrimination, we must acknowledge that these preconceptions are no longer relevant to our diverse society. This is the theoretical basis upon which my ADAPT (Accept a Diverse America by Promoting Togetherness) Program is based.  The next step is to help adults realize that they may not hold accurate opinions or relevant values about how society of the '90s really is.  The third step is to educate children that we are all different. Therefore, we must respect others for who they are and we must accept each other because we are all human beings. No one is better than anyone else, and we are all part of a great group of people known as the human race.</P>
<P>Finally, we must change those within our sphere of influence to become familiar with such groups as the National Association To Advance Fat Acceptance and the Anti-Defamation League, (in both of which I am personally involved) so that we can begin to break down the barriers that have kept us from being the,"one nation, under God, indivisible," that our founding fathers set out to create.</P> 

<CENTER><H3>ADAPT-ing To Improve the Quality Of Life in America</H3></CENTER>


<P>Each of us has been given special talents and gifts that we can use to improve the quality of life of others. Since there are so many wonderful organizations which work hard to help people improve their quality of life, I have spent countless hours volunteering for a number of organizations.   I have given time for the causes of: the Rome Developmental Center, Erie Canal Village; the Altar and Rosaq Society; senior citizen homes; pageants; school booster clubs; Parent Teacher Associations; SH modeling seminars; the Queen of Hope Pageant; the American Cancer Society; the Big Sisters program; the Children's Miracle Network and the Adopt a School program at my college.</P>
<P>Throughout my participation in these groups, one overriding desire remained: to break down the barriers of discrimination established by pre-existing "norms," which are irrelevant in today's society. In the 1990s, prejudices against people who are "different" because of physical appearance, gender role perceptions, sexual odentation, ethnic background and mental capabilities, to name a few, still exist. This is abhorrent to me. So I began a journey to educate myself about the diversity of the human race.</P>
<P> But simply educating myself was not enough to evoke a much-needed change in our society's attitudes. I realized I also needed to develop a program that educated others about the beauty of our diverse nation.   With this realization in mind, I conceived the idea of the ADAPT program.</P>
<P>My ADAPT (Accept a Diverse America by Promoting Togetherness) contains four essential parts.   In order for ADAPT to work, we must first realize that our generally accepted ideas about what is "normal" may no longer be relevant or accurate. We must analyze and re-evaluate these accepted norms concerning such things as physical appearance, sexual orientation, gender roles, ethnic background, mental capabilities and the like. Many of these concepts, generally accepted by our founding fathers, are used as the basis upon which our society still discriminates between "normal" and "abnormal."   Since our society has changed over the past 200 years, we must re-evaluate these norms and develop an attitude which accepts a more inclusive concept and promotes a better opinion of diversity.</P>
<P>Next, we need to educate the adults, who, in particular, work with or influence children. Certainly, parents and teachers are included in this category.   With my ADAPT program, I speak with this segment of the population to help adults redefine their values of what is acceptable with regard to diversity.</P>
<P>The third part of ADAPT is working with the children directly. I teach them about accepting and respecting others who may be different from themselves.</P>
<P>Finally, on a more general level, I encourage others to familiarize themselves with groups that fight for minority rights. In working on my ADAPT program, I have become familiar with the National Association To Advance Fat Acceptance and the Anti-Defamation League, in my pursuit of knowledge about diversity in America.</P>
<P>We are all human, imperfect, fallible and vulnerable. We are all capable of discriminating against others or being discriminated against. I developed, and am very proud of, my ADAPT program, because it has become an important tool for me to use in improving the quality of life for others by breaking down barriers and by promoting my belief in the idea of unity in diversity.</P>

<H3><I>Here are what the various images in the county emblem symbolize, in the words of Mrs. Schmidt...</I></H3>


<P>"In 1976, the Oswego County Legislature, as part of their participation in the Bicentennial Celebration sponsored a contest to create a logo to be used as the Oswego County seal.  I attempted to choose symbols that would represent the many aspects of our county.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="plow.gif" WIDTH=55 HEIGHT=35>The plow is emblematic of the importance of agriculture throughout our 22 towns including dairying, much farming, and the growing of fruit? vegetables and other crops. 

<P><IMG SRC="cap.gif" WIDTH=29 HEIGHT=24>The graduation cap symbolizes the high quality of all education in our county from programs such as Head Start and pre-schools through high school and in particular our widely acclaimed State University College at Oswego. 

<P><IMG SRC="boat.gif" WIDTH=81 HEIGHT=44>The sailboat and fish characterize the recreational pleasure derived by residents of the county from its ponds, stream, rivers, Oneida Lake and Lake Ontario. In addition, many businesses thrive due to the tourists who flock to our attractive county."</P>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="gen"></A>Oswego County: Trophy Fishing Capital of the
Northeast!</H2></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=6>A</FONT>nglers from all over the northeastern United States and Canada
are making the trek to Oswego County for its famed trophy fishing. With year-round fishing
opportunities, prize winning catches and a wide range of hot spots, the waters and tributaries of
eastern Great Lake Ontario are an irresistable lure for both veteran and novice anglers.</P>

    <P>Proof of Oswego County's world renowned reputation is evident by the large number of
New York State fishing licenses sold here every year -- we traditionally top the State' s 62
counties in the numbers of resident and non-resident fishing licenses issued.</P>

    <P>With several world and state record catches landed in the County, the number of anglers
drawn here throughout the season is not surprising. We have monster coho, chinook and
steelhead lurking in our waters, and you can call one of our dozens of skilled charter captains or
river guides for a truly remarkable fishing experience.</P>

<P>In the fall, Oswego County marks the return of salmon, when the fish journey up the rivers
and streams to spawn. The Salmon, Little Salmon and Oswego Rivers are all popular spots to
catch these runs of fish.  Feisty steelhead can also be found in these waters whenever the weather
turns warm -- in the spring and fall, as well as during winter thaws.</P>

<P>For exciting walleye fishing, fishermen don't have to look any further than Oneida Lake's
north shore in Oswego County. With more fish per acre than any other lake in the northeast, "The
Walleye Lake of New York State" provides anglers with stringers full of walleye, bass, perch
and crappie, on top of the over 50 additional species of fish.</P>

    <P>So, whether you are looking to pull pike through the ice in winter, fight bullhead by
lantern light in spring, or reel in panfish from shore, we' ve got the perfect spots for you.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=5>W</FONT>hen it comes to cross-country skiing, there's no better place than
Oswego County! The warm waters of Lake Ontario combine with cold
air masses from Canada to form lake effect snowfall -- giant snow-
making machine.

<P><IMG SRC="t-thon2.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=122 VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7 ALT="Tug Hill Tourathon">From the novice to the expert, thousands of skiers are challenged by
over 150 miles of trails. Some areas feature groomed trails, or skiers can
blaze their own trails in rural public areas such as parks and forests.

<P>Northern Oswego County is home to Winona State Forest and is part
of the Tug Hill Plateau. Because of its deep snow and elevation, the area
offers an outstanding ski season, lasting right through late spring.

<P>The Annual 50K Tug Hill Tourathon Race, which takes place at the
Tourathon Course in Boylston, highlights the skiing year and attracts
hundreds of racers from throughout the United States and Canada. With
three levels of participation, the event is popular among skiers of all
ages and skills, yet is challenging enough to satisfy the most accomplished
skier.

                                    
<P>The trail network consists of 31 miles of groomed trails. The course spans
rolling terrain of up to 2000 feet above sea level, and is well maintained
throughout the season. Skiers can access the course from the intersection
of Center and Wart Roads, off county Route 13 in Boylston. For more
information on the Tug Hill trail system, call the Tug Hill Tourathon
Office at (315) 387-5964.

several other cross country skiing areas, including:

<P><FONT SIZE=5>I</FONT>f you seek excitement, Oswego County's extensive trails are a
snowmobiler's delight.

<P><IMG SRC="snowmobl.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=152 HEIGHT=105 VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7 ALT="Snowmobiles">Oswego County has 278 miles of groomed and marked snowmobile
trails which access unlimited miles of trails throughout the Tug Hill and
Adirondack Park regions.



<P>The northeastern portion of Oswego County is part of the Tug Hill
plateau. With an average snowfall of 180 inches, this is a popular
destination for snowmobilers.

<P>Also popular is the Oneida Lake area in the southeastern portion of the
County, including the groomed 26-mile County Recreational Trail.

<P>Oswego County is home to eight organized snowmobile clubs. Six of
these clubs make up the Oswego County Snowmobile Association,
whose goal is to provide well-marked, mapped and groomed trails.
Clubs making up the Association include: Fulton Area Snow Travelers,
Kasoag Trailblazers, Panther Lake Prowlers, Pulaski/Boylston
Snowmobile Club, Redfield So & Rec Club and the Square Valley
Trailblazers. Club dues contribute to trail maintenance and members
receive trail maps. For more information, contact the Oswego County
Snowmobile Association at (315) 599-7762 or (315) 964-2561.

<P>Additionally, the Vanderbilt Snowmobile Club, phone (315) 623-7779,
serves members in the Constantia area, while the Upstate Regional
Snowmobile Association, phone (315) 964-2557, provides information
on snowmobiling throughout the County.

<P>Snowmobiles must be registered and insured while using public trails.
For safety reasons, snowmobilers should wear helmets at all times and
stay to the right of the trail. Unless otherwise posted, the trail speed
limit is 25 mph. Children under 16 years of age must take a snowmobile
safety course and receive a certificate of completion.

	<P>The Oswego County Department of Public Works division of Solid Waste has developed a unique composting program that saves money and provides residents with free compost.  The staff at the Bristol Hill landfill have created a composting recipe that uses 110,000 pounds of bean by-product from Grandma Brown's Beans Inc., in Mexico.
	<P>"Oswego County first proposed bean-waste recycling to Grandma Brown's Beans Inc., in the second half of 1992," recalls Jim Barker, maintenance manager at Grandma Brown's, who is responsible for trucking bean waste to the Bristol Hill site.
	<P>"From the outset, the idea appealed to the company for several reasons," according to Barker.  First, it eliminates tipping fees and results in a cost savings of several thousand dollars annually.  Second, recycling bean waste creates a useful byproduct.
	<P>"A cooperative relationship between the county and local industries has developed benefiting the local industries, the county, and the community," said Auralie Ashley-Marx, solid waste program coordinator.  "Grandma Brown's is one example of a local industry's continued commitment to recycle a significant portion of their waste stream."
	<P>"Grandma Brown's has worked with the county to make sure that the beans delivered to the composting site meet our requirements and do not contain undesirable materials such as plastics and metal cans," said Ashley-Marx.
	<P>An "active windrow" method was selected to compost the bean waste.  The composting program is a cost efficient way to handle the 50 to 55 tons of white-navy bean by-product produced by Grandma Brown's annually.
	<P>The county's active windrow uses a variety of waste products to make a usable product.  The method combines yard waste, food waste from Dean Food in Fulton, paper pulp from International Paper in Oswego, wood chips from county brush and tree waste, beans, and stable manure.
	<P>The waste materials are mixed with a front-end loader and then piled into a triangular bed approximately 10 feet in height.  Micro-organisms naturally found on these wastes use air, water and organic nutrients to break down the materials into a soil additive called compost.
	A 30-inch temperature probe is used to take the interior temperatures of the windrows regularly.  The windrow's temperature remains in the optimal composting range of 120 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit.  The final compost is cured, tested and screened before it is released for use as a soil additive on any type of crops.
	<P>"The county appreciates the spirit of cooperation shown by Grandma Brown's management and staff," said Mark Lichtenstein, deputy superintendent for solid waste.  "By diverting reusable, compostable waste, residents and industries are helping the county to prolong the active life of the Bristol Hill landfill."
	<P>"In 1996, the County released an estimated 600 tons of compost from the Bristol Hill landfill, helping to prolong the life of the facility, said Ashley Marx.  "The program benefits the community because not only does it save expensive landfill space, but residents are given the resulting compost free of charge for their use as a soil additive."
	<P>The county will have several batches of food and yard waste compost available at the Bristol Hill compost site free of charge in the spring of 1997.  To have your name put on a list to be notified when the compost will be released contact Bristol Hill, 592-2250.</P>

	<P>The New York State Assembly approved legislation Tuesday which allows the cities of Oswego and Fulton to keep their sales-tax revenues.
	<P>The 3 percent Oswego County sales tax was approved by the County Legislature last April and will take effect March 1.
	<P>The "home rule" legislation to allow Fulton and Oswego to retain their sales-tax revenue was sponsored in the Assembly by Assemblywoman Frances Sullivan.  The same bill was approved by the State Senate last spring.
	<P>The county will return a portion of the sales-tax revenues to each town in the county.  The amount each town receives will vary, depending on the population of the town.  According to estimates, Schroeppel, the most populated town, will receive $199,248, while Boylston, the least populated, will receive $9,883.
	<P>"The county legislature has kept its promise to the residents of Oswego County," said Legislature Chairman Ted Jerrett, 13th District, New Haven.  "No longer will the property owners of Oswego County be the only ones being forced to pay for services.  We've reduced the overall amount that government needs to operate, reduced the county property tax levy by 21%, and created a fairer tax system.   Everyone who uses county services, not just property owners, will now help pay for those services."</P>

	<P>The holiday season has traditionally been a time for gift giving.  This year, in the spirit of conservation and recycling, include Mother Nature on your gift list.
	<P>"Many people do not give a lot of thought to recycling and conservation during the holiday season," said Mark Lichtenstein, Director of the County Division of Solid Waste.  "By reusing items, buying recycled-content products, and recycling materials from the holidays, people can have an impact on reducing the tremendous amount of waste produced each year."
  	<P>Here are some tips developed by the Oswego County Division of Solid Waste:
<P><I>Reduce:</I>
<UL>
<LI>	  Use silverware, china, ceramic, glass and linens instead of paper and plastic for holiday parties.  If the number of guests exceeds the amount of available silverware and dishes, buy plastic ware (with recycled content) that can be saved and used again at next year's parties.
<LI>	  Remove your name from the mailing list of any catalog you no longer wish to receive.  To learn how, contact the Division of Solid Waste to receive a free "Eliminate Junk Mail!" brochure.
<LI>Reuse:
<LI>	  Wrap gifts in alternative wrapping paper, such as comics or colored newspaper, old maps, magazines, paper bags, aluminum foil, holiday fabric, or cloth napkins.  Reuse or recycle these items.
<LI>	  Put gifts in reusable gift bags or pre-decorated boxes, available in stores or easily made from colorful holiday fabrics.
<LI>	  Save wrapping paper, ribbons and bows to be reused the following year.
<LI>	  Donate good-as-new clothing or toys to holiday charity drives.
<LI>Recycle:
<LI>	  Corrugated cardboard (wavy layer inside) may be recycled at a county recycling drop-off center/transfer station.
<LI>	  Vegetable food scraps from holiday dinners and parties may be composted with yard trimmings in a backyard compost bin or can be brought to one of the county's compost sites.  Don't compost meat and bones.
<LI>	  Turn Christmas trees into wood chips.  Oswego County will accept Christmas trees for recycling at four of the five transfer stations after the holidays.  The Oswego transfer station does not accept any tree waste. Remove trimmings and as much tinsel as possible, so that the chips don't become contaminated.
<LI>	  Be sure to recycle glass, newspapers, and all other materials accepted in Oswego County's recycling program.
</UL>
<P><I>Tips for disposal:</I>
	<P>"The parties, presents, and celebration of the holidays create one of the busiest times of the year for waste disposal," said Lichtenstein.  "The amount of waste produced during the holiday season forces trash haulers to work overtime in order to serve all of their customers."  
<UL>
<LI>	  Traditional wrapping paper and greeting cards are not recyclable in Oswego County's recycling program.  Be sure to place traditional wrapping paper and greeting cards with your trash.
<LI>	  Plastic toys and polystyrene packaging (peanuts, etc.) aren't recyclable.  Rigid plastic containers, including bottles, jugs and tubs, are recyclable in Oswego County.

	<P>The Oswego International Speedway is receiving some well-deserved world wide attention in the December issue of "Open Wheel" magazine.  The monthly publication, distributed in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, contains a nine- page feature article about the speedway and the 1996 International Classic race.
	<P>Written by Bones Bourcier, the article focuses on Doug Didero, the winner of the 200-lap supermodified race and includes interviews with other racers who names are very familiar to Oswego race fans: Joe Gosek, Steve Gioia, and Eddie Bellinger. The full-color and black and white photos in the article are by Robin Hartford.
	<P>According to the article, the Oswego International Classic is "America's most prestigious supermodified event" and this year's event "may have been the most important Oswego Classic ever run" because of the new influence of the Indy Racing League (IRL).  The IRL is helping talented supermodified racers gain access to major league racing.  Drivers like Didero who win at Oswego get noticed by the IRL and may get a chance to compete in races such as the famous Indianapolis 500.
	<P>"Auto racing is one of Oswego County's major tourist attractions, bringing in over 200,000 visitors annually," said Cathy Pokines, director, County Department of Promotion and Tourism.  "It's great to see Oswego's International Classic Weekend get this widespread recognition."
	<P>Open Wheel magazine is published by General Media Automotive Group, Inc. of Palm Coast, Florida.</P>

	<P>The Oswego County Health Department's Emergency Medical Services (EMS) program will sponsor six emergency medical service courses in 1997, beginning with a basic emergency medical technician class in January.
	<P>In an effort to improve planning, provide equal access to training, and encourage the integration of services, all classes will be held at the Oswego County BOCES Complex on County Route 64 in Mexico.
	<P>The following courses will be offered in 1997:</P>
<UL>
<LI>	Basic Emergency Medical Technician Original/Refresher:  Starts Jan. 22.  Classes will be held Mondays and Wednesdays from 7 to 10 p.m.  Test will be June 19, 1997.
<LI>	Certified First Responder Original/Refresher: Starts Jan. 28.  Classes will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 10 p.m.  Test will be March 15, 1997.
<LI>	Basic Emergency Medical Technician Refresher: Starts Feb. 1.  Classes will meet Saturdays from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m.  Test will be April 17, 1997.
<LI>	Certified First Responder Original/Refresher:  Starts Sept. 8.  Classes will meet Mondays and Wednesdays from 7 to 10 p.m.  Exam will be Nov. 20, 1997.
<LI>	Basic Emergency Medical Technician Refresher:  Starts Sept. 9.  Classes will meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 10 p.m.  Test will be Nov. 20, 1997.
<LI>	Basic Emergency Medical Technician Original:  Starts Sept. 13, 1997.  Classes will meet Saturdays from 9 a.m. to noon and 1 to 4 p.m.  The test will be in February 1998.
</UL>
	<P>Candidates for the original basic emergency medical technician must be 18 years old.  Candidates for the original certified first responder must be 16 years old the month of the final written exam.
	<P>Refresher courses are designed for certified personnel whose cards will expire within the next year, or whose cards have already expired.  Anyone who has ever been assigned an EMT number may now re-certify through a refresher course.
	<P>Candidates cannot have been convicted of any crimes related to murder, manslaughter, assault, sexual abuse, theft, robbery, drug abuse, or the sale of drugs, or currently be under charges for any such crime.
	<P>The basic emergency medical technician course is approximately 132 hours of instruction, providing education in emergency medical technology for ambulance attendants.  The course covers all techniques of emergency care presently considered within the responsibilities of the emergency medical technician, as well as all operational aspects of the job.
	<P>The student must successfully pass CPR testing prior to admission to the state final practical skills examination.  Students will receive CPR training according to the American Heart Association guidelines for health care professionals.
	<P>The role of the first responder is to be the "first tier" of the EMS system and provide initial assessment and resuscitative care until basic life support or advanced life support arrives at the scene.  The first responder course is intended for individuals who provide short-term resuscitative care prior to the arrival of an ambulance, who do not have the need to prepare patients for transportation.  
	<P>The first responder course will be a minimum of 37 hours, but it is anticipated that the course will be close to 50 hours in order for students to become proficient in all course objectives.
	<P>In order to take the New York State final written exam for certified first responder or emergency medical technician certification, the student must pass all course requirements, have a class average of 70 or better, and have passed the final practical skills exam.
	<P>All candidates must register with the Oswego County EMS Program at least one week before the start of the course.  Registration forms are available at the Oswego County Health Department, 70 Bunner St., Oswego, and at local fire departments and ambulance corps. 
	<P>For more information about the Oswego County Health Department's emergency medical training courses, call the EMS program, Monday through Friday between 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m., at 349-3547 or 1-800-596-3200, extension 3547.</P>

	<P>Immunization records for thousands of Oswego County children are now available to parents, health care providers,  school nurses and public health agencies through the Central New York Immunization Information Registry System (CNYRISS), Steven Rose, Oswego County Commissioner of Human Services, announced today.
	<P>"The County Health Department was selected to participate in the registry system as a result of its superior performance in getting children immunized," said Commissioner Rose.  "Over the past three years, the number of Oswego County children who were immunized against childhood diseases by age two has increased from 52 percent to 87 percent.  This dramatic improvement is the result of the immunization action plan developed by the health department, and involves educational and promotional programs with local health care providers and a variety of community agencies.
	<P>"Routine immunizations against childhood diseases have proven to be the most effective means of improving the public's health," added Commissioner Rose.  "The biggest stumbling block to early and timely immunization of our children has been a lack of public education about the existence and serious nature of these preventable diseases."
	<P>The Oswego County Health Department provides immunizations against childhood diseases free of charge to Oswego County residents.  "The health department is determined to meet its goal for the Year 2000 of having 90 percent of the children in Oswego County fully immunized by their second birthday," said Commissioner Rose.
	<P>"It's extremely important that parents recognize the need for vaccinating their children in a timely manner, as well as maintaining up-to-date shot records," said Commissioner Rose.
	<P>The Central New York immunization information registry system is an easier and more efficient way for parents to access information about their children's immunizations, regardless of where in Oswego County they received their shots.  The registry provides a complete record for children in Oswego County and will offer the ability to retrieve information from other counties in the Central New York area.  As a result, families moving from one county to another will have access to their children's shot records.
	<P>The  registry is located at the Women's and Children's Health Research Center at Upstate University Hospital in Syracuse.  Oswego County was chosen to participate in a pilot program last winter.
	<P>"When a child is born in Oswego County, the child's immunization records are entered into the registry by our staff," said Anne Coniski, immunization program coordinator for the County Health Department.  "The registry saves parents' time, and makes it easier for parents to locate a child's immunization records and keep track of immunization requirements."
	<P>For information about concerning the registry or immunization clinics in your area, call the County Health Department weekdays at 349-3547 or 1-800-596-3200, extension 3547, or at 298-2233.</P>

             <P> Is turkey on your Thanksgiving menu?  According to the Oswego County Board of
Health, many food poisoning cases are reported around the holidays, due to improper storage or
preparation of turkey.  Here are some simple tips for safely handling and preparing turkey.
	<P>If you'll be cooking a fresh turkey, buy it one or two days before the day you'll cook and serve it.  Refrigerate it immediately, and check that your refrigerator is set at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.  Frozen turkey should be stored in a home freezer at zero degrees Fahrenheit or below.
	<P>The thawing time for a frozen turkey depends on the weight of the turkey and the method of thawing.  Never thaw frozen turkey at room temperature, because the warmer air temperature promotes growth of disease-causing bacteria.
	<P>"You might think that cooking destroys any disease-causing bacteria, but inadequate cooking is the main cause of  illness associated with roast turkey," said Steven D. Rose, Oswego County Commissioner of Human Services.
	<P>The safest way to thaw turkey is in the refrigerator, where a steady cold temperature is guaranteed.  Allow approximately 24 hours in the refrigerator for every five pounds of turkey. An 18-pound turkey, for example, will need three to four days in the refrigerator to thaw.  A frozen turkey can also be thawed in cold water.  Change the water every 30 minutes to keep it cold.  A 12-pound turkey takes around six hours to thaw in cold water, with large birds (20 to 24 pounds) taking around 12 hours.  Turkey thawed in the refrigerator or in cold water can be kept in the refrigerator for an additional one or two days. 
              <P>Microwave ovens can be used to thaw turkey, but they vary greatly in capacity and in cooking instructions.  If you use a microwave to thaw a turkey, it's important to follow
the manufacturer's instructions for the size of the turkey, minutes per pound, and power level
needed.  If you use the microwave to thaw your turkey, cook the turkey immediately after thawing.
	<P>Once thawed, remove the turkey's neck and giblet pieces, then wash the turkey inside and out with cold water.   If you're cooking the stuffing inside the turkey, remember that a stuffed turkey takes longer to cook.  The stuffing should be loosely placed inside the turkey.  Be sure to wash everything that comes into contact with the uncooked turkey  -- including hands, sink and utensils -- with hot, soapy water.
	<P>Turkey must be cooked at 325 degrees or higher.  The turkey meat and the stuffing must reach a minimum of 180 degrees Fahrenheit before being removed from the oven.  The juices should run clear.  While pop-up timers give some indication of doneness, it is recommended that the temperature be checked with a regular meat thermometer in several places.  Remove all stuffing, and let the turkey stand 20 minutes before serving.
	<P>Many people look forward to Thanksgiving leftovers.  Leftover turkey should be removed from the bone and refrigerated within two hours of cooking. Use leftover turkey or stuffing within three days, and leftover gravy within one or two days.
	<P>For more information about food safety, call the Oswego County Health
Department weekdays at 349-3545 or 1-800-596-3200, extension 3545, or call the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Meat and Poultry toll-free hotline at 1-800-535-4555, weekdays between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.</P>

	<P>During the past 14 months, teenagers participating in the Fulton/Oswego Corridor Community Service Program completed over 1,500 hours of community service work for public and private agencies.  The innovative community service program is administered by the Oswego County Probation Department.
	<P>"The goal of the program is to prevent at-risk students from ever becoming involved in the juvenile justice system by offering them opportunities to enhance their self-esteem and giving them positive reinforcement for their efforts," said Thomas Sarchioto, director of the County Probation Department. 
	<P>School officials identified students whom they feel need extra support and encouragement to stay in school and be productive citizens.  The program uses community service projects to help teenagers develop a sense of community responsibility and learn how to set and achieve positive goals through community service work.
	<P>Groups of up to ten youths from each school district participate in the program on a voluntary basis.  The youths, ages 13 to 16, work on community service projects while receiving a $3 per hour stipend.
	<P>The Fulton recreation department has utilized program members for projects at the War Memorial, CV Abbot Park, Recreation Park, Van Buren Park, North Bay, the West Side Pool, and City Hall.  
	<P>"It's a great program for everyone involved," said Barry Ostrander, superintendent of the Fulton Recreation Department.  "The program members work directly in the community."  
	<P>The Oswego Department of Parks, Recreation, and Waterways has used program members for projects at Fort Ontario, Breitbeck Park, West Side Linear Park, Legends Softball Complex, city ice rinks, and Gallagher Pool.
	<P>"The program benefits both the kids and our department," said Greg Neal, superintendent of parks, recreation, and waterways.  "The members develop a sense of ownership in their community and the recreation department benefits from the work that they do." 
	<P>Participants also assisted the Salvation Army during the holiday season, shoveled snow for seniors, stocked shelves at the Oswego Human Concerns Center, moved books at the Fulton Library, and helped elderly residents with yard cleanup.
	<P>"As a group, we have accomplished a great deal in a short period of time," said David Fern, youth services specialist.  "We are just scratching the surface of the impact these kids will have in the communities of Oswego and Fulton as we continue to grow."
	<P>The students attend weekly meetings to discuss a variety of topics including employment skills, drug and alcohol abuse, and anger management.  The meetings are led by professionals from a variety of human service agencies, local businesses and Fern.
	<P>The Probation Department received a $43,202 federal grant to administer the program.  The grant will fund the project for one year and can be renewed for up to two more years.
	<P>"If the program is to last longer than three years it must be successful and the communities must take ownership of it and fund it," said Barbara Mentry, deputy director.
	<P>According to Fern, the program is already receiving significant community support.  Money and materials have been donated by Agway; Cam's New York Pizzeria, Inc.; Fay's Foundation; Howard's Office Supply; Neal-O'Brien Building and Materials Corp.; Nestle Company, Inc.; Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation; Price Chopper Discount Foods; Raby's Ace Home Center; Syracuse University; Tops Friendly Markets; and Wal-mart.
	<P>By helping teenagers stay in school, the Probation Department is hoping to save public assistance money in the future, as well as guide youths into productive adulthood.
	<P>Organizations interested in participating in the community service program should contact Fern, weekdays, phone 349-3477.</P>

	<P>The Oswego County Tourism Advisory Council recently honored Sanford "Sandy" Resnick as an Oswego County Tourism Ambassador.  The award recognizes individuals for their extraordinary support and commitment of time and energy to the Oswego County tourism industry.
	<P>"It is an honor to have been selected by my peers to receive this prestigious award," said Resnick.  "The tourism resources we have in Oswego County are exceptional and abundant. I have enjoyed sharing information about them with our residents and visitors alike."
	Resnick, originally from Pittsburgh, Pa., played an instrumental role in the development of the county's tourism industry.  In 1985, Resnick became the director of the Greater Oswego Chamber of Commerce.  As director, he initiated the development of a county-wide tourism marketing strategy.
	<P>"Sandy's hard work and commitment laid the foundation for Oswego County's tourism industry to build upon," said Donald Feck, chairman of the Tourism Advisory Council.
	<P>When the Oswego County Legislature created the Department of Promotion and Tourism in 1989, Resnick was hired as the department's first director.  He continued to lead and expand the promotion of Oswego County's tourism industry until 1992.
	<P>"Sandy was an integral part of the early development of Oswego County's tourism industry," said Cathy Pokines, director of the Oswego County Promotion and Tourism Department.  "Sandy's efforts and dedication allowed for tourism in the county to be the economic force that it is." 
	<P>Resnick is currently the director of Conferences and Institutes for SUNY Oswego. He also co-owns and operates Gateway Boat Rides Inc., located on the historic Oswego River.  He serves on the board of directors of the H. Lee White Marine Museum, the Safe Haven Museum, and is a member of the Oswego Hospital Community Development Committee.</P>

	<P>The New York State Health Department notified Oswego County Health Department officials today that the Park-Davis Division of the Warner-Lambert Company has voluntarily recalled four lots of its influenza virus vaccine, also called Fluogen.
	<P>According to Commissioner of Human Services Steven Rose, the flu vaccine used at Oswego County Health Department clinics did not include any of the recalled vaccine.
	<P>The vaccine lots are being recalled as a precautionary measure because a component of the vaccine has decreased in potency.  According to the State Health Department, the safety of the vaccine is not in question.
	<P>The federal Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that persons who received the affected vaccine, or any other influenza vaccine, do not need to be re-immunized.
	<P>The recalled lot numbers are 00576P, 00786P, 00966P, and 00686P.  Park-Davis has directed the distributors, clinics, and physicians who received these lot numbers to stop using the vaccine and return any unused product to the company.</P>

	<P>The annual salmon run brings thousands of fish and anglers to Oswego County.  As a result, it is essential to have an efficient way to dispose of fish carcasses.  Approximately 355 to 450 tons of fish waste must be disposed of in Oswego County each year.
	<P>Prior to 1991, all fish wastes were either disposed of at the Bristol Hill Landfill in Volney, the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) disposal site in Altmar, or discarded improperly along roadsides or on public and private property.
	<P>The Oswego County Division of Solid Waste began a large-scale fish composting project in 1991 to better manage fish waste.  Last year, 305 tons of fish waste were composted.
	<P>The process used to compost fish waste is called the "static windrow method." This method is designed to handle large amounts of fish waste, including odors and leachate.
	<P>The county's static windrow method creates a usable compost product by combining fish waste with paper pulp obtained from International Paper in Oswego and brush and tree waste collected at Oswego County's five regional transfer stations.
	<P>"The static windrow fish composting method benefits local industries, the county, and the community," said Auralie Ashley-Marx, solid waste program coordinator.  "Local industries are able to divert useable wastes from the landfill, saving them money in tipping fees.
	<P>"In 1995, the county diverted 1,485 tons of material from the Bristol Hill Landfill, helping to prolong the life of the site.  The community benefits because residents are given the resulting compost free of charge."	
	<P>This fall, Selkirk State Park also started to compost fish waste.  Park Manager Dan Davis and county solid waste officials worked together to obtain a DEC research and development permit to develop the park's composting program.
	<P>"The park generates a large quantity of garbage contaminated with fish waste which is subsequently rejected by the Pulaski transfer station," said Davis.  "We needed to implement an efficient system for the handling of fish waste.  
	<P>"The composting program has saved the park time and money, in addition to providing environmental benefits.  We use wood chips and fish waste generated at the park to create  finished compost used in the park."
	<P>The static windrow method is an adaptation of a process originally developed at Cornell University.  Fibrous paper pulp is premixed with wood chips at a ratio of 1 to 1.  The resulting bulking agent mixture is then mixed with fish waste at a rate of approximately 3 to 1.  This process is continually repeated to form a triangular compost bed approximately 10 feet in height.
	<P>A 30-inch temperature probe is used to take the interior temperatures of the windrows on a daily basis for the first 30 days.  The windrow's temperature remains in the optimal composting range of 120-145 degrees fahrenheit.  The final compost is cured, tested and screened before being released for use as a soil additive for non-food crops.</P>

	<P>The Oswego County Department of Planning and Community Development and Seaway Trail, Inc. are co-sponsoring a public meeting about the Sandy Island Beach Feasibility Study, Tuesday, Nov. 12, 7 p.m. at the Sandy Creek Town Hall, County Route 15, one-quarter mile east of Interstate 81.
	<P>"This meeting is an opportunity for the public to find out about the possibility of developing Sandy Island Beach as a public park," said Edward Marx, director, Department of Planning and Community Development.  "The results of the feasibility study will be presented at the meeting."
	<P>Seaway Trail, Inc., in cooperation with the county Department of Planning and Community Development, received a federal grant to determine the potential use of Sandy Island Beach as a public park.  The study examines the feasibility of public acquisition of the property, the potential of developing the property for recreational use, and possible sources of funding for purchasing the land and operating the park.
	  <P>Sandy Island Beach, owned by the Riggs Estate, is a natural sand beach located in Sandy Pond at the end of County Route 15 between North Pond and South Pond.  The 143-acre property consists of 24 acres of upland and 119 acres of aquatic lands.
	<P>"It may be the last piece of Lake Ontario shoreline in Oswego County suitable for development into a public beach," said Marx.  "Oswego County has approximately 44 miles of Lake Ontario shoreline.  Yet, Selkirk Shores State Park and Mexico Point are the only public beaches where local residents and tourists can go to the lake for swimming and recreation."
	<P>For more information, contact the Department of Planning and Community Development, weekdays, phone 349-8292, or 1-800-596-3200, extension 8292.</P>

<P>To the Editor: 


     <P>Christmas and children share a magical relationship - it's a joy to see their eyes light up when they see a tree and gifts. Some children are not as lucky as others and that magic doesn't happen for them without your help. 
     <P>These are the children that are reached by the Children's Christmas Fund. Each year we try to serve as many as possible but this depends on the generosity of many caring people. 
    <P> At this time we ask you to become one of those caring persons and help us provide some magic for these children. Any contributions would be greatly appreciated, and as early as possible as we cannot shop for Santa until we have an idea of funds available. 
     <P>If you would like to share in the MAGIC OF CHRISTMAS, please make checks payable to: "Children's Fund" and send to:</P> <ADDRESS>Mrs. Connie Day, Coordinator Children's Christmas Fund<BR>Oswego County Department of Social Services<BR>100 Spring Street<BR>Mexico, NY 13114</ADDRESS> 

     <P>MAY YOUR HOLIDAYS BE MAGICAL, JOYOUS, AND REWARDING!!!!</P>

<P>Sincerely,<BR>
Steven D. Rose<BR>
Commissioner<BR>

</H3></CENTER>



      <P>The Oswego County Board of Health would like to warn all residents of the possible danger side air bags present to babies under 20 lbs. 
      <P>Air bags are designed to provide extra protection to properly belted adults in frontal collisions. A frontal collision over 12 MPH will cause an air bag to inflate in 1/10 of a second at a speed of approximately 200 MPH. As an air bag inflates, it can collide with the back of a rear-facing safety seat with enough force to cause serious or fatal injury to a baby.
       <P>According to the Oswego County Board of Health, the rear center seating position is the safest place for children to ride. The Board of Health also urges everyone to read the child safety instructions and vehicle owner's manual before installing a safety seat in your vehicle. Recent studies show that as high as 90% of child safety seats are used incorrectly.
       <P>If you have any questions concerning the use and installation of child safety seats, contact the Oswego County Health Department, at 349-3547, or the Auto Safety Hotline, 1-800-424-9292. </P>

	<P>Oswego County residents are reminded to continue using the 7-digit telephone numbers listed in the front of the telephone directory when calling local fire, ambulance or police services for emergency assistance.
	<P>"Many residents assume that the new 911 emergency dispatch system is now operational, because they have received their new 911 address.  The system is still being developed and is not operational," said Robert Hayes, 911 Director for Oswego County.
	<P>At its March meeting, the Oswego County Legislature passed a local law requiring all residents in the county to have their new 911 address number prominently placed on their residence or business structure.
	<P>"The Legislature recognized that timely and appropriate emergency assistance is imperative to the health, safety and welfare of Oswego County residents," said Stephen Balcolm, Chairman of the Oswego County Legislature's Fire and Emergency Management Committee.  "The passage of the 911 law is for the benefit of all Oswego County residents." 
      <P>The County 911 office assigned an arabic number to all existing residences and structures in Oswego County.  "We want to be sure that when an emergency vehicle such as police, fire department, or ambulance is called, they are able to locate you quickly," said Hayes.
	<P>The 911 enumeration law requires that all Oswego County residents have their new 911 address prominently placed on the front of their residence or business structure.
	<P>In order to ensure residents safety, the 911 number must be displayed adhering to the following guidelines:
 	<P>The assigned 911 number must be at least 3 inches in height, and be in contrasting color 	to the structure it is placed on;   
 	<P>The number must be displayed in such a manner that is visible from the adjacent public road or highway; and 
 	<P>The number must be placed without obstruction from other objects and wherever possible be placed near illumination, so that it may be seen at night.
	<P>In the event that a structure is more than 75 feet away from the public road or right of way, the 911 number must be visibly displayed on a sign, post, or mail box no further than 25 feet from the road or right of way.
	<P>Upon notification of a number, an owner has 30 days to comply to the 911 law and regulations.  Failure to comply with this law could result in the owner of the structure being deemed in violation of the local law and could result in a fine of $250 per month.  
	<P>The 911 program reports to the Oswego County Legislature's Fire and Emergency Management Committee.  In addition to Legislator Balcom, members are Bruce Bisbo, 6th District; Earl Chesbro, 12th District; Russ Johnson, 25th District; Clyde Osborne, 11th District; and Don Wahrendorf, 19th District. 
	<P>If you have any question concerning your 911 address or the 911 enumeration law, contact the Oswego County 911 office at 349-8227, or 1-800-679-3911. </P>

</H3></CENTER>



	
	<P>The week of Oct. 20 through Oct. 26 is National Adult Immunization Awareness Week, and the Oswego County Health Department reminds residents that immunizations are just as important for adults as they are for kids.
	<P>"Just last month there was a case of 'lockjaw' or tetanus in a neighboring county," said Commissioner of Human Services Steven Rose. "This should serve as a reminder
that adults need to be protected from preventable diseases such as influenza,
pneumococcal pneumonia, tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella.  These diseases are all preventable with the proper immunizations."
	<P>"Many people believe childhood immunizations have eliminated preventable diseases," noted Commissioner Rose. "But this isn't true. In 1994, 40 percent of all reported measles cases and 50 percent of all rubella cases in New York State occurred in adults 20 years of age or older. Why? Because too many adults are not irnmunized."
	<P>According to a recent Center for Disease Control and Prevention survey, only half of
all adults had a tetanus shot in the last 10 years, the recommended interval.
	<P>Dr. James Grant, Medical Director for the Oswego County Health Department,
reviewed the requirements and the serious effects childhood diseases can have on un-immunized adults:
	<P><B>Measles:</B>   In 1994, 40 percent of all cases occurred in people aged 20 and older.
Measles during pregnancy results in a higher risk of premature birth or miscarriage. Two
doses of measles vaccine generally provide lifelong protection. Most often, the vaccine
given is a combination measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.  College students and
most health care workers born after Jan. 1, 1957, are required by law to have two doses of
measles vaccine and one dose each of mumps and rubella vaccine.
	<P><B>Mumps:</B>  In 1994, 33 percent of all mumps cases in New York State occurred in people aged 20 and older. Complications include central nervous system involvement in 15 percent of
cases; in males, 20 to 50 percent of cases can be complicated by orchitis (testicular
inflammation).
	<P><B>Rubella:</B> In 1994, 57 percent of cases occurred in people aged 20 and older. This
disease is most serious in pregnant women and may result in serious birth defects or fetal
death.
	<P><B>Tetanus and diphtheria:</B>  Tetanus, or "lockjaw," is fatal in about 40 percent of all cases.  For un-immunized older adults, the chances of surviving are 50-50.  The number of tetanus cases has been declining.  In 1992, only four tetanus cases were reported, all in people aged 20 and older.
	<P>Diphtheria kills one out of 10 people infected.  Adults should be vaccinated with a Td shot - a combination vaccine that protects against tetanus and diphtheria - every 10 years.
	<P><B>Pneumococcal disease:</B> The pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for
adults, age 65 and older, and for people with chronic illnesses. The vaccine is usually
needed only once in your life, and can be given at the same time as the annual influenza
shot without an increase of side effects.
	<P><B>Influenza:</B> The influenza vaccine is recommended every October, before flu season
starts, for those age 65 and older, and for people who have diabetes; chronic diseases of
the heart, lungs or kidneys; chronic anemia; or diseases that interfere with the body's
immune system, such as leukemia. The vaccine is covered by Medicare.
	<P><B>Polio:</B>  Adult immunization is usually NOT recommended, unless a person is traveling
to a part of the world where polio is still common.
	<P><B>Hepatitis B:</B>  The vaccine is recommended for health care workers who are at
increased risk for needle-stick exposures; clients and staff of institutions for the
developmentally disabled; hemodialysis patients; sexually active homosexual men; users of
illicit injectable drugs; recipients of certain blood products; household members and
sexual contacts of HBV (hepatitis B virus) carriers; infants born to HBV-positive
mothers; and special high-risk populations.
	<P>"Adults can avoid contracting these serious diseases by getting timely and appropriate vaccinations," said Dr. Grant.
	<P>The Oswego County Health Department provides immunizations at nine sites throughout the county:  Central Square, Constantia, Fulton, Hannibal, Mexico, Oswego, Phoenix, Pulaski and West Monroe.  For more information about immunizations and where to get them, call the Oswego County health department, weekdays, at 349-3547 or 298-2233. </P>

 <P>The 1997 county budget approved by the Oswego County Legislature cuts government spending by over $7 million and lowers the property tax levy by 21.4 percent.
     <P>"The 1997 budget reflects our goals of fairer taxes and less government spending," said Legislature Chairman Theodore Jerrett. "Property owners gain relief from the unbalanced tax burden they've carried for so long. With this budget, government needs less money from the community, allowing for more investment and growth in the economy. In collecting the smaller amount that is needed for such things as roads and public safety, everyone is treated more equally."
     <P><IMG SRC="prop1.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=437 HEIGHT=301 VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7 ALT="Chart showing restructured tax system">The property tax reduction was achieved three ways. The Legislature made 5 percent across-the-board cuts in county departments and community agencies that receive county funds. Approximately $9.3 million from the unappropriated fund balance was applied to the tax levy. Thirteen percent of the property tax levy was replaced by the 3 percent county sales tax, which will take effect in March.
    <P> "By cutting spending, we reduced the overall tax burden by $5.2 million," said Legislator Herbert Van Schaack, 20th District, Oswego Town, chairman of the Legislature's Ways, Means, and Budget Committee. "The county will collect fewer taxes next year than it has since 1991."
    <P>Other members of the Ways, Means, and Budget Committee include Legislators Floyd Boynton, 22nd District, Fulton; Clayton Brewer, 24th District, Fulton; James Bryant, 5th District, Constantia; James McMahon, 9th District, Hastings; and Donald Wart, 4th District, Parish.
     <P>Towns will share the benefits of the county sales tax. Town governments will receive 20 percent of the first $10 million collected in sales tax, and 10 percent of any revenue above $10 million.
     <P>"We encourage town governments to follow our lead and use their portion of the sales tax to reduce town property taxes," said Legislator Jerrett. "Property owners need relief at all levels. Combining our efforts to provide immediate tax relief is one of the most important things we can do for people."
     <P>Next year's total county budget appropriation is down to $131.4 million. $48.5 million will come from property taxes, $8 million from the sales tax, and the remainder from state and federal aid, grants, and fees for services.
<H3>Fairer Tax System</H3>
     <P>The 1997 county budget shows a dramatic change in the county's revenue structure. In 1991, property tax accounted for 51 percent of the county's total revenue. In 1997, it will drop to just 36 percent.
    <P> "For decades, people have complained about the inequities of property taxes and cried out for real change. What we've done is created a fairer tax system. Everyone who uses county services will help pay for these services," said Legislature Chairman Jerrett. "By using the sales tax to replace part of the property tax levy, we begin to move away from the biggest problem with property taxes: that they're not related to either your use of government services or your ability to pay."
    <P>Since January 1995, the county has had to claim and re-sell over 200 tax-delinquent properties. Changes to the tax structure have been a gradual process. 
    <P> In Oswego County, local industry has traditionally paid the bulk of county property taxes, helping to keep taxes lower for residents and small businesses. But this situation is rapidly changing because many companies are challenging their tax assessments. 
	<P>The county is facing over 50 legal challenges to property assessments, and Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, the county's largest taxpayer, is seeking a 50 percent reduction in the assessed value of its properties.
    <P> "The handwriting is on the wall," said Legislator Van Schaack. "Cutting spending is important, but it is only part of the solution. As industry pays less and less, more and more of the tax burden is being shifted onto small businesses and homeowners. The outlook for property owners was grim, even with major cuts in county spending.
   <P> "We had to make fundamental changes in how we raise revenue, in order to prevent property taxes from skyrocketing out of sight. 
	<P>"The best solution was to cut county spending and end our over-reliance on property tax by establishing an alternate source of revenue that is fairer toward taxpayers," he noted.
<H3>Less Government Spending</H3>
   <P>"Across the board budget cuts will affect how some county services are provided," said County Administrator Arthur Ospelt. "For example, the Highway Division budget was cut approximately $450,000. This will slow down some aspects of highway maintenance."
     <P>"We've also saved millions by continuing our efforts to make government more efficient and cost effective," he noted.
     <P>The Department of Social Services (DSS) cut its budget by $2.8 million. Part of this savings is the result of DSS being restructured under the "Jobs First" concept, which is designed to reduce the number of people on public assistance by placing priority on helping them find and keep jobs. Since 1995, the cost to county taxpayers for DSS programs dropped $4 million.
     <P>The net county cost of solid waste and recycling programs has been reduced from $2.4 million in 1994, to $1.3 million in 1997. This savings has been achieved by increasing revenues from other sources and cutting back on overtime hours.
    <P>"These reductions were not achieved easily," said County Budget Officer Douglas Hartranft. "Although this is the first year that all departments have been cut, it is not the first year of reductions in county government. 			
<P><IMG SRC="prop2.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=354 HEIGHT=212 VSPACE=7 HSPACE=7 ALT="CPI vs. Property Tax Levy">"Our goal of stabilizing and reducing the tax levy dates back to the early 1990s. Since 1992, the county property tax levy has been cut a total of 18.5 percent, even though the consumer price index has risen about 13 percent.
     <P>"The 1997 budget is clearly the result of Oswego County's commitment to smaller, more efficient, and less costly government," said Hartranft.</P>

     <P>The 1990s have been a decade of change in county government. From reorganizing the Legislature, to restructuring the tax system, Oswego County is making changes and reforms designed to make government more efficient, cost-effective, and less dependent on taxes.
    <P>"The redistricting of the County Legislature in 1993 and the prospect of a future with a smaller industrial tax base were what really got the ball rolling," said Legislature Chairman Theodore Jerrett, 13th District, New Haven. "The results of county government's efforts to consolidate and reduce spending can be seen in recent county budgets."
     <P>The Oswego County Legislature has not approved a property tax increase since 1992, when state and federal mandated programs caused a 4 percent increase in the 1993 budget. The 1994 and 1995 county budgets included no property tax increases, and the 1996 budget reduced taxes 1.1 percent. The 1997 budget reduces county taxes another $5.2 million.
     <P>"We're calling our efforts toward more cost-effective and efficient government  Progress 2000+," said Legislator Jerrett. "Progress 2000+ includes examining ideas for improvement from legislators, department heads, and the Goals 2000+ Task Force, and then implementing those ideas as they become feasible."
     <P>For the past few years, many legislators and department heads have been exploring new ideas and concepts for improving county government's effectiveness. Some of these concepts included consolidation and new management methods, such as the Jobs First restructuring of the Department of Social Services.
     <P>To help provide additional focus to these concepts, the Oswego County Legislature asked 15 business people to serve on the "Goals 2000+ Task Force" in 1995. The task force was asked to review county government's revenues, expenditures, programs, and services, and provide recommendations for improvement from the perspective of the business world. The report projected that the county could implement 14 recommendations over a five year period.
    <P> "The task force report provided us with a business perspective that brought focus and energy to important issues," said Legislature Chairman Jerrett. "Some recommendations reinforced ideas already begun. For example, we had already consolidated many legislative committees and merged the administration of the Health Department and Department of Social Services. The report recommended that we continue this consolidation, and we are. Also, dozens of county jobs have been eliminated through attrition."
     <P>"In the first seven months, we've implemented or begun work on nine of the recommendations," said Legislature Chairman Jerrett. "I'm very pleased with the progress county government has been making toward cost-effectiveness and efficiency, both before and after the Goals 2000+ report."
     <P><B>Here are some examples of Progress 2000+ initiatives:</B>
<UL>
<LI>	  The County Legislature adopted a mission statement in April, as recommended by the Goals 2000+ Task Force, and some county departments have developed their own mission statements. 
<LI>	  Administrative functions in health, social services, and employment and training departments were combined.
<LI>	  County Administrator Arthur Ospelt created a purchasing committee to look into centralized purchasing.
<LI>	  The legislature's General Government Committee will consider further consolidation of legislative committees and county departments and strengthening the county administrator position in 1997.
<LI>	  Total Quality Management methods are being tested in the Department of Social Services.
<LI>	  The Personnel Department and Personnel Committee are completing a management compensation study which reviews job duties and responsibilities; and
<LI>	  The Administrator's Office is examining the structure and responsibilities of inter-municipal councils in other counties.

<! INSERT THE ARTICLE'S BODY HERE AND PLACE A paragraph code  AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PARAGRAPH>

	<P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> Why did the Legislature pass the sales tax?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> The county needs an alternative source of revenue to ease the burden of property taxes on homeowners and businesses. The sales tax is a fairer system of taxation. The sales tax revenue will replace part of the property tax levy.
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> When will the sales tax take effect?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> The 3 percent Oswego County sales tax will take effect in March 1997. In the towns, the county sales tax will be added to the state sales tax. People in all areas of the county will pay a total of 7 percent sales tax.
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> What will the money be used for?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> As promised by the County Legislature, the sole purpose of the sales tax is to reduce property taxes in Oswego County. County Resolution No. 50 requires that 100 percent of the county's portion of the sales tax be used to replace part of the property tax levy.
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> Why pass a sales tax now, instead of waiting until all the Goals 2000+ Task Force recommendations are implemented?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> The report submitted by the Goals 2000+ Task Force states that its recommendations could result in tax decreases over a "five-year horizon."
	<P>However, at least 50 companies in Oswego County are challenging their tax assessments. If these industries are successful in having their assessments reduced, an unacceptable tax burden will be shifted onto property owners sooner than the Goals 2000+ recommendations can be achieved.
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> Instead of adopting a sales tax, why not just cut spending and lower property taxes? 
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> The County Legislature cut property taxes by $13.2 million in the 1997 budget. However, spending cuts alone won't solve the problem of the increasing tax burden on homeowners and business owners.
	<P>Individual property owners are paying more and more of the property tax levy, as industry pays less and less. The county sales tax spreads the tax burden more fairly over everyone who uses county services.
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> Will the total sales tax in the cities of Fulton and Oswego be 10 percent now?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> No. The total sales tax will be 7 percent everywhere in Oswego County.
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> How do we compare with neighboring counties?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> With the new 3 percent sales tax, Oswego County's sales tax will be the same as Onondaga, Madison, Lewis, and Jefferson counties. Our sales tax will be less than Cayuga and Oneida counties.  Our businesses will still have a competitive edge over those counties.
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> Is Oswego County the highest taxed county in New York State?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> No. This rumor was started a few years ago when a newspaper published a chart showing that Oswego County had the "highest per capita property tax rate" in the state. Many people misunderstood this statistic, thinking that it meant we are the highest taxed people in the state. 		
<P>Fortunately, that's not what the statistic means.
	<P>For example, the Town of Scriba has one of the highest per capita property tax rates in the county, but Scriba taxpayers pay the lowest property taxes in the county.
	<P>The per capita property tax rate means that, compared to other counties, on a per person basis, Oswego County raises a greater portion of its revenue from property taxes than from other taxes. The sales tax helps remedy that problem.
	<P>The per capita (per person) property tax rate doesn't give an accurate portrayal of the total taxation picture, because it doesn't take all taxes into account, nor does it account for the portion of the property tax levy which is paid by industry.
	<P>Some other counties also raise more revenue by charging higher user fees for county services than we do in Oswego County.</P>
	<HR><P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT> Is food taxable?
	<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT> No. Except for junk food and meals purchased at restaurants, food is not taxable.</P><HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=5>Q:</FONT>How will the sales tax revenue be shared with the towns?
<P><FONT SIZE=5>A:</FONT>The table below shows the amount of sales tax revenue to be returned to town governments, assuming $10 million is collected in Oswego County in 1997. Distribution is based on the population of each town.</P>

<CENTER><H3>RESOLUTION PROCLAIMING THE PLEDGE TO OSWEGO COUNTY PROPERTY OWNERS</H3></CENTER>                            
<P><I>April 11, 1996</I>
     <P><B>WHEREAS</B>, the County Legislature has heretofore adopted a countywide sales tax in response to a Real Property Tax crisis facing business interests and individual property owners, and
     <P><B>WHEREAS</B>, the County Legislature intends to establish a public trust between citizens and county government via a written commitment to the electorate, and
     <P><B>WHEREAS</B>, the County Legislature has expressed a desire to keep the 1997 Oswego County Budget at or below the 1996 budget levy requiring assistance and cooperation from all county departments.
     <P><B>NOW</B>, upon recommendation of the Ways, Means and Budget Committee of this body, be it,
     <P><B>RESOLVED</B>, that the County Legislature enact the following Pledge to Property Owners:
     <P><B>FIRST</B>, the County portion of the sales tax will be used to reduce the Real Property Tax Levy;
     <P><B>SECOND</B>, the Cities of Oswego and Fulton will be held harmless regarding their present sales tax revenues, and that the County Legislature will support legislation at the State level enabling the Cities to collect and retain their sales tax within their respective boundaries;
     <P><B>THIRD</B>, the Towns of Oswego County will receive a share of the countywide sales tax revenues based on population. This share shall consist of twenty percent of the first ten million dollars ($10,000,000) of the county portion of sales tax revenue and ten percent of the county portion of sales tax revenue raised in excess of ten million dollars.
     <P><B>FOURTH</B>, the County Legislature will maintain fiscal responsibility in county government and implement efficient, cost effective downsizing and consolidation practices to reduce the Real Property Tax Levy, and be it further
     <P><B>RESOLVED</B>, that the county administration is directed to develop a budget request for 1997 that is based upon at least a 5 percent reduction in the county tax levy. Any revenue gained from sales tax would result in an additional reduction.</P>

</H2></CENTER>

     <P>Oswego County's financial position "can only be described as exemplary," according to a report by Fiscal Advisors and Marketing, Inc., a firm which analyzes financial statements for county and local governments in New York State.
     <P>The Cicero-based company looked at several factors and issues affecting the county and reported its findings to the Legislature's Ways, Means and Budget Committee earlier this fall.
     Their report describes Oswego County's financial management as "a reflection of the highest professional standards associated with good government."
      <P>"Oswego County is unique among all counties in New York State and among most governmental units in the nation," concluded authors Donald Freed and John Shehadi. "While its current financial position is strong, it is vulnerable to forces beyond its control that could severely impact this position."
      <P>The authors identified three major changes taking place which will affect the county's financial position for years to come:
<UL>
<LI>	  Federal welfare reform; 
<LI>	  Competition in the electric utility industry; and
<LI>	  The 3% county sales tax which takes effect in 1997.
</UL>
	<P>Noting that Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation pays more than half of the county's real property tax levy, the authors said the county has gradually reduced its dependency on Niagara Mohawk, but is vulnerable because it relies heavily on one major taxpayer. Niagara Mohawk is significantly reducing its amount of assessed taxable property and could face increased competition in the public utility industry in the future.
	<P>According to the report, the county cut its reliance on Niagara Mohawk property taxes from 68.5 percent to 59.8 percent of real property tax revenues over 10 years.
	<P>Federal welfare reform could have a major impact on the county because the county and state may be required to pick up some of the benefits being eliminated by the federal government.
    <P> Freed called the county sales tax a "very astute financial move" because it broadens the county's revenue base and is a "more equitable" way of distributing the tax burden. As a result of the sales tax, he noted, property values will be enhanced.
     <P>The report recommends that the County Legislature set aside funds to offset the possible loss of property tax revenues from Niagara Mohawk. The money would come from the county sales tax proceeds and part of the unappropriated, unreserved fund balance. Soon after the county received the report, the Legislature set up an account to pay for bond payments, using $3 million from the unappropriated, unreserved fund balance.
     <P>The report also suggests that the county reduce its unappropriated, unreserved fund balance to 6 percent of the 1995 revenue, or $7,290,000, and reduce its appropriated fund balances to $3 million.  
Mandated Program Costs vs. Inflation Rate
     <P>"One of the things that the financial advisors looked at was the cost of mandated social services programs over the last decade," said County Administrator Arthur Ospelt.  "They found that 80 percent of the increases in county costs were due to medical assistance, aid to families with dependent children, and home relief programs. The DSS budget increased much faster than the rate of inflation, but at a rate comparable to other counties in the state."</P>

<! INSERT THE ARTICLE'S BODY HERE AND PLACE A paragraph code  AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PARAGRAPH>

<P><I>To the Residents of Oswego County:</I>
     <P><IMG SRC="../../ted.jpg" WIDTH=100 ALIGN=RIGHT ALIGN=MIDDLE VSPACE=7
HSPACE=7>I've had the honor of serving the people of Oswego County as a legislator since 1978. During the past 18 years I've seen many changes in local, county, and state government.  
     <P>Yet, in recent years I became more and more concerned about the direction government seemed to be heading. As mandates from the state and federal governments increased in number and cost, counties and local governments were forced to provide more 
expensive services, and taxpayers were forced to pay for them.
     <P>I'm happy to report that now we're starting to see this trend turn around. Over the past two years, state mandates have relaxed a bit, helping us to keep taxes under control. We've been able to maintain county services without a tax increase since
 1994. In fact, we were able to decrease taxes in 1996 and 1997.
     <P>Other negative trends are also starting to take a turn for the better. County government had grown too dependent on a single taxpayer, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation. This was a risky situation because it means that all county services -- police
, fire protection, highway maintenance, services for children, seniors and veterans, etc. -- depended on the financial health of a single company.  
     <P>We were also depending too heavily on homeowners and other business property owners for the balance of tax revenues.
     <P>The best solution to this over-dependence on property taxes was to cut the overall amount of taxes collected by the county, and replace part of the property tax levy with a 3 percent county sales tax.
     <P>Recognizing that such fundamental changes would be difficult for some citizens to accept, the legislature adopted a "Pledge to Property Owners." legislators promised to cut county spending at least 5 percent in 1997, use all of the county's portio
n of sales tax revenue to reduce property taxes even further, work to allow the cities to retain their sales tax, give part of the county sales tax to the towns, and implement cost effective consolidation and downsizing of county government. The legislatu
re has kept this promise to taxpayers.
     <P>By keeping their promise to use the sales tax to reduce our dependence on property taxes, the county legislature created a fairer tax system. All people who use county services, including travellers and tourists, will now help pay for the cost of 
services. The tax burden will no longer be placed only on the shoulders of property owners.
     <P>By keeping its promise to cut county spending, the county legislature has cut the total amount of taxes it collects. The combined total of property taxes and sales tax in 1997 will be $5.2 million less than the property tax levy of 1996. In fact, 
1997 taxes will be lower than they've been since 1991.
     <P>We are, indeed, turning the corner to better times. Mandate relief is finally becoming a reality. We've cut government spending and created a fairer tax system. Unemployment in Oswego County is the lowest since 1990, and over 795 DBAs for business
es have been filed with the County Clerk's Office in the first 10 months of 1996. Sealright is expanding and adding jobs, and new industries are looking to locate here in Oswego County. Yes, it will take time and hard work to recover from the hits we've t
aken in past years. But, surely, things are turning around, and I'm optimistic about our future.   
     <P>As always, my door is open, and I encourage you to contact me or your county legislator with any questions or concerns about county government.

<P>Sincerely,<BR>
Ted Jerrett<BR>
Chairman of the Legislature</P>

	<P>Twenty-seven companies have reported a total of 29 materials which qualify as "Extremely Hazardous Substances" to the Oswego County LEPC.
     <P>Some of these chemicals are used in wastewater treatment, some are used in refrigeration, and some in agriculture. 	
	<P>Others are used in various manufacturing processes. If improperly used or contained, all of them could pose a significant threat to the community.
     <P>The reporting requirements help local fire department and other emergency services personnel to be aware of the hazards and plan ahead of time for emergencies involving them.

Chemicals make life smoother. 
     <P>Chlorine, for example, is used by water treatment plants to purify the water we drink. It's used in wastewater plants and in a variety of other industries as a bleaching agent, and in the production of chemicals such as insecticides, cleaning solvents, medicines and plastics.
     <P>Yet as essential as chemicals are in the industries that produce the goods we use in our day-to-day lives, some are extremely toxic and can cause harm or even death to people exposed at certain levels. Chlorine is a deadly gas when it escapes, and is extremely toxic when inhaled. Even relatively low concentrations can cause death.
    <P> Twenty-seven industries and other locations in Oswego County report having quantities of extremely hazardous substances on hand for the processes used in their facilities. A good many more businesses and industries report using chemicals and hazardous substances that also can cause harm to the community.
     <P>How would emergency personnel in Oswego County respond to a chemical accident at one of these sites? Would the firefighters and law enforcement personnel know what chemicals are involved -- and what the dangers are? How would they protect themselves, and the public, from the toxic elements?
    <P> Industry regulates itself closely. Facilities are required under the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act to provide information on the presence of hazardous chemicals and to assist communities in planning for chemical emergencies. They report directly to the community via Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPCs).
     <P>LEPCs are crucial to the success of the federal law. They provide a forum for citizens, health professionals, industry, public-interest organizations, and the local, state, and federal government agencies that are responsible for emergency planning and response, public health, and environmental protection. 
     <P>Established in 1987, the Oswego County LEPC facilitates planning, training, and information exchange among industry, government, emergency-response agencies, and the public.
     <P>Members are appointed by the State Emergency Response Commission. By law an LEPC includes representatives of several organizations: elected state and local officials; law enforcement, civil defense, firefighting, first aid, health, local environmental and transportation agencies; hospitals; broadcast and print media; community groups; and representatives of facilities subject to the law's requirements. 
    <P> "Without the dedication of the many volunteers from private businesses, government, and community groups, we would not be able to respond to and control the many hazardous incidents that could pose a problem to the community," noted George Brower, director of the County Emergency Management Office, which is the coordinating arm of Oswego County's LEPC.
   	<P>The County Legislature's Fire and Emergency Management Committee oversees the Emergency Management Office. The committee is chaired by Legislator Stephen Balcom, 3rd District, Pulaski, and includes Legislators Bruce Bisbo, 6th District, West Monroe; Earl Chesbro, 12th District, Pennellville; Russ Johnson, 25th District, Fulton; Clyde Osborne, 11th District, Volney; and Robert Simmons, 21st District, Hannibal. 
	<P>Under the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act, the Oswego County LEPC developed a comprehensive emergency response plan called the "Oswego County SARA Title III Comprehensive Plan." The plan was revised in 1995 and includes the identity and location of hazardous materials throughout the county, names of coordinators of facilities where the hazardous materials are located, procedures for immediate response to a chemical accident, methods to notify the public about any actions they must take, and provisions for testing the plan. 
     <P>The Oswego County LEPC also receives information about inventories of hazardous chemicals and emergency releases by local facilities, and makes this information available to the public upon request. 
     <P>"It's gratifying to note that there are many industries in the county that are actively involved with the LEPC and emergency planning," said LEPC Coordinator Jim Hohman, "and, in any event, we have had no problems with having facilities comply with the chemical inventory reporting requirements."
     <P>The LEPC serves as a focal point in the community for information and discussions about hazardous substances, emergency planning, and health and environmental risks.
     <P>The committee's first "tabletop" exercise, held in 1995, brought emergency responders together around a table to discuss how they would respond to a simulated hazardous materials transportation accident in the City of Oswego.
	<P>Participants learned how other agencies would operate in such an accident, and discussed how the agencies would work together. A second tabletop exercise, this one revolving around a facility in Fulton, is planned for later this year.
     <P>Meetings of the LEPC are held quarterly and are publicized through the local media. Recent meetings have featured a program by the Oswego Fire Department on its hazardous materials team and a discussion by Oswego County Legislator and local farmer Morris Sorbello of Granby on the uses of chemicals in agriculture. 
    <P> It's essential for emergency responders to know what hazardous chemicals are present in our community, how they are used and stored, and what potential dangers they present. But the responsibility for compiling that information and planning for emergencies is the responsibility of many: the industry that makes, uses, and transports chemicals, the emergency-response organizations that protect the public, the government that regulates the industry, and the public itself.
	<P>More information about the Oswego County LEPC is available by contacting Jim Hohman, coordinator, weekdays, at 598-1191.</P>

<P><I>Imagine this scenario:</I>
	<P>A tractor trailer carrying sulfuric acid overturns near the Route 81 bridge over the Salmon River, spilling its contents onto the roadway.
     <P>It's raining heavily, and there's a brisk northwesterly wind. It appears that run-off from the highway is heading down an embankment toward the river. It's salmon season, and despite the downpour, a few die-hards are still fishing on the river banks.
     <P>Fire fighters, EMTs, and law enforcement officials arrive at the scene. The truck's driver is injured and unable to answer their questions. The only information emergency responders have about the tanker's contents is a faded placard on the side of the truck.
     <P>When emergency officials arrive at an accident involving hazardous chemicals, the incident commander must immediately take into account several factors:
     <P>What does the symbol on the placard mean? Is the material gaseous? Is it explosive? Is it hazardous if inhaled? What type of gear is needed to protect emergency workers? What are the wind conditions and how long will it take for a cloud of vapor to reach the nearest homes? Will people need to be moved from the area?
     <P>This type of accident could easily occur, and in fact, a tanker carrying ammonium nitrate, an explosive, overturned on Route 81 in early October. Fortunately, there were no injuries and the substance was contained.
	<P>In order to protect the public's health and the environment during this type of incident, emergency officials in Oswego County are organizing a countywide hazardous materials "haz-mat" response team.
     <P>"With chemicals being transported through the county by highways, rails and through the harbor, and with the variety of chemicals used by industry in the county, there's a real potential for a serious spill or industrial accident anywhere along the line," noted County Fire Coordinator Wilfred "Bill" Denery. "We need to be prepared to react to this type of emergency anywhere in the county."
     <P>Under the umbrella of the Oswego County Haz-Mat Response Team Committee, local fire services and county agencies are working together to form a county haz-mat team. The three local haz-mat teams in the county -- the Oswego City Fire Department, Fulton Fire Department, and Alcan Fire Department -- are helping by providing their experience and resources to the countywide team. 
     <P>So far, approximately 30 fire fighters from Minetto, Cody, Mexico, Caughdenoy, Parish, Sandy Creek, Palermo, Volney, Oswego Town, Granby Center, Hannibal, Alcan, Fulton and Central Square have signed up for the county team.
     <P>"The committee feels strongly that this type of inter-departmental commitment is essential for the overall success of the team," said Tom Abbott, assistant Oswego City fire chief and co-chair of the Oswego County Haz-Mat Response Team Committee. "This unified effort will ensure that the team develops according to the interests of the county fire service at large and gives each participating department constructive representation within the organization."
     <P>Obtaining equipment will be a long and expensive process.
	<P>Haz-mat team members use specialized gear, communications equipment, and extinguishing agents when dealing with hazardous materials. Decontamination of personnel and equipment is standard procedure after each incident, and a portable decontamination unit must be transported along with the team's gear. 
     <P>Denery has received two state grants, totalling $70,000, through the assistance of New York State Senator James Wright and the State Department of Environmental Conservation.
	<P>The grant money is being used to buy air packs, coveralls, training suits, chemical extinguishing agents, and a laptop computer used to record site inventories of hazardous materials and predict scenarios for potential industrial and transportation incidents.
	<P>Donations of vehicles and equipment have come from the Oswego County Sheriff's Department, the Palermo Fire Department, and the North Syracuse Fire Department.
     <P>Four levels of formal training are offered to haz-mat team members. Basic and advanced classes are taught through the local fire departments, while technical and advanced specialist classes are taught at the State Fire Service Academy at Montour Falls.
     <P>Over the next few months, sub-committees will continue to develop response procedures and training programs, acquire equipment, develop a logo, and locate a centralized operations base for the haz-mat team.
     <P>Denery hopes to have the team ready to begin operations early next year.

<P>Information being collected by Oswego County's home health care staff will have a lasting impact on home care in New York State and across the nation.
	<P>The staff is one of 23 agencies in the state chosen to participate in a demonstration study of the "outcome assessment instrument set" (OASIS). The purpose is to determine how home care changes the health status of patients.
	<P>The demonstration is funded by the New York State Department of Health and is being conducted by the University of Colorado Research Center in Denver.
     Nursing staff who care for patients in their homes are using the OASIS tool to measure patient outcomes in a variety of areas. Through nursing assessment, data is compiled and transmitted to the University of Colorado on up to 85 items.
    <P> "This project is a real credit to our staff," noted Steven D. Rose, Oswego County Commissioner of Human Services. "Oswego County was chosen for this study because our nursing staff has already demonstrated a strong commitment to leadership, and has the experience and flexibility to continually improve the quality of its home care services. As a result of this study, we expect to be able to return more patients to an optimal level of activity, shorten the length of hospital stays, and implement cost-savings measures across the board."
     <P>Nurses began to compile data July 15 and will continually report it to the University of Colorado over a two- to three-year period. Researchers provide information back to the county health department on issues such as the quality of home care, the effects of home care on the health of individual patients, and how to use patient outcomes to improve the quality of home care.
    <P>"Our staff is to be commended for its efforts in helping Oswego County Public Health stand out among others. They serve as pioneers in outcome measurement," said Kathleen Smith, Director of Patient Services for the county health department. "We're committed to our staff and the success of outcome-based quality improvement. Motivation, celebration, and recognition are critical."
     <P>The County Legislature's Health Committee oversees the health department's public health nursing service. The committee includes County Legislator Floyd Boynton, chairman, 22nd District, Fulton; Barbara Brown, 8th District, Palermo; James Bryant, 5th District, Constantia; Frank Church, 14th District, Scriba; Clyde Osborne, 11th District, Volney; and Robert Simmons; 21st District, Hannibal.</P>

    <P> Every summer, hundreds of children experience the wonder and excitement of a week at Camp Hollis. During the summer of 1997, Camp Hollis will celebrate its 50th anniversary as Oswego County's summer youth camp.
     <P>To celebrate this event, Camp Hollis is inviting all previous staff and campers to attend the 50th anniversary party, held July 19 and 20, 1997, at Camp Hollis. If you, or someone you know, attended or worked at Camp Hollis during the last 50 years, this event is a perfect way to relive some fond memories of the past.
     <P>Camp Hollis is owned by the County of Oswego, and is operated by the Oswego City-County Youth Bureau. The camp, located in the Town of Oswego on the shore of Lake Ontario, was originally a health camp for children with signs of tuberculosis. 
     <P>"The camp program was designed to take these children for a six-to eight-week summer camping experience," said Kathleen Fenlon, director of the Oswego City-County Youth Bureau. "The original goal was to build up the children's physical health in order to combat the disease."
    <P> After the program was discontinued during World War II, a group headed by then County Court Judge Eugene Sullivan determined that the facility should be used as a summer camp for the youth of Oswego County. During the summer of 1947, Camp Hollis opened for an eight-week period with funds provided by the Oswego County Board of Supervisors.  
     <P>In the following years the Board of Supervisors and later, the Oswego County Legislature, allocated a greater portion of the operating expenses, allowing for the camp to expand in size and accommodate more children.
     <P>Camp Hollis has been continually growing and improving every season. The current program allows for children, ages 9 to 12, to attend a week-long residential camping experience. 
	<P>Every week, 100 children participate in a wide variety of activities including arts and crafts, nutrition, athletics, aquatics, hiking, drama, and large group activities.  
    <P> "The goals of the camp program are to give children a camping experience, and promote good sportsmanship while stressing social interaction and the wise use of natural resources," said Fenlon.
     Camp Hollis is also used annually by over 2,000 Oswego County residents for day and weekend camp programs. School groups, scout troops, and senior citizen groups are some of the many organizations that utilize the camp facilities.
     <P>To celebrate the grand history of Camp Hollis, the Oswego City-County Youth Bureau is looking for a variety of memorabilia from the many people the camp has touched. Anyone who can assist with the following information is asked to contact Camp Hollis, c/o the Oswego City-County Youth Bureau, 70 Bunner St., Oswego, NY 13126, weekdays, phone (315) 349-3451, or 1-800-596-3200, ext. 3451.
<UL>
<LI>	  Names and addresses of staff;
<LI>	  Stories and legends of Camp Hollis; and
<LI>	  Camp Hollis memorabilia.
</UL>
     <P>"Our goal is to collect and compile stories of individuals who worked at Camp Hollis, to share at the anniversary party," said James Farfaglia, senior youth services specialist. "We would like to display any old photos, T-shirts, and craft projects. We appreciate any loaned items, and items will be returned."</P>

<P>In 1994, the Oswego County Health Department established the Step by Step Clubhouse, a program to assist adults with mental illness.  The Clubhouse is administered in conjunction with Catholic Charities.
     <P>The Step by Step Clubhouse, located at 160 S. Third St., is a pre-vocational training program for adults with mental illness. The program provides members an environment where they can learn vocational skills and begin the rehabilitation process.
     <P>Step by Step is funded by the state. "Step by Step Clubhouse is a very exciting and successful program," said Steven Rose, Oswego County Commissioner of Human Services. "It's been in operation since January 1994.  There are approximately 39 active members, and membership continues to grow."
    <P> "The program is based on the philosophy that an important part of a person's rehabilitation is being able to do productive work within the community and feel that they are positively contributing to their community," said Joette Deane, coordinator of mental health services.
     <P>Members are involved in developing, implementing, and running the program.
     <P>The Clubhouse Learning Center allows members to improve their knowledge in various fields through books and computer software programs.  Members can also work toward earning a graduate equivalency degree (GED).
    <P> "The program is set up so that recipients work at their own pace without the pressure of rigid time constraints," said Program Director Theresa Rakovan.
     <P>"Step by Step Clubhouse provides more than a pre-vocational training program," said Rakovan. "It is a place where members can feel safe to explore different areas and learn new skills. It is a program where all contributions and accomplishments are acknowledged and celebrated."
    <P> Members learn pre-vocational skills in computers, clerical work, restaurants, and many other job-related fields. They also use their skills to make arts and crafts products. These products are sold at local festivals and the money raised is used to purchase additional materials.
    <P> The Clubhouse is work intensive, requiring all members to check in and contribute to the operation of the program. Many members also have jobs in the community and do volunteer work.
    <P> "Everyone has the ability to contribute to the community," said Rakovan. "It is the goal of the Clubhouse to create an environment where a person can identify their abilities and build the confidence to use them."
     <P>For more information, call the Oswego County Health Department, weekdays, at 349-3591 or 1-800-596-3200, extension 3591. </P>

<P><I>According to Captain Tony Buffa:</I><BR>
There has been good yellow perch fishing by boat off Wright's Landing.  Fish along the edge of the weeds with buckeye minnows.  Put a sinker on the bottom with two #6 or #8 hooks above it.  An occasional brown trout is also being caught.  The river is still too swift for any fishing.</P>

<P><I>According to Captain Tony Buffa:</I><BR>
The walleye fishing has been excellent here.  You can troll near the bottom in deep water with Junior Thundersticks or Rapalas.  In addition, jigging with dark jigs and drifting with buckeye minnows has been working as well, if not better.  When walleye fishing is this good at this time of year, it is usually a good sign for fishing at first ice in North Bay.</P>

<!    INSERT NEWS RELEASE'S TITLE HERE>New Program Coordinator Sees Untapped Potential in Salmon River Corridor
</H3></CENTER></A>

<! INSERT THE NEWS RELEASE'S BODY HERE AND PLACE A "<p>" AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PARAGRAPH>
     <P>ALTMAR -- Ask Fran Verdoliva what his new job at the Salmon River Hatchery is, and youll hear "Salmon River program coordinator," "ecosystem coordinator," "special assistant to the Commissioner," and "Salmon River steward."
   <P>"A steward of the Salmon River is what Ive been doing for most of my life," says Verdoliva, who was hired as the state DECs new Salmon River Program Coordinator in July. "Ive spent years on the river, and Ive always had a concern about whats ha
ppening, where its going, and where it has been."
   <P>The Oswego native ran his own fly fishing business and spent several years as a guide before accepting the position with the DEC. He has a masters degree in outdoor recreation from Syracuse University.
   <P>The State Legislatures $450,000 appropriation for hatchery improvements, and the DEC's creation of the coordinators position signal a new direction for the future of the Salmon River Corridor.
   <P>"Fishing has been, and will continue to be, the primary focus of the economy and recreational activity on the river," said Verdoliva in a recent interview, "but there are a lot of other things going on here."
   <P>"The DEC, and more importantly, the Governor, have taken a look at the Salmon River Corridor and made it an area of prime focus. They recognize that the river is a unique resource that is vital to the local economy. Theyre interested in expanding t
he hatchery -- not only in fish production, but in education and research, and as a tourism attraction."
   <P>A major focus will be to develop a long-range strategic plan for a natural resource-based economy along the corridor.
   <P>Other goals are to:
<UL>
<LI>    develop the hatchery as an educational resource and promote it as a family-oriented destination for visitors;
<LI>    develop and promote use of the trail system along the reservoirs and the river for hiking, mountain biking, cross-country skiing and other uses; 
<LI>    develop the river as a year-round fishery, adding native brown trout, skamania steelhead, and re-introducing the Atlantic salmon to the river.
</UL>
   <P>"Weve moved beyond the gold rush atmosphere, when the fishery was at its peak, and need to look at long-term, more sustainable types of recreational activities on the Salmon River," says Verdoliva. "Eco-tourism is the balance of an areas ecology
 with the economic potential that tourism offers.
  <P> "The corridor really offers that ability because we have a great ecosystem -- high quality water bounded by forestland, great wildlife, and tremendous snowfall. Were now seeing eagles and ospreys in the area. We have tremendous potential -- for wat
er-related recreation on the reservoirs and on the rivers white water, and for trail development on both sides of the river."
  <P> In his role as "river steward," Verdoliva will be monitoring the river -- the health of the fish population, angler ethics, and law enforcement activities. He believes that maintaining a high quality fishery and establishing a year-round fishery are
 long-term, achievable goals.
   <P>The signing of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions (FERC) agreement with Niagara Mohawk will help, because it will maintain a minimal water flow and cooler water temperatures, allowing the population of native fish species to increase.
  <P> "There have been big changes in the fishery, said Verdoliva. "...we have to take the realistic view that its not the way it was 15 years ago. The numbers of fish may be down, but this fall were seeing a sizeable run of big fish. We have a high qua
lity fishery. Theres nothing like it in North America, unless you go to Alaska."
   <P>As a community liaison, Verdoliva has been meeting with groups and community organizations about the river and the hatchery.  "I can take issues and local concerns and bring them directly back to the Commissioner and his staff," he said. 
   <P>"In reading through the landowner surveys conducted by the Greenway Committee, its obvious that local people want to preserve open spaces and keep the rural atmosphere of this area. We have a strong commitment to keeping it rural while improving th
e economy through our natural resources."</P>

</H3></CENTER>

	<P>When the Salmon River is mentioned, most people immediately think of sport fishing.
	<P>The regions most popular trails are those short paths between parking areas and anglers favorite fishing holes.
 	<P>But the long trail systems which criss-cross the Salmon River region may soon be gaining new popularity as local communities and the State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) look toward developing recreational opportunities beyond sportfi
shing.
	<P>The Salmon River corridor, or "greenway," is the land immediately adjacent to the river and reservoirs, stretching between Port Ontario and Redfield.
	<P>In 1994, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation began divesting itself of land holdings along the Salmon River corridor. These wilderness areas were transferred through the Mellon Foundation to the DEC. In addition, the utility gave a 200-foot conservation 
easement along the river to the DEC for public access and fishing.
	<P>The land transfer became the catalyst for forming the Salmon River Greenway Committee. The group of volunteer citizens and representatives of local government are working to ensure that development along the Salmon River is controlled and doesn't nega
tively impact the rural character of local communities and the regions environmental resources.
	<P>Old logging roads, seasonal roads, and newly created trails meander through many of the most scenic forest lands in the Salmon River Greenway. Enhancement and promotion of the areas trail systems is high on the list of projects to develop the area's 
recreational resources.
 	<P>Chateaugay State Forest, Salmon River State Forest, and Hall Island State Forest are prominent features of the greenways eastern region. At the greenways western end is Selkirk Shores State Park. Extensive trail systems in these state lands are eas
ily accessible, marked, and linked to each other by primary roads.
	<P>The newly-created Hall Island State Forest encompasses the entire south shore of the Salmon River Reservoir.
	<P>The DEC is developing a 14-mile trail system in this area, extending from Dam Road in Orwell to County Route 17 in Redfield. Several loops within the trail system provide adventurers with a choice of returning to their starting point or traveling from
 one trail head to another.
	<P>Hikers should have little trouble traversing the Hall Island trails. Rocks, roots, tree falls, and several small boggy areas make these trails suitable for intermediate to advanced mountain bikers and cross-country skiers.
	<P>Seven miles of marked forest trails and eight miles of unplowed roads provide excellent hiking, skiing, and mountain biking opportunities in Chateaugay State Forest. Orwell and Pekin brooks and forests of white pine, elm and maple trees grace these tr
ails.
	<P>Salmon River State Forest and Selkirk Shores State Park also contain multipurpose trails. Mountain biking is not allowed at Selkirk Shores. Snowmobilers can access popular trail systems in the Tug Hill region from Selkirk.
	<P>During the winter, many trails are designated for either snowmobile use or cross-country skiing.
	<P>The Oswego County Department of Promotion and Tourism recently published a guide booklet to the Salmon River Greenway.  The interpetive guide describes many of these trail systems, as well as the greenways many other attractions.

HSPACE=7>GUIDELINES ON REPORTING CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT</H2> 

<P>Every local department of social services in New York State has a Child Protective Unit which is
legally
designated with the responsibility of investigating reports of suspected maltreatment or abuse of
children. All situations of suspected child abuse or maltreatment should be reported to the New
York
State Child Abuse and Maltreatment Register over its toll-free statewide telephone number,
1-800-342-3720. A separate hotline number to be used only by mandated reporters is 
1-800-635-1522. To assist persons in reporting, the following information has been extracted
from
several sections of the Social Services Law and from the Family Court Act.

<P>An abused child is one who is less than 18 years of age and whose parent or other person legally
responsible for his care :

<UL>
<LI>inflicts or allows to be inflicted serious physical injury by other than accidental means
<LI>creates or allows to be created a substantial risk of such injury
<LI>commits or allows to be committed a sex offense against such child
</UL>

<P>A neglected child is one who is less than 18 years of age whose physical, mental or emotional
condition has been impaired or is in danger of becoming impaired due to the parents':

<UL>
<LI>failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, medical care or education
<LI>failure to provide proper supervision or guardianship
<LI>infliction of excessive corporal punishment
<LI>abandonment of the child
</UL>

<P><B>Who should report abuse and maltreatment?</B>

<P>Any person who has reasonable cause to suspect a child is abused or maltreated should report
this
information to the New York State Child Abuse and Maltreatment Register.

<P><B>Who is legally required to report abuse and maltreatment?</B>

<P>All of the following persons are required under Social Services  
Law, Section 413, to report situations of suspected child abuse and maltreatment :
<UL>
<LI>Physicians                                              
<LI>Medical Examiners             
<LI>Dentists                 
<LI>Optometrists                  
<LI>Podiatrists                     
<LI>Interns                      
<LI>Registered Nurses             
<LI>Hospital Personnel engaged in admission, examination, care or treatment

</UL>

<P>Whenever such a person is required to report under this title in his capacity as a member of the
staff
of a medical or other public or private institution, school, facility or agency, he shall immediately
notify
the person in charge of such institution, school, facility or agency, or his designated agent, who
then
also shall become responsible to report or cause reports to be made.

<P><B>How is a report made?</B>             

<P>All reports should be made to the New York State Child Abuse and Maltreatment Register over
its
toll-free statewide telephone number, which is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All
reports will
be relayed to the local child protective services. The telephone report should be made as quickly
as
possible when abuse or maltreatment is suspected. For mandated reporters, a written report must
be
followed within 48 hours. The written report should be made on Form DSS-2221, Report of
Suspected
Child Abuse or Maltreatment. These may be obtained from the child protective service within
each local
department of social services.

<P><B>Should a person be certain of abuse or maltreatment before reporting?</B>

<P>No. The law does not require absolute certainty. It does require reasonable cause to suspect abuse
or
maltreatment.

<P><B>Can a person incur liability by reporting suspected abuse?</B>

<P>Any person or institution making a report of suspected child abuse or maltreatment in good faith
has
immunity from civil or criminal liability which might otherwise be incurred. The good faith of
any person
required to report shall be presumed.

<P><B>What action will be taken by the Child Protective Service?</B>

<P>The Child Protective Service in each local Department of Social Services is required to
investigate every
report of suspected abuse or maltreatment. The Protective caseworker must make a prompt and
accurate determination to prevent injury to the child's welfare. Where dangerous or damaging
conditions are found, help must also be offered to the parents. Court action will be initiated when
it
is in the best interests of the child.

<P><B>What rights do the subjects of a report have?</B>

<UL>
<LI>They have a right to a copy of all information contained in the  State Central Register except
the names of persons making a report or who have cooperated in a subsequent investigation.
<LI>When a report has been determined to be unfounded, all identifying data in the State Central
Register is automatically expunged.
<LI>When a report has been determined to be indicated, the subject of a report may request the
amendment or expungement of any information which he feels is inaccurate or improperly
kept.
<LI> If this request is denied or is not acted upon within 30 days, the subject of a report is entitled
to a fair hearing to determine whether the record should be amended or expunged.

Contact Person : Robert V. Shear, President</ADDRESS><BR>

<P><B>SERVICES </B>: SBH is a private, non-profit corporation whose mission is to promote recovery
from the
effects of alcohol and other drug dependency and from the effects of other emotional and
psychological problems. SBH goals are to provide high quality, efficient services based on client
need;
strengthen community efforts to address behavioral health problems; and offer progressive
leadership
in service to clients and the community.

<P><I>SBH Outpatient Treatment</I> - Management of behavioral health problems is most efficient placed
in the
context of a family-centered outpatient environment, where expert clinicians plan services and
coordinate care. In this context, brief counseling and case management approaches can be most
effectively coordinated with more intensive treatment services when these are needed. SBH
offers a
variety of outpatient treatment programs from very limited to very intensive, matched to the
treatment
and support needs of the individual client. Through its alliances with other specialized providers,
the
same approach to coordinated treatment can be provided for the full range of mental and addictive
disorders.

<P>Should admission to a structured environment be required, SBH case managers retain
responsibility for
utilization control through the treatment process, assuring the most efficient path to recovery and
seamless coordination of care. SBH is unique in Central New York in its ability to offer a complete
range of residential treatment alternatives managed by clinicians with a bias toward outpatient
care.

<P><I>SBH Community Residences</I> - With over 35 years of experience providing community residence
services, SBH offers a range of programs for both men and women. Halfway house services are
provided in combination with outpatient care as a cost-effective alternative to inpatient treatment
when
appropriate. These programs also operate as a continuing support for persons in need of structured
environment after inpatient treatment, and can be supplemented with apartment living for those
in need
of long term support.

<P><I>The Willows Inpatient</I> - Since 1977, SBH has operated the most cost-effective addiction treatment
facility in Central New York. This 40 bed program has specialized in the treatment of persons
with
complex problems, and offers a uniquely wide range of research-based treatment options. Length
of
stay and program services are tailored to individual needs. Special attention is given to individuals
and
families with high levels of social problems and/or relapse potential.</P>

<P><I>Contact Person : Christine Weaver, Coordinator of Client Services</I>
               
<P><I>SERVICES :</I> The Department of Employment and Training (DET) administers employment and
training
programs for residents of Oswego County who are economically disadvantaged, receive public
assistance or food stamps, or experience barriers to employment. Programs are funded by the
federal
Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), Economic Dislocated Worker Assistance Act (EDWAA),
and grants
from New York State, and the local and state Department of Social Services. Services provided
include
assessment and testing, vocational counseling, workshops, occupational skills training, on-the-job
training, and remedial education.

<P>On-the-Job Training provides youth and adults an opportunity to learn skills in an employment
situation.
DET contracts with private employers to hire eligible applicants and reimburses the employer for a
negotiated training wage for a specified training period up to a maximum of 6 months.

<P>Occupational Skills Training offers specialized instruction in a variety of vocational fields
determined
to be in demand in the local labor market. The training is provided by a number of training agents
in
the area. Tuition and fees are paid and sometimes include a minimal support payment to assist
with
the costs of attending the training.

<P>Youth programs and workshops offer participants the opportunity to gain the skills and education
necessary for future employment. Topics include life skills, self-esteem issues, career awareness,
problem solving, personal interests, listening skills, attendance/punctuality, completion of job
applications/resumes, and interpersonal skills. Workshops are for in-school and out-of-school
youth and
may be linked with occupational or basic skills components. 

<P>Basic Occupationally Oriented Skills Training (BOOST) is designed for youth ages 16 to 21, who
lack
a high school diploma. Classes are held at the BOCES Instructional Learning Center in Mexico
and
prepare the students for the High School Equivalency Examination. In addition to attending
classes,
youth are placed in work experience positions.

<P>The Summer Youth Corps (SYC) is designed for economically disadvantaged youth, aged 14
through
21. This 6-week program provides participants with a positive summer work experience while they
earn
minimum wage for 30 hours per week. Students who are in need of remedial training may work
part-
time and attend class part-time. To ease transportation arrangements, participants are placed in
public,
non-profit agencies throughout the County as close to their homes as possible.

<P>Entry Employment Experience (EEE) provides youth aged 16 to 21 an opportunity to learn skills
in an
employment situation. DET contracts with private employers to train eligible applicants and pays
the
participant a training wage for specified training period up to a maximum of 13 weeks. Upon
completion of training, the employee agrees to hire the participant.</P>

denied
coverage under Child Health Plus.

child,
up to $100 a family. Anyone who is eligible for Food Stamps, free or reduced price school
lunches or

<P><I>SERVICES :</I> Lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease which causes inflammation of various
parts of the
body, especially the skin, joints, blood and kidneys. The immune system normally protects the
body
against viruses and bacteria. With lupus, the immune system loses its ability to tell the difference
between foreign substances and its own cells and tissues. 

<P>Lupus can be difficult to diagnose as the symptoms come and go and mimic many other illnesses.
Some symptoms of lupus can be transient joint and muscle pain; fatigue; a rash caused by or
made
worse by sunlight; low grade fevers; hair loss; pleurisy; appetite loss; sores in the nose or mouth;
or
painful sensitivity of fingers to the cold.

<P>The Central New York Chapter is dedicated to improving the quality of life for lupus patients
and their
families. Their mission is to educate and inform lupus patients, their families, the medical
community,
and the general public; support lupus patients and their families by providing moral support,
encouragement and service; and promote and support research for better treatment and an
eventual
cure.  </P>

<P><I>SERVICES :</I> It is the mission of the AIDS Council in Oswego County to increase personal and
community knowledge of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its impact on Oswego County residents.
Through
these efforts, the council hopes to minimize the prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection in Oswego
County.
Additionally, it is also the mission of the Council to enhance support services for persons with
HIV/AIDS and their families or significant other in Oswego County.

<P>Established in 1990, the AIDS Council in Oswego County was established as a coordinating
committee
in response to the need for a presence on HIV/AIDS issues for Oswego County residents who
would
otherwise have to seek assistance outside the County. The Council has both a Board of Directors
and
a volunteer organization which actively assists with coordination of services and education in
schools
and in the community.

<P>Along with sponsoring an annual essay/poster contest inviting entries from all school districts in
Oswego County, the Council is associated with a support group for those both affected by and
infected
with HIV/AIDS.

<P>The AIDS Council in Oswego County is incorporated in New York State and is recognized by the
IRS
as a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) foundation. As such, donations to the AIDS Council, to support its
mission,
are tax-deductible.

<P><I>HOURS :</I>   AIDS Council meetings are held the third Wednesday of each month at 3:30 PM in
the County Health Department, Bunner Street, Oswego. The Volunteers meet the second
Thursday of each month at 7:00 PM at the Oswego Hospital. Support group meetings
are held every other Friday from 7:30 tp 9:00 PM, call Penny Morley at the Red Cross

spearhead a mobilization of resources to ensure all children are physically, socially, emotionally and
behaviorally able to learn when entering school.

<P>Success-by-Six does not propose to create new agencies. It aims to share information with
agencies and families. It suggests new ways that government agencies, non-profit groups and
private industry can work together. For more information, contact the United Way of Greater
Oswego County office. </P>

<P><I>SERVICES :</I>

     <P>Children's Service helps youngsters (ages 5 - 12) affected by significant behavioral or other
     severe psychiatric issues and provides structure for stabilization. Separate tracks are available
     for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorders, Anger Management, Psychological Trauma and
     Mood Disorders.

     <P>Adolescent Service provides special treatment programs for youths (ages 12 - 18) who are
     affected by severe emotional problems. Whether the problem is depression, suicidal tendencies
     or disruptive behavioral tendencies, the program can be adapted to individual needs. Youths
     with emotional problems compounded by alcohol or drug abuse can also find specialized help
     through the Dual Diagnosis Track for Adolescents, which utilizes the Twelve-Step Program for
     addiction recovery.

    <P> Adult Service provides specialized and general programs for people (ages 18 and up) who are
     temporarily unable to cope with the stresses of everyday living. Individual, group and family
     therapy support components can restore emotional stability to individuals experiencing a recent
     problem with depression or anxiety, or a long-standing problem that has caused acute
     impairment.

    <P> Intensive Service provides a safe, low stimulation environment for individuals (ages 13 and up)
     suffering from extreme psychiatric illness. It is the ideal therapeutic environment for someone
     who has become highly agitated, volatile, psychotic or suicidal to achieve the proper balance
     for their rapid stabilization and well-being.

     <P>Dissociative Identity Disorder Track helps adults (ages 18 and up) with severe dysfunctional
     problems and distress, that may be a result of their suffering from prolonged episodes of
     psychological trauma. A safe, therapeutic and structured environment for individualized
     treatment will restore the patient's ability to function.

     <P>Dual Diagnosis Service is for adults (ages 18 and up) with a psychiatric disorder and an alcohol
     or drug program, or a combination of both. This intensive treatment will help these adults begin
     their recovery, from medical detoxification through a full psychiatric evaluation and
     stabilization. A Twelve Step Program, augmented with family therapy, couples counseling,
     group therapy and other programs, addresses specific treatment needs.

     <P>Eating Disorders Program for adolescents (ages 12 - 17) and adults (ages 18 and up) serves
     people with Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa or other serious eating disorders. The goal is
     to establish healthy eating habits in an atmosphere of caring and support. Flexible, individually-
     tailored treatment programs help teens or adults face their psychological and medical problems
     so they are able to return to their own environment, utilizing newly acquired insights and skills.

     <P>Trauma Recovery Program for men and women provides a safe environment for people to
     address psychological trauma caused by overwhelming life experiences. For someone suffering
     from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or other dissociative symptoms that may be
     caused by witnessing or personally going through traumatic experiences, this program offers
     a comprehensive range of specialized groups and individual therapy along with expressive
     therapy to deal with key issues.

     <P>Women's Program provides a unique opportunity for women to discuss sensitive issues with
     other women in the context of special therapy groups. These groups allow a woman to take
     time out for herself and get much needed support from other women experiencing similar
     problems. Survivor's issues (sexual abuse), body image, anxiety, self-esteem, depression,
     relationship and dysfunctional family issues are talked about in an atmosphere of empathy and
     support.

     <P>Partial Hospitalization for Adults (ages 18 and up) provides a continuum of care between
     traditional outpatient services and inpatient hospitalization. The program is designed to provide
     active treatment to stabilize and ameliorate acute symptoms, to serve as an alternative to
     inpatient hospitalization, or to reduce the length of stay in a hospital within a medically
     supervised program. Partial hospitalization has three specific treatment tracks with the more
     generic schedule, including Eating Disorders, Dual Diagnosis (MICA issues) and Trauma
     Reactions. All of the patients in the specialized tracks also attend other program groups that
     are relevant to their issues, such as those for depression, anxiety, anger and self-esteem and
     other concerns.</P>

<P><I>SERVICES :</I> Offers a community-based program that provides intensive intervention services to
youth
and families who are presently separated or about to be separated by institutional, group home or
foster family care. The program accepts referrals from the Oswego County Department of Social
Services.  

<P>Through the Advocacy model, a consistent relationship is developed between a supportive, trained
staff
member (advocate) and a troubled young person and family. Advocates are assigned to work with
troubled young people in individual, small group and familial activities. Services are provided to
the
youth, his parent or caretaker, siblings and/or extended family members as needed. 

<P>Based on the assessment of youth/family needs, a service plan will be tailored to meet specific
needs
for service, support and education. Services include individual and family advocacy; brokerage of
needed services; group work/youth and parent support groups; companionship/mentoring;
educational
and vocational assistance; behavior management; and life skills development.

<P>After the advocate has stabilized the youth in the community, the supportive work program is used
for
those youth whose goal is employment. Employment not only offers the young person the ability
for
self support but also a major influence on the nature of one's associates, the use of leisure time, the
development of positive self-image and the development of future expectations.</P>

<P><FONT Size=6>L</FONT>ake Ontario may indeed be the smallest of the Great Lakes, but
for Oswego County fishermen it's landed some of the biggest catches.</P>

<P>Whether anglers are fishing offshore, or along one of the lake' s numerous river mouths and/or
tributaries, they'll find abundant chinook and coho salmon, rainbow, brown and lake trout,
steelhead, smallmouth bass and perch.</P>

<P>The early spring on Lake Ontario and its accompanying outlets provides excellent fishing
opportunities for rainbows, steelhead and lake trout. The lake trout move into shallow, near-shore
waters following the winter months, drawn in by warmer water temperatures and excessive
forage fish. By April and early May, the fish can be found almost anywhere along the shore, with
the best areas at the north of major tributaries, warm water discharges, major piers, sand bars and
rocky points. The rainbows and steelhead usually begin to move off shore by late April,
following their periods of spawning in the rivers and streams, during the winter.

<P>Throughout the spring and into summer, visiting anglers can expect exciting fishing for
coho and chinook salmon. By mid-June, the brown trout usually move out into the deeper waters,
providing anglers with very promising deep-trolling activity. Rainbows, lake trout and bass are
also very active during the summer trolling periods.</P>

<P>In the early fall, a majority of the rainbows, chinook and coho salmon head toward the river 
mouths and tributaries, furnishing shore fishermen with easier access and outstanding fishing. 
Smallmouth bass, however, tend to stay a bit further out and provide good fishing around Nine
Mile Point, along the breakwalls at Oswego near Fort Ontario, Selkirk Shores State Park, at the
mouth of the Salmon River and at the North Sandy Pond entrance. The bass favor cobble or
rocky bottoms, and are attracted to structures such as shoals and submerged ledges. </P>

<P>For consistently good fishing for brown trout, the late fall and winter months are ideal, and
fishermen should focus their efforts on the warm water discharges at the power plants. Many of
the rainbows and steelhead return to the streams and rivers during October in anticipation of their
winter spawning, and usually remain there until late April.</P>

<H3><I><A NAME="lure">FAVORITE LURES</A></I></H3>

<P>For trout and salmon, try Hot-n-Tops and Hot Shots, large plugs, dodgers, trailing hooks,
fluorescent spoons, baitfish and spinners. For smallmouth bass, crabs, minnows, worms, small
plugs and spinners. For perch, worms, small minnows, grubs and perch eyes.</P>

<H3><I><A NAME="reg">SPECIAL REGULATIONS</A></I></H3>

<P>Consult a current New York State Fishing Regulations Guide available from all license-issuing agents. Almost everyone 16 years and older must have a N.Y.S. license to fish in
freshwater.  Licenses are available from many bait and tackle shops, Town and County Clerks, or
send requests for mail applications to N.Y.S. Department of Environmental Conservation.

<H3><I><A NAME="tips">TIPS</A></I></H3>
<UL>
<LI>Dodgers help attract salmon and trout while trolling.
<LI>Running several lures at a time will work well.
<LI>Trolling speed is very significant.
<LI>Know preferred water temperatures for the various species.
<LI>Follow the thermocline, the layer of water in which a rapid change of temperature occurs.

thousands of fishermen annually from throughout the United States and Canada.</P>

<P>    The river's year-round fishing activities begin in the spring, when the melting snow of
winter swells the tributaries, and marks the welcomed return of hard-fighting steelhead.</P> 

<P>     For steelhead, spring means their spawning season -- but for visiting anglers, it means not
only excellent fishing for steelies, but for bullhead and rock bass as well.</P>

<IMG SRC="wedge.jpg" ALIGN=LEFT ALIGN=MIDDLE WIDTH=125 HSPACE=7
VSPACE=7><P>    While the major cycles of trout and salmon runs are in early September, the
river's
summer trout and salmon fishing provides some excitement of its own. Anglers can expect some
solid fishing for brown trout and Atlantic salmon as early as mid-July, with browns weighing in
at 10 to 15 pounds.</P>

<P>    The Salmon River's notoriety for excellent salmon fishing is most evident in the fall. It's
during the first week of September, that the chinook and coho salmon spawning period begins, as
the fish move into the area from the mouth of the river at Port Ontario.  The salmon generally
hold in the deeper pools of the river during their spawning runs, which last until the beginning of
November.  Although the fish do not actually feed during that period, they can be enticed to
strike by a variety of baits.</P>

<P>    By late October and into November, rainbow trout and steelhead fishing becomes quite
abundant, and provides fishermen with the challenge of landing the tenacious fish throughout the
winter.</P>

<P>    Throughout the fishing season, visiting anglers can expect good smallmouth bass fishing
everywhere below Pulaski, with the best catches being taken from the estuary at the mouth of the
river. Expect the northern pike and largemouth bass in the weedier, backwater areas.</P>

<H3><I><A NAME="tips">TIPS</A></I></H3>
<UL>
<LI>Use small 10, 12, and 14 sized flies for salmon and trout.
<LI>Fishing from a drift boat is often best when fish are spooked by crowds, or when access to
the river is difficult.
<LI>Try brightly colored egg sacks and flies first. If unsuccessful, switch over to darker colors.
<LI>When temperature is above freezing, worms will work very well for salmon and trout, as
well as other species.
<LI>Use a very light line (4-6 lb. test) for steelhead.

<P><FONT SIZE=6>T</FONT>he Oswego River offers a diverse selection of fishing
opportunities from Three Rivers near Phoenix to its convergence with Lake Ontario in the City
of Oswego.</P>

 <P>In the winter, almost all of the fishing action is concentrated in the Oswego Harbor area.
Steelhead and rainbow trout remain in the river throughout the season, and become most active
during warm spells. </P>
<P>When spring arrives, the activity spreads out along the entire length of the river. The
steelhead in the lower stretch of the river become most active during March and early April. As
the river thaws, other fish become accessibleincluding white perch, white bass, bullhead,
crappies, catfish and carp. </P>
<P>The summer heralds the beginning of bass season. Smallmouth bass are common throughout
the river, and these fish like to congregate below the dams and locks and in the deeper areas.
Northern pike and largemouth bass can be found in the weedy, more stagnant sections of the
river. Some of the best spots for these gamefish are at the mouth and into Ox Creek, just south of
Fulton, and around Battle Island, to the north of Fulton. </P>
<P>Walleye can be found year round in the Oswego River, and these fish are most active during
the peak of the summer. Although they can be found around most of the dropoffs in the river, the
best fishing is usually found in the Oswego Harbor area. </P>
<P>In the fall, huge schools of salmon and trout begin to make their runs into the Oswego River
from Lake Ontario. These include chinook and coho salmon, and brown and lake trout. The fish
are easily accessible for shore and boat fishermen, whoby using egg sacks and spoons can
expect some exciting fall fishing action. </P>
<P>Once the fishing for salmon and brown trout begins to fade, waves of steelhead and rainbow 
trout head upriver. These will continue to enter the river throughout the warmer periods of the
winter, and will stay until spring. </P>

<P>City of Oswego, Battle Island, Ox Creek, Three Rivers, Big Island.</P>


<H3><I><A NAME="lure">FAVORITE LURES</A></I></H3>
<P>For trout and salmon, try Hot-n-Tops and Hot Shots, egg sacks, steelie stoppers and yarn
flies. For walleye, drifted worm rigs and jigs. For smallmouth bass, crabs, minnows, worms,
small plugs and spinners. For largemouth bass, worms, crayfish, plastic worms, spinners and
buzzbaits. </P>

<H3><I><A NAME="reg">SPECIAL REGULATIONS</A></I></H3>
<P>There are special regulations for the river section between  Utica Street Bridge and the
Varick Street Dam in Oswego . These regulations are subject to change. Please consult a current

<H3><I><A NAME="tips">TIPS</A></I></H3>
<UL>
<LI>For trout, salmon and walleye, try calmer pools in the river and let the bait drift near the
bottom. 
<LI>Steelhead are most active during a warm period after a cold spell, with the best fishing in
the harbor area just below the dam. 
<LI>For smallmouth bass check out the fast waters below the dams and lock spillway and the
deeper holes of the river. 
<LI>Look for northern pike and largemouth bass in the slack water areas and in weedbeds with
drop-offs.

<H3><I><A NAME="desc">DESCRIPTION</A></I></H3>
<P><FONT SIZE=6>R<FONT>ecognized as "The Walleye Lake of New York State," Oneida
Lake is not only the largest inland lake in the State, covering 51,072 acres, but it also provides
anglers with more fish per acre than any other lake in the northeastern United States !</P>

<P>Fishing in Oneida Lake means 58 different species -- including walleye, yellow perch, black
bass, panfish, white perch, bass and bullhead -- making Oswego  County's north shore of the lake
a year-round angler's paradise!</P>

<P>Bass and walleye fishing derbies held at the lake offer anglers great fishing, as well as big
cash and merchandise prizes throughout the year, while the onset of winter allows for some
prizes of its own, with excellent ice fishing.</P>

<P>Spring is an especially exciting time for fishermen and helps explain why Oneida Lake is
referred to as "The Walleye Lake of New York State." By the middle of May, walleye become
very active with  the warmer temperatures, and their abundance means limit catches for visiting
fishermen. Trolling is quite good along the entire north shore, from late spring into the  early
summer, providing walleye, bass, and perch.</P>

<P>The end of July is prime time fishing for smallmouth bass, largemouth bass and perch, which
are found lavishly   throughout the lake. The smallmouth bass usually congregate in the shallows
around islands, rockpiles and rabble, while the largemouths are found at the edges of the small
breaks in the weeds. The perch are also found in shallow weedy areas, like Big Bay and in the
weedbeds just west of Frenchman's Island.</P>

<P>In the late fall, walleye once again dominate the lake, providing anglers with spectacular
fishing. The Cleveland Bar has always maintained a good reputation for strong walleye fishing,
as well as perch and smallmouth bass.</P>

<P>The north side of the islands provides good weeds for perch and smallmouth, while walleye are
found to the south of the bar at large drop-offs. Walleye prefer to feed during periods of low
light, and will often leave the deeper water and move into the near-shore waters at dusk and
dawn
for their food supply.</P>

<P>When the lake freezes over during the winter months, ice fisherman set  up tents and tip-ups
to share in the wealth of walleye, perch, crappie and panfish. Big Bay is one of the best ice
fishing spots, and the action is best when the lake is only partially -- yet safely -frozen.</P>

<P>Whether it's during winter ice fishing or summer trolling, Oswego County's north shore of
Oneida Lake, is indeed an angler's paradise! </P>

<H3><I><A NAME="hot">HOT SPOTS</A></I></H3>
<P>Willard Isle, Big Bay, Cleveland Bar and just west of Frenchman's Island.</P>

<H3><I><A NAME="lure">FAVORITE LURES</A></I></H3>
<P>For walleye, have baits, or deepdiving plugs that resemble bait fish, spinners with worms, and
bright spoons. For smallmouth bass, crabs, minnows, worms, small plugs and spinners. For
largemouth bass, live baits, such as worms or crayfish, spinners or buzzbaits on surface, and
plastic worms on bottom. For perch, worms, small minnows, grubs and perch eyes.</P>

<LI>When rigging worms for walleye, hook once near the head to let the worm dangle naturally,
and give the walleye sufficient time to engulf the bait.

<P>The Oswego River offers excellent steelhead fishing below the first dam
from both shore and driftboat.

<P>Oneida Lake is best known for its yellow perch and walleye. For panfish
and perch, concentrate your efforts in the channel and in other deep
areas of the lake. If it's walleye you're pursuing, try fishing in the channel
off the north side of Frenchman's Island.

<P>Sandy Pond is another hot spot during the winter months, with excellent
opportunities for northern pike, yellow perch and panfish.

<P>Other popular areas for ice fishing include: Lake Neahtahwanta in
Fulton, Mexico Point, and smaller ponds throughout the County.

<P>There are specific regulations for ice fishing in New York State, and
they may be different for each body of water. These rules are published
in the "New York State Fishing Regulations Guide," which you should

<P><FONT SIZE=6>N</FONT>ew York's Salmon River Fish Hatchery and Oneida Lake Fish
Cultural Station are among the most modern facilities in North America. The Salmon River
Hatchery
in Altmar produces about four million trout and salmon each year to help make sportfishing
opportunities in New York among the best in the world. The Oneida Lake Fish Cultural Station
in
Constantia is the largest, state-of-the-art walleye hatchery in the country and the first facility in
North America intensively rearing large numbers of fingerling walleye.</P>

<P>The Salmon River Fish Hatchery, which began operation in 1981, is part of a major effort by
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) to meet stocking needs
of
Lakes Erie, Ontario and Champlain and their tributaries. The hatchery raises 250,000 coho
salmon,
3.2 million chinook salmon, 600,000 steelhead, 200,000 landlocked Atlantic salmon, and
300,000
brown trout each year.</P>

<P>The Oneida Lake Fish Cultural Station was renovated and expanded in 1993, and is the most
modern facility of its kind. According to recent DEC statewide angler surveys, walleye ranks
third
after bass and brown trout as the most sought after fish. The facility's capacity is 400 million
eggs,
producing 200 million fry and 250,000 to 300,000 4-inch to 5-inch fingerlings.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>A</FONT>t one time, Lake Ontario supported the largest population of
lake-dwelling Atlantic salmon known to man, while both Lakes Erie and Ontario were excellent
lake
trout fisheries. However, by 1900 the salmon had vanished. By 1950 the lake trout had also
disappeared from most of the Great Lakes. What happened? Destruction of habitat, over fishing,
predation by an exotic parasitic fish called the sea lamprey, and numerous dams which prevented
salmon from reaching spawning streams all led to the disappearance of these spectacular
fish.</P>

<P>Human disturbances and over exploitation also resulted in the substantial loss of the walleye
population in New York's waters. Walleye is a highly popular sport fish due to its excellent
eating
quality. The Oneida Lake Hatchery's purpose is to increase walleye population in 89 existing
lakes.</P>

<P>Through the work of the two hatcheries, world class sports fisheries have been created in the
waters of New York and the Great Lakes.</P>

<H2><I><A NAME="raise">Raising Trout, Salmon, and Walleye</A></I></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>T</FONT>he hatchery operations are based on the reproductive cycles of
trout, salmon and walleye. Each fall chinook and coho salmon from Lake Ontario swim up the
Salmon River, then Beaverdam Brook, and finally up the ladder to the Salmon River Hatchery.
One
to three years earlier, these same fish were released from the hatchery smolt pond and swam
down
the same route to reach Lake Ontario.</P>

<P>During spawning operations, eggs and milt from adults are combined to start a new
generation.
Up to nine million salmon eggs can be incubated at one time at the Salmon River Hatchery. The
eggs
hatch after about one month and are transferred to "start tanks" after they have absorbed their
yolk
sac, about one month later.</P>

<P>While in the start tanks, the young salmon, now called fry, grow to about three inches in
length
and are then called fingerlings. Chinook salmon are stocked at this size, about six months after
hatching. Coho salmon are raised an additional year in the outdoor raceways and released the
following spring, at about five to six inches long.</P>

<P>Steelhead, which spawn in the spring, are also raised at the Salmon River Hatchery and are
stocked at about one year of age. Brown trout and landlocked Atlantic salmon, which spawn in
the
fall, are transferred in as fingerlings from other hatcheries and raised until about 14 months of
age.</P>

<P>Trout and salmon raised at the Salmon River Hatchery are trucked to stocking sites and
released into tributaries, harbors or directly into the lakes. Once in the lakes, the young fish grow
rapidly. Chinook salmon in Lake Ontario, for example, may exceed 40 pounds after five
summers, while brown trout and steelhead may exceed 20 pounds. The current Great Lakes
record chinook (47-pounds, 13-ounces) and world record coho (33-pounds, 4-ounces) were
caught in the Salmon River during their spawning run to the Salmon River Hatchery. When
mature, salmon and steelhead return to the stocking site to spawn. Those released directly from
the hatchery return to it to start the cycle again.</P>

<P>Adult walleye are collected in 20-25 trap nets set in Oneida Lake. They are transported to the
Oneida Lake Hatchery in boats and placed in adult holding tanks. Here, the walleye are hand
sorted
as to male, ripe female (capable of being stripped on day of collection) or hard female (to be held
for later stripping). To collect the 400 million eggs the hatchery needs, over 40,000 walleye are
handled each year. This process usually occurs in an 8 - 14 day period during the first week or
two
of April. Fingerling rearing begins after the 21 -day egg incubation period when newly-hatched
fry
are ready to be fed brine shrimp. After consuming brine shrimp for 40 days, the walleyes are then
switched to a formulated diet, reared for 100 days or more, and are released at four to five inches
in
length.</P>

<P>The Oneida Lake Fish Cultural Station will help in the restoration of self-sustaining and
abundant walleye population in 33 waters. The hatchery is also trying to introduce and establish
new
walleye populations in 21 waters.</P>

<H2><I><A NAME="visit">Visitor Hours</A></I></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>T</FONT>he Salmon River Hatchery is open to the public from 9 a.m. to
4
p.m. seven days a week from March 15 to November 30. Informative exhibits, including
mounted
and live fish, introduce visitors to fish hatchery operations and the DEC's Great Lakes
Management
Program. A self-guided tour allows visitors to watch hatchery operations. Depending on the time
of
year, visitors may observe fish swimming into the hatchery, the egg taking process, and fish
tagging.</P>

<P>Most people enjoy visiting the hatchery during the spawning seasons -- Salmon spawn in
October and steelhead spawn in late March/early April. You may call the hatchery in advance of
your visit to find out which activities are in progress. Approximately 200,000 visitors view the
facility annually.</P>

<P>The Oneida Lake Fish Cultural Station is open from April 1 to September 30 seven days a
week
from 8 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The adult walleye collection in April is the most interesting to the
public
since large adult walleyes can be viewed at the hatchery. Tour guides will be available at this
time.
Group tours can be arranged by contacting the hatchery.</P>

	<P>At the end of this year I'll be retiring from government service.  The past 26 years have been a great experience for me.  I've had my share of happy and rewarding times, and I've taken my fair share of lumps and criticisms.  That's par for the course for anyone who enters public service.
	<P>It was Chuck Ely, the former Republican Committee Chairman, who first pulled me into politics.  When he first asked me to run for Town Supervisor in Schroeppel I said "no."  And I said "no" the next few times he asked, too.  I didn't want anything to do with politics.  Like most regular Americans, I thought politics was a messy business full of untrustworthy people.  I wanted no part of it.
	<P>But, Chuck finally convinced me to run.  My opponent was considered "unbeatable." I won by two votes, and for a while people called me "Landslide."
	<P>Over the years I served as Town Supervisor of Schroeppel, County Legislator, Chairman of the Legislature, Superintendent of Public Works, and County Administrator.  As I became more involved in politics, I learned that I was wrong in my first opinion of politics and government.  I discovered it was just like any other profession: there are those people who are honest, hard-working, and good at their jobs, and there are some who are not.
	<P>I've had the privilege of serving and working with many fine decent people at all levels of government, many of whom are still serving the public.
	<P>One of those is the person who will replace me as County Administrator, John "Jack" Tierney.  Jack served as my deputy for several years and I can think of no one better to do the job.  Jack is a real pro.  Whereas I advanced through the political system, Jack has advanced through the professional ranks.   He knows this county inside and out, and he understands residents' needs and desires.  Even people who regularly criticize the county have expressed their respect and confidence in Jack.  That says a lot about him.
	<P>Doug Hartranft, our Budget Officer, is another person who has my respect and confidence.  Doug will be taking over Jack's old job as Deputy County Administrator.  Jack has made a wise decision to move responsibility for developing the county budget into the Administrator's Office.  Doug's meticulous oversight of the county budget has greatly helped the legislature reduce spending and cut taxes for the past four straight years.  Doug's the right person for this job.  He and Jack make an effective team which the public can trust.
	<P>I've seen a lot of changes and faced many hard decisions during the past three decades in government.  Most of the changes have been for the better.  I've seen Oswego County become a leader in New York State in many areas.  We're recognized and respected for our solid waste management, highway maintenance, tourism promotion, community planning, youth services, and many other programs.  Now I'm seeing our social services department become a state leader in welfare reform and cost reduction through its "Jobs First" initiative.  And our County Airport is on the verge of becoming an air university and real economic boon to the Fulton area.
	<P>During it all I have tried my best to follow the simple rule that you must do what is right and best for the people you serve, no matter what the political consequences may be.  
	<P>I've seen the disastrous results of governments run by fence-sitters and people who place more importance on their re-election than on doing what's right.
	<P>I've seen many wise, gutsy decisions which were unpopular when they were made.  Eventually, after a few years, the public often sees the wisdom of the decision and appreciates the political courage it took to do the right thing.
	<P>A good example is the recycling program.  Recycling received some opposition when it was proposed.  Critics said it wouldn't work and was too expensive.  Fortunately, courageous legislators, county employees, and many volunteers prevailed and created a state-of-the-art solid waste management and recycling program that is the envy of the nation.  
	<P>The recent decision to enact a county-wide sales tax is a similar situation.  Knowing that the sales tax was an unpopular idea, legislators who voted "yes" put their heads on the political chopping block to do what they believe is absolutely right and necessary for the long-term good of our communities.  
	<P>The best advice I have for those people I'm leaving behind in government is to keep forging ahead.  Do what you know is right and don't fear criticism from activists and the leaders of  political action committees who usually act in their own self interest.
	<P>Keep Oswego County moving ahead to provide the best possible quality of life for our residents.  Maintain our position as a county which other New York counties look to for progressive leadership.  Always place the long-term best interest of Oswego County communities first.  You will take some lumps for it, but in the long run you will have served the people well.
	<P>I began this "News From the County Building" column about four years ago.  I wanted a column that would be different from the usual political editorials.  The goal was to inform residents about county programs and some of the issues that affect our communities.
	<P>I wasn't sure if the column would be successful and attract readers.  Fortunately, it did.  Many people have told me they read it regularly and I've enjoyed hearing their comments and feedback.  It's proven to be a worthwhile effort.
	<P>In closing, I'd just like to say thank you to everyone who has supported me and helped me over the years, especially my wife Marianne and my children.  Although there have been many proud moments for me in government, nothing has given me more pleasure than the support of my family and watching them grow and prosper.
	<P>This isn't a goodbye, however.  Although the old rocking chair looks pretty comfortable, I've never been able to sit down for long.  I may not be involved in government on a daily basis anymore, but I plan to still be involved in politics and community service. 
	<P>So, for now, good luck, and keep moving ahead.  It's been fun.</P>

<!TEXT>

	<P>At the December meeting of the Oswego County Legislature, legislators strengthened the County Administrator position to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of county government.  
	<P>One of the recommendations of the Goals 2000+ Task Force was to create a strong "County Director" position as a transitional step to an elected county executive.  The task force said the director should serve a four-year term to offset the two-year term of county legislators.  They recommended that the  powers of the new office be strong enough to allow the director to carry out the task force's recommendations for improved efficiency in county government.
	<P>The changes made to the County Administrator's job description and powers are in line with the Goals 2000+ Task Force's report.  The key changes in the administrator's responsibilities: increase the term of appointment to four years; allow the administrator to hire and fire the deputy administrator, subject to confirmation from the legislature; hire department heads, subject to the legislature's confirmation; allow the administrator to transfer up to $10,000 within the equipment and contractual areas of department budgets, with the requirement that the Legislature be informed of the transfer; and make the administrator the county's Chief Budget Officer.
	<P>I am retiring at the end of this year, so the Legislator needed to appoint a new County Administrator to fill this strengthened position.  Legislators made an excellent choice and appointed my deputy John "Jack" Tierney.  Legislators also approved Jack's choice for Deputy Administrator, Douglas Hartranft, our present Budget Officer.  
	<P>Although legislators debated over the administrator's new responsibilities,   no one questioned Jack's or Doug's abilities.  Jack and Doug are absolutely the right people for these important jobs.  
	<P>In other business, the Legislature:
<UL>
<LI> 	Appointed James Terramiggi of Fulton as Republican Elections Commissioner and William Scriber of Parish as Democrat Elections Commissioner.
<LI> 	Sold three delinquent tax properties in the towns of Mexico and New Haven.
<LI> 	Urged the county's Industrial Development Agency to work quickly with the town of Minetto to gain title to the Columbia Mills site, demolish Building 11, encourage development of the site, and report back to the Legislature in two months.
<LI> 	Directed the County Department of Planning and Community Development to study the proposed Panther Lake Protection and Rehabilitation Tax District and report back to the Legislature.
<LI> 	Appointed the following people to the Oswego County Planning Board: Daniel Krupke, Richland; Paul Arena, Mexico; Cynthia Hirsh, Hannibal; and Robert Somers, Fulton.
<LI> 	Transferred $350,000 within the Health Department budget to cover increased costs for home health aides, personal care aides, and physical therapy visits.
<LI> 	Increased the Department of Promotion and Tourism's budget by $5,000 to cover the requirements of a New York State Canal Corporation matching grant.  The grant was used to re-print the county's "Canalling!" guidebook.
<LI> 	Accepted a $2,350 grant from the New York State Office for the Aging for health insurance information and counseling assistance services.
<LI> 	Transferred $10,248 within the Probation Department to cover shortfalls in several accounts, purchase computer equipment, and to cover anticipated shortfalls in the 1997 budget.
<LI> 	Accepted $8,000 in state aid to pay for programs for runaways and homeless youth.
<LI> 	Revised the county bed tax policy to hold municipalities more accountable for how they spend their portion of the bed tax; and to require the creation of local tourism promotion advisory boards in municipalities which receive more than $1,000 annually in bed tax revenue.
<LI> 	Agreed to share the maintenance and utility costs of the navigation lights on the Three Rivers Bridge with Onondaga County.
<LI> 	Established Dec. 2, 1996 as the date for the re-levy of unpaid school taxes.
<LI> 	Appropriated monies for the conduct of county government, as specified in the approved 1997 county budget.
<LI> 	Authorized the County Treasurer and Budget Officer to adjust the budgets of several offices until the close of business in 1996.
<LI> 	Approved continuing fully funded grant projects which are continuing from 1996 to 1997.
<LI> 	Began the annual dog quarantine, which is in effect until April 30, 1997.
<LI> 	Authorized the Legislature Chairman and Clerk of the Legislature to handle all unfinished business until the 1997 organizational meeting.
<LI> 	Scheduled the Legislature's organizational meeting for Thursday, Jan. 6, 1997 at 2 p.m. in the Chambers of the County Legislature, 46 East Bridge Street, Oswego.
<LI> 	Scheduled a public hearing for Thursday, Jan, 6, 1997 at 2 p.m. in the Chambers of the County Legislature, 46 East Bridge Street, Oswego about proposed Local Law Number 1 of 1997 which would create the position of Director of Youth and Aging; and 
<LI> 	Honored the following employees, who are retiring at the end of the year: Elections Commissioner Paula Prior, Schroeppel; Elections Commissioner Joanne Brace, Oswego Town; Elections Secretary Betty Anderson, New Haven; and Elizabeth DeSantis, coordinator of programs for children with special needs.

<!TEXT>

 	
	<P>In a column last month I described the benefits of Oswego County's new "800 trunking" emergency radio communications system.  When the system becomes operational you will probably hear and read more about the 800-trunking system.  The 800 trunking system is completely separate from the enhanced 9-1-1 emergency calling system.
	<P>The E-911 system is expected to become operational late in 1997.  When 9-1-1 is ready to begin, there will be widespread publicity in the newspapers and on radio and television.  Until then, Oswego County residents should continue to use their local seven-digit emergency telephone numbers to call for help from police, fire, and ambulance crews.
	<P>800 trunking and E-911 are two separate communication systems.  The two independent systems don't need each other to function, but they will eventually work together to provide the best possible emergency communications in the county.
	<P>The difference between the 800-trunking system and E-911 is simple:  800-trunking is a radio system used only by emergency personnel and county agencies;  E-911 is a telephone emergency dispatch system used by the general public to call for help in an emergency.   
	<P>When the E-911 emergency calling system begins several months from now, you will be able to call for emergency assistance simply by dialing nine-one-one on a telephone.  Your call will be answered by a dispatcher at the Public Safety Center on Churchill Road in Oswego.  The dispatcher will immediately know where you are, even if you can't talk,  because the street addresses of all telephone numbers have been programmed into E-911's computer.  
	<P>This is the point in an emergency situation when the E-911 communication ends and the 800-trunking communication system begins.
	The dispatcher will use the radio system to contact the nearest police, fire, or ambulance personnel and send them to your location.  The 800-trunking radio system eliminates signal interference from radio systems in other counties.  The new radio system will allow all our emergency agencies to use the same radio system, something they cannot do now.  Health officials, highway crews, police, fire fighters, ambulance crews, and emergency management officials will be able to contact each other directly by radio.  Radio communication between all these agencies will be smooth and uninterrupted because the "trunking" technology will prevent radio channels from becoming bogged down.  
	  <P>Emergency personnel will be using the new radio system several months before 9-1-1 can be used by the public.  Even without a working 9-1-1 system, the new radio system will improve the coordination of emergency relief efforts, and shorten the response time of emergency personnel.  When 9-1-1 becomes operational and begins working with the 800-trunking system, it will improve efficiency and response times even more.</P>

	<P>This year's Christmas shopping season is a week shorter than usual because of the late Thanksgiving holiday.  But before you panic and take off for a mall in another county, stop and think about buying those gifts at a local store instead.
	<P>The Oswego County Chambers of Commerce Council estimates that if residents and businesses purchased just 5 percent more of their goods and services in Oswego County, an additional $68 million would enter the local economy.  For this reason, the council began its "Plus 5 - Buy Locally" campaign in 1994.
	<P>This campaign encourages all businesses and residents to buy 5 percent more locally this year than they did last year.  During the Christmas season, the council is asking all of us to buy five more gifts locally than we did last Christmas.  
	<P>The Chambers of Commerce Council is running a series of ads in local newspapers promoting local events to stimulate local buying.  These events include open houses at businesses, holiday expos, tree lighting ceremonies, and attractions such as "Light-Up Pulaski."
	<P>Through surveys and economic extrapolations conducted in 1994, the council determined that local residents and businesses purchase 90 percent of their goods and services from companies outside Oswego County.  Nearly $1.3 billion leaves our local economy each year because of these "outside" purchases.  Just think what some of that $1.3 billion could do for local businesses, their employees and families if it stayed here in Oswego County.
	<P>Its not just business owners who profit from more local purchases.  Buying locally benefits everyone in the community by helping to stimulate the local economy.    More money flowing through the local economy gives businesses the opportunity to expand and create jobs.  Employees and their families benefit from better wages and benefits, and are able to spend more at other local businesses.
	<P>So, before you pick up the phone to mail-order a gift, or before you jump in the car to go to the mall, think about doing your Christmas shopping locally this year.  It's an easy way to help your local economy, and ultimately, yourself.
	<P>For more information about the Plus 5 - Buy Locally campaign, contact Nancy Bellow, director of work force development, SUNY Oswego Center for Business and Community Programs, weekdays, phone 341-3492.
	<P>The Plus 5 - Buy Locally campaign is a successful example of how chambers of commerce throughout the county can work together to improve the economy and help businesses in all communities.

<!TEXT>

	<P>Police officers in Oswego County can now seize vehicles and money used in connection with drug-related misdemeanors.  
	<P>This hard-line approach to fighting drug crime was adopted into law by the Oswego County Legislature at its meeting in November.  The goals of the seizure and forfeiture law are to remove the potential profit in illegal drug activities, and to create new financial resources to help pay for law enforcement and drug treatment and education programs.	
	<P>Drug-related misdemeanors are illegal activities such as criminal possession of hypodermic instruments, or criminal possession or sale of small amounts of marihuana or other controlled substances.   Previously, the seizure of vehicles and money was allowed under federal law only for more serious drug crimes.
	<P>The seizure and forfeiture law was sponsored by the County Legislature's General Government Committee, which is chaired by Legislator Fay Reid, 1st District, Sandy Creek.  Other committee members include legislators Henry Babcock, 18th District, Oswego; Ray Chesbro, 10th District, Phoenix;  Frank Church, 14th District, Scriba; Leonard Ponzi, 17th District, Oswego; and Morris Sorbello, 23rd District, Granby.
	<P>This new law authorizes police to seize vehicles used in drug-related misdemeanors, including cars, trucks, all-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles, boats, and aircraft.  The vehicles may be sold at public auction, or kept by police agencies and the District Attorney's Office for use in law enforcement activities.  The law applies to vehicles worth $2,500 or less.  Federal law requires vehicles of greater value to be turned over to federal law enforcement agencies.
	<P>The local law also allows police to seize all monies used in connection with drug-related misdemeanors, including currency, traveler's checks, cashier's checks, bonds, stocks, negotiable instruments, and securities.  Any type of proceed or thing of value used in exchange for marihuana or a controlled substance can be confiscated.
	<P>Vehicles or money used in a drug crime without the owner's knowledge will also be seized.  However,  these may be returned if the owner can establish that he or she did not know that the vehicle or money was being used for an illegal purpose.
	<P>Seized money and funds from the sale of confiscated vehicles will be distributed two ways.  Fifty percent of the cash will be used by the Oswego County District Attorney's Office to help pay for drug treatment programs and law enforcement activities.  The other 50 percent goes to the police agency that seized the property.
	<P>There is justice in this new seizure and forfeiture law: people who commit drug crimes end up helping to pay the costs of arresting, prosecuting, and treating criminals involved in illegal drug activities.

<!TEXT>


	<P>Could a large fire 180 miles away in Rensselaer interfere with a local fire department's efforts to respond to a fire in Oswego County?  The answer is yes.  Radio signals coming from emergency agencies outside Oswego County often interfere with our local emergency radio communications, causing fire dispatchers to temporarily lose contact with fire fighters in the field.
	<P>Signal interference is not the only problem with the current radio systems.  Emergency agencies can't communicate with each other by radio, because each agency's radios use different frequencies.
	<P>Beginning in 1997, Oswego County's new "800 trunking" radio communications system will end such problems and greatly improve emergency communications in other ways.  
	<P>The new radio system will eliminate signal interference from other areas and improve radio communications with emergency agencies in neighboring counties.  Emergency personnel will no longer have to wait for an open radio channel to send a message.
	<P>More importantly, all our emergency agencies will be using the same radio system.  For the first time ever, health officials, highway crews, police, fire fighters, ambulance crews, and emergency management officials will be able to contact each other directly by radio.  This will result in better coordination of emergency situations, and emergency personnel will be able to respond to accidents and crises more quickly.
	<P>For example, if a highway crew worker sees an auto accident, he will be able to use his radio to call an ambulance directly, instead of reporting it to the highway dispatcher who would then call an ambulance.  The time saved could save a life.
	<P>The new radio system will prevent signal interference by transmitting at 800 megacycles.   Radio signals are immediately "trunked," or routed, to the nearest available radio channel, allowing for uninterrupted transmissions.  Low and high-band scanners will not be able to follow emergency communications transmitted at 800 megacycles.  This is a small sacrifice to make for greatly enhanced safety, security, and faster response times for police, fire, and ambulance services.
	<P>Emergency radio communications will be coordinated from the E-911 Office at the Public Safety Center (PSC).  Signals between the PSC and three radio towers will be transmitted by microwave.  The towers, located in Boylston, Hastings, and Oswego, relay signals between the PSC and radio units in the field.
	<P>The 800 trunking system will provide dependable emergency radio communications to a minimum of 95 percent of the county.   Areas which may lack coverage include the lakes and unpopulated forest areas.
	<P>800 trunking and the E-911 are two separate systems.  The 800 trunking system coordinates radio communications among emergency personnel.  E-911 is a telephone system which allows the public to call for emergency assistance by dialing nine - one - one.  The 800 trunking system will become operational around the first of the year.  The E-911 system will be completed later in 1997.
	<P>Development of the 800 trunking system is being overseen by the County Legislature's Fire and Emergency Management Committee.  The committee is chaired by Legislator Stephen Balcom, 3rd District, Pulaski.  Other members include Legislators Bruce Bisbo, 6th District, West Monroe; Earl Chesbro, 12th District, Schroeppel; Russ Johnson, 25th District, Fulton; Clyde Osborne, 11th District, Volney; and Don Wahrendorf, 19th District, Minetto.
	<P>Two years ago the Oswego County Legislature bonded $5.8 million to pay for the 800 trunking system.  The E.F. Johnson Company of Minnesota won the contract to build the radio system.  Ninety-eight  percent of the project was completed using local labor and resources.
	<P>The project has been directed by Deputy County Administrator Jack Tierney, Fire Coordinator Wilfred Denery, and E-911 Director Robert Hayes.</P>

	<P>One year ago, the Oswego community came together to take charge of the problem of alcohol and drug use among young people.   Parents, students, human service workers, law enforcement officials, government officials, business leaders, and the news media worked together to create a coalition to fight teenage substance abuse.
	<P>The Oswego Community Exchange and its "Take Charge" campaign will celebrate their first anniversary at a free event open to the public, Wednesday, Nov. 20., 7 p.m. at the Elks Lodge in Oswego.  There is a lot to celebrate.  The accomplishments of the Take Charge Coalition are numerous and meaningful.
	 <P>The community exchange program held last year was  a series of educational workshops and events about substance abuse.  The event was attended by people from all sectors of the Oswego community.  As a result of the community exchange, over 60 people volunteered to work on committees throughout the year to reduce alcohol and substance abuse.
	<P>During the past year, the Take Charge Coalition contacted the owners or operators of all the taverns and stores with liquor licenses in Oswego.  Eleven taverns and seven stores have taken the "Partnership Pledge" to help combat underage drinking.
	<P>The coalition conducted the first of a series of Training for Intervention Procedures (TIPS) workshops.  These workshops train workers who serve alcohol about prevention methods, such as how to recognize intoxicated customers and underage drinkers.
	<P>To tackle the problem of teens having alcohol parties at home, the coalition developed a brochure which informed parents about the legal penalties parents may face for allowing such parties to take place.  The brochure also provides advice about how to plan and control an alcohol-free party for teenagers.  A copy of the brochure was mailed to the parents of every Oswego High School senior in June 1996.
	<P>In addition, the coalition presented a workshop about its programs at the New York State Association of Youth Bureaus Conference.
	<P>The coalition plans to do even more in the future.  Coalition leaders are working with Assemblywoman Frances Sullivan and State Senator James Wright to track state legislation affecting substance abuse.  Educational materials and t-shirts are being developed to promote drug and alcohol-free activities for young people.  The coalition also plans to address the problem of taverns and college Greek organizations which continue to promote or allow underage consumption.
	<P>The Oswego County Legislature is a proud sponsor of the Take Charge Coalition.  For its part in the coalition, Oswego County received an achievement award from the National Association of Counties.
	<P>The coalition still has many challenges ahead of it.  If you would like more information, or want to know how you can help, contact Jane Murphy, administrative assistant to the county administrator, weekdays, phone 349-8235.</P>

<! INSERT THE NEWS RELEASE'S BODY HERE AND PLACE A paragraph code  AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PARAGRAPH>

	<P>Last week, Governor George Pataki announced that the Port of Oswego Authority will receive $3 million in state funding to improve the port's infrastructure.  These capital improvement projects will result in more economic development opportunities in Oswego County and central New York.
	<P>The presence of active, well-equipped ports along major waterways has always been an important factor in the economic strength of nations and communities.  The Port of Oswego is no exception.  As the first port-of-call on the Great Lakes and a terminus on the New York State Canal System, Oswego's port is a major commercial shipping link serving the northeastern United States, Canada, and the Midwest.  
	<P>The port is also important to international trade via the St. Lawrence River Seaway route to the Atlantic Ocean.  Vessels from Europe and as far away as Asia utilize Oswego's port.  The most common cargos loaded, unloaded, or stored at the port are limestone, fertilizer, salt, aluminum, and machinery used in industrial applications.
	<P>Despite its importance to our local and regional economy, the port had not received any financial assistance for capital improvements from the state for over 10 years, making the port less able to compete for business.
	<P>Thanks to the efforts of Governor Pataki; State Senator James Wright, 46th District, Watertown; Assemblywoman Francis Sullivan, 117th District, Volney; and Port of Oswego Authority Executive Director Thomas McAuslan, the port now has an opportunity to reach its economic potential.
	<P>The $3 million in funding for the port will be used to demolish the deteriorated grain elevator on the  west side of the harbor and the blue warehouse on the east side.  Demolition of the grain elevator will eliminate an eyesore and create new opportunities for business and tourism development at the site.  The blue warehouse will be replaced by a modern bulk storage facility.
	<P>The new storage facility, combined with improvements to the port's railway system and machinery, will allow the port to serve a broader variety of customers and handle additional cargos.  The port's services will be greatly enhanced, as will it's competitiveness in the global economy.
	<P>The $3 million in funding is being provided through the Multi-Modal Program included in the 1996-97 state budget.  This program provides financial assistance for capital improvements to transportation infrastructure, such as airports, railroads, ports and highways.</P>

<CENTER><H3><!TITLE>Taxpayers, Environment, and Economy Benefit from ERF Retrofit</H3></CENTER>
         
<!TEXT>

	<P>The Oswego County Legislature's decision to "retrofit" the Energy Recovery Facility (ERF) will save county taxpayers about $20 million over the long-term, reduce pollution in the environment, and maintain a solid waste management system which helps attract and retain industries in Oswego County.
	<P>The ERF can incinerate 200 tons of non-recyclable waste each day.  The facility is located on State Route 481 north of Fulton.
	<P>Why is the retrofit needed?  The ERF was built in 1985.  Between 1988 and 1995 the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) developed regulations to control the emission of dust and "acid gases" from trash incinerators.  Acid gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride are the cause of acid rain.  The pollution controls at the Oswego County ERF reduce dust emissions, but not the emission of acid gases.  
	<P>The new regulations require all trash incinerators to be upgraded or "retrofitted" with new pollution controls by 1999.  Incinerators which do not comply with the regulations will be shut down.
	<P>The DEC informed Oswego County in 1988 that the ERF would eventually need to be retrofitted.  The Oswego County Public Works Department, the Legislature's Public Works Committee, and the Oswego County Solid Waste Management Board began discussing the retrofit and researching other options in 1989.  The Solid Waste Management Board is comprised of county residents who advise the County Legislature about waste disposal and recycling.
	<P>After five years of research, the Solid Waste Management Board and the County Legislature  adopted the Oswego County Solid Waste Management Plan in 1993.  The plan recommended retrofitting the ERF.
	<P>How does retrofitting the ERF save money?  The only alternative to retrofitting the ERF is to close the facility.   Retrofitting the ERF means bonding for up to $10.8 million, whereas closing the ERF could easily cost the county over $30 million.
	<P>Oswego County will bond for up to $10.8 million to pay for the retrofit.  The actual net cost of the retrofit may be as low as $5 million if the county receives funding from the Environmental Quality Bond Act or the proposed Clean Water/ Clean Air bond Act of 1996.  The bond will be issued late in 1997 and will not affect the 1997 budget.
	<P>If, instead, the county closes the ERF, the trash which is now incinerated would have to go to the Bristol Hill Landfill and use up valuable acreage.  We currently fill landfill space at a rate of  about one acre each year.  At this rate, Bristol Hill will last another 40 years.  Without the ERF, we would fill an average of six acres every year at a cost of over $4 million per year. The Bristol Hill Landfill would last only 10 years.  We would need to immediately begin looking for a new landfill site to develop.  Finding, purchasing and developing a new landfill of only 15 acres would cost more than $15 million.  Additional acreage would be needed and would add to the initial cost.
	<P>How will the retrofit improve the environment?  "Scrubber baghouses" will be built at the ERF.  This technology will remove up to 90 percent of the acid gases currently emitted from the ERF.  The amount of dioxin emitted will be reduced from one-tenth of a pound per year to one- fortieth of a pound per year.  The ERF will still use its closed-loop water cooling system so that no waste enters the Oswego River from the plant.
	<P>Oswego County has an excellent record of environmental protection.  The ERF and the recycling program have helped reduce Oswego County's waste stream by nearly 50 percent.  The national average is only 25 percent.  The EPA, the nation's strictest enforcer of environmental law, honored Oswego County as the community which has done the most to protect the environment within our EPA region.  This region includes New York, New Jersey, and the Virgin Islands.
	<P>How is the retrofit good for the economy?  A comprehensive and stable solid waste management system helps attract and retain industries and employers.  For example, Armstrong World Industries in Fulton purchases steam at a discounted rate from the ERF to produce electricity for its manufacturing process.  This gives the company, which employs 220 people, a competitive advantage.  The ERF also generates electricity which is sold to Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation.  Total energy sales from the ERF generate $1 million each year and help offset the ERF's operating costs.</P>

	<P>At the October meeting of the Oswego County Legislature, legislators voted to retro-fit the county Energy Recovery Facility (ERF)  and approved 17 other resolutions.
	<P>The legislature approved bonding $10 million to install air pollution control equipment at the ERF.  The equipment will bring the facility into compliance with new federal air quality regulations.  The ERF incinerates non-recyclable trash, saving valu
able landfill space.
	<P>The "retro-fit" of the ERF will benefit the environment by reducing air emissions, will allow the county to continue selling steam energy to the nearby Armstrong World Energies plant, and will extend the life of the Bristol Hill Landfill in Volney.
	<P>The $10 million bond will not affect the 1997 county budget.
	<P>In other business at their October meeting, legislators:
<UL>
<LI>	Approved veterans' requests for exemptions to county property taxes;

<!TEXT>
	
	<P>It's been only two months since Oswego County began its household battery recycling program, yet county residents have already recycled 2,400 pounds of batteries at the county's five transfer stations.  Between Aug. 15 and Oct. 4,  2,802 batteries were collected at the Bristol Hill transfer station alone.
	<P>The credit for the instant success of this program belongs to the employees of the Division of Solid Waste and to county residents who use the program.  The large numbers of people recycling their household batteries, instead of throwing them in the trash, is a strong indication that this is a program county residents want and appreciate.
	<P>Household batteries contain numerous materials such as lead, cadmium, and mercury which can pose health problems for people and hurt the environment if not disposed of in a safe manner.  However, nearly 97 percent of all household batteries can be recycled and their base elements and components re-used.
	<P>Before Oswego County started the battery recycling program, residents stored used batteries in their homes until the county held an household hazardous waste collection day.  Unfortunately, many batteries still ended up in the trash and the county landfill.
	<P>County residents can now safely dispose of  used  household batteries at collection units located at county transfer stations in Hannibal, Pulaski, Oswego, Hastings, and at the Bristol Hill Landfill in Volney.
	<P>At a time when government is coming under harsh fiscal constraints and trying to downsize, the Division of Solid Waste is able to offer a new, popular service without increasing its budget.  In fact, the Division of Solid Waste has nearly halved its cost to county taxpayers from $2.4 million in 1994 to $1.3 million in 1997.  It is another example of county government "doing more with less" through wise fiscal management, increasing outside revenue, and focusing on efficiency.
	<P>The Division of Solid Waste is directed by Mark Lichtenstein, Deputy Superintendent of Public Works.  It is overseen by the Legislature's Public Works Committee. Committee members include Legislators Frank Church, 14th District, Scriba, committee chairman; Clayton Brewer, 24th District, Fulton; Leonard Ponzi, 17th District, Oswego; Fay Reid, 1st District, Sandy Creek; Herbert Van Schaack, 20th District, Oswego Town; and Donald Wart, 4th District, Parish.
	<P>The county's battery recycling program can accept dry cell AAA, AA, C, and D-cell, 9- volt, and button batteries.  Button batteries, such as those used in wrist-watches, should be separated from dry-cell batteries.  Please place button batteries in clear, zip-lock plastic bags, and all other batteries in a separate clear zip-lock plastic bag.
	<P>The county can't accept wet-cell batteries for recycling.  Wet-cell batteries include car, motorcycle, marine, and lawn mower batteries, and can be recycled at local scrap yards.  Federal law also prohibits us from accepting any type of battery from industries or businesses.
	<P>For more information about the battery recycling program, contact the county Division of Solid Waste, weekdays, phone 592-2250 or 1-800-834-2583.</P>

<!TEXT>

	<P>One of the most common criticisms Americans make about politicians is that they never keep their promises.  "They say one thing, then do another," is a complaint that's been heard over and over again.
	<P>Unfortunately, this perception has stereotyped all politicians, lumping our sincere and effective community leaders in with those who might be evasive.
	<P>So, when the Oswego County Legislature adopted its "Pledge to Property Owners" in April, it was not a surprise that some people doubted their sincerity.
	<P>The pledge, contained in Resolution No. 50 of 1996, promised to do five things: use all of the county's portion of sales tax revenue to reduce the property tax levy; support legislation in Albany to help the cities of Oswego and Fulton retain their sales tax; share sales tax revenue with the towns; reduce the county tax levy by at least 5 percent; and implement efficient, cost-effective consolidation and downsizing to reduce property taxes.
	<P>Although the vote on sales tax was 14 to 11, the vote on the pledge was 24 in favor with one abstention.  Regardless of how they felt about the sales tax, legislators committed themselves to using sales tax revenue wisely and to making fundamental changes and improvements in the way county government budgets and spends money.
	<P>Opponents of the sales tax predicted that the sales tax would not be used to reduce the tax levy, that the county would not begin implementing the recommendations of the Goals 2000+ Task Force, and that the Legislature would not cut back on county spending.
	<P>Fortunately for all county taxpayers, businesses, and residents, the County Legislature kept its promises.
	<P>The Legislature adopted the 1997 county budget Sept. 26.  As promised, all of the county's portion of the sales tax was allocated to reduce the property tax levy by 13 percent. Legislators went beyond their commitment, and cut county taxes another 8.4 percent, instead of 5 percent.  This brings the total county property tax reduction to 21.4 percent.
	<P>What is most significant about the 1997 budget is that the total amount of taxes collected by the county, sales tax included, will be less in 1997 than it has been since 1991.
	<P>The Legislature also fulfilled its promise to towns and cities.  Towns will receive 20 percent of the first $10 million in sales tax revenue, and additional 10 percent of  any amount above $10 million.  Town governments  may use this revenue to reduce town property taxes as a further benefit for taxpayers.  The county is supporting legislation in Albany to allow the cities to retain their sales tax revenue.  This legislation is pending approval in the State Legislature.
	<P>As demonstrated by next year's spending reductions, the county is implementing more efficient ways of doing business and providing county services.  We're using the Goals 2000+ recommendations and other initiatives suggested by department heads and legislators to reduce spending.  
	<P>We've taken the first steps in revising our budgeting practices by moving up the budget process nearly two months.  By requiring a minimum 5 percent reduction, the Legislature forced a close examination of every budget line in every department and authorized agency.
	<P>We're making headway in downsizing and consolidation, especially in the field of human services.  The administration of the Health Department, Department of Social Services, and Department of Employment and Training are now consolidated.
	<P>It is easy to make promises and then break them.  It is even easier to criticize those who dare to make promises.
	<P>It is much more difficult to keep promises.  Those who do establish their credibility and honesty.  In April, the Oswego County Legislature challenged itself to keep a difficult promise, and it delivered on that promise.</P>

	<P>What happens when someone doesn't pay their school taxes?  The schools must still operate, so who makes up the difference?
	<P>The answer is: the county.  
	<P>Under New York State Real Property Tax Law, counties must pay local school districts' unpaid taxes.  It is then up to the County Treasurer's Office, not the school districts, to collect delinquent school taxes.
	<P>This situation often causes taxpayers to confuse county property taxes and school taxes.  When the County Treasurer's Office bills delinquent taxpayers, it becomes the proverbial "bearer of bad news," even though it is collecting the taxes of another entity.
	<P>The county budgets $4 million every year in the "deferred tax revenue account" to cover delinquent taxes.  As a result, property owners who pay their taxes on time are covering for people who are delinquent on school, county, and town taxes by "up-fronting" the money.
	<P>The process for collecting delinquent taxes is set by state real property tax law, not the county or the school districts.
	<P>Central school districts collect their taxes during fall, and report the amount of unpaid school taxes to the county each spring.  The county then pays the district the uncollected amount from the deferred tax revenue account.  The central school districts are paid in one lump sum and the city school districts are paid monthly.  
	<P>The County Treasurer's Office attempts to collect delinquent school taxes to replenish the deferred tax revenue account.  Central school taxes which are still unpaid in December are added to delinquent taxpayers' county tax bills in January.
	<P>The process for collecting town and county taxes is also established by state real property tax law.  Town tax collectors collect town and county property taxes from January to April.  
	<P>The towns keep enough to cover their own tax levy.  The rest is turned over to the county after April 1 and applied to the county tax levy.  The county then begins collecting delinquent county taxes.
	<P>Both processes guarantee school districts and towns their full tax levy, while leaving the county to bear the burden of collecting delinquent taxes and budgeting the deferred tax revenue account.
	<P>It would be much less confusing to taxpayers if school districts and towns were allowed to collect their own delinquent taxes.  This would require a change in state real property tax law.
	<P>Occasionally, someone proposes these changes in Albany.  But, unfortunately, the proposals seldom make any headway.</P>

<!TEXT>   
	<P>At the September meeting of the Oswego County Legislature, legislators received the proposed 1997 county budget from the Ways, Means, and Budget Committee.  Legislators scheduled a public hearing about the budget for Thursday, September 26 at 7 p.m. in the Legislative Chambers of the County Office Building, located at 46 East Bridge Street in Oswego.
	<P>The proposed county budget cuts property taxes by 21 percent.  This reduction was achieved by reducing spending by 8 percent and replacing 13 percent of the property tax levy with sales tax revenue.
	<P>Also during the meeting, legislators listened to representatives of veterans groups concerned about the future of their tax exemptions.  Many veterans in the county are concerned they may lose part of their tax exemptions because the State Legislature changed the real property tax law.  The county would have to pass a local law in order for veterans to continue to receive the same relative level of exemptions they have in the past.
	<P>The Legislature responded to veterans' requests by proposing Local Law No. 4 of 1996, Veterans Eligible Funds Exemption Law.  A public hearing on the law is scheduled for Thursday, Oct. 10, at 2 p.m. in the Legislative Chambers.
	<P>In other business, the legislature:
<UL>
	<LI>Sold seven delinquent tax properties in the city of Oswego and towns of Amboy, Constantia, Hannibal, and Williamstown.
	<LI>Established a $3 million debt service reserve fund designated  for payment of bond notes, as recommended in a recent study of county finances by financial advisors.  The reserve fund will help protect taxpayers from sharp tax increases if there is a sudden loss in property tax revenues.
	<LI>Approved the purchase of $12,000 of computer hardware to upgrade the Probation Department's computer equipment.
	<LI>Accepted a $30,150 state grant to provide case management services to the partners of teenage mothers.  The services will be subcontracted to Oswego County Opportunities.
	<LI>Accepted $13,000 from the federal government to pay the additional costs of the USDA Summer Feeding Program's six new feeding sites in Oswego County.
	<LI>Approved using $35,200 to purchase a new paint striping vehicle for the Highway Department.
	<LI>Transferred $60,000 from the contingency account to pay legal fees on pending litigation.
	<LI>Accepted the state's new real property equalization rates for the towns and cities of Oswego County.
	<LI>Honored the following employees for years of service:  Joan Kelly, remedial education specialist, Department of Social Services, 25 years; Betty DeSantis, coordinator of programs for children with special needs, Health Department, 30 years; and Judith Wallace, clerk, Board of Elections, 25 years.  Also honored, but not present, was Edward Monteith, highway crew leader, Department of Public Works, 25 years.

<!TEXT>
                          
	<P>In April, the Oswego County Legislature adopted a 3 percent sales tax to reduce the property tax levy and create a fairer tax system.  Recognizing that it also needed to cut taxes overall, the legislature vowed to cut county spending.
	<P>The proposed 1997 Oswego County budget includes a 21 percent decrease in property taxes.  Part of this decrease is due to spending cuts.  
	<P>All county departments and county-funded agencies were directed by the Legislature to lower their budget requests by 5 percent.  In many cases, county departments cut more than 5 percent from their budgets.
	<P>In last week's column, I gave some examples of these budget cuts.  This week, we'll look at some more budget reductions, and how they'll affect the services provided by county government.
	<P><B>Buildings and Grounds Department:</B>  The Buildings and Grounds Department is responsible for the maintenance and repair of county facilities, including nine office buildings.  Funding for heating fuel and electricity for county facilities was cut a total of $96,500.  In case of extreme weather conditions, money may have to be drawn from the contingency account to pay heating and electric bills.
	<P>Funding for replacing maintenance equipment such as mowers, vacuum cleaners, and floor buffers was reduced $16,000.  $10,000 was cut from building supplies and repairs.  Consulting fees for engineers and architects was cut $7,000.
	<P>In addition, the Buildings and Grounds Department oversees an account for furniture and furnishings for all county departments.  This account was cut $100,000.
	<P><B>Probation Department:</B>  Salaries account for over 80 percent of the Probation Department budget, making it difficult to find areas to cut without affecting services or laying off staff.  The non-secure detention program was cut $32,000, or 30 percent.  This program hold detained Family Court juveniles in specially certified detention foster homes.
	<P>Electronic monitoring of probationers was eliminated, saving $17,500.  This program saved jail space by allowing judges to sentence people guilty of minor offenses to home confinement.  Radio transmitters placed on probationers' ankles allowed the department to track offenders, ensuring that they were at home or at work.
	<P>Additionally, funding was cut 31 percent for contracted services such as alcohol abuse assessment and mental health evaluations for offenders.
	<P><B>Authorized Agencies:</B>  Authorized agencies are organizations which receive money from the county to provide specialized services to the public.  Authorized agencies were also directed to cut their funding requests by 5 percent.  
	<P>Examples include Cornell Cooperative Extension Association of Oswego County, WCNY Public Television, Oswego County Historical Society, Soil and Water Conservation District, Oswego County Fair, Arts & Culture for Oswego County, and Operation Oswego County, the county's economic development agency.
	<P>Funding for authorized agencies was cut a total of $79,904.</P>

<P><B><!DATE>Sept. 5, 1996</B></P>
<CENTER><H3><!TITLE>Proposed 1997 County Budget is a "Savings Plan"</H3></CENTER>
         
     <P>Government budgets are often referred to as "spending plans."  But it would be more accurate
to call the proposed 1997 Oswego County budget a "savings plan."
     <P>Legislators are considering a 1997 proposed budget which will reduce the property tax levy
21 percent.  This reduction is being made by cutting spending and by replacing part of the property
tax levy with sales tax revenue.
     <P>The legislature directed all county departments and non-county agencies authorized to
receive county funding to cut their budget requests by at least 5 percent.  This directive is the result
of taxpayers' requests for property tax relief and the Goals 2000+ Task Force recommendation to
place priority on essential services.
     <P>Below are examples of how the proposed budget affects two large county departments and
the service they provide:
     <P><B>Highway Division.</B>  The Department of Public Works Highway Division budget was cut
approximately $450,000.  
    <P> Funding for personnel in the proposed 1997 budget is down $154,000.  Since 1992, personnel
costs in the highway division have decreased 5 percent.  Cuts were made in funding for temporary
employees and overtime pay.  This will result in less roadside mowing and may slow down highway
maintenance.
     <P>The 1997 equipment budget was cut 12 percent, or $67,500.  Since 1992, the equipment
budget has been cut from $1.4 million to $488,500, a decrease of nearly $1 million.  This means
there is less money available to replace aging highway vehicles and equipment.
     <P>After rising for a few years, contractual expenses were cut $226,800.  If this cut is approved
in the 1997 budget, the net increase in contractual expenses since 1992 will be 4.7 percent.
     <P><B>Department of Social Services (DSS).</B>  DSS cut its budget $2.8 million, or 13.6 percent. 
This reduction is the result of restructuring DSS under the "Jobs First" initiative and several other
factors.  The purpose of "Jobs First" is to reduce the number of people on public assistance by
placing priority on helping eligible DSS clients find and keep jobs.  
     <P>Other factors contributing to the decrease in the DSS budget include:
<UL>
<LI>slowing the rate of Medicaid cost increases by beginning mandatory enrollment in
Medicaid managed care.
<LI>fully implementing work requirements for people requesting public assistance funds.
<LI>enhancing fraud detection methods.
<LI>reducing the need for foster care placements by developing managed care programs
for families in crisis.
</UL>
     <P>How do the proposed budget cuts affect smaller departments?  Let's look a two examples:
     <P><B>Department of Planning and Community Development.</B>  The proposed budget eliminates
over $22,000 from the planning department.    The hours of two part-time employees in the housing
division were cut in half, which will result in fewer field visits and require more clients to travel to
Oswego for housing assistance.  Reductions in other budget lines will cause the department to begin
charging fees for some services, such as mapping projects and mailing informational materials.
     <P>The department's budget for upgrading computer equipment was cut 70 percent.  As a result,
the department's long-range plan for modernizing its computer equipment is delayed, and
maintenance contracts for computer equipment were eliminated.
     <P><B>Oswego City-County Youth Bureau.</B>  The effects of the $42,662 cut in the Youth Bureau's
budget will be felt most at Camp Hollis, the county' residential summer camp for children.  Three
jobs at Camp Hollis will be eliminated.  Cuts in transportation may prevent some children from
attending camp who need transportation services.  Food, and supplies for the arts and crafts program
will also be affected.
     <P>The USDA Summer Feeding program will reduce the number of feeding sites in Oswego
County from 18 to 12.  Funding was also reduced for the popular youth recognition program, Teen
Institute, and the Travelling Arts in the Parks program.
    <P> In many cases, when cuts are made to the county budget, revenue from the state and federal
government is also automatically reduced.  This happens because the amount of aid the county
qualifies for from state and federal governments is based on how much the county can advance funds
for in anticipation of revenue, or is willing to contribute to the program.  The Youth Bureau is a good
example of this.  Of the $42,662 cut from the Youth Bureau's budget, only $20,408 comes from the
county tax levy.

<CENTER><H3>1997 County Budget Continues Cost-Cutting Trend</H3></CENTER>

     <P>Oswego County legislators are considering a proposed cut of 21 percent in the property tax
levy next year.  This large tax cut is the result of cutting expenses 8 percent, and replacing 13 percent
of the property tax with sales tax revenue.</P>
     <P>The combined total of property tax and sales tax in the proposed 1997 budget is lower than
the total amount of taxes collected by the county in 1991.  The Legislature has not approved a
property tax increase since 1992, even though the consumer price index has risen approximately 13
percent during that period.</P>
     <P>These spending cuts and the sales tax are the most recent step in a long-term process of
restructuring county government to be more efficient and less expensive for taxpayers.  To place the
sales tax in perspective, its helpful to look at the many significant changes the Legislature has made
in county government over the last few years.</P>
    <P> In late 1993, the Legislature developed a redistricting plan which reduced the number of
county legislators from 36 to 25.  Voters overwhelmingly approved the plan, setting the stage for
a series of changes in county government's structure and size.</P>
     <P>In 1994, the county began restructuring the Department of Social Services (DSS).  The "Jobs
First" approach by DSS places priority on helping public assistance recipients find jobs and become
self-sufficient.  As a result of Jobs First, DSS's proposed 1997 budget is $2.8 million less than 1996.</P>
     <P>An airport committee conducted an in depth study of the airport in 1995 to determine if it
was economically self-sustaining.  As a result, an Airport Advisory Committee of residents and
elected officials was formed to improve the airport's effectiveness as an economic development
resource.</P>
     <P>The Goals 2000+ Task Force, comprised of 14 business people in Oswego County, began
an 11-month study of county spending practices and operating procedures in 1995.  That same year,
the Legislature combined the administration of the Health Department and DSS under one
commissioner.</P>
     <P>Additional sweeping changes have been made during the first eight months of 1996.  The
new 25-member Legislature streamlined its committee structure, reducing the number of committees
from 19 to 12.</P>
     <P>The Goals 2000+ Task Force report was accepted by the Legislature in March.  The report
contained 14 recommendations to increase government efficiency and reduce the property tax burden
over a five-year period.</P>  
     <P>Some of the task force recommendations were implemented immediately.  A county mission
statement was developed in April.  The Legislature merged the Department of Employment and
Training into DSS in June.  The county continues to contract projects to private industry.</P>
    <P> We are now developing an inter-municipal council of state and local government and school
district leaders from Oswego County.  The group's goals are to improve communications, solve
common problems, and reduce the duplication of services.</P>
     <P>In a process called "Progress 2000+" we are studying the feasibility and impacts of the task
force's remaining recommendations.  This includes a review of our accounting and purchasing
practices.</P>
     <P>In April, the Legislature adopted a 3 percent county sales tax to create a fairer tax system. 
The revenue from the county sales tax, which is paid by everyone, replaces part of the property tax
levy.</P>  
    <P> The Legislature also exceeded its pledge to lower the total tax levy at least 5 percent.</P>
     <P>Change, even change for the better, is often accompanied by conflict and uncertainty.  Yet,
we must make changes in county government to meet the challenges of the future, which include a
shrinking property tax base.</P>
     <P>The process of re-making county government is not over.  In the coming months we'll focus
on improving cost accounting and the budget process.  By building on the Goals 2000+ Task Force's
recommendations, as well as additional initiatives developed by legislators and department heads,
we'll continue to make county government more efficient and effective for county residents and
businesses.</P>

Museum</CENTER></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>T</FONT>he H. Lee White Marine Museum features a fascinating
variety of artifacts, paintings, models and intriguing stories of
the area's maritime heritage.</P>

<P>The museum is located at the mouth of the Oswego River, one of the most historic sites in
the history of the United States. Ever since Pere Simon LeMoyne first entered the river in 1654
to the present day, events which have shaped our destiny as a nation, have continuously taken
place here.   It is for this reason that the Port of Oswego New York Authority undertook the task
of developing a museum which would reflect the historic importance of the Oswego Harbor and
the exciting story of Lake Ontario as well.</P>
<P>Come and adventure with us. Let our paintings, pictures, models and artifacts take you back
to the 17th century and down through 300 years of incredible history to the present.  Explore the
lake with the mighty Iroquois in "The American Indian-Master Boat Builder and Navigator"
exhibit, march with Roger's Rangers and the leaders of colonial America through a magnificent
series of epic paintings depicting the conquest of North America, sail with the valiant women
who were also a part of the history of the great lakes, hunt for treasure in our "Lost Treasures of
Lake Ontario" exhibit, watch the modern harbor unfold its present day story of a working port in
the Twentieth Century.</P>
<P> The museum features a series of hands-on exhibits for children. These are intended to give
young people a sensory as well as a visual concept of history.</P>
<P>Don't miss our adjunct holdings. These include the National Historic Landmark Tug LT-5, the last remaining large tug used in the Normandy landing on "D" Day. It was
awarded National Landmark status because its crew shot down a German plane on that day.  Be
sure to see the Derrick Barge, "Lance Knapp," the last steam powered vessel on the Barge Canal.
The barge includes a unique exhibit on the history of canalling in New York State.</P>
<P>All of these adventures and countless more await you when you come for a visit to historic
Oswego or, as the Iroquois called it "Choueguen, The place where the waters pour out".</P>

<H3>The Tugboat "LT-5 / MAJOR ELISHA K. HENSON"</H3><IMG SRC="lt-5.jpg" WIDTH=150
Height=104 ALIGN=RIGHT HSPACE=7 VSPACE=7><P>The tugboat LT-5 / MAJOR ELISHA K. HENSON,
which is listed in the
National Registry of Historic Landmarks, served in the 1944
invasion of Normandy, and is now on floating display in Oswego
Harbor.  It is the last remaining large tug from the Normandy invasion fleet.   It was named a
National Historic Landmark in 1992, due to the heroic action of her crew on "D" Day.</P>

<H3>The Van Cleve Collection</H3>
<P>The Van Cleve Collection reproduces watercolors of 19th Century Lake Ontario vessels
originally painted and made into a book by Lake
Captain James Van Cleve. In 1877 Captain Van Cleve presented his book to the mayor of
Oswego and it has been carefully preserved in
the Oswego City Hall ever since. The paintings are being presented to the public for the first time
at the museum.</P>

<H3>The Heritage Collection</H3>
<P>This collection presents a group of unique artifacts which illustrate 300 years of everyday
life at the mouth of the historic Oswego River. </P>

<h2>Letter From The President</h2> 
<br clear=left><hr> 
 
 
 
 
<img src="mary.jpg" align=left hspace=10> 
<br>
<h2><b>Greetings from Sister Mary Reap, I.H.M., President, Marywood College</b> </h2>
<br>

Hello, and thank you for your interest in Marywood College, an 
institution with a proud past and promising future. Those who know us 
well all agree on one thing ... Marywood is a very special place. <p>

As you browse our Home Page, I hope that you will begin to 
experience a kinship with the many offerings of Marywood. We are as 
varied as your needs. From our Fricchione Day Care Center to our Ph.D. 
program, the Marywood "circle of life" is fully complete.  <p>

If it's an undergraduate degree you're looking for, Marywood 
provides more than 50 programs in the arts and sciences. Our Graduate 
School of Arts and Sciences is the largest degree granting and most 
diverse graduate school in northeast Pennsylvania, while our School for 
Continuing Education provides self-enrichment courses, certificate 
programs and customized training to more than 14,000 participants 
annually. Marywood's nationally respected School of Social Work is the 
only accredited graduate program in the area, while our Off Campus 
Degree Program offers degree options for people throughout the country. <p>

Our alumni of more than 18,000 strong have gone on to distinguish 
themselves in profound ways throughout all walks of life ... education, 
medicine, business, the arts, psychology, human service endeavors, 
health services, the legal profession, social sciences, etc. In fact, 
our alumni directory reads like a Who's Who.  <p>

Apart from our alumni, one of our greatest sources of pride is 
surely our ability to compete in a world dominated by technology without 
losing track of the traditions on which we were established. We were the 
first college in northeastern Pennsylvania to install a high speed, 
integrated voice, data and video communications network link on 100 
percent fiber optic backbone. Our new Videoconferencing Center allows 
our students and faculty to interact with peers and colleagues around 
the world. <p>

Since 1915, Marywood has been a place where students have mastered 
professional and leadership skills that have allowed them to meet human 
needs on regional and global levels. It is a mission by which we live 
daily. <p>
 
Sincerely,<p>
<img src="marysig.gif"> 
<p> 
Sister Mary Reap, IHM<br> 
President<br> 
Marywood College<p>

<a name="TheCollege"><h2>The College</h2></a> 
Marywood College of Scranton, Pennsylvania prepares students to have a positive impact on society at 
regional and global levels while providing each student with the foundation for success in an 
interdependent world.  Marywood College is an independent, comprehensive, Catholic institution of more 
than 3000 students, committed to the integration of liberal arts and professional studies in the context of 
ethical and religious values.  Founded by the Congregation of the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate 
Heart of Mary in 1915, Marywood offers a wide variety of undergraduate, graduate and continuing 
education programs designed to place men and women of all backgrounds and ages at the forefront of 
service, knowledge and technology.
 
<a name="Location"><h2>Location</h2></a> 
Situated on a hill top, Marywood's scenic 115-acre campus is part of  
an attractive residential area of the city of Scranton in  
northeastern Pennsylvania.  With a population of 78,800, Scranton is  
the fifth-largest city in Pennsylvania and is the county seat of  
Lackawanna County, whose population is approximately 250,000.   
Marywood has the advantage of being relatively close to major cities  
of the northeast. Distances by car to some of these cities are as follows: 
<ul> 
<li>1 hour from Binghamton 
<li>2 1/2 hours from New York City 
<li>2 1/2 hours from Philadelphia 
<li>4 hours from Washington, D.C. 
<li>5 1/2 hours from Boston 
</ul> 
Marywood is served by several airlines at the  
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport (20 minutes from campus).   
The Pocono Mountains, offering spectacular scenery and an abundance  
of outdoor recreational opportunities, including downhill skiing, are  
only a few minutes from campus. 
 
<a name="Facilities"><h2>Facilities</h2></a> 
A $6 million Center for Natural and Health Sciences was dedicated in  
Fall 1993.  It houses state-of-the-art science laboratories, a  
multi-media computer lab and lecture hall in addition to three  
computer labs connected to the campus fiber optic network.  Over 300  
microcomputers located in nine instructional labs and eleven clusters  
are found in the Center for Human Services, Performing Arts Center,  
Visual Arts Center and Liberal Arts Center, giving students access to  
the on-line card catalog (library), CD-ROM databases and Internet  
resources. 
<p> 
Marywood's Learning Resources Center (LRC) houses library services,  
media services and academic computing services.  The library  
collection includes nearly 200,000 volumes of books, 1,114 current  
journal subscriptions and more than 40,000 audiovisual items.  The  
LRC participates in the interlibrary loan network with 8,000  
libraries.  The research collection includes many index and abstract  
services. 
 
<a name="Academic Program"><h2>Academic Program</h2></a> 
Marywood's programs are administered through three degree-granting  
schools.  The Undergraduate School offers degrees in nearly sixty  
academic disciplines including the arts, sciences, music, fine arts,  
social work, and nursing.  All students are required to complete a  
core curriculum in the liberal arts in addition to the courses in  
their major.  Opportunities for undergraduates abound through double  
majors, honors and independent study programs, practicums,  
internships, and study abroad.  Programs leading to master's degrees  
are offered in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the  
School of Social Work.  Certificate programs are available through  
the School of Continuing Education.  A visiting student program in  
conjunction with the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York City  
allows retail/merchandising students to earn degrees from both  
Marywood and FIT.  Study abroad opportunities are offered in France,  
Spain, Mexico, Canada and England.  Army and Air Force ROTC programs  
are also available. 
<p> 
The College is fully accredited by the <a href="#mdstate">Middle States Association of  
Colleges and Schools<super>1</super></a>, and its programs are accredited by the  
Pennsylvania Department of Education, National Association of Schools  
of Music, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education,  
American Dietetic Association, Council on Social Work Education,  
National Association of Schools of Art and Design, National League of  
Nursing and the American Bar Association.  
 
<a name="Faculty"><h2>Faculty</h2></a> 
The Marywood faculty numbers 205 (130 full-time, 79% of whom hold the  
Ph.D. or the highest degree in their field; 75 part-time).  61% of  
the faculty advise freshmen; 83% advise undergraduates.  The  
student-faculty ratio is 12:1.  Faculty are evaluated on both their  
teaching and their scholarly and/or artistic activities. 
 
<a name="Costs"><h2>Costs</h2></a> 
Tuition for full-time students (32 credit hours/$370 per credit hour)  
for the 1995-96 academic year is $11,840.  There is also a general  
fee of $200 per semester for full-time students.  Costs for room and  
board for a full academic year are approximately $4,800, depending on  
selected meal plan and room occupancy.  Books and supplies are  
estimated at $600. 
 
<a name="Financial Aid"><h2>Financial Aid</h2></a> 
Marywood College offers a comprehensive program of financial aid to  
assist students in meeting educational costs.  Eligibility for  
federal and state-funded programs is based upon demonstrated  
financial need.  In determining financial need, a federal eligibility  
formula is used to analyze family income and assets.  In addition,  
the College also awards hundreds of scholarship/grants from  
institutional funds on the basis of academic merit, without regard to  
financial need.  Applicants at Marywood College are considered for  
all financial assistance programs for which they qualify.  Candidates  
are to submit the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)  
and the Marywood application form, preferably by February 15th. 
 
<a name="Admission Requirements"><h2>Admission Requirements</h2></a> 
Candidates for admission should demonstrate reasonable progress  
toward graduation in an accredited secondary school, have graduated  
from a secondary school, or offer evidence of an equivalent secondary  
education.  Each candidate should show satisfactory academic  
preparation in 16 units of subject matter: 4 units of English, 3  
units of social studies, 2 units of mathematics, 1 unit of science  
with laboratory, 6 additional units to fulfill graduation  
requirements.  Either SAT:1 or ACT scores are required for those who  
wish to enter as freshmen. 
<p> 
In addition to fulfilling general admission requirements, candidates  
for admission to a degree program in art or music must meet special  
standards established by each department; prior to enrollment in the  
department, candidates are required to audition on a major instrument  
or to present an art portfolio. 
<p> 
For certain programs  candidates without the recommended distribution  
of units may be eligible for admission if their course work as a  
whole and the results of their tests offer evidence of a good  
foundation for college work.  Candidates who are deficient in  
required course work may complete appropriate work during the summer  
or the first year in the College 
<p> 
A student who demonstrates satisfactory academic performance at  
another college may apply for admission as a transfer student.   
Academic courses presented for transfer should be genuine equivalents  
of courses required by the programs of study at Marywood; students  
should have earned a grade of "C" or higher (a "C-" will not  
transfer) in their course work.  A student should expect to earn a  
minimum of 60 credits at Marywood College; ordinarily at least  
one-half of the credits required for a major must also be earned at  
Marywood College. 
<p> 
International candidates are required to meet the academic standards  
for admission, demonstrate proficiency in the use of the English  
language, and submit documentation of being supported by sufficient  
funds to cover educational and living expenses for the duration of  
study.  To certify English proficiency, international applicants

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Undergraduate Statement of Purpose</h1>
<br clear=left>

<a href="/ug_cat/ug_index2.htm">Undergraduate Departments</a><br>
<a href="/ug_cat/adminfo.htm">Admissions Information</a>
<hr>

<h2>Statement and Implementation of Undergraduate Curricular Purpose: Living Responsibly in an Interdependent World</h2>

	The undergraduate curriculum at Marywood College is 
designed to implement the College's mission and goals.  Its central 
focus may be expressed in the phrase  "living responsibly in an 
interdependent world."  All studies involved in the curriculum aim to 
assist students to incorporate this focus into their personal and 
professional lives. In offering this curriculum experience, the College 
fulfills its historic mission, which commits it to "spiritual," ethical and 
religious values and a tradition of service," and "which provides a 
framework that enables students both to develop fully as persons 
and to master the professional and leadership skills necessary for 
meeting human needs on regional and global levels."<p>
	To live responsibly in an interdependent world, students must 
develop a fund of significant knowledge and a particular set of 
values and skills and then proceed to employ these personally and 
professionally.<p>
	To create an environment in which students can develop into 
fully human persons, Marywood College integrates professional 
programs with a core curriculum.<p>
	The core curriculum is organized into four liberal arts 
categories and an academic skills component.   Each component 
contributes an essential perspective to the central focus.<p>
	In pursuing studies in Category I, <b>The Human Condition in 
Its Ultimate Relationships</b>, students examine the accumulated 
human wisdom about God, nature and humanity, and evaluate their 
own life position and choices.  They develop their thinking skills, 
explore the religious dimension of life and experience the free and 
responsible pursuit of truth, as they examine the ultimate questions 
that have always engaged human beings.  Studies in this category 
supply students with a theoretical basis and a cognitive process for 
making ethical decisions in promotion of justice, peace and 
compassion in the contemporary world.<p>
	The studies in Category II, <b>The Human Condition in the 
Context of the Physical Universe</b>, are vital for the fulfillment of 
the central focus.  Many of the urgent concerns of the interdependent 
world are the scientifically and technologically based and required 
knowledge and analytical skills for effective response.  The studies 
promote an appreciation of nature, an awareness of our dependence 
upon it and a sense of stewardship in fostering its resources.<p>
	Essential preparation for living responsibly in an 
interdependent world is also provided in Category III, <b>The Human 
Condition in Relation to Self and Society</b>.  Knowledge of past and 
contemporary societies and systems promotes recognition of the 
radical interdependence of human beings and helps students to 
respond effectively to human need.  Courses in this category focus on 
the rich diversity to be found in human unity, and they forge their 
individual commitments to the well being of all.<p>
	The studies encompassed in Category IV,  <b>The Human Condition 
in its Cultural Context</b>, heighten students' sensitivity to human 
concerns and to the challenges and delights shared by persons of 
diverse cultures and historical periods.  They foster aesthetic 
appreciation and the ability to communicate effectively within and 
outside one's own cultural group.  They provide access to 
understanding of our partners in interdependence.<p>
	Beside the four liberal arts categories, the core curriculum 
prescribes that students achieve competence in communication skills, 
including speaking, writing and computer literacy, and mathematical 
and physical fitness skills.  These skills are further fostered in all the 
professional programs which are pursue in integration with the core 
curriculum.<p>
	The Curricula for the professional programs consist of complex 
systematic bodies of theoretical and practical knowledge.  These 
programs enable students to develop into competent professionals 
who are recognized for their specialized knowledge, who serve the 
individual and society with compassion and who have concern for 
the effectiveness and honor of their professions.  A professional 
person has an obligation to continue education and research and to 
share knowledge for the common good.<p>
	The total undergraduate curriculum promotes lifelong 
independent learning and fosters the development of creative and 
responsive leadership in personal and professional life.  It is hoped 
that, as a result of their studies, students will be able to fulfill the 
mission of the College, learning to live responsibly in this 
interdependent world.<p>
	In summary, students should be able to:
<ul>
<li>explore the religious dimensions of life, respectful of its 
multiple manifestations.
<li>think critically and creatively in both the theoretical and 
practical aspects of life.
<li>appreciate the value and dignity they share with others as 
human beings.
<li>comprehend the dynamic natural and historical processes that 
have shaped the world.
<li>apply the wisdom of the humanities to the examination to 
nature, technology and society.
<li>understand the fundamentals of science and their relationship 
to nature, technology and society
<li>enjoy beauty, both natural and humanly created
<li>read, write and speak effectively and in a foreign language.
<li>communicate efficiently in a foreign language
<li>reason abstractly and mathematically.
<li>utilize resources essential for research, academic success and 
lifelong learning.	
<li>assume responsibility for their own health and physical well-being.
</ul>

<h3>Presuppositions</h3><p>
The goals of education at Marywood are based on the following presuppositions:
<ul>
<li>that a personal, loving God exists.
<li>that each human person is sacred, called by God to become free, authentic and moral.
<li>that all human persons are entitled to respect, encouragement in the ongoing pursuit of learning and 
support in assessing their own potentialities and values in a free and responsible way.
<li>that a fully human development implies a response to God, love of oneself and action undertaken with 
others to help create conditions for human well-being throughout the global community.
<li>that unprecedented contemporary challenges exist in the evolving world of nature, technology, socio-economic and political system.
<li>that contemporary challenges must be addressed in both personal and professional contexts and that 
each individual is capable of responding constructively to these challenges.
</ul>

<h3>Goals</h3><p>
The Marywood College community aims to achieve the following goals:
<ul>
<li>to provide an education directed toward the self-development of a fully human person--one who 
responds not only to self, but also to others;  to the natural, the technological, the political and the socio-
economic environment and to God.
<li>to pursue truth in the arts, sciences, humanities, philosophy and theology in a free and responsible 
manner.
<li>to pursue academic excellence through outstanding teaching and the promotion of research and 
community service on the national and international level.
<li>to integrate the tradition of liberal arts education with professional specialization.
<li>to provide an effective learning environment for all with particular awareness of the needs of women and first generation college students.
<li>to foster effective concern for environmental well-being, justice, peace, compassion and 
commitment to their promotion in the contemporary world.
<li>to develop competencies for responsible leadership, creativity and service in meeting human needs.
<li>to develop critical and creative thinking, aesthetic appreciation and independent learning skills.
</ul>

<h3>Objectives</h3><p>
In order to achieve these goals, Marywood pursues the following objectives:
<ul>
<li>to provide the context for the exploration and appreciation of the religious dimension of life through 
academic activities and a campus lifestyle that promotes the College's mission.
<li>to foster an awareness and appreciation of the pluralistic nature of contemporary societies through 
interdisciplinary studies and experiences that focus on international and multicultural diversity.
<li>to examine contemporary questions in the light of the wisdom of human tradition and to evaluate the 
relevancy and applicability of inherited insights through course work and other educational and research 
opportunities.
<li>to provide opportunities for aesthetic development and enjoyment for the College community and the 
surrounding region through academic offerings and the presentation of artistic, musical and theatrical 
programs.
<li>to provide means for the development of capacities for leadership and service through academic 
programs, campus activities and opportunities for community involvement.
<li>to foster critical and creative thinking in both the theoretical and practical aspects of life by offering the appropriate liberal arts and professional programs.
<li>to provide opportunities for continuing professional and personal development through a range of 
educational experiences.
<li>to offer programs at off-campus as well as main campus locations.

<a name = "goals"><h2><b>GOALS</b></h2></a>
Within the context of <a href="/mwgoals.htm">Marywood's mission, goals and objectives</a>, the School of Social Work has as its 
goals to:
<ul>
<li>Provide its students an <a href="#curriculum">educational experience</a> designed to assure the acquisition of knowledge, 
values, attitudes, ethics and skills necessary for competent advanced professional social work 
practice as master's level social workers. The School, in keeping with the goals of Marywood 
College, prepares students to understand, address through practice and appreciate cultural, 
ethnic and racial diversity as well as vulnerable groups in the population. The School stresses, in 
its stance and curriculum, the transactions between people and their environments, emphasizing 
the multi-faceted role of the social worker in promoting social and economic justice. Moreover, 
given Marywood's historical commitment to education for women, the School gives emphasis to 
sensitizing its students to the importance of women as consumers and providers of social 
services.
<li>Provide service to areas of Pennsylvania, New York and New Jersey, regions which blend both 
rural and urban communities, with campuses in Scranton and Lehigh Valley (PA). Service is 
carried out by students through practicum placements in a range of agency settings. Faculty 
contribute through teaching, consultation, continuing education and community service.
<li>Contribute to the knowledge base of the profession through scholarship and professional service.
</ul>

<a name = "curriculum"><h2><b>CURRICULUM</b></h2></a>

In the curriculum, the School stresses the importance of an approach that focuses on transactions 
among persons, families, small groups and the <a href="#course_desc">larger social forces and institutions</a> with which they 
come into contact. With the <a href="#course_desc">client system</a> as the primary focus, an understanding of psychological 
phenomena and behavior requires knowledge of social context and the interactions of social systems. 
There is the assumption that one needs to locate, on a differential basis, the <a href="#course_desc">particular forces that are 
impacting upon a client system</a>. Through this understanding of situations, <a href="#course_desc">change efforts may be 
directed in a variety of ways</a>, either toward individuals, families and small groups, or toward the 
social systems with which they interact. The <a href="#course_desc">efficacy of change efforts</a> is evaluated within the context 
of professional social work values and <a href="#course_desc">ethical practice</a>.<p>

<a name = "ed_obj"><h3><b>Educational Objectives for Students</b></h3></a>

The curriculum of the School of Social Work is designed to produce graduates who will be able to:
<ol>
<li>Identify with the social work profession and its historical commitment to promote social and 
economic justice and individual and family well-being.
<li>Demonstrate in practice their understanding and acceptance of the attitudes, values and ethical 
principles fundamental to professional social work.
<li>Comprehend the importance of self-awareness in professional practice.
<li>Understand the scientific method of inquiry and its relevance to social work practice. Evaluate 
existing and emerging knowledge in a discriminating, analytical and critical manner.
<li>Utilize their understanding of the complexity of human behavior and social environments and 
their interaction to make reliable assessments of individuals, groups, organizations and communities.
<li>Understand the multi-faceted role of the social worker in promoting, restoring, maintaining and 
enhancing the goodness-of-fit between clients and environment.
<li>Select the appropriate helping role to alleviate distress and promote opportunities for people to 
live with dignity and freedom.
<li>Demonstrate, in their work with diverse groups, a comprehension and appreciation of cultural 
and ethnic minorities as well as other vulnerable populations in contemporary society.
<li>Evidence knowledge about interventive strategies needed to perform effectively in their chosen 
concentration and skill in implementing these strategies to promote individual/family well-being and 
social and economic justice.
<li>Show understanding of the rich diversity of theoretical helping perspectives extant and commit 
to a personal practice stance that is open to modification as new knowledge emerges.
<li>Identify major social welfare concepts and policy issues and demonstrate skill in policy analysis 
and change strategies.
<li>Appreciate the importance of providing leadership in the field of social welfare and within the 
social work profession.
<li>Give evidence of commitment to continuing education and personal/professional growth.
<li>Contribute to the knowledge base of the profession.
</ol>

<a name = "org_prin"><h2><b>ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES</b></h2></a>
 The curriculum is designed to provide students with a foundation in professional social work 
practice and progressive opportunities for more concentrated study leading to autonomous practice. 
The Social Work curriculum is structured in relation to a system of organizing principles that serve to 
integrate individual sequences into a coherent whole. These principles or integrative themes 
include:<br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Ecological Perspective</b>
<dd>This theme encompasses the notion of the reciprocal relationship of person and environment and 
incorporates the significance of bio-psycho-social factors in client system development. Furthermore, 
the ecological perspective recognizes a broad spectrum etiological view of social problems and 
supports a multiplicity of intervention strategies for social work at both micro and macro levels.
<dt><b>Cultural and Social Diversity</b>
<dd>The curriculum endorses a commitment to and understanding of cultural and social diversity. This 
theme recognizes the patterns and consequences of oppression and discrimination as they have 
impact on people of color, women, the poor and other disenfranchised groups.
<dt><b>Social Work Values and Ethical Principles</b>
<dd>Undergirding the total curriculum is the thematic significance of the relationship of social work 
values and ethical principles to professional practice. The belief in individual dignity and human 
worth, social justice and the right to self-determination are examples of themes which give 
foundation to course and sequence development.
<dt><b>Self-awareness and Professional Use of Self</b>
<dd>Curricular content reflects the professional responsibility to be self-aware as a condition of advanced 
social work practice. A differential use of self that enhances practice effectiveness is nurtured through 
courses which assess factors of human growth and development, social policies that impact one's life 
and the strengths and weaknesses that one brings to the practice of social work. A student will be 
better able to differentiate a use of the self that enhances practice effectiveness.
<dt><b>Scientific Mode of Inquiry</b>
<dd>This concept provides a frame of reference for the presentation of all theoretical and practice 
constructs in the curriculum. Students are exposed at all levels to the idea that systematic, scientific 
inquiry is a major professional responsibility in increasing competence in social work practice. In 
addition, students are taught the importance of their role in contributing to the knowledge base of the 
profession.<br>
</dl>
In implementing these organizing principles, the School seeks to provide a conceptual basis for both 
<a href="#foundation">foundation</a> and <a href="#advanced">advanced</a> course work. As themes cross courses and sequences, they serve as 
integrative linkages throughout the curriculum. It is intended, in the structure of the curriculum, that 
the theory and practice courses provide a focal point of this integration. Students are encouraged to 
use this knowledge in their practicum experiences, then refine and further develop their 
understanding and integration by incorporating these experiences into assignments and discussions 
in the methods course.
This approach requires that the curriculum include knowledge about the biological, psychological, 
cultural, social and economic factors which influence human development and behavior in order to 
provide a wide focus in the identification of salient sources of data necessary for understanding and 
intervention. It requires, too, that courses be  offered that assist the student's understanding of the 
impact of social groups, communities and social institutions and concomitant norms and values upon 
human activity. The influence of cultural, ethnic and racial diversity is germane to an understanding 
of adaptation, coping and self-understanding. Institutional patterns of discrimination are understood 
as evoking experiences, needs and responses particular to groups consistently affected by social, 
economic and legal bias or oppression.<p>

<a name = "practicum"><h2><b>Practicum</b></h2></a>
Social work education places great emphasis on experiential learning. Students obtain first-hand 
experience, working under the supervision of qualified practitioners, acquiring progressively more 
developed and sensitive skills. Practicum placements are sixteen hours per week for two academic 
years. <a href="#part_time">Part-time</a> students undertake the first practicum in their second year. Students and their 
placement agencies establish the placement hours. Evening or weekend hours may be available on a 
limited basis to accommodate students with full-time employment.
<a name = "work_study"><h4><b>	Work Study</b></h4><br></a>
Students employed in human services may, with the support of the agency administration, develop 
practicum assignments within their employing agencies. These assignments are called "work-study" 
and require close consultation with the practicum department of the School to maintain the 
program's educational standards.<br>
<a name = "dev_prac_plac"><h4><b>	Developing Practicum Placements</b></h4><br></a>
Placement decisions involve a collaboration between the practicum coordinator and the student in 
order to select a practicum setting that can meet the student's interests and provide appropriate 
learning opportunities, and whose location and operating hours are accessible to the student. The 
School is prepared to arrange practicums in the student's home community, and has relationships 
with a large number of practicum agencies located throughout Pennsylvania, southern New York, 
and New Jersey, providing experience in every type of social work practice. In addition, students are 
encouraged to work with the coordinator of practicum to establish new settings tailored to their 
particular interests.<p>

<a name = "cred_trans"><h3><b>Transfer Credits</b></h3></a>
Students from other accredited graduate schools of social work may receive recognition of up to 31 
credits, provided the courses were completed not more than five years prior to the date of 
application. No credits, other than those from an accredited graduate school of social work, will be 
transferred from other institutions. Credits earned within five years in the Marywood College 
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences may be applied as elective credits toward the M.S.W. Not more 
than six elective credits may be earned at G.S.A.S. and those must be reviewed by the M.S.W. faculty 
for appropriateness to social work education.

<h3><b>Human Biology Course Work</h3></b>
An additional requirement for graduation is completion of coursework in human biology. Students 
with undergraduate coursework in human anatomy and physiology will be credited with completion 
of this requirement. All other should complete an appropriate course prior to registering for 
graduation. SW 635, Human Biology and Social Work, a non-credit course offered at least once each 
year, is designed specifically to satisfy this requirement. SW 635 is a short course taught outside the 
regular semester schedule.<p>

<a name = "gerentology"><h3><b>Gerontology Institute</b></h3></a>
The large aging population in northeastern Pennsylvania and the growing demand for personnel 
specially trained to work with the aging led, in 1977, to establishment of a Gerontology Institute at 
Marywood. The Institute brings together, in an interdisciplinary manner, resources of the School of 
Social Work and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Psychology, Human Ecology, Counselor 
Education, Nursing public administration and Health Services Administration are some of the 
disciplines cooperating in the Institute.<br>
Graduate social work students with a special interest in working with the aging may receive a 
Certificate of Specialization in Gerontology by taking twelve credit hours of study within the Institute. 
The credits taken within the Institute apply toward the credit requirements of the M.S.W. degree. 
Students who attend the off-campus program or the Saturday program may need to enroll in 
weekday classes at the Scranton campus to complete the requirements for certification.<p>

<a name = "programs"><h2><b>PROGRAMS AND SCHEDULING</b></h2></a>

The School of Social Work at Marywood has developed four different programs for persons seeking 
Master of Social work degrees: standard full-time, advanced standing, part-time on the Marywood 
campus and part-time at the Lehigh Valley Center. All four have the same standards and require both 
classroom study and practicum experience, working under supervision in a social work agency or 
setting.<p>

<a name = "standard_cat"><h3><b>Standard Full-Time Program</b></h3></a>

This program calls for two academic years of study (eighteen months, exclusive of summers) and 
completion of 60 credit hours. Students ordinarily spend two consecutive days a week on campus 
taking classroom courses and sixteen hours a week in social work agencies or settings gaining social 
work experience under supervision and focusing on the relationships between social work theory 
and practice. Ordinarily, fifteen credits are earned in practicum education and 45 in classroom 
courses. Practicum agency placements usually can be developed for students in the region in which 
they live.<p>

<a name = "part_time"><h3><b>Part-Time Programs</b></h3></a>
The School has developed two part-time programs, making it possible for the highly motivated 
student to obtain the M.S.W. degree on a part-time basis over three to four years, including summer 
sessions. Most students choose a three-year plan; some find that a four-year schedule is more 
compatible with their personal responsibilities, e.g., to family members or to a job. Schedules are 
described on pages 12 and 13.<br>
The two basic part-time plans offered by the School are:<br>
<ol>
<li>The Saturday plan, on the Scranton campus, in which students take two classroom courses (six 
credits) on Saturday in fall and spring semesters and one (three credits) on Saturdays in the summer 
session, and carry out their practicum placement requirements concurrently with the required social 
work theory and practice courses in the second and the final years.
<li>The Lehigh Valley plan, available through the School's Lehigh Valley Center, located at 
Allentown College in Center  Valley. Students in this plan ordinarily take classroom courses (six 
credits) two evenings a week in fall and spring semesters and one course (three credits) two evenings 
a week in the summer session and have the same practicum placement requirements as those 
following the Saturday plan.
</ol>
In addition to admission of part-time students to the above plans, the School does admit students, on a 
space-available basis, to follow courses part-time in the weekday schedule on the Scranton 
campus.<br>

<a name = "standing"><h3><b>Advanced Standing Program</b></h3></a>
This program is for persons who have received a bachelor's degree from an undergraduate social 
work program accredited by the Council on Social Work Education. The program permits qualified 
students to complete the M.S.W. in one calendar year. Applicants should submit to the coordinator of 
admissions an official transcript of their undergraduate work. The School may request descriptions of 
the courses upon which the requests for advanced standing are based. Decisions will be made on the 
basis of comparability of the undergraduate social work courses to the relevant areas of Marywood's 
curriculum. Students given advanced standing may receive recognition of up to 21 credits toward 
the M.S.W., providing the student makes application for admission to Marywood within five years 
after completing B.S.W. degree requirements.<br>
Full-time students admitted to advanced standing undertake three semesters of practicum and 
required methods courses. The students ordinarily begin with an eight-week summer session 
scheduled especially for them and starting two weeks prior to the regular summer session.<br>
Other arrangements can be made for advanced standing part-time students, integrating their 
schedules with those of the programs as described in the Sample Plans of Study that follow. Although 
individuals' programs vary, part-time, advanced-standing students usually begin their programs in 
January or June.<p>

<h3><b>Please Note regarding schedules</b></h3>

The School recognizes that a student may be unable to carry out his or her program as scheduled, but 
students who make changes in the course sequence should anticipate adding one or more semesters 
to their original schedules. Any changes should be carefully planned with a school 
administrator.<br>
Both full-time and part-time students follow basically the same sequence of courses. Part-time 
students desiring to complete their work for the M.S.W. degree in three or four years, as in the plans 
above, are expected to be able to arrange time for the equivalent of two working days per week in 
order to carry out the <a href="#practicum">practicum requirements</a> in a social agency or setting.<p>

<a name = "admissions"><h2><b>ADMISSION AND ENROLLMENT INFORMATION</b></h2></a>

<a name = "prerequ"><h3><b>Prerequisites</b></h3></a>

Admission to the School of Social Work is selective. An applicant must possess a bachelor's degree 
with a liberal arts foundation from a regionally accredited college or university. The undergraduate 
preparation should include course work in the social sciences, behavioral sciences and the 
humanities; six credits in each of these areas is expected.<br>
Successful applicants are expected to demonstrate potential for graduate study by maintaining a 3.00 
or better undergraduate grade point average and be physically and emotionally capable of  carrying 
out the work required for graduate education in social work.<br>
Also important in a successful application is evidence of those personal attributes, strengths and 
values consistent with the traditions of the profession. Experience - paid, volunteer or internship - in 
human service is also expected of applicants.<br>
The School does not offer provisional enrollment. Applicants who show promise but do not meet 
expectations for entering students may be offered admission on the condition that they work closely 
with their educational advisers to monitor progress and forestall problems. Opportunities for such 
enrollment are necessarily limited.<p>

<a name = "application_proc"><h3><b>Application Process</b></h3></a>

Persons seeking information about admission to the School of Social Work should write the director 
of admissions, School of Social Work, Marywood College, or <b>call 717/348-6282; FAX 
717/961-4742; E-mail <a href=mailto:ssw_adm@ac.marywood.edu>ssw_adm@ac.marywood.edu</a></b><br>
An applicant should submit: (a) the application form properly completed; (b) official transcripts of all 
undergraduate and graduate education; (c) a personal statement of 800 words about the applicant's 
interest in social work and reasons for seeking professional education at the graduate level; (d) three 
letters of reference and (e) the application fee. For further information, see application.<br>
A personal interview with the applicant may be requested by the School. Also a personal visit may be 
desired by the applicant which may be very helpful in learning about Marywood's program.<br>
After each application is evaluated by the Admissions Committee, a recommendation is made to the 
dean. The committee does not make its recommendations on one factor alone; each factor is 
considered in light of the total application.<br>
Written notification of the School's action is sent to the applicant by the Director of Admissions. The 
Admissions Committee reviews every complete application on hand before making admissions 
decisions. Many applicants will not be notified of the Committee's decision until three or more weeks 
after the application deadline. Upon receipt of notice of acceptance, the applicant is required to 
submit (within 30 days) a deposit of $100, which will be applied to tuition. If an applicant is unable 
to begin studies in the year for which admission was originally requested, the deposit will apply to the 
following year if he or she still meets the basic admissions requirements. The deposit is not refunded if 
the applicant does not attend the School of Social Work.<p>

<a name = "calendar"><h3><b>Application Calendar</b></h3></a>

Students in the full sixty-credit program, full-time or part-time, can begin coursework in June (one 
foundation course) or September. Advanced-standing students may begin in January, June, or 
September.<p>

<a name = "enrollment"><h3><b>Enrollment</b></h3></a>

The School of Social Work accepts both full-time and part-time students in the Master of Social Work 
Program. Entering classes usually number about 35 in the full-time program, 35 in the Scranton 
part-time program, 35 in the Lehigh Valley part-time program and 15 in the full-time advanced 
standing program. Total enrollment in the School is limited to approximately 350 students.<p>

<a name = "financial_aid"><h2><b>FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE</b></h2></a>
Marywood College awards a number of scholarships each year to graduate students on the basis of 
financial need. In addition, graduate students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis (six or 
more credits per semester) may be eligible to borrow under the Federal Stafford Loan and Federal 
Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS). There are specific application procedures for both scholarship 
and/or student loan consideration, and all required forms must be submitted not later than the 
established deadline dates as indicated below. All inquiries concerning assistance should be addressed 
to the Office of Financial Aid, Marywood College, 2300 Adams Avenue, Scranton, PA 18509.<p>

<a name = "applic_req"><h3><b>Application Requirements/Deadline Dates</b></h3></a>
Graduate students who desire to apply for scholarship consideration and/or student loans MUST FILE 
A FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID (FAFSA). This application is contained in the 
scholarship application packet which can be obtained after February 1 each year at the School of 
Social Work or Office of Financial Aid at Marywood College. Students who desire to be considered 
for a scholarship MUST FILE ALL THE FORMS CONTAINED IN THE SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION 
PACKET NOT LATER THAN THE ESTABLISHED DEADLINE DATE (usually May 1). Students who wish 
to apply only for a student loan should file the FAFSA not later than July 1 for the fall and spring 
semesters and November 1 if beginning study in the spring semester. Students applying for loan 
assistance are reminded that the actual loan application must be obtained directly from a bank, credit 
union or other commercial lender. Upon receipt of the Needs Analysis Form from the FAFSA, the 
Office of Financial Aid will notify the student in writing as to the additional documents (e.g., Income 
Tax Returns, Verification Worksheets, etc.) which federal regulations require the College to obtain in 
order to verify and document income and student status. Upon receiving  this notification, the student 
is personally responsible for submitting the requested documentation to the Office of Financial Aid so 
that the loan application can be processed. Compliance with these requirements will usually ensure 
that the loan proceeds will be made available to the student on a timely basis. Students are advised 
that when the College submits a processed loan application to the state guaranty agency, it can take 
from four to six weeks for actual approval and disbursement of loan funds.<p>

<a name = "scholarships"><h3><b>Institutional Funds</b></h3></a>
I.H.M. SCHOLARSHIPS are made possible through the contributed services of the Sisters, Servants of 
the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These scholarships cover partial tuition (exclusive of fees) for a 
limited number of graduate students each academic year. Awards are made on the basis of academic 
merit and financial need.<br>
GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPS: Marywood College provides a limited number of graduate assistant 
opportunities that are designed to further the educational and career goals of graduate students, as 
well as advance the well-being of the College's academic programs and services. All assistantship 
positions are requested by academic chairs or college administrators at the director level or above. 
Graduate assistantship positions are approved for the equivalent of eighteen credits of academic 
course work per academic year. In addition, graduate assistants are paid a monthly stipend for 15-20 
hours academic service per week. Further information and applications can be obtained from the 
School of Social Work. Applications for assistantships are usually due in early March.<p>

<h3><b>Notification of Scholarship Award</b></h3>
The Committee on Graduate Scholarship reviews all scholarship applications submitted by graduate 
students. Students who are selected to receive a scholarship are notified of their awards in August 
each year.<p>

<h3><b>Religious Tuition Reduction</b></h3>
The college grants a thirty percent (30%) reduction in tuition (exclusive of fees) to religious; that is, 
those with a full time religious vocation.<p>

<h3><b>Student Loan Programs</b></h3>
FEDERAL STAFFORD LOAN. Under this program, graduate students enrolled on at least a half-time 
basis (minimum of six credits per semester) can borrow up to $8,500 per grade level. Applicants 
MUST FILE THE FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT AID (FAFSA) as well as the actual 
STAFFORD LOAN APPLICATION which is obtained from the bank or credit union. Students applying 
for a Stafford Loan for the fall semester should have all required forms submitted not later than July 
1; students applying for the spring semester should have all forms submitted not later than November 
1. Stafford Loan checks are sent directly to the College by the lender each semester (one-half of the 
total approved loan each semester), and require the student's endorsement on the loan check. Loan 
checks must be endorsed at the Cashier's Office each semester before the funds can be applied to the 
student's account. Repayment of the Federal Stafford Loan begins six months after the student 
graduates, leaves school, or drops below half-time enrollment status.<br>
FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL LOANS FOR STUDENTS PROGRAM (SLS). Under this program, graduate 
students who are enrolled on at least a  half-time basis (minimum of six credits per semester) can 
borrow up to $10,000 per grade level in addition to funds borrowed under the Federal Stafford Loan 
Program. Unlike the Federal Stafford Loan, however, borrowers do not have to demonstrate financial 
need, but must undergo a credit analysis by the lender. The application for the SLS loan can be 
obtained from a bank or credit union. Information concerning current interest rates and repayment 
terms can be obtained from the lender. The approved SLS loan amount can never exceed the actual 
cost of education less any other scholarships, grants or loans received.<p>

IMPORTANT: In your best interest, Marywood College urges you to use discretion in borrowing 
money for school. In signing the loan application, you are making a commitment to repay that loan. 
If you should default on your loan, the federal government can sue for collection and/or withhold 
income tax refunds. In addition, your future credit rating will be affected. Therefore, borrow only 
those funds that are absolutely necessary for your educational expenses. All borrowers are required 
by federal law to complete an exit interview with the Office of Financial Aid prior to graduation or 
withdrawal from Marywood College for any reason.<p>

<a name = "experience"><h2><b>STUDENT EXPERIENCE</b></h2></a>

<a name = "advising"><h3><b>Advising</b></h3></a>
The School of Social Work approves an open advisory system by which students may arrange for 
consultation with any member of the <a href="#faculty">faculty or administration</a> of the School. In addition, an 
educational coordinator is appointed by the dean. The educational coordinator is responsible for the 
general coordination and administration of the student's academic program, periodic reviews of the 
student's performance and the preparation of various reports and references which constitute the 
student's official record. Each semester, the student's registration form must be signed by the 
dean.<p>

<a name = "standards"><h3><b>Academic and Professional Standards Committee</b></h3></a>
This committee is convened to assist students who may be having special problems pertaining to the 
academic and/or professional expectations of the School. It is convened when a student's QPA falls 
below 2.80; when the student receives an "F" in a course; at the request of a student who desires 
assistance; or at the request of a member of the faculty. It functions in an advisory capacity to the 
student and to the dean.<p>

<a name = "stud_org"><h3><b>Student Organization</b></h3></a>

<a href="#programs">All students</a> are members of either the Scranton Student Association or the Lehigh Valley Student 
Association. Student representatives are voting members of committees of the School (Curriculum, 
Operations and Policy Review, and Outcomes), as well as of the Faculty-Student Assembly. Financial 
support for the association is provided through the general fees of the School. In the Lehigh Valley, an 
association fee is assessed in the fall and spring semesters to support the activities of the association. 
Both associations are involved in organizing a wide range of professional and social activities for 
students. A Student Council comprised of representatives from the two organizations is charged with 
representing student interests to faculty and administration.<p>
 
<a name = "housing"><h3><b>Housing</b></h3></a>
The college has dormitory-style facilities for housing graduate students. Commuting students may 
make arrangements for campus housing one or two nights per week for a semester. although the 
number of available rooms is limited. The college also maintains a listing of rentals (apartments and 
rooms) in the vicinity. The School of Social Work and college neither approve nor disapprove of these 
accommodations. Students take responsibility for making their own housing arrangements. 
Information about on- or off-campus housing may be obtained from the Office of Student Affairs of 
the college.<p>

<a name = "classes"><h3><b>Classes</b></h3></a>
Class registration is usually limited to maintain a small class environment for learning. Discussion 
and student presentations are a significant portion of most courses, and students are expected to be 
active contributors.<br>
The frequent sharing of ideas in the classroom helps each student develop one's own voice and 
contributes to an awareness of others. Encounters in the classroom, coupled with the routine 
interactions of peers, foster close relationships among students.<p>

and paintings comprise the American Collection.  In addition, European ceramics, glass and other 
decorative arts are displayed and feature exhibitions are highlighted throughout the year.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Marywood Marks Of Excellence</h2>
<br clear=left><hr>



<h2>Marywood Marks Of Excellence</h2>

	There are many ways to define success and just as many ways to 
measure it.  At Marywood, we look at quantifiable ways in which our college 
has made important contributions to our community.  Here are a few 
examples:<br>

	<dd>More than two-thirds of the teachers and administrators in the 
Scranton School District have Marywood degrees, as do untold others in area 
districts.  Over the past five years, thousands of high school students have 
benefited from the education they have received from Marywood alumni.<p>

<dd>	U.S. News and World Report ranks Marywood in the top third among 
168 northeastern colleges and universities in terms of student satisfaction.<p>

	<dd>Marywood's campus crime statistics are, and always have been, among 
the lowest in the nation -- .004 number of crimes per 100 students over the 
past four years.<p>

<dd>	Since 1982 about 12,000 children have spent their summers at 
Marywood's College for Kids, where they have learned art, music and 
computers, among other things.<p>

	<dd>Our student volunteer program is extensive.  Since 1990 about 1,300 
Marywood students have logged more than 50,000 volunteer hours with 65 
local community agencies.  The Volunteers in Action group, which numbers 
40 students annually, sponsors events outside the community.  Volunteers in 
Action has helped the victims of Hurricane Andrew in Florida, participated 
in a home building and repair program in Kentucky and worked with the 
poor in Ecuador.  Our staff and students also travel to various countries 
around the world on missionary trips.<p>

<dd>	Marywood College has provided customized training and other 
seminars to more than 3,500 employees from various corporations such as 
Moses Taylor Hospital, Met Life, Mercy Hospital and NatWest.<p>

	<dd>Marywood's Fricchione Day Care Center, which serves 67 children 
from ages 8 weeks to 6 years, has been accredited by the National Academy of 
Early Childhood Programs.  The Academy recognizes outstanding Early 
Childhood programs that meet national standards of quality.  In addition, 
Marywood has provided training for over one-half of the day care center 
workers in Pennsylvania.<p>

<dd>	Marywood is the first institution of higher learning in northeastern 
Pennsylvania to offer a Ph.D. program.  The doctoral program is available in 
the areas of Counseling/Psychology, Education and Social Work.<p>

	<dd>A high number of Marywood College student/athletes are annually 
named to the Pennsylvania Athletic Conference Academic Honor Roll.  In 
order to be eligible for the Honor Roll, students must maintain a grade point 
average of 3.2 or better.<p>

<dd>	Since 1990, Marywood has provided scholarship assistance to almost 
100 local women -- ages 25 years and older -- through the Charlotte 
Newcombe Scholarship Fund.<p>

	<dd>Pathways, a two-week summer program for high school students, has 
served over 200 area and regional youngsters over the past five years.<p>

<h2>National Publicity Brings Positive Exposure To Community</h2>

	<b>"National publicity is a great way to show that your institution is 
important and worthy of support,"</b> says Sister Mary Reap, Marywood 
President.  "It's a third-party endorsement that has great impact on both the 
college and surrounding community by generating a real sense of pride 
among students, faculty, staff, administration and alumni."<p>
	Over the past few years, Marywood College has brought positive 
exposure to the Scranton area via numerous placements in such national 
publications as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, 
Associated Press and The Chronicle of Higher Education.<p>
	"When our students or faculty are featured in national publications, it 
always creates a lot of feedback from alumni all over the world," notes Sister 
Mary.  "We are certainly proud of the fact that we have the kind of people on 
campus who, through their research activities and service projects, can 
capture the attention of national reporters."<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Development</h2>
<br clear=left><hr>




	The strength and vitality of any institution can be measured in part by 
its ability to find outside sources of revenue, separate from that generated by 
tuition.<p>
	As Marywood moves forward with progressive goals and objectives, 
many of our needs are determined by the success rate of fund raising 
endeavors. For example, our Annual Fund benefits such areas as:</b>
<ul>
<li>visiting lecturers
<li>cultural events
<li>continuing education
<li>life-long learning
<li>scholarship assistance
<li>campus-based financial aid
<li>teaching technology
<li>teaching/information technology
<li>plant and facility improvements
</ul>

There are many ways in which an individual can contribute:<p>

1) The Presidential Society: distinguished members (gifts totaling $5,000 or 
more); Sister M. Coleman Nee, I.H.M. Society ($2,500 to $4,999); Marywood 
Ambassadors ($1,000 to $2,499) during the fiscal year.<br>

2) Investor's Club ($500 to $999)<br>

3) Dean's Club ($250 to $499)<br>

4) Director's Club ($100 to $249)<br>

5) Builder's Club (under $100)<br>

6) Endowed Scholarship ($10,000 or higher commitment)<br>

7) Planned Giving options (provisions for Marywood in a will, a life income 
plan, pooled income fund, gift annuity, charitable remainder trust, real estate, 
life insurance, art and antiques)<p>

<h3>Admission: How do students get into the Honors Program?</h3>

If your record from high school suggests that you are capable of Honors work, you'll be placed in one or more Honors courses that meet Marywood's liberal arts requirements (this insures you will be taking a required course or courses whatever your major), such as history, philosophy or psychology.<p>

Beginning with the second semester of freshman year, any student with a 3.0 or better average may select Honors courses.<p>

<h3>Requirements:  How do students stay in the Honors Program?  What is the Honors Degree?</h3>

At the end of their sophomore year, students who have completed at least  three Honors courses with a 3.0 or better average may elect to participate in the program leading to an Honors degree.<p>

To graduate with an Honors degree, a student must complete a minimum of 21 Honors credits; at least 15 credits must be in small Honors seminars or colloquia.  Another three credits must be in an Honors thesis in the student's major program.  In addition, the Honors Degree candidate must graduate with an overall QPA of 3.25 or above.<p>


Any student meeting the requirements can take Honors courses, whether or not he or she is seeking the Honors degree.<p>


<h3>Honors Recognition</h3>

All forms of Honors learning courses and projects are designated by a special code that appears on the student's transcript when the work is completed successfully.  Students completing the Honors degree receive an Honors certificate, and successful completion of the Honors Degree Program is noted on all official transcripts.<p>

<h3>Other Opportunities</h3>

Students participating in the Honors Degree Program may be elected to Marywood's chapter of Delta Epsilon Sigma, a national honor society at Catholic colleges and universities.  Participants are also 
assisted by the Marywood Committee on Scholarship in competitions for Danforth, Rhodes, Fulbright, and other prestigious post-baccalaureate fellowships.  Marywood is a member of both the National Collegiate Honors Council and the Northeast Region Collegiate Honors Council.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Individual Options</h2>
<br clear=left><hr>


At  Marywood, you'll find a variety of special options including independent study, field experience, and self-designed majors to create the academic program that best suits your current interests and future goals.<p>



<h3>Honors Program</h3>

<b>The Honors Program</b> encourages and assists excellent students to pursue their academic goals effectively and creatively through a variety of opportunities.  Honors courses allow students to work with 
other highly motivated students and to develop individual research (in conjunction with a faculty advisor) that will culminate in an honors thesis fit for publication in Marywood's Scientia journal.   Participating 
students are chosen upon matriculation at Marywood based on the evidence of their high school record.  If you are not chosen at that point but wish to select Honors work, you may do so beginning with the second 
semester of your freshman year, if you have a 3.0 (B) or better average.  You may decide to follow the full program leading to an Honors degree, or you may choose simply to elect some Honors courses without 
completing an Honors degree.<p> 


<h3>Double Major</h3>

To graduate with a double major in which the requirements of two distinct major programs are fully met within one degree program you will need to  arrange the sequence of study with the support of both 
departmental chairpersons.  Usually, students apply to the appropriate  chairperson for entrance into the second major upon the completion of the freshman year.  Examples of double majors students have 
pursued recently are: Social Work and Religious Studies; English and Advertising and Public Relations; and International Business and Foreign Language.<p>



<h3>Minor</h3>

Many departments offer the option of a minor, usually ranging from 18 to 24 credits in that department.  
You would need to make arrangements for the sequence of courses with the appropriate chairperson.  Some recent major/minor programs students have chosen include: Mathematics with a minor in Computer 
Science; English with a minor in Philosophy; Business with a minor in Spanish.  <p>


<h3>Ad Hoc Major Self-Designed Program</h3>



<h3>Independent Study</h3>

Students may undertake independent study on topics that are other-wise not available through the Marywood curriculum.  To enroll in independent study, you must have an overall QPA of 3.0 (B) and obtain permission from a faculty member and the department chairperson involved.  Some recent independent study topics include Philosophy of Law; Analysis of Factors Which Impact Student Performance in Math Class; and Research into the Construction and Writing of a Short Novel. <p>


<h3>Field Experience or Internship</h3>



<h3>Certificate Programs </h3>

Marywood's School of Continuing Education, in conjunction with the Undergraduate School, offers a variety of Certificate Programs for individuals not currently seeking a degree.  Certificate Programs are organized sequences of courses that culminate in a Certificate of Achievement in a particular area of study:  Comprehensive Business Skills; Office Administration; Microcomputer Applications; 
Retail/Business Management; Art; and Art History.  Depending on attainment of required grades, credits earned toward a certificate may apply toward a degree.  All courses for Certificate Programs are regular 
Marywood courses taught by Marywood faculty.  Applicants for the program must have completed high school three years prior to application or complete a successful interview with the Dean of Continuing Education.  For more information about application, transfer of credits, QPA requirements and the like, 
please call the School of Continuing Education at 717-348-6237.  <p>

<h2>Creating Your Personal Vision:<br>
A Message From The Dean</h2>

<i>It is a shopworn but accurate cliche that even a journey of a thousand 
miles must begin with but one step - followed by another, of course, and then 
yet another.  In the pages of this book you will find a rich and varied catalog 
of course offerings which may be seen as steps along the journey which is 
your graduate education.<p>

You may be seeking a master's degree, a graduate certification, your own 
personal enrichment or some combination of these.  There will surely be times 
along the way when the journey does seem - to you or to your family - to be a 
thousand miles long, but don't despair.  Remember that you need only move 
from step to step.<p>

What can you expect from this journey?<p>

First of all, you should expect knowledge. Academic excellence has been a 
hallmark of the graduate programs of Marywood College for over sixty years. 
Your instructors, both full time faculty and practicing professionals, have 
superior credentials and expertise in your field. You will have access to the 
finest learning resources available in the region. You can expect that your 
education will combine the most solid theoretical foundations with the most 
current programs, so you can expect to master your discipline.<p>

Second, you  can expect the ecological dimensions  as well.  By that I mean 
the cultural, ethical, political and social contexts within which we all carry out 
our professional endeavors.  Those who master the content-knowledge of their 
fields without also mastering the context-knowledge are simply technicians or 
mechanics.  There is another cliche which states that managers know how to 
do things right, while leaders know the right things to do.  At Marywood we 
seek to educate leaders.<p>

Third, you should expect the journey to be personal.  In our society what we 
do is inextricably bound up with how we perceive ourselves to be.  Into our 
work we bring our pasts, our strengths and weaknesses, our values and 
priorities and even our hopes and dreams.  You should expect that in your 
education you will reflect upon, challenge and perhaps have challenged by 
others, the ways these personal qualities affect and are affected by your 
professional expertise.  Through such reflections or questioning we grow 
more fully human, and therefore, more profoundly competent.<p>

In grade school and high school, perhaps even through much of college, 
you were the passive recipient of your schooling.  Other people were the 
teachers, and you were the learner.  Now, though, you should expect to be a 
much more active partner in your education, not only the student but often 
the teacher to your instructors and to your classmates.  Your initiative, your 
creativity, your drive to excel are an integral and necessary part of your 
graduate education.  That can be a wonderfully liberating experience as well 
as a sobering responsibility.<p>

On behalf of the faculty and staff of Marywood College's Graduate School of 
Arts and Sciences I welcome you or welcome you back to this journey, and I 
wish you a "Bon Voyage."<p>

<h2>History, Mission and Organizations</h2>

<h3>History of the College and

offers degrees, state certification programs, professional certificates, 
professional continuing education and personal enrichment courses of study.<p>

<h3>Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Knowledge Base Statement</h3>

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences provides disciplinary and 
professional educational opportunities to men and women within the 
institutional mission of Marywood College. Graduate education challenges its 
faculty and students to be<br>
<ul>
<li>community leaders who integrate knowledge and action
<li>critical and creative thinkers
<li>ethical and just human beings
<li>persons willing to take a risk in pursuit of an ideal.<p>
</ul>
Graduates are encouraged to network and collaborate with others in 
response to ambiguity and diversity in changing, technological world.<p>

<h3>Graduate School Faculty</h3>
Marywood College's Graduate School has developed an excellent three-tiered 
faculty system to bring teaching and instruction to the highest level possible. 
This three-tiered system involves full-time faculty, community professional 
practitioners in the applied disciplines and field site/practicum supervisors. 
Each of the three groups works in consort to deliver the curricula. This 
approach integrates and balances practice and theory in the professions, 
keeping the curriculum current to practice, and is reflective of the creative 
ideas generated in the various disciplines.<p>

The majority of Marywood's full-time graduate faculty are experienced 
teachers. Their experience and the Graduate School's long history in adult 
professional and aesthetic education are factors which have led, over the 
years, to an open and engaging faculty-student relationship. At Marywood, 
the quality of faculty-student relationships, both within and outside the 
classroom, has become the standard by which educational excellence is 
measured.<p>

<h3>Role and Practice of Research</h3>
Research at Marywood supports and builds upon its teaching and service 
activities. Faculty research is frequently linked closely to teaching and 
becomes integrated into course work on an ongoing basis. Faculty work with 
students to improve research skills and a research orientation within the 
professional degree programs. Joint publishing of students and faculty is an 
aspiration of the Graduate School and is encouraged within the faculty. The 
Graduate School, because of its curricular focus on the human services and 
the professions, stresses especially the concrete application of theoretical 
and empirical findings to local and regional needs whenever possible. The role 
of research is continuing to grow at Marywood with the development of 
annual opportunities on campus via the Research Forum in which faculty and 
students present their findings each spring.<p>

<h3>Graduate School Governance</h3>
The Graduate School is led by the Dean, aided by the advice and wisdom of the 
graduate faculty, and provides specific structures and opportunities for 
student and community input. The standards and policies of graduate 
education evolve from the openness of discussion, self-criticism and debate 
which graduate education implies. Formally, the process of information 
gathering, judgment and decision-making occurs through the following 
committees and organizations: Policy and Operations Committee, Curriculum 
Committee, Joint Committee on Graduate Studies, various department-based 
advisory groups and the Graduate Student Council. The Policy and Operations 
Committee is composed of the chairs of all graduate departments and 
provides the forum for the debate and discussion of all operations and policy 
issues in the Graduate School. The quality of specific courses and degree 
program sequences is ensured by the review of the Graduate School 
Curriculum Committee. The Joint Committee on Graduate Studies investigates 
academic relationships between the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and 
the School of Social Work.<p>

<h3>Graduate School Office and Services</h3>
The Graduate School Office renders a number of important services to 
graduate students. It (l) receives and processes applications for admission; 
(2) maintains a supply of graduate school literature for the information of 
interested students; (3) counsels students in some phases of graduate work; 
(4) refers students to appropriate academic advisors on matters of program 
development; (5) interprets the guidelines for admission to the Graduate 
School and for the fulfillment of graduate requirements; (6) provides 
verification of students' status for academic and professional purposes; (7) 
informs students about scholarship availability; (8) acts as the primary source 
of contact for student problems and/or concerns with the operations or 
policies of the Graduate School.<p>

The Graduate School maintains an active mailing list of graduate students to 
whom it sends advance notices of course offerings and course brochures. In 
order to receive notices and brochures, a student must keep the office fully 
informed of her or his latest mailing address. Keeping the Graduate School 
informed assures timely communications between the College and all its 
graduate students.<p>

<h3>Enrollment</h3>
Marywood has an enrollment of approximately 3,000 students in its four 
schools, including the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. Enrollment at the 
graduate level is almost 1,400 students. Graduate students, both full-time 
and part-time, represent a diversity of backgrounds. Actively working to 
increase the diversity of the student body in Marywood's graduate programs 
is a high priority. Marywood's size permits a closeness in faculty-student 
relations, particularly related to research, uncommon in larger research-
oriented graduate schools.<p>

<h3>Campus</h3>
Marywood College is located on a scenic property of 115 acres on the edge of 
the city of Scranton. Visitors to the campus in all seasons are impressed with 
the natural beauty of the campus which has enough trees and variety of 
foliage to qualify as an arboretum. Nestled along well worn and scenic 
walkways, the campus's twenty centers of living and learning create a 
relaxed and aesthetically pleasing environment for studies. Buildings and 
resource centers at Marywood blend with the natural beauties of the region, 
through a program of planned and controlled growth.<p>

Marywood's commitment to nature and an aesthetic learning environment 
has been enhanced over the past decade with major developments in 
communications technologies and library and computer resources. The College 
has its own television and radio stations and satellite dish for receiving 
programming from around the world. The Visual Arts Center, with its two 
outstanding galleries, the Suraci and the Contemporary, provides the 
graduate student with a variety of exhibits of outstanding character 
throughout the year. Marywood's strong heritage in music programming 
affords a rich repertoire of musical performances in the College's Performing 
Arts Center throughout the year.<p>

To fulfill student needs for meeting places and recreation, the Marywood 
Student Center provides lounges, a cafeteria, snack bar, game rooms and 
bookstore. The Health and Physical Education Center houses an Olympic-size 
swimming pool, gym, racquetball courts, weight room and dance studio. Open 
air tennis courts are nearby.<p>

<h3>Location</h3>
Marywood College is located in the Scranton-Wilkes-Barre metropolitan area 
with easy access to the Pocono Mountains and resort areas. The College is 
conveniently located at the center of the intersection of many interstate 
highways. The campus is 120 miles west of New York City and 115 miles north 
of Philadelphia.<p>

The College's location in a metropolitan area of more than 750,000 people, 
with reasonable access to the major eastern cities, provides the best of two 
worlds for graduate education --access and self-sufficiency. The Scranton 
area is home to a well-established off-Broadway series, offers a noted ski 
facility in Montage Mountain and provides Triple A baseball. The strong and 
continuing ethnic heritage of the region affords excellent variety and 
outstanding restaurant options. Several state parks and recreational areas 
are very convenient to the city and provide excellent opportunities for 
summer and winter sports, camping, picnicking and other outdoor activities.<p>

Culture, recreation and educational resources are blended well in Marywood's 
location. It is an area that, in recent years, has been ranked  high in national 
studies for its quality of life and has been experiencing a strong and 
sustained economic emergence in the past decade.<p>

<h1>Marywood College</h1>
<h2>Graduate School of Arts and Sciences</h2>
<br clear=left><hr>

<h2>Regulations, Rules and Policies</h2>

<h3>Graduate Admission</h3>

Applicants for <b>admission to master's level graduate courses</b> must meet at 
least two minimal requirements: (1) possess a bachelor's degree from a 
regionally accredited college or university and (2) demonstrate potential for 
graduate work, ordinarily by having maintained a "B" average during 
undergraduate study. Additional prerequisite requirements, standards for 
admission and evidence of suitability for advanced study are often required 
by particular departments or for specific degree concentrations within 
departments. Students seeking admission should review the summary chart 
on page 47 which outlines the admission requirements for all graduate 
programs and read carefully the particular section or sections of the 
graduate catalog referring to the degree program of their interests.<p>

Students seeking admission should contact the Graduate School Office as 
soon as possible. To obtain full admission to the Graduate School normally takes a 
minimum of two months from application submission to final review. If 
admission test requirements, such as the Graduate Record Examination, 
Graduate Management Admissions Test or Miller Analogies Test, are not 
taken in advance of admission application, delays of more than two months should 
be anticipated. <i>Students who do not complete the admission process cannot 
gain a full admission status to the Graduate School. Without gaining full 
admission status, students will be subject to all policy and rule changes 
affecting their degrees beyond their initial date for commencing course work.</i> 
Since degree requirements frequently change over a three to five year 
period, the lack of  full admission status could prolong a student's time and 
credit hours necessary for degree completion. Until a student receives a 
formal letter from the Dean's Office noting full admission, a student is not 
fully admitted to graduate studies. Accumulated credit hours are evaluated at 
the time of full admission to determine applicability to the degree program 
being pursued.<p>

<b>Applicants for admission to the doctoral program</b> must hold a master's degree 
and meet specific additional requirments for that program. Consult the 
section of this catalog related to the doctoral program for more details.<p>

<h3>Special Admission of Undergraduates</h3>
A Marywood College undergraduate student who is within nine credits of 
completing the undergraduate degree requirements is eligible to apply for 
admission to master's level graduate courses. The student must first obtain 
the approval of the Undergraduate Dean. Such students must provide the 
Graduate School with an official transcript of all undergraduate studies as 
soon as the course work leading to the bachelor's degree is completed. Forms 
necessary for approval of enrollment are to be obtained in the Undergraduate 
Dean's Office.<p>

<h3>Admission of International Students</h3>

Marywood College is authorized under federal law to enroll nonimmigrant 
alien students. A scholarship record of all secondary, college and university 
work previously completed will be required to secure admission to any field 
of study. Graduate students are admitted with the understanding that their 
work is subject to review and re-evaluation upon arrival. In some cases, 
additional undergraduate work will be required before acceptance as a 
regular matriculating graduate student.<p>

The student should complete the application for admission, including 
references and official transcripts, and return them to the Graduate Dean at 
least eight months in advance of the beginning of the term of anticipated 
enrollment to allow time for correspondence and the evaluation of the 
application. Notarized translations should accompany original documents 
which are in a language other than English.<p>

After acceptance into Marywood, the student will receive forms for indicating 
means for payment of tuition and fees. These forms must be returned to 
Marywood with the indicated deposit. Upon receipt at Marywood, a U.S. 
Immigration I-20 form will be forwarded to the applicant.<p>

The Office of Student Affairs at Marywood College is responsible for the non-
academic advisement of international students. New international students 
should contact this office upon admission and again immediately upon 
arrival in Scranton. All international students should feel free to consult this office 
at any time concerning special problems.<p>

The Registrar is the designated official relating to U.S. Immigration affairs.  
The Office of the Registrar is in the Liberal Arts Center.<p>

The procedures listed below should be followed by students seeking 
admission whose native language is not English.<p>
<ol>
<li> Applications from students who live outside the United States should be 
received eight months before the semester of desired first enrollment.<br>
<li> Admission to graduate standing does not imply that any financial 
assistance will be given. Admission means only that the student may take 
graduate courses. Accordingly, to be admitted, a student must be able to 
prove financial support availability.<br>
<li> To be informed about the student's competence in reading and writing 
English, the College requires that the student be tested on mastery of the 
English language by performing satisfactorily on the Test of English as a 
Foreign Language (administered by the Educational Testing Service of 
Princeton, New Jersey). Normally TOEFL scores of under 550 will not be 
accepted.<br>
<li> Students are required to carry health insurance.<br>
</ol>

<h3>Application Process</h3>

Students seeking admission to a master's degree, certificate or certification 
program must apply for admission through the Graduate School Office. All 
applicants must submit the following information:<br>
<ol>
<li>The application form properly completed, including the application fee 
payment.<br>
<li>Official transcripts of all previous academic work mailed directly to the 
Graduate School Office from previous institutions attended.<br>
<li>Two letters of reference from persons familiar with the student's 
educational background and work.<br>
<li>Specific departmental requirements as listed in the department's 
description of the course of study for which application is being submitted.<br>
<li>Students seeking state certification must also contact the College's 
Certification Office at 717-348-6297 for specific additional requirements.<br>
</ol>
Application materials required for the doctoral program are described on 
pages 142-143 of the catalog.<p>

When all required materials have been received at the Graduate Office, they 
will be forwarded to the applicant's department of specialization for review. 
Applicants should expect a review process which may take up to 60 days from 
final application submission. After the departmental review and assessment 
of the application is completed, the applicant will be informed in writing by 
the Dean's Office of the specific action taken concerning the request for 
admission to the Graduate School. The various student statuses in the 
Graduate School are defined later in this catalog. Late applicants who cannot 
or do not submit complete credentials within their applications for 
departmental review may take classes only under the personal enrichment or 
admission in process category. Such students are limited in the numbers of 
credit hours for which they may enroll.<p>

Courses in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences are offered in the fall, 
spring and summer sessions. Applicants to any course of study other than the 
doctoral program may be admitted in any of these sessions, but must check 
with their appropriate chairpersons to be advised properly concerning when 
beginning courses will be available and the consequences of being admitted in 
a particular semester other than the fall semester.<p>

<h3>Admissions in Process Credit Limitations</h3>

Students seeking a master's degree may not take more than nine (9) credit 
hours in one degree program prior to full admission. Individual programs of 
study may further limit a student to as few as six (6) credits prior to full 
admission. Full admission to a course of studies takes effect the semester 
immediately following the date of the admission letter to the degree 
applicant from the Graduate School Office.<p>

If students take more than nine (9) credits, or six (6) in those programs that 
specifically limit the number in the catalog, in one degree program prior to 
full admission, <i>such credits cannot count toward fulfilling degree 
requirement credit hours or course requirements. To register for more than nine (9) 
credits, or six (6) if program defined, a student must receive departmental 
advisement and obtain the Dean's signature on a special form authorizing 
such enrollment.</i><p>

The release form is available for registration in the Graduate School Office.

<h3>Student Status Categories</h3>

A student may be enrolled in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences with 
either regular status or special status. "Regular" status refers to that of a 
student, one who is admitted by the College, pursuing a course of studies 
leading to a master's degree or doctoral degree. Students who have not yet 
been admitted to matriculation or who do not intend to earn a master's  or 
doctoral degree are given "special" status. The following categories are used 
for differing purposes within the Graduate School:<p>
<ul>
<li>Regular - This status is assigned to those students who are pursuing a course 
of study leading to a master's or doctoral degree.<p>

<li>Provisional - Students who have been given provisional acceptance remain 
in a special status category until they have fulfilled all conditions of their 
letter of acceptance.<p>

<li>Admission in Process - A student who has applied to seek a graduate level 
degree is in a special status, non-degree seeking category until all 
necessary paperwork, letters of reference, fees, tests and departmental 
evaluations have been completed. It is the student's obligation to see that 
the required materials for application completion are sent to the Graduate 
School Office on a timely basis, normally within five months of the date of 
application.<p>

<li>Certificate Program - A student who has been accepted to pursue a program 
of studies leading to a Marywood College certificate with no specific 
relationship to state certification or any professional body is in a special 
status, non-degree seeking category.<p>

<li>Certification - A student accepted to a program of study which fulfills 
requirements for state certification in such areas as education, 
psychology and special education is in a special status, non-degree 
seeking category.<p>

<li>Transfer - A visitor from another educational institution whose purpose is to 
transfer credit back to the home institution is in a special status, non-
degree seeking category.<p>

<li>Enrichment - A person enrolled in a course without reference to a specific, 
organized goal recognized by the Graduate School is in a special status, 
non-degree seeking category.<p>
</ul>

<h3>Student Reporting Classification</h3>

A student who is enrolled for nine or more credits in a given semester is 
reported as full-time for that semester. A student who is enrolled for less 
than nine credits in a given semester is reported as part-time for that 
semester. In certain instances, governmental or agency regulations 
supersede the College definition.<p>

<h2>Other Academic Regulations and Rules</h2>

<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
Students are expected to maintain rigorous standards of academic honesty in 
their course work. Students who violate ethical standards of practice in their 
course work or in the conduct appropriate to their professional objectives 
are subject to dismissal from programs after being admitted. Course work 
completed through plagiarism will be graded as automatic "F".

<h3>Professional Standards of Ethics and Conduct</h3>

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences educates students to take positions 
of responsibility and leadership within their communities. Many of our 
departments and programs represent professions which adhere to 
established standards of behavior and ethics, and we expect our students to 
adhere to those standards as well. Failure to do  so may result in dismissal 
from a program of study. For further information, consult your faculty 
advisor.<p>

<h3>Admission to Degree Candidacy</h3>
Admission to graduate study as a fully admitted student does not assure 
admission to candidacy for a degree. A separate and thorough assessment of 
the degree candidate's progress and work for candidacy will be made by the 
department within which candidacy is sought. When a department admits a 
student to degree candidacy, it does so as an expression of a firm belief that 
the quality of work that a degree-seeking student has completed gives 
strong evidence of significant potential for successful advanced study within 
the degree area. Students achieving marginally passing grades in their 
beginning courses may be dropped from the degree program at the time of 
review for failing to make a strong case for their continued candidacy.<p>

To be eligible for candidacy a student must:
<ol>
<li>File an application for admission to candidacy with the Chairperson 
according to the criteria of the department and upon completion of 
twelve hours of  graduate work (30 hours in the doctoral program) 
with a "B" average. Application forms are available in the Graduate 
School Office.<p>
<li>Meet all prerequisites required by the department as listed in the 
catalog.<p>
</ol>
Notification of admission to candidacy is given in writing by the chairperson 
of the department.<p>

<h3>Standards for Continued Candidacy</h3>
A student who obtains two "Fs" in a program, for whatever reason, will be 
dismissed from the Graduate School. Students who fail to maintain a 3.00 
average in their course work once they have achieved candidacy status are 
subject to probation for two semesters and dismissal from the degree 
program if 3.00 is not achieved in the third semester.<p>

<h3>Transfer of Credit</h3>
At least two-thirds of the degree requirements must be met at Marywood. 
Departments or individual programs may require more hours taken at 
Marywood and may limit transfer credits to fewer than the Graduate School 
of Arts and Sciences limit. Specific credits and numbers of credits accepted 
for transfer must be approved in writing by the Department Chairperson in 
the degree program or graduate certification program to which a student has 
been fully admitted.<p>

All credits accepted for transfer must have been taken at the graduate level. 
Bi-level courses are generally unacceptable and must be specifically justified 
in the student's departmental records. All credits transferred must be 
equivalent to a "B" grade or better. If a course has been taken on a pass-fail 
basis there must be a written statement attached to the requested transfer 
credit that states it is the institutional policy to grant credit only for grades 
of "B" or better in graduate course work. Transfer credits must parallel or 
integrate well, both in terms of content and quality, with current standards in 
the Graduate School. Acceptable transfer credits must have been: (l) taken in 
residence from a regionally accredited institution; (2) not previously applied 
to a degree unless related to formal advanced standing; (3) earned no more 
than five calendar years from the date of provisional or regular admission.<p>

An applicant desiring to earn credit at Marywood for transfer to another 
institution should have an official statement of good standing in the home 
institution submitted to: Dean, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, 
Marywood College, Scranton, Pennsylvania, 18509-1598.<p>

Marywood students desiring to register for credits at another institution to 
be transferred to Marywood to fulfill specific requirements of a certificate or 
degree program must receive prior approval of the appropriate Department 
Chairperson and obtain his or her signature on the Authorization for 
Transfer of Credit form.<p>

<h3>Time Limitation for Degrees</h3>
All requirements for a master's degree must be completed within seven 
calendar years unless the student has been granted a leave of absence for 
medical or other good reason. This period of time is rarely extended. <b>Written 
application for extension, with full documentation of serious cause, must be 
made to the Chairperson of the department in which the student is enrolled.</b> 
Any extension must have the approval of both the department and the 
Graduate Dean.<p>

<h3>Leave of Absence Policy</h3>

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences will consider a serious student-
initiated petition for leave of absence from studies in any degree program. 
Students who cannot actively pursue their degree studies for more than two 
consecutive semesters (including summer sessions) are well advised to seek 
a department approved leave of absence. Without any documented and 
approved leave of absence recorded, students will be held strictly 
accountable to the seven year time limit for degree completion. The time 
limit applies to all degree requirements including a degree candidate's professional 
contribution and any other degree closure experiences/ requirements.<b> Failure 
to return to graduate studies by the specified date from an approved leave of 
absence may result in the administrative withdrawal of the student from the 
College by the Registrar.</b><p>

No leave of absence will be granted without the prior approval of the 
Department Chairperson/Program Director and the Dean. The maximum 
additional time permitted through any combination of leaves of absence 
within one degree is two calendar years. Leave of absence petitions must 
generally be filed with the department/program at least two months prior to 
the semester they are proposed to take effect.<p>

<h3>Withdrawal from the College</h3>
A matriculating student who desires to withdraw from the College must 
notify the Department Chairperson or Dean in writing. If enrolled in classes, 
ordinary procedures for withdrawing from courses and the College's 
published time line apply. Absence from class does not constitute notice of 
withdrawal from a course. A student who discontinues attendance at classes 
without withdrawing officially will receive "F*" in all courses concerned. <p>

<b>Continuous enrollment and consistent progress toward a degree in each 
academic year is an expectation of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences 
for all matriculating students. A matriculated student who has not completed 
any credits toward the degree in a two-year period must be administratively 
withdrawn from the program.</b><p>

<h3>Reactivation</h3>

A former matriculating student who wishes to return after having been 
withdrawn must reapply for admission. The catalog which is current at the 
time of readmission will apply. If the student's bid for reactivation is 
successful, previously earned academic credits will be evaluated in light of 
their age and applicability to the current curriculum by the appropriate 
chairperson.<p>
 
<h2>Registration, Scheduling and Program Change</h2>

<h3>Registration</h3>

Specific registration information is published by the Registrar prior to each 
academic session. Students may register either by mail, by fax (717) 341-
0748, or in person for each term during which they expect to attend classes. 
Matriculating students and those in a certificate or certification program 
need the signature of the Chairperson/Advisor; other students need the 
signature of the Graduate Advisement Coordinator or the Graduate Dean.<p>

A student may be denied further registration if progress toward the 
completion of his/her planned program of studies becomes unsatisfactory, or 
in the event of financial delinquency.<p>

<h3>Cancelled Courses</h3>

The College reserves the right to cancel any course, revise subject matter 
content or alter schedules.<p>

<h3>Student Schedule Changes</h3>

At the beginning of each semester there is a scheduled period during which a 
student may make scheduling changes. The appropriate schedule change 
forms should be obtained at the Office of Academic Records. Students should 
then follow the specific procedure for schedule change as published by the 
Registrar.<p>

<h3>Withdrawal From Courses</h3>

Students may withdraw from courses at any time during the semester up to 
the specific withdrawal deadline date, which is published each semester. A 
change of schedule form is available at the Office of Academic Records. The 
official date of withdrawal is the date the completed form is received at that 
office. Absence from class does not constitute notice of withdrawal. A 
student who discontinues attendance in a course without officially 
withdrawing will receive an "F*" in that course.<p>

<h3>Auditing Courses</h3>
Upon appropriate advisement, a person who holds a bachelor's degree may 
register and attend graduate classes as an auditor. The fee for auditing 
courses is the same as when taking courses for credit. Academic credit will 
not be given subsequently for courses taken as an auditor.<p>

<h3>Graduate Advisement</h3>

Each graduate student must seek academic advisement and receive course 
scheduling approval from the assigned graduate department advisor or 
chairperson before registering for courses. Students are expected to schedule 
advising appointments well in advance whenever possible. Students should 
develop a course of study plan for two semesters or more each time they 
meet with their advisor. Before taking any elective course work, each 
student should have a conference with the advisor to discuss career interests 
and professional goals. Two year tentative course schedules are available 
from the departments.<p>

Graduate students who have not yet been formally accepted into a graduate 
program should seek academic advisement and receive course scheduling 
approval from the Coordinator of Student Advisement. All graduate students 
may consult the Coordinator of Student Advisement to receive information 
on the policies and procedures of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, as 
well as the wide range of services available to graduate students.<p>

<h3>Scheduling of Classes</h3>

Graduate classes taught in the regular academic year are usually scheduled in 
late afternoons, in evenings and on Saturdays in order to provide the 
opportunity for individuals engaged in full-time occupations to further their 
education. Graduate courses are offered during the summer terms in regular 
daytime and evening classes.<p>

<h3>Course Numbering</h3>

Courses marked 500 and above are strictly graduate courses. Courses marked 
1000 and above are specifically doctoral level courses. Some courses marked 
400 to 499 are bi-level courses. No more than nine graduate credits of a 
student's total graduate program may be selected from such courses. Only 
such 400 courses as are offered for graduate credit may be used in this way. 
Credits earned to fulfill requirements for the bachelor's degree may not be 
applied toward the master's degree. Graduate students enrolled in 400 
courses are expected to meet more rigorous requirements than 
undergraduates in the same course.<p>

<h3>Change of Program or Field of Study</h3>

Students who wish to change from one department to another must re-apply 
to the Graduate School. Their applications will be reviewed by the faculty of 
the new department.<p>

A student who wishes to change a field of study within a department must 
file a Change of Field of Study Form, available in the Graduate School Office.<p>

<h2>Grading, Records and Transcripts</h2>
<h3>Grading System</h3>

To receive credit for a course, students must meet all course requirements. 
The responsibility for completing assigned work and for understanding 
material covered in class rests fully on the student.<p>

Grades are recorded at the end of each semester and each summer session. 
The student receives an official report by mail. Any inaccuracy must be 
reported in writing to the Registrar immediately. Student course work is 
graded according to the following scale:<br>
<pre>
<font size=-1>
A	=	4.00
A-	=	3.67
B+	=	3.33
B	=	3.00

The grade average expected of graduate students is "B. Grades of "S" and 
"U" may be given to indicate satisfactory and unsatisfactory performance in 
institutes, seminars or practicum-type courses. No course in which the grade 
earned is less than "C" is credited toward the degree. A "B" average is 
needed to graduate.<p>

The standing "Incomplete" (I) is given to a student who has done satisfactory 
work in a course but has not completed the course requirements because of 
illness or some other emergency situation. The student must submit a 
written request for the grade "I" to the course instructor. (Forms are available at the 
Office of Academic Records.) A faculty member is not permitted to assign 
"Incomplete" unless the student has requested it and is eligible under the 
above conditions. <b>An "Incomplete" in a course taken for credit must be 
resolved within one month after the opening of the following semester or 
the grade becomes a permanent "F*."</b> The student is responsible for making 
satisfactory arrangements with the teacher for completion of course 
requirements. After an "Incomplete" has been changed to a failing grade, a 
student must retake the course concerned to obtain credit.<p>

There is one exception to the "I" grade rule. This applies to Professional 
Contributions (555-0 credit). An "IP" will regularly be granted for up to one 
year in accordance with Graduate School policy.<p>

The standing "Failure" (F or F*) indicates that the student has not obtained 
any credit for the semester's work. If it is a required course, it must be 
repeated. However, a course may be repeated only one time.<p>

Any grade, excluding "I," is retained on the student's record, but is removed 
from the computation of the QPA when a student retakes the course and 
earns a higher grade in the retake.<p>

<h3>Academic Appeals and Student Grievances</h3>

The Graduate School of Arts and Sciences has its own grade appeals policy 
and procedure. The School, however, follows the overall college academic appeals 
process for other academic related appeals and/or student grievances. Copies 
of these policies are available in the Graduate School Office.<p>

<h3>Academic Records</h3>

A student who believes that an error has been made in assignment of a grade 
must initiate contact with the faculty member involved within ninety days of 
the end of the semester for which the grade was assigned. Failure to act 
within the ninety-day time period will disqualify the student from further 
consideration of the matter.<p>

The student is responsible for reporting to the Office of Academic Records any 
other error on the academic record within thirty days after a grade or other 
academic record report is received. Marywood College will not be liable for 
unreported errors on student records.<p>

<h3>Transcripts</h3>

A transcript is issued only upon the written request of the student. A 
transcript form (or letter) should be submitted for each transcript requested. 
Transcript forms are available at the Office of Academic Records.<p>

An official transcript (one bearing the school seal) is sent directly to the 
school district, business, etc., indicated by the student. An unofficial student 
copy may be sent directly to a student upon request. A fee is charged for 
each transcript.<p>

Marywood College will not forward the transcript of any student who has a 
financial indebtedness to the College.<p>

<h3>Confidentiality of Student Records</h3>

Marywood College intends to comply fully with the Family Educational 
Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended. This act was designated to protect the 
privacy of educational records, to establish the right of students to inspect 
and review their educational records and to provide guidelines for the 
correction of inaccurate or misleading data through informal and formal 
hearings. A policy statement explains in detail the procedures to be used by 
Marywood College for compliance with the provisions of the act. Copies of 
the policy statement can be found in the Office of the Registrar and the 
Offices of the Deans. <p>

<h2>Graduation Requirements</h2>

<h3>Academic Standards for Degree Closure Experiences</h3>

All closure experiences must involve substantive evidence of serious 
reflection, adequate integration and appropriate synthesis of program 
learning experiences and curricular objectives. Closure experiences must also 
encourage and promote self-discipline, self-motivation and self-
understanding within degree candidates through the specific requirements 
defined by the department offering the closure experience.<p>

<h3>Professional Contribution/Thesis/Dissertation</h3>

The Professional Contribution is a requirement of the master's degree in most 
departments. The Professional Contribution constitutes a scholarly endeavor 
that may take the form of a minor thesis, a scholarly paper, a work of art, a 
recital, internship or other form that demonstrates the student's ability to 
deal in depth with the sources and/or materials in the field of concentration. 
Copies of the guidelines for theses or Professional Contributions may be 
obtained in the departmental office or the Graduate School Office.<p>

The program in Human Development requires the successful completion of a 
doctoral dissertation. Guidelines for the dissertation are obtained from the 
faculty dissertation director.<p>

<h3>Comprehensive Examination </h3>

A final comprehensive examination -- written, oral or both -- must be passed 
by the degree candidate, if required by the student's department. This 
examination is given once in the fall, spring and summer. The precise dates 
are listed on the Graduate School calendar. In case of failure in the 
comprehensives, a student may be given a second examination within a 
reasonable time at the discretion of the Department Chairperson and with the 
approval of the Graduate Dean. A formal written request for permission to 
take the comprehensives must be sent to the Chairperson of the department 
at least one month prior to the date set on the calendar for the examination.<p>

Students will be informed in writing of the time and place of the examination 
two weeks prior to the date of the examination.<p>

A record of examination results signed by the Department Chairperson will 
be submitted to the Dean. The student will receive written notification of the 
examination results from the Department Chairperson.<p>

<h3>Graduation Registration</h3>
At the time of enrollment for the last semester of work toward a degree, the 
student registers for graduation. This initiates clearance toward graduation 
by the Graduate School and the Registrar. The student is billed for the 
graduation fee, along with tuition and fees for the semester. Application for 
graduation will not be accepted after the first two weeks of the fall and 
spring semesters or the first week of a summer session.<p>

<h2>Special Recognitions and <br>
Programming in Graduate School</h2>
<h3>Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study (CAGS)</h3>

This certificate program is an individually oriented program designed to meet 
the needs of students for advanced study in Counseling/Psychology and Art. 
Each student, with an assigned advisor, can plan his/her program of studies 
and draw up a contract which will be reviewed each semester until 
completion of the program. A certificate of advanced graduate study is 
awarded at the termination of study.<p>

<h2>Delivery of Services</h2>

The College assumes no liability, and hereby expressly negates the same, for 
failure to provide or for delay in providing educational or related services or 
facilities, or for any other failure or delay in performance arising out of or 
due to causes beyond the reasonable control of the College. Causes may 
include, without limitation, power failure, fire, damage by the elements and 
acts of public authorities. The College will exert reasonable efforts, when in 
its judgment it is appropriate to do so, to provide comparable or substantially 
equivalent services, facilities or performance. However, its inability or failure 
to do so shall not subject it to liability.<p>

This catalog contains current information regarding the College calendar, 
admissions, degree requirements, fees and regulations. However, Marywood 
College reserves the right, in its sole judgment, to promulgate and change 
rules and regulations and to make changes of any nature in its program, 
calendar, admissions policies, procedures and standards, degree 
requirements, fees and academic schedule whenever it is deemed necessary 
or desirable, including, without limitation, changes in course content, the 
rescheduling of classes, canceling of scheduled classes and other academic 
activities, in any such case giving such notice as is reasonably practicable 
under the circumstances.<p>

<h2>Resources and Services</h2>

<h3>Financing Your Future: Investing in Graduate Education</h3>

<h3>Financial Aid</h3>
Marywood College awards a number of scholarships each year to graduate 
students on the basis of academic merit and financial need. In addition, 
graduate students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis (minimum of  
six  credits per semester) may be eligible to borrow through the Federal 
Subsidized Stafford Loan and Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. There are 
specific application procedures for both scholarship and student loan 
consideration, and all required forms must be submitted not later than the 
established deadline dates as indicated below. All inquiries concerning 
financial assistance should be addressed to the Office of Financial Aid, 
Marywood College, 2300 Adams Avenue, Scranton, PA 18509.<p>

<h3>Application Requirements/Deadline Dates</h3>

Graduate students who desire to apply for scholarship consideration and/or 
student loans MUST FILE A FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL STUDENT 
AID (FAFSA). This application is included in the scholarship application packet 
which can be procured after January 15 from the Office of the Graduate Dean, 
the graduate departments or the Office of Financial Aid. Students who desire 
to be considered for a scholarship MUST FILE ALL THE FORMS CONTAINED 
IN THE SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION PACKET NOT LATER THAN THE 
ESTABLISHED DEADLINE DATE (usually in mid-February). Students who wish to apply 
only for a student loan should file the FREE APPLICATION FOR FEDERAL 
STUDENT AID (FAFSA) not later than July 1 for the fall and spring semesters and November 
l if beginning study in the spring semester. Students applying for loan 
assistance are reminded that the actual loan application must be obtained 
from a bank, credit union  or other commercial lender. Upon receipt of the Needs 
Analysis Report from the FAFSA, the College will notify the student in 
writing as to the additional documents (e.g., Income Tax Returns, Verification 
Worksheets, etc.) which federal regulations require the College to obtain in 
order to verify and document income and student status. Upon receiving 
such notification, the student is personally responsible for submitting the 
requested documentation to the Office of Financial Aid so that the loan 
application can be processed. Compliance with these requirements will 
usually ensure that the loan proceeds will be made available on a timely basis. 
Students are advised that when the College submits a processed loan application to the 
state guaranty agency, it can take from four to six weeks for actual approval 
and disbursement of loan funds.<p>

<h3>Endowed Scholarships/Institutional Funds</h3>
Full-time and part-time graduate students are invited to make application for 
the following scholarships which are awarded each academic year:<p>

THE I.H.M. GRADUATE SCHOLARSHIP was founded in 1983 by the Sisters, 
Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary who teach in a special summer 
project. Their desire is to assist individuals in achieving their professional 
goals in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.<p>

THE SISTER M. CUTHBERT DONOVAN SCHOLARSHIP was founded by 
Sister M. Cuthbert Donovan, I.H.M., Dean Emerita, to provide tuition scholarships on 
the basis of academic merit and need to alumnae/alumni of Marywood College 
for attendance in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. <p>

THE EUGENE L. RAYMOND MEMORIAL SCHOLARSHIP was established in

1989 by the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences Student Council and other friends of 
the College. Income from this endowment provides scholarship assistance to 
students, on the basis of academic achievement and financial need.<p>

I.H.M. SCHOLARSHIPS are made possible through the contributed services of 
the Sisters, Servants of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. These scholarships 
cover partial tuition (exclusive of  fees) for a limited number of graduate 
students each academic year. Awards are made on the basis of academic merit 
and financial need.<p>

GRADUATE ASSISTANTSHIPS: Marywood College provides a limited 
number of graduate assistant opportunities that are designed to further the educational 
and career goals of graduate students, as well as advance the well-being of the 
College's academic programs and services. Graduate assistantship positions 
approved are for the equivalent of eighteen credits of academic course work 
per academic year. In addition, assistants are paid a monthly stipend for 15-20 
hours of academic service per week. Further information can be obtained 
from the Office of the Dean, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.<p>

<h3>Notification of Scholarship Award</h3>

The Committee on Graduate Scholarships reviews all scholarship 
applications submitted by graduate students. Students who are selected to receive a 
scholarship are notified of their awards in early April each year. Students not 
selected for scholarships are, likewise, notified in writing of such 
determination.<p>

<h3>Deferred Payment Plan</h3>

A deferred payment plan that allows payment of expenses in four payments 
(for a deferred payment fee ) is available for students who wish to pay their 
expenses in this manner. This plan requires payment of one-quarter of 
tuition plus all fees, including the deferred payment fee and room and board, by the 
semester payment due date or at registration. The remaining three-quarters of 
tuition is due in three equal payments on specific due dates set by the 
Cashier's 
Office. Application for this plan must be made by the semester payment due 
date or at registration.<p>

<h3>Employer Deferred Plan</h3>

Payment of tuition may also be deferred if Marywood has accepted the tuition 
reimbursement policy of a student's employer. Application for deferment of 
tuition because of employer reimbursement must be made at the Cashier's 
Office before the payment due date for each semester. This plan requires 
payment of all fees and the portion of tuition not covered by an employer by 
the semester due date or at registration.<p>

<h3>Religious Tuition Reduction</h3>

The College grants a thirty percent (30%) reduction in tuition (exclusive of 
fees) to clergy and members of religious communities.<p>

<b>VISA</b> and <b>MASTER CARD</b> also are accepted.<p>

<h3>Student Loan Programs</h3>

FEDERAL SUBSIDIZED STAFFORD LOAN. Under this program, graduate 
students 
enrolled on at least a half-time basis (minimum of six credits per semester) 
can 
borrow up to $8,500 per academic year*. Eligibility for the Subsidized Stafford 
Loan is based upon a federal eligibility formula.<p>

FEDERAL UNSUBSIDIZED STAFFORD LOAN. Under this program, 
graduate students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis (minimum of six 
credits per semester) can borrow up to $10,000 IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL 
SUBSIDIZED STAFFORD LOAN per academic year*. Unlike the Federal 
Subsidized Stafford Loan, borrowers do not have to demonstrate financial need for the 
Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loan. The approved loan amount can never 
exceed the actual cost of education less any other scholarships, grants or loans 
received.<p>

<h3>*Policy Regarding Federal Stafford Loan Borrowing Limits</h3>

Graduate students who borrow under the Federal Stafford Loan program(s) 
are advised of the following policy governing this student loan program:<p>

<h3>Borrower-Based Academic Year Policy</h3>
In compliance with federal law, Marywood College uses the Borrower-Based 
Academic Year policy for the processing of all federal student loan 
applications. This policy is as follows:<p>

The Borrower-Based Academic Year is individualized for each borrower. A 
Borrower-Based Academic Year may begin at any time within the schools 
Scheduled Academic Year based on the students start date in his/her 
program 
of study. The Borrower-Based Academic Year must meet the statutory 
requirements of an academic year or its equivalent. Equivalence for a 
Borrower-Based Academic Year at a term-based school is determined in two 
steps:<p>
<ol>

<li>The school counts the number of terms in its Scheduled Academic 
Year. The total of  such terms then represents the minimum number of terms 
that must be included in a Borrower-Based Academic Year. At Marywood 
College, this number is two. A summer term falling outside the normal 
Scheduled Academic Year may be counted as one term in a Borrower-Based 
Academic Year. At Marywood College, a Borrower-Based Academic Year may 
consist of any of the following: 
	<ol>
	<li>Fall and Spring semesters
	<li>Summer and Fall semesters
	<li>Spring and Summer semesters
	</ol>
<li>The school must include in the Borrower-Based Academic Year only 
those terms in which it is or was possible for the student to enroll on 
at least a half-time basis.<p>
</ol>

IMPORTANT: In  your best interest, Marywood College urges you to use 
discretion in borrowing money for school. In signing the loan 
application/promissory note, you are making a commitment to repay that 
loan. 
If you should default on your loan, the federal government can sue for 
collection, attach your wages and/or withhold income tax refunds. In 
addition, 
your future credit rating will be affected. Therefore, borrow only those funds 
that are absolutely necessary for your educational expenses. All borrowers are 
required by federal law to complete an exit interview with the Office of 
Financial Air prior to graduation or withdrawal from Marywood College for 
any reason. <p>
