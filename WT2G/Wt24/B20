Berger and Environmental Protection Administrator Carol Browner</b><br><br>The Briefing Room, 5:31 P.M. EST<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: Good evening. I'm going to move briskly through this, since we're not going to give you much substance, anyhow. (Laughter.) The President has just concluded what he has described as a very exciting working session with his Cabinet, new and old, today. He began today's meetings right on the button at 10:00 a.m. this morning in the Jackson Place Conference Room, a large sort of ornate room that's attached to Blair House, that frequently has meetings of this nature and also, obviously, meetings of foreign visitors when they're here in the United States.<br><br>The Cabinet and the presidential staff sat around a very large table and engaged in productive dialogue for most of the day. And I've got a lot of people here who will tell you about some of the sessions that they had, some of the things that we did during the course of the day.<br><br>A very broad range of issues discussed today, starting with foreign policy in the morning, international economic policy, followed by a working lunch at which the President and the Vice President spoke; I'll tell you a little bit about that in a second. Then afternoon sessions that dealt with budget policy, fiscal policy, building on our economic growth strategy, social policy with a particular focus on education and on some of the things that we're doing to attack problems like teenage pregnancy and drug use, and then we have just concluded with good discussions of natural resource policy and technology.<br><br>And we've got briefers here who will cover those areas, although I think you will see that a lot of the work done today is work that prepares the President's unveiling of his second term agenda at the Inaugural Address and the State of the Union message before Congress. For that reason, we are not going to go into any elaborate detail on the specifics of the discussion today.<br><br>He said that, an observation you've heard him make before, that he believes that historians will record that he has had one of loyalist Cabinets in the history of the American presidency. And in part that's because of how well the Cabinet members themselves worked together. He cited as one example of that, drug control strategy and pointed toward General Barry McCaffrey and said that he had been an example of how you could pull together the resources of government with individual Cabinet members in their own domains being willing to work as part of the teamwork strategy and not getting bogged down in some of the traditional institutional bureaucratic turf fights that have characterized government in the past.<br><br>SECRETARY RILEY: Thank you. We spent a good part of this afternoon on domestic matters, and primarily education. We had some discussions on reducing crime, the criminal issue. Janet Reno participated, of course, in that. Some discussions on drugs. General McCaffrey and Donna Shalala and I and others talked about that issue. The Domestic Policy Council, with Bruce Reed chairing it, really conducted the discussions, and it's going to be very clear that we're going to have a strong emphasis with the councils here in the White House working effectively with the pertinent Cabinet people to shape these policies.<br><br>I feel very good about the domestic policy and the way it's shaping up, especially in education. I think, as all of you know, the President's background for years has been one where he's been very much interested in education himself. He knows education. I think his first term was very successful in dealing with education and getting the American people to seize on the importance of education.<br><br>We talked about that, then we got into the next term, had some discussions on the Hope Scholarship, the other higher education issues -- the $10,000 tax deduction for tuition that was discussed, of course, a lot in the campaign; the issue of the reading initiative which also was discussed in the campaign. Carol Rasco, who is coming with the Department of Education and will head up that initiative, and we're all very excited about that -- she, of course, spoke on that and its relationship to standards. The access to higher education of course being a very important part of that package.<br><br>But the large issue that was discussed was standards. All of these issues relate to standards. Goals 2000 of course is the framework, really, for state and local control, but national priority of high standards and assessment linked to standards and state goals for reaching high standards. And we were so pleased to be able to say that Virginia, which was the only state that had not yet come into Goals 2000 informed me yesterday through Governor George Allen, that they plan to file an application. So we were very pleased at that, that's all 50 states working on this matter of developing standards, developing assessment to those standards and then getting the standards down to the classroom.<br><br>We had some discussion about TIMS, the Third International Math and Science study, which is very, very interesting and informative. TIMS study clearly says internationally, in terms of math and science and 8th grade, that standards matter, standards work. However, you've got to get them down into the classroom and that is very, very important and very difficult. And that's the job we have to do over the next four years. Again, that's a state and local responsibility, but a federal government, a national priority and the President made it very clear that it was going to be certainly one of his top priorities over the next four years.<br><br>Q: Mike, you said that the President's stressed bi-partisanship and that this appeared again during the day. Now that we've heard summaries from each of these people, where does that show up at various --<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: Most keenly, as Sandy said, and I think it was reflected in other conversations too, the need to really work cooperatively with this Congress was a key focus that we recognize -- the President recognizes that a large part of the agenda that we are going to address involves cooperation with the Legislative Branch, which is dominated by the other party.<br><br>But I'd also stress something the President said in one of his remarks, too. He said one -- for him, personally, one of the lessons of the first term is that there are a number of tools that are available to the President, and they're important to the conduct of the presidency, and they go beyond just the crafting of the legislative agenda. They are also the tool of the bully pulpit and how the President articulates policies, they're the role the President can play, lifting up examples of success in the private sector, in communities, success by state and local governments, places other than the federal government, and that is a role that he would be stressing himself. And then a third, there are areas in which the executive acts through executive directives or executive orders. The Executive Branch has the capacity to shape the agenda of the country.<br><br>But I would say specifically in that area in which we need to work cooperatively with Congress, whether it's balancing the budget, whether it's crafting a national education strategy, whether it's fighting drugs, whether it's protecting Medicare, whether it's reforming welfare, whether it's conducting or fulfilling the very ambitious foreign policy agenda that Sandy laid out, we're going to have to work very closely with Congress and we have to consult with them and have to put a focus very early on reaching out to the Republican congressional leadership to keep them apprised of their plans.<br><br>Okay.

The campaign coincides with the Partnership's 10th anniversary, and will include:<UL><LI>a month-long countdown to "ABC-D Day" -- Sunday, March 30th -- to introduce a televised town hall meeting to facilitate parents taking the time to talk to their children about drugs.

A parent's guide to drug prevention, to be issued by the Department of Education, will evolve from the Digest's special section.<br><br>"This is extraordinary media leadership," said James E. Burke, chairman of the Partnership. "We are extremely grateful to everyone at ABC and the Reader's Digest for this multi-million dollar commitment."<br><br>"Over the long run, the challenge for the entire media industry is maintaining this type of commitment consistently, long after our March efforts are complete," Burke said. "In just a few short years, the number of teens using drugs has doubled -- and in some age categories, tripled. We must do everything we can -- including marshaling the powerful influence of the media -- to halt and reverse these trends. We can -- we must -- get out in front of this problem before it gets any worse."<br><br>"The March Against Drugs campaign is part of ABC 's on going commitment to public service with a concentrated effort to change the startling rise in teen drug use," said David Westin, president of the ABC Television Network.<br><br>"In the late 80s, drug use by teens and children declined substantially in this country, in part because the media consistently portrayed the damages caused by drugs," Westin said. "In recent years, however, we've not paid as much attention to this critical problem, perhaps because of a mistaken belief that we were past the problem. The disturbing rebound in drug use among teenagers has made us think again about what we can do as a network. Our campaign goes to the heart of the problem. New research shows kids are half as likely to use drugs if an adult talks to them about the risk involved. Maybe if we start talking, so will parents."<br><br>###<br><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>02/05/1997</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><I>Distributed by <A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A>.</I></P>    <P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif"WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle  ISMAP></A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT></B></CENTER></BODY>

EST<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: Let me start -- we're going to have a written statement that will be out very shortly on some action that the Treasury Department is doing to expand the application of the President's 1995 executive order against the Colombian drug cartels. They basically, through the Office of Foreign Assets Control, can go out after the known assets that belong to individuals and businesses associated with some of the kingpins of the Cali Cartel.<br><br>They've announced today that they've identified 78 new persons and businesses that they will target for some of their enforcement activity. And that will, obviously, contribute greatly in our efforts to control what is a source of roughly 80 percent of the cocaine that comes into the United States. Obviously, this action demonstrates the President's continuing resolve to break up these cartels and to deprive major narco-traffickers of profits that are aimed at the expense and destruction of America's youth.<br><br>Q: Here or there? Assets here in the U.S.?<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: They are held in different ways and they can capture the transactions at different points by identifying and targeting the commercial activity that exists between the individuals and the businesses. Treasury is doing more on this today and I wanted to call your attention to it and we are going to have a statement on it.<br><br>Q: -- what he announced at the U.N. in '95, am I correct?<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: Correct. And we, in a sense, have added now 78 entities to the list that we're looking at. I think that brings the number up to about 350, 360, something like that, total. But we've got a statement and a fact sheet on that coming.<br><br>Q: Is it the same sanctions then --<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: It's the same process by which we attempt to retrieve the assets of the entities. So they're just expanding the application of that under the terms of the initial executive order. No change to the way they do it, just an additional identification of people that they can target for their activity.<br><br>Q: On health care, it's been reported that the White House is considering an initiative to cover children who are not insured or covered by Medicaid. To do so, the White House for the first time would cap premiums on Medicaid.<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: That sounds like -- sounds like FY '98 budget.<br><br>Q: So you're confirming that will be in the budget?<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: No, I'm saying, it sounds like a question related to the FY '98 budget, which I have steadfastly refused to comment upon. I think everyone knows the President is concerned about the coverage gaps that exist for children. You're aware that we've addressed some of those in previous budget proposals. And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, the Senate Democrats are putting forward some impressive ideas today related to their declaration that health care coverage for kids will be their number one health priority. So that's a good one to stay tuned to, because there's going to be more on that subject.<br><br>Q: Mike, the National Drug Policy Office put out a report yesterday on crackhouses around the country. And there were some 200 that were found in Denver alone. That number seems a little high. Are you surprised by the number, and how did they arrive at that number?<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: You know, I am not familiar with that report or how it relates specifically to Denver. If they saw any anomalies in there I'm sure that they would look into it further and inquire about what law enforcement explanation might arise, or what other explanation might arise. But I'd have to check for you on that, I just don't know.<br><br>Q: Mike, in terms of the D.C. package yesterday -- significant as it was described by the President's aides, why did he not and has not yet himself made any public appearances on that?<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: Because he actually has a desire to do some things at greater length in a broader context about the District. Remember, as I said yesterday, the work that the President intends to do related to the District goes beyond just finding financial resources or arranging the swap of responsibilities that we were talking about yesterday. He actually has, as President, a leadership role that he can pay with respect to the District and he wants to exercise that during the course of the coming term. And he will find a number of opportunities to do that as we go along the way.<br><br>Q: You mean explain about the speech or a --<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: I think more than just an event. I think that he thinks that this is work that's going to require his attention on and off as we go certainly through the coming year and probably through all the next four years, to make the nation's capital the city it rightly should be. So he's, I think, got an interest in doing more than one public pronouncement on that subject, and I think he will probably do -- at least do one of those sometime fairly soon.<br><br>Q: -- DEA agents who left for Cuba this morning. Is this latest incidence of Cuban cooperation on U.S. drug -- you don't know about it.<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: Don't know a thing about it. Sorry.<br><br>Q: You stumped the band. (Laughter.)<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: I'll check and see. We can check further and see on it. I didn't see that in any of my traffic that I looked at today.<br><br>Q: One more question. A group of doctors and other plaintiffs in California have sued the administration in a class action, saying that the crack-down on doctors bullies them and violates their constitutional rights of free speech with patients about the benefits of marijuana. Could you comment on the suit?<br><br>MR. MCCURRY: I will only echo what General McCaffrey said. He indicated that, as we announced on December 30th, we'll continue to enforce existing federal law. The aim of the administration's policy is to ensure that no American gets the wrong message about the dangers of drugs and to ensure the safety and efficacy of all the medicines that are available to the American public through the process that we have to regulate drugs and bring them to market.<br><br>Beyond that, General McCaffrey in his statement yesterday did not take a position on the litigation, nor would I. But I think our views on the overall issue, or the underlying issue, you pretty well know.<br><br>END<br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>01/17/1997</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><I>Distributed by <A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A>.</I></P>    <P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif"WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle  ISMAP></A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT></B></CENTER></BODY>

Dear 
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Columnist" VALUE="Columnist's Name" SIZE=40>


<P>More eighth graders in our community are smoking marijuana. And a study on gateway drugs conducted by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse has shown that kids who get high are 85 times more likely to start using other, more dangerous drugs -- like crack, cocaine and heroin -- than their non-using counterparts.


<P>Consider the fact that smoking one to three joints a day has the respiratory risk of smoking five times as many cigarettes, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. This means that kids who get high put themselves at risk for bronchitis, emphysema and cancer. 


<P>Marijuana use also causes impairments in learning and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills. In addition, users are more likely to skip school, get into fights and get arrested than their classmates who don't do drugs.


<P>Despite all the negative consequences, marijuana use is on the rise. In fact, 31 percent of all high school seniors now smoke marijuana, according to the Monitoring the Future Survey released in December of 1994. This is an increase of 40 percent over the past three years. In addition, marijuana use has doubled among eighth graders over the past few years. 


<P>You might want to examine the extent of the drug problem in our community and see why these kids are turning to drugs again. Your column could help call attention to this alarming trend and educate parents, teachers and other role models about the importance of helping kids remain drug-free.


<P>If I can be of any assistance, please contact me at <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Phone" VALUE="Your phone #" SIZE=15>. 


<P>Sincerely,

State Responses to Serious and Violent Juvenile Crime reports on state laws enacted from 1992 to 1995. The report shows that 47 of the 50 state legislatures and the District of Columbia have made substantive changes to their laws targeting juveniles.<br><br>"This resource clearly demonstrates the diverse ways that states are taking the initiative in reforming their juvenile justice systems," said Shay Bilchik, Administrator of the Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). "A part of OJJDP's role is to conduct research and disseminate information that lets the states know what other states are doing to discourage juveniles from a life of crime. This report is important because it provides policymakers and juvenile justice practitioners with practical information they can use to develop their own legislative and policy responses to juvenile offending."<br><br>Several trends emerge from the report's analysis of legislative and executive actions. Most states are increasing prosecuting juveniles as adult criminal offenders who have committed serious or violent crimes and for whom traditional juvenile training schools and rehabilitation programs are inappropriate or have not had an impact. Many legislatures have lowered the age for which juveniles who commit serious or violent crimes can be tried as adults in criminal court and have added to the list of offenses now considered serious. Also, the power of prosecutors to exercise discretion in whether to prosecute in juvenile or criminal court has generally increased.<br><br>"Juvenile crime and delinquency is a high priority for the Justice Department," Bilchik said in announcing the study's release. "Even though recent FBI statistics show that juvenile violent crime and murder arrest rates both decreased in 1995, the teen population will grow significantly in future years. We must be ready to meet the challenge through sound policy and effective programs to prevent and control delinquency."<br><br>Report findings include the following developments:<UL><LI>All but 10 states adopted or modified laws making it easier to prosecute juveniles in criminal court.<LI>Thirteen state legislatures and the District of Columbia have added or modified statutes that provide for a mandatory minimum period of confinement for juveniles adjudicated delinquent for certain violent crimes.<LI>States increasingly enacted legislation requiring presumption of open proceedings and the release of juvenile offenders' names, particularly if the offense was a serious or violent one.<LI>States' legislative responses to serious and violent offenders often rely upon corrections facilities and program resources that do not currently exist.<LI>Twenty-two states enacted laws that increase the roles or rights of victims of juvenile crime, particularly victims of serious or violent crime by juveniles.</UL>Supported by a cooperative agreement with OJJDP, the report was prepared by the National Center for Juvenile Justice, the research division of the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges.<br><br>Copies of State Responses to Serious and Violent Juvenile Crime are available by writing the Juvenile Justice Clearinghouse, P.O.

For example, California saw increases in employment of over 60 percent and Kansas found that monthly net earnings six months after treatment were 33 percent greater than before treatment.  The State of Pennsylvania found that 95 percent of female AFDC recipients moved from welfare to employment within the first six weeks of beginning treatment at a residential halfway house.<br><br>The report concludes that: "The evidence from across the country is clear: treatment for alcohol and other drug problems is a critical component of welfare reform efforts and is a successful strategy to end welfare dependency and to increase employment-related outcomes."<br><br>NASADAD is releasing Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment:  Policy Choices in Welfare Reform at a crucial time, as States have been given unprecedented responsibility for reforming their welfare systems.  Providing substance abuse treatment for welfare recipients is a critical part of welfare reform, but this was rarely acknowledged in recent Congressional debates.  As welfare reform discussions continue at the State and Federal levels, NASADAD hopes this publication will ensure that substance abuse treatment is fully included in those discussions, and in the legislation and policies that result.<br><br>Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment: Policy Choices in Welfare Reform was authored by Dr. Nancy Young, of the University of California at Los Angeles' School of Public Policy and Social Research, with the assistance of NASADAD staff.  Dr. Young is also the author of another NASADAD report, entitled Invest in Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment: It Pays, which surveyed 15 State studies of treatment effectiveness and found significant evidence of substance abuse treatment's positive effects on crime, health, and employment.<br>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>

<B>
ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUG TREATMENT: POLICY CHOICES IN WELFARE REFORM
</B><br><br>
Now that welfare reform is a reality, the primary challenge to policymakers will be to move welfare recipients to work.  In order to do so, alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment will have to be provided for many of the recipients.  Recognizing this, NASADAD has published Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment:  Policy Choices in Welfare Reform, a summary of the need for treatment for recipients of public assistance, and the evidence of its effectiveness.

Alcohol and Other Drug Treatment: Policy Choices in Welfare Reform provides an overview of the experiences of 21 States in treating low-income clients, many of them on public assistance. It finds that treatment substantially increased most clients' employability, and concludes:  "The evidence from across the country is clear: treatment for alcohol and other drug problems is a critical component of welfare reform efforts."

NASADAD's report makes three critical points:

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Between 15% and 27% of adult AFDC recipients need treatment for AOD problems.  This translates into roughly 609,000 to 1 million adults.  Among longer- term recipients, these percentages are even higher.  For States to meet their work requirements, many of these individuals will have to find jobs.  Yet they will be unable to do so because of their substance abuse problems.<br><br>

	<LI>Treatment substantially increases work participation and is an important welfare reform tool.   Treatment will help return welfare recipients with AOD problems to work.  In Arkansas, full-time employment more than doubled after clients entered medication-based treatment.  Colorado increased employment by 60% from admission to follow-up for its clients.  Kansas treatment clients increased their number of days employed per month by 50% after treatment.  Similar evidence is included from 18 other States.<br><br>

	<LI>The majority of welfare recipients who would benefit from AOD treatment are not receiving it.  Treatment waiting lists are extensive.  Considering that AFDC recipients will face time limits and States will face work requirements, the 609,000 to 1 million AFDC recipients with AOD problems will urgently require treatment in order to become employable.  Yet there will not be enough treatment capacity to handle all of them.
</UL>

While States will be able to exempt significant portions of their caseload from work requirements, most of these exemptions will be taken up by pregnant women or women with infants, or individuals with other disabilities.  In the end, thousands of individuals with AOD problems will have to be put to work, and most will need treatment in order to remain employed.

The test detects the presence in urine of marijuana, PCP, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, codeine and morphine.<br><br>The product is marketed as Dr. Brown's Home Drug Testing System, made by Personal Health and Hygiene Inc., of Silver Spring, Md. It will be available in drug stores, pharmacies and other places where other over-the-counter products are sold.<br><br>"The Clinton Administration has zero tolerance for illicit drugs," said HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala. "It is crucial for parents to talk openly with their children about the dangers of drug abuse. Parents also need access to the best medical information and drug-abuse counseling services. The approval of this test gives parents another option to consider to help ensure that their children remain drug-free."<br><br>The product consists of three components: a kit for urine collection, storage and mailing; a laboratory testing service; and a results and referral service.<br><br>The collection kit contains a paper cup for collecting urine and two plastic tubes with screw-on lids into which the urine is poured for storage and shipping. The tubes are placed in a plastic pouch which is inserted into a bubble bag for mailing to a designated laboratory. Each kit has an identification number which is placed on the urine specimen, making it possible to obtain results anonymously. Directions for use and for obtaining and interpreting results are included in the kit.<br><br>The designated laboratory is certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the College of American Pathologists, and Health Care Financing Administration. The lab evaluates the urine sample for possible tampering and then analyzes it for drugs of abuse. Screening tests used are those cleared by FDA. The lab then does confirmation testing to minimize false positive reports and sends the results via computer to the company's results center. Results are available one to three days after the lab receives the sample.<br><br>"Consumers have a right to expect accurate and reliable information from products like these," said FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler.<br><br>To obtain results, users call an 800 phone number and identify themselves by the identification number attached to the urine sample and instruction booklet. The user is informed of the results by a "Personal Health and Hygiene" phone representative, and given information about the meaning of the test result, the potential for false positive and false negative results. If necessary (or upon request) the caller is offered referrals for drug abuse counseling and medical assistance. The center operates seven days a week during designated hours.<br><br>A positive result indicates that the drugs tested for were present in sufficient quantity in the urine to be detected. FDA and the manufacturer recommend that test users who receive a positive test result, have questions about their results, or believe their results are inaccurate consult a physician for further evaluation. Although standard laboratory testing is highly accurate in detecting drugs of abuse in urine, certain medicines and, in rare cases, certain food may produce false positive test results. In rare cases, it is also possible that technical or procedural errors in the lab or other factors could interfere with test results.<br><br>A negative result means that either the substances tested for are not present or that there is insufficient quantity to be detected. The time elapsed since drug use or exposure is a factor that may cause a false negative test result.<br><br>FDA's approval of the product was based on a number of factors. These included a review of scientific issues involved in the test system; sample stability; collection tube adequacy; effectiveness of labeling along with availability of the health representatives for conveying meaning of test results and limits of the procedure; and laboratory credentials and procedures which would ensure accurate and reliable test results.<br><br>Requirements for the marketing of home test systems for drugs of abuse are under review by the FDA and an interim policy is in effect for such tests. Under this interim policy, home tests for drugs of abuse may be marketed without FDA clearance if three criteria are met: the laboratory conducting the testing uses FDA-cleared tests; the laboratory is certified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; and the product has accurate labeling.<br><br>The manufacturer of Dr. Brown's Home Drug Testing System chose to pursue FDA approval through a Premarket Approval application (PMA), although the interim policy does not require a PMA.<br><br>###<br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>01/24/1997</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><I>Distributed by <A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A>.</I></P>    <P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif"WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle  ISMAP></A><BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT></B></CENTER></BODY>

<center><B>MARIJUANA USE IS ON THE RISE AMONG STUDENTS</B></center>


<P>	A few afternoons a week, 17-year-old Sarah Smith gets high with her friends. She thinks smoking a joint is a "cool" thing to do. What she doesn't know is that marijuana use could seriously harm her.<p>
	Today, a full 31 percent of high school seniors get high, according to the latest Monitoring the Future Survey released in December of 1994.  This is an increase of forty percent over the past three years. And marijuana usage has doubled among eighth graders over the past few years.<p>
	These findings are pretty alarming -- especially when you realize the risks associated with marijuana usage. Consider the fact that smoking a joint every day is equivalent to smoking five times as many cigarettes. This means that kids who smoke marijuana put themselves at high risk for cancer, bronchitis and emphysema.<p>
	Marijuana use also affects memory, learning, judgment and motor skills. And kids who use marijuana on a regular basis have a higher rate of skipping school, fighting, delinquency and arrests than their classmates who don't use drugs.<BR>
	In addition, marijuana is considered a "gateway drug," which means that users often go on to experiment with other, even more dangerous drugs, such as crack, cocaine and heroin.  In fact, kids who get high are 85 times more likely to use other drugs than their classmates, according to a recent study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. </P>



<P>	Many young marijuana users are unaware of these potential -- and dangerous -- consequences. The Monitoring the Future Survey found that fewer youngsters today than in the past recognize the risks associated with getting high. Only 65 percent of respondents thought there was any danger in smoking marijuana, down from 79 percent in 1991.<p>
	This means that we have some serious work cut out for us in educating kids about the risks and harms of marijuana use. We must take every opportunity to prevent teens from using this drug, and to help those who already do use to quit. <p>
	Prevention programs already in place have made great strides over the past decade in reducing substance abuse. But as these latest findings remind us, we can not stop here. We must understand that every seven years there is a whole new market of school-aged kids who must be introduced to these anti-drug messages. <p>
	Just as the Walt Disney Corporation must market its movies and products to each new generation of youngsters, we must market our anti-drug messages to each new generation as well.<p>

Hoffer, M.D., Ph.D., as Scientific Director and Director of NIDA's Division of Intramural Research. Dr. Hoffer will direct NIDA's intramural research program, based in Baltimore, which includes studies on the causes, consequences, treatment, and prevention of drug abuse and addiction and on the biomedical mechanisms underlying the addictive process.<br><br>"Dr. Hoffer is a highly recognized scientist of international repute in the areas of neuropharmacology, neurotransplantation, trophic factors, and developmental neurophysiology," said Dr. Alan I. Leshner, Director of NIDA. "Dr. Hoffer will further the progress of our intramural program as we confront current challenges for drug abuse treatment, such as the need for cocaine treatment medications and the transmission of HIV through drug use," he added.<br><br>Prior to his appointment at NIDA, Dr. Hoffer was professor of Pharmacology and Psychiatry at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. He also directed two NIH funded Centers at the University of Colorado, one for the National Institute Neurological Disorders and Stroke focusing on Parkinson's disease and the other for the National Institute on Aging. Dr. Hoffer has published more than 300 papers in neuropharmacology and developmental biology.<br><br>As NIDA's Scientific Director, Dr. Hoffer will be responsible for planning, evaluating, and directing all aspects of NIDA's intramural research. He will also head up programs of multidisciplinary laboratory and clinical research based in the Addiction Research Center (ARC), home for NIDA's Division of Intramural Research. The ARC, started in 1935, is the largest U.S. facility devoted to the study of drug abuse and addiction. The ARC was established to develop and implement treatments for drug addiction and to conduct pioneering studies into the nature of the addictive process. Major research contributions of the ARC include advancing the use of methadone to treat heroin addiction and explaining repeated relapses into drug abuse.<br><br>Dr. Hoffer and the DIR are located on the Bayview campus of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore where the DIR operates a state-of-the-art brain imaging center, a 26-bed inpatient treatment research unit, and an 80-slot outpatient treatment research unit. NIDA is the primary Federal agency conducting and supporting research to increase knowledge and promote effective strategies to deal with the health problems and issues associated with drug abuse and addiction. <br><br>To schedule an interview with Dr. Hoffer or to obtain further information on NIDA's intramural research program, call the NIDA Press Office at (301) 443-6245.

<H3>Domestic Violence and Substance Abuse</H3>
<H2>The Fact Is ...</H2>
</center>

<UL>
	<LI>Every 12 seconds a woman is beaten by her partner, reports Women's Work, a public arts program funded through Liz Claiborne, Inc.


	<LI>More than 2.5 million women a year are victims of violence in the United States, according to the National Crime Victimization Survey done by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.


	<LI>Research shows that alcohol and drugs are associated with up to 50 percent of all spousal abuse cases.


	<LI>Experts suggest that men who batter women may drink in order to give themselves permission to be violent. Men also learn that violent behavior that occurs while drinking may be excused or even forgiven.


	<LI>Medical expenses from domestic violence total from $3 to $5 billion each year. Businesses lose another $100 million in lost wages, sick leave, absenteeism and lowered productivity, according to the Colorado Domestic Violence Coalition.


	<LI>The National Crime Victimization Survey found that domestic violence accounts for almost 100,000 days of hospitalization, 30,000 emergency room visits, and 40,000 doctors appointments each year.


	<LI>A study sponsored by the Sheriff's Department of Lemon Grove, Calif., found that domestic violence occurs more frequently in areas with high concentrations of liquor stores.


	<LI>A study of 234 men charged with assaulting their mates in Marion County, Indiana, found that 32 percent of the men had a drug problem and 22 percent had dual drug and alcohol problems.


	<LI>Studies have found that by treating substance abuse problems,


	<LI><P>incidences of domestic violence may be decreased.


	<LI>Counselors for batterers report that treatment for domestic violence alone is not enough --batterers with addictions must also receive substance abuse -treatment as well.

<H2>THE FACT IS . . . .</H2>
</center>


<UL>
	<LI>Marijuana is the most widely used drug in the United States, and research has shown that it has many serious and harmful consequences. Some of the short term 	effects include impairments in learning and memory, perception, judgment and 	complex motor skills. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">1</A>


	<LI>Thirty-one percent of high school seniors use marijuana today -- this is an increase of forty percent over the past three years. In addition, marijuana use has 	doubled among eighth graders. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">2</A>

	<LI>Active daily marijuana use is up as well, reaching 3.6 percent among high school seniors in 1994 -- up by 50 percent from the 1993 level. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">3</A>

	<LI>The perceived risk of marijuana use among youngsters has declined. In fact, only 65 percent of kids think there is any danger associated with marijuana use, down 	from 79 percent in 1991. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">4</A>


	<LI>Emergency room episodes related to marijuana or hashish rose by 48 percent between 1991 and 1992. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">5</A>

	<LI>The number of teens arrested for marijuana use has increased sharply. The latest data collected in 12 major urban areas found that the national median of 	arrested/detained teens testing positive for marijuana jumped from 16.5 percent to 	26 percent from 1992 to 1993. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">6</A>

	<LI>Young people who use marijuana regularly, with or without other illicit drugs, 	have higher rates of skipping school, fighting, delinquency, arrests and health 	problems than their counterparts. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">7</A>


	<LI>Teenagers (12 to 17 years old) who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than their counterparts who do not use marijuana. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">8</A>


	<LI>Marijuana smoke contains some of the same carcinogens and toxic particulates as tobacco, sometimes in higher concentrations. Daily use of 1 to 3 joints a day appears to produce some of the same lung diseases (bronchitis, emphysema and 	bronchial asthma) and potential cancer risk as smoking five times as many cigarettes. <A HREF="Marijuana_Sources.html">9</A>

<H3><CENTER>JOIN TOGETHER 1995 NATIONAL SURVEY HIGHLIGHTS </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Join Together surveyed 4,200 leaders of community anti-drug abuse coalitions
fighting substance abuse around the country last summer to learn about their
activities, views and impact. Here are some of the things respondents said:<BR>
<BR>
Local leaders believe the substance abuse problem is either not improving
(48%) or getting worse( 36%). For the first time, people in rural communities
are as concerned as those in the big cities. Only 16 % of community leaders
think the problem is improving.<BR>
<BR>
When asked to rate how key leaders are responding to increasing substance
abuse problems, the local coalition leaders charge that most key elected
officials arepaying LESS attention to this problem. Fifty four percent (54%)
say that Congress is paying less attention, and  37% say that their governors
and state elected officials are paying less attention to substance abuse
than 2 years ago.In contrast, 29% say that mayors have INCREASED  their
attention to substance abuse.<BR>
<BR>
Business and labor fared even worse from coalition leaders, with their performance
rated  fair to poor by 79% and 88% respectively. Media and religiousgroups
 also received fair to poor marks by 64% and 69% respectively.<BR>
<BR>
Community coalition leaders strongly support public policy changes to prevent
and reduce substance abuse: 90% support restrictions on alcohol advertising,
92%call for lower legal blood alcohol limits for drivers, and 80% support
immediateaccess to drug treatment for everyone who needs it. Further, 77%
strongly opposelegalization of drugs. <BR>
<BR>
Access to treatment is critical to solving substance abuse:  In communities
where access to treatment is increasing (31%), leaders are more likely to
say the problem is getting better or remaining the same; conversely, in
communities where access to treatment is decreasing (30%),  people say the
problem is getting worse.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal government's role in fostering the community coalition movement
is essential.  Many community coalitions (38%) are highly dependent on federal
money, which is currently on the chopping block. Only about 22% of coalition
funds comes from state governments.  Recognizing the need for additional
money, a growing number (24%)  of coalitions diversified their funding base
over the past two years.<BR>
<BR>
The American tradition of neighbors joining together to solve community
problems, like substance abuse, is flourishing. Over the last two years,
49% of coalition leaders report that citizen participation is growing and
new coalitions are forming to deal with substance abuse, and related problems
like HIV, teen smoking and gang violence.<BR>

<B>PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS YOUR BUSINESS</B>


<P>This is no time to cut prevention for illicit drug and alcohol abuse.


<P>Recent studies have shown us that more kids are using marijuana today. There's also widespread binge drinking on college campuses. And heroin dealers are having an introductory sale on a new, more powerful inhalable heroin to lure a new generation of customers.


<P>Other recent stories also bring news of new AIDS cases attributable to drug use and tell us that a large portion of our prison inmates have alcohol and drug addictions.


<P>Appropriately applied prevention strategies work to reduce illicit drug and alcohol use -- just as immunizations, when given, work to reduce the spread of other diseases. However, much of the progress we have made against illicit drugs and excessive alcohol in the last decade is at risk if we do not continue existing prevention efforts. And in order for prevention to be even more effective, all sectors of a community must join together.


<P>For example, volunteers from 30 neighborhoods in Tacoma, Washington, joined forces and were able to close down almost 600 drug dealing locations there. And a community-wide effort in South Central Los Angeles has been able to keep some liquor stores that closed during the 1992 riots from reopening. Some of these stores were replaced with other businesses.  


<P>A national panel examining the substance abuse problem in America recently recommended that all public and private organizations incorporate prevention principles and themes into their ongoing initiatives. In addition, the panel recommended that private sector and community groups work together on prevention efforts to amplify their impact. For instance, parents and schools should link their prevention efforts with those of police, businesses and religious groups. The panel also urged government and the private sector to support such efforts with long-term commitments in funding, training and other resources.


<P>Here are some other things that can really make a difference:<br>

Businesses, in conjunction with social service agencies, can create drug-free workplace policies and provide information about alcohol and drugs to their employees, many of whom are parents; Recreation programs and schools can work with kids to plan creative alternatives to drinking and drug use after school and on the weekends; Religious leaders can work with treatment providers to reach out through their congregations to those who need help; The media can host public forums for coalitions in their communities to find solutions to local substance abuse problems; Employers can make jobs available for high-risk youth and people coming out of treatment programs; and Law enforcement can work to mentor high-risk youth. Please act now to make sure that substance abuse prevention policies and programs are a priority in our community.

<FORM ACTION="Prevention_PitchOutput.nclk" METHOD=POST>

Dear 
<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Reporter" VALUE="Editor" SIZE=35>
:<br>


<P>Substance abuse prevention programs in our community are making great strides against alcohol and drug use and the resulting problems -- like violent crime, HIV-infection, domestic violence and fatal car crashes. Fewer young people today drink and use drugs than their counterparts a decade ago as a result of extensive efforts to educate them about the dangers.


<P>But several recent national studies have found this decrease in substance use to be slipping. For instance, the Harvard School of Public Health found that almost half of all college students now binge drink (five or more drinks at a time), and widespread binge drinking creates problems for other students on college campuses throughout the country. And the latest Monitoring the Future Study found that marijuana use is up among 8th, 10th and 12th graders.


<P>In light of these findings and talk in the new Congress to cut prevention funding, now would be an opportune time to take an in-depth look at some prevention programs at work in our community. Some examples of prevention programs are student organizations like Students Against Drunk Driving, after-school activities to keep kids off the streets, workplace programs that educate employees about the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse and public awareness campaigns that get the message out throughout the community.


<P>These programs are really making a difference. By calling attention to these efforts, you can help these programs gain support to increase their effectiveness and create a healthier community.


<P>Please feel free to call me at <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="Phone" VALUE="Phone number"> if you need help getting in touch with some local prevention programs.


<P>Sincerely,
<p>

<H3>Prevention Works</H3>

<H2>THE FACT IS . . . .</H2>
</center>

<P>
<H3>SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS COSTLY:</H3> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>--The nation spends about $168 billion on alcohol and drug problems a year(FN-1)-- that's $675 for every man, woman and child in the country.(FN-2)


<P>--The amount the country spends on health care could be reduced by $90.4 billion if alcohol and other drug problems were prevented before they started.(FN-3)</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><H3>PREVENTION WORKS TO REDUCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE:</H3> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>--The number of adolescents (ages 12 to 17) who drink alcohol has decreased by almost 3 million since 1979 -- from 37 percent to 20 percent.(FN-4)


<P>--There has also been a significant decrease in illicit drug use among adolescents -- from 18 percent in 1979 to less than 7 percent in 1991. This represents 2.5 million young people who have stayed away from drugs.(FN-5)


<P>--Prevention messages about the dangers of drinking and driving have been reaching young people. In fact, the number of fatal alcohol-related car crashes among teens has declined by 55 percent over the past 10 years. However, such crashes among young adults aged 21 - 35 have only fallen by 32 percent, indicating the need for more targeted efforts.(FN-6)


<P>--A 1994 study by Cornell University Researchers of 6,000 students in New York state found that the odds of drinking, smoking or using marijuana were 40 percent lower among kids who participated in a prevention program during 7th, 8th and 9th grades than their counterparts who did not. (FN-7)</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><H3>DESPITE OUR SUCCESSES, WE NEED TO STEP UP PREVENTION EFFORTS:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE> --A December 1994 study by the Harvard School of Public Health found that nearly half (44 percent) of all college students are binge drinkers, consuming five or more drinks at a time. On a national scale, this means that approximately 3 million students a year binge drink, and 1.3 billion do so more than once a week.(FN-8)


<P>--Fifty percent of binge drinkers in this study said they had ridden with a driver who was high or drunk, and 40 percent of the males said they had driven after five or more drinks.(FN-9)


<P>--Binge drinking affects not only the drinker but also his or her peers -- physical assault, sexual harassment and impaired sleep and study time are some of the &quot;secondhand binge&quot; effects experienced by non-binging students as the result of the heavy drinking of their classmates.(FN-10)


<P>--The 1994 Monitoring the Future Survey found that marijuana use is up among 8th, 10th and 12th graders, and anti-drug attitudes are deteriorating.(FN-11 )


<P> --Specifically, over the past two or three years marijuana use has doubled among 8th graders (to 13 percent), grown by two-thirds among 10th graders (to 25 percent), and grown by 40 percent among 12th graders (to 31 percent).(FN-12)


<P>--Other illicit drugs that have been on the rise among students -- including LSD, hallucinogens, inhalants, stimulants, barbiturates, cocaine and crack.(FN-13)


<P>--In other Monitoring the Future survey findings, binge drinking has remained constant among students in 8th, 10th and 12th grades.  One in seven 8th graders reported having five or more drinks in the past two weeks, as did nearly one in four 10th graders, and more than one in every four seniors.(FN-14)</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P><H3>PREVENTION EFFORTS WORK -- AND MUST INVOLVE THE WHOLE COMMUNITY:</H3> 
<BLOCKQUOTE>--Prevention works best when all parts of the community make it a priority and get involved together. That means community leaders, policy makes, educators, clergy, business leaders, volunteers, parents, employers, employees, youth and social service providers, children and youth, and representatives of the media.(FN-15) (See recommendation 2 from Join Together's Public Policy Panel on Preventing Substance Abuse.)


<P>--Many liquor stores in South Central Los Angeles that were closed down during the 1992 riots are being replaced with other businesses. This is due to the work of the Center for Substance Abuse Partnership grantee there that has mobilized the whole community in this effort.(FN-16)


<P>--Close to 600 drug locations in Tacoma, Washington, have been closed since 1989, thanks to Tacoma's Campaign for Safe Streets. This campaign brings together volunteers from over 30 neighborhoods working to reclaim their streets from drug dealers.(FN-17)


<P>--In the Liberty City section of Miami, known for its heavy drug trafficking, the Miami Coalition had succeeded in bringing together clergy, schools and police to organize community watches, shut drug houses, clean up parks, and start community service and neighborhood beautification programs.(FN-18)


<P> --Drug treatment is now readily available in the Marshall Heights section of Washington, D.C., thanks to the efforts of Marshall Heights Fighting Back, operated through the Marshall Heights Community Development Corporation. This area of the nation's capital, which has a high rate of drug use and crime, had no drug treatment       capacity, so the Fighting Back program organized key members of the community to help build a drug treatment and social service program right in the neighborhood.(FN-19)</BLOCKQUOTE>

Substance abuse prevention is noted as one of the components of Digital's health program for young people, and alcohol and drug prevention grants also may be considered under the company's education program.<br><br>"Digital believes that children deserve to have positive experiences and access to choices that will encourage them to reach their full potential," explains the company's <a href="http://www.digital.com/info/community/contrib.html">corporate giving guidelines</a>. "Digital is able to invest in programs that provide opportunities for children and young adults to learn, to enjoy a sense of well-being, and to thrive in an environment of achievement."<br><br>Grantmaking priorities include Health, such as programs that "address positive social development and family issues, ranging from AIDS education to substance abuse prevention and violence/abuse against children"; Education, including school-based substance abuse prevention programs and initiatives that link community-based organizations with schools; and Leadership and Excellence, including programs that "promote positive experiences and personal growth that include, but are not limited to, academic achievement and youth community service corps. "<br><br>The company makes donations of equipment as well as cash awards to non-profit organizations. In addition to educational organizations, health care and community groups are eligible for product donations (under certain circumstances, even if they do not address children and youth issues). Groups seeking computers and other Digital products must contribute their own funding toward the cost of equipment. The company will make a maximum grant of 25 percent toward the purchase of PCs and 50 percent toward the purchase of other Digital equipment.<br><br>A spokesperson for Digital's corporate giving program tells Join Together that non-profits seeking grants need to call or e-mail the company before submitting an application, in order to determine if they are eligible for a grant. Eligible programs must be located in communities where Digital has a significant business or employee presence and include significant participation by Digital employees.<br><br>Recent grants by Digital include:<br><br>$2,000 to the Salem, N.H. Boys and Girls Clubs for a teen drug and gang prevention program<br><br>$1,000 to the Chillicothe Optimists Club of Missouri to support the local DARE program<br><br>$6,000 to support Camp Heartland, which runs summer camps for HIV/AIDS patients in California, Wisconsin and Illinois<br><h3>Vital Information</h3>Digital Equipment Corp.<br>111 Powdermill Road<br>MS01/L14<br>Maynard, MA 01754-1418<br>508-493-6550<br><a href="contributions@digital.com">contributions@digital.com</a><br><h3>Mission</h3>"Digital Equipment Corporation accepts responsibility for being involved in the world in which it functions. This involvement is designed to achieve both business and social goals. We believe that these goals are not only compatible, they are inseparable. Simply stated, being a responsible corporate citizen is good business. Our involvement is motivated by a desire to take advantage of opportunities to advance the interest of the Corporation and its varied constituencies. We also seek to encourage appropriate levels of volunteer involvement on the part of our employees. At Digital, we view corporate giving as more than philanthropy or social responsibility. We see it as an investment in the future of both the company and the community. We believe the continued well-being of one is linked inseparably to the continued well-being of the other. We recognize that we cannot solve all the problems in the world, cannot meet every challenge or pursue every opportunity. Thus, we have designed a thoughtful program of public involvement that focuses company resources in those areas where we believe we can have a meaningful impact on behalf of the company and the community."<br><h3>Application Guidelines/Funding Restrictions</h3>Applications accepted year-round. No grants for capital campaigns & endowments, private foundations, individuals, trips, sporting events, transportation or tours, tickets for tables and advertising for charitable events and testimonials, fundraising and marketing programs that benefit nonprofits, religious, political, fraternal or veterans organizations, or organizations that violate Digital principles and philosophies. No multi-year grant commitments. <br><h3>Key Staff</h3> Jane Hamel, Manager, Corporate Contributions</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>01/22/1997</TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><b>Source: </b>Join Together Online</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif" WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle ISMAP><BR><BR></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT> </CENTER></BODY>

These foundations generally take a broad view of their health care mission and sometimes serve wider community needs, according to a report in the October 1996 issue of Health System Leader (HSL) newsletter.<br><br>The Health Foundation of South Florida (resulting from the sale of Cedars Medical Center to Columbia/HCA in 1993), for example, awarded $1 million to the Miami Coalition for a Safe and Drug-Free Community, while the Group Health Foundation of St. Louis (resulting from the conversion of Group Health Plan in 1985) gave $20,000 to Boys Town for a sexual abuse and substance abuse recovery program. Other health-care related activities supported by <a href="http://www.jointogether.org/posting/FundingNews.qry?function=detail&FundingNews_Aid=611">conversion foundations</a>, and closely tied to alcohol and other drug abuse, include violence, AIDS and teen pregnancy prevention.<br><br>The conversion of non-profit hospitals has been going on for more than two decades but has picked up speed in recent years, with health care giant Columbia/HCA leading the way. According to a survey by Grantmakers in Health, a coalition of health foundations, 40 foundations created by Columbia/HCA conversions alone had assets of more than $5 billion, with annual grantmaking of approximately $250 million. The creation of the California Endowment and the California Healthcare Foundation (worth a combined $3.2 billion) from the conversion of Blue Cross of California may presage the conversion of 15 to 20 more of the 63 Blues around the nation over the next five years, according to HSL.<br><br>Hospital conversions have been controversial, to say the least, arousing concerns about preserving public assets embedded in non-profit hospitals, as well as fears that indigent care will fall off under a for-profit scheme. One side-effect of the increased official scrutiny of conversions has been a tendency for the resulting foundations to be less than precise in defining their grantmaking priorities. "The converting health plan is between a rock and a hard place," Ann Monroe, president of MonroeCo Consulting, said in an HSL interview. "It has to provide enough specificity to satisfy the regulators that the foundation will be off and running in the direction of public benefit. But it can't be too specific, or it will give the impression that the foundation's hands are tied."<br><br>Monroe, who was an advisor to the foundations created by the conversion of California Blue Cross, noted that the California Endowment mission was defined as "to increase access to affordable, quality healthcare for underserved individuals and communities and to make fundamental improvements in the health status of Californians." In its first round of grants, announced in September 1996, the foundation made no awards to substance abuse programs. But a foundation spokesperson told Join Together that alcohol and drug programs would fall under the scope of the foundation's guidelines and could be considered for funding. And indeed, in the foundation's second round of grantmaking money <a href="http://www.jointogether.org/posting/FundingNews.qry?function=detail&FundingNews_Aid=637">was awarded to an AOD program</a>.<br><br>According to the HSL report, most conversion foundations go through a two-phase mission development process. General at first, grant-making guidelines tend to become more strategically targeted with the definition of specific mission goals and objectives. Since most foundation solicit community input and review as these goals and objectives are defined, it is crucial that community-based treatment and prevention advocates become involved with conversion foundations in their local communities at an early stage. One point to stress is that conversion foundations should focus on areas where they can make a difference and where other foundations have not given much support -- which often is the case with local substance abuse programs.<br><br>Another result of the controversy has been a tendency among some state attorneys general to require conversion foundation grants to hew strictly to the original mission of the converted hospital. "For some hospitals, that could mean a turn-of-the-century charter that specified indigent care or medical education, but not broader community health initiatives like violence prevention or drug education," noted HSL Founding Publisher Barry S. Bader.<br><br>The future growth of hospital converison foundations remains cloudy. Regulation has increased dramatically in recent years, and an estimated 30 of Columbia/HCA acquisitions have been killed or revised by regulatory, civic, physician or community opposition, according to an Aug. 8, 1996 report in the New England Journal of Medicine. Concerns include whether non-profits are being properly valued in these transactions; who receives the proceeds of the conversions; who will continue the hospitals' charity care, medical education and research functions; and whether the foundation will support the for-profit or replace services cut by the for-profit. <br><br>Still, increased competition in the health care industry and the high debt levels incurred by many non-profit hospitals over the years assures that the entreaties of companies like Columbia/HCA will not fall on deaf ears. For community-based substance abuse treatment and prevention programs, the key is to inform hospital converison foundations of the scope of the alcohol and other drug problems in the communities served by the health care organization, and be in a position to meet the needs of the foundations once they are defined.<br><br>(Health System Leader newsletter is published 10 times per years and available for $319 from Capitol Publications, 1101 King St., Suite 444, Alexandria, VA 22314, (703) 683-4100, (800) 655-5597; fax (703) 739-6517.)<br><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>01/28/1997</TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><b>Source: </b>Join Together Online</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif" WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle ISMAP><BR><BR></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT> </CENTER></BODY>

"Business can no longer ignore the devastating effect that drug abuse is having on our youth, our families and our nation's work force," said Floyd Hall, Kmart's chairman, president and CEO. "Drug abuse is destroying far too many American families, with an estimated 68 million kids ages 18 and under using illegal drugs. We will rally the resources of our company so that the Kmart Family Foundation can attack this epidemic that is stealing the hopes and dreams of our nation's youth."<br><br>The foundation will make "grants for charitable purposes which focus on the fight against and prevention of drug abuse among children and/or on combating the effects that drug abuse by others can have on children and their families." Only applications from 501(c)3 non-profits will be considered, and programs should target communities where Kmart operates.<br><br>Proposal deadlines are Dec. 31, March 31, June 30 and Sept. 30.

L. 103-322)<br>  authorizes the Department of Justice to make grants for the hiring or<br>  rehiring of law enforcement officers to engage in community policing. The<br>  COPS Universal Hiring Program permits interested agencies to supplement their<br>  current sworn forces or to establish a new policing agency, through grants<br>  for up to three years. All policing agencies, as well as jurisdictions<br>  considering establishing new policing agencies, are eligible to apply for<br>  this program. In addition, policing agencies serving specialized<br>  jurisdictions, such as transit, housing, college, school, natural resources,<br>  and others, are eligible to apply for this program. There are three<br>  application deadlines for this program: March 14, 1997; June 13, 1997; and<br>  August 1, 1997. Departments may apply before any one of the deadlines and<br>  equal consideration will be given to all applications submitted by he same<br>  deadlines.<br>    All applicants will be asked to provide basic community policing and<br>  planning information for their area of jurisdiction. In addition, new<br>  applicants serving jurisdictions of 50,000 and over, as well as all those<br>  jurisdictions seeking to establish a department and agencies serving<br>  specialized jurisdictions (such as transit, housing, college, school, or<br>  natural resources), will be asked to provide additional information relating<br>  to the applicant's community policing plan, local community policing<br>  initiatives and strategies, local community support for the applicant's<br>  community policing plan, and plans for retaining the officers at the end of<br>  the grant period. In addition to the requested community policing<br>  information, all applicants will be asked to submit a streamlined budget<br>  summary containing information relating to planned hiring levels, salary and<br>  fringe benefits, and decreasing federal share requirements. The COPS<br>  Universal Hiring Program Application offers two alternative budget worksheets<br>  which are tailored to the number of officers requested by each applicant;<br>  applicants requesting five or fewer officers will complete one budget<br>  worksheet for each officer, while applicants requesting more than five<br>  officers will complete a single budget worksheet based on the average yearly<br>  cost per officer.<br>    Grants will be made for up to 75 percent of the total entry-level salary<br>  and benefits of each officer over three years, up to a maximum of $75,000 per<br>  officer, with the remainder to be paid by state or local funds. Waivers of<br>  the non-federal matching requirement may be requested under this program, but<br>  will be granted only upon a showing of extraordinary fiscal hardship. Grant<br>  funds may be used only for entry-level salaries and benefits. Funding will<br>  begin once the new officers have been hired or on the date of the award,<br>  whichever is later, and will be paid over the course of the grant.<br>    In hiring new officers with a COPS Universal Hiring Program grant, grantees<br>  must follow standard local recruitment and selection procedures. All<br>  personnel hired under this program will be required to be trained in<br>  community policing. In addition, all personnel hired under this program must<br>  be in addition to, and not in lieu of, other hiring plans of the grantees.<br>    An award under the COPS Universal Hiring Program will not affect the<br>  eligibility of an agency for a grant under any other COPS program.<br> <br>    The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance reference number for this<br>  program is 16.710.<br> <br>    Dated: January 17, 1997.<br> <br>  Joseph E.

Knowing that the end of the grant was near, however, the Network had moved to strategically position itself to continue its work into the future, says Director Phil Salzman. The first move was a merger with two other regional human services organizations, which led to the Network becoming an integrated component of the health delivery system managed by Health and Educational Services (HES). A subsidiary of the non-profit Northeast Health Systems, HES operates hospitals and other health delivery services in Gloucester and elsewhere in Massachusetts.<br><br>Thanks to the merger, the Network receives $175,000 per year from HES to provide community-based prevention and intervention services. "We lost some staff but we're still here," says Salzman, who notes that the Network needs less support now because its start-up phase is over. The end of the CSAP grant also means the program can now do its own fundraising, free of federal rules and regulations.<br><br>The Network helps provide integrated behavioral health services to HES health care delivery system, including treatment, prevention, intervention and aftercare. From its roots of doing  pure prevention,  Salzman says, the Network now has a larger capacity, links to primary care and managed care, and promotes not just drug prevention but overall health and wellness.<br><br>HES also gains from the relationship, says Salzman. "We fit into their corporate vision as the community-based component of an integrated health delivery system," he says. "The Network not only bolsters community relations for HES but also gives the health system access to customers with special needs."<br><br>Perhaps most importantly, the Network fills a key role relative to the rise of capitation for public-sector clients. "If we can do a good job of prevention and early intervention ... we can save the hospital money down the road," says Salzman. For example, he notes, 40 percent of admission to local hospital emergency rooms are alcohol-related. If prevention and early intervention programs can cut that rate, then the hospital system stands to receive a better return on each of its covered lives.<br><br>Part of the reason the Network fits so well with the needs of a mainstream health service provider is that the program never suffered from tunnel vision regarding its mission in the community. "We've always been much broader than substance abuse," says Salzman. "People don't want their kids to do drugs and they want them to be safe, but that's only part of it; they want them to be healthy and well, too ... We didn't ask [parents and community leaders] to join a public policy group to clean up drugs. We said, 'You are already here and working hard; how can we help you?'" <br><br>To position themselves for strategic alliances with mainstream health systems, community partnerships and anti-drug coalitions need to learn to adapt and recognize opportunities to build an infrastructure connected to the many phases of community life, says Salzman. "If it doesn't say drug, don't dismiss it; they're all connected," he says. "Strategically look at the role of prevention in health care delivery; drug use and abuse is part of what primary care is all about -- it's part of health. Don't limit yourselves because you were funded to be a drug prevention group."<br><br>Phil Salzman, Director, Gloucester Prevention Network; Director of Prevention Services, HES, 96 Main St., Gloucester, MA 01430; (508)281-0311.</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>02/03/1997</TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><b>Source: </b>Join Together Online</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif" WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle ISMAP><BR><BR></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT> </CENTER></BODY>

The program, initiated in 1988, provides grant funds to replicate a successful model in Florida that helps families that do not qualify for government aid -- but that cannot afford private health insurance -- buy health insurance for their children. <br><br>Florida Healthy Kids is a subsidized insurance product sold through schools. School districts are used as a grouping mechanism to lower the cost of insurance for children, similar to the role employers play in providing group coverage to their employees. <br><br>Up to $3 million has been made available for the Healthy Kids replication program. Under this three-year competitive program, approximately seven states will be awarded grants. These include planning grants for states to develop their programs and implementation grants for those ready to proceed.<br><h3>Background</h3>One child out of every seven in America does not have health insurance, according to a 1996 study by the Employee Benefits Research Institute. The number of uninsured children is increasing and current trends in private health care coverage and welfare reform threaten to accelerate the rate of increase. <br><br>The majority of Americans get their health insurance coverage from group insurance plans provided through their employers. Historically, covering a worker generally meant covering his or her children as well, but rising health care costs have begun to change that. Recent years have seen a drop in employer-provided dependent coverage (from 61 percent of children in 1988 to 54 percent in 1993). Additionally, many lower-wage workers cannot afford the higher costs of family coverage.<br><br>Expansions in state Medicaid programs were able to cover many children who otherwise would have been uninsured. But rising health care costs and recent changes in federal welfare rules have many experts predicting that further expansions will not be possible. The result of these two trends is that children are 40 percent more likely to be uninsured than adults. For children with medical problems, lack of insurance doubles their chance of not getting care. <br><br>Very few insurance companies offer policies only for children, but a model program, Florida Healthy Kids, has demonstrated that a children's insurance product has a place in the market. The feasibility of a children's, school enrollment-based health insurance program  was first explored in a 1988 University of Florida study and in a subsequent pilot program, jointly funded by the State of Florida and The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The program designed a children's insurance product and used school districts to group children into purchasing pools to make the product affordable. The product was sold to families who did not qualify for government aid, but could not afford private health insurance for their children.<br><br>Moving the insurance contract from the employer to the school district also enhanced the portability of coverage, especially for families with a child with a pre-existing condition. A recent evaluation of the program found a 70 percent decrease in emergency room visits per enrollee. In 1995, enrollees had more than 110,000 primary care visits, more than 9,500 children were immunized and 719 children received eyeglasses. Teachers also reported improved attendance in school. <br><br>The Florida Healthy Kids model has two goals: create a comprehensive insurance product for school children and facilitate the provision of preventive care for children. <br><br>The Florida program has the following components: <br><h3>Eligibility: </h3>All children enrolled in school grades K_12 are eligible to participate in the program. Pre-school age siblings may also join. <br><h3>Benefits: </h3>The benefits package emphasizes prevention and is designed specifically for children's medical needs. It features inpatient and outpatient care, including dental, vision, and mental health. There are no pre-existing condition limitations and no medical underwriting. Co-payments are required for some services, such as emergency rooms, eyeglasses, office visits, and prescriptions. In each school district, insurance companies bid to participate in the program. To participate, companies must demonstrate that they have an adequate and accessible network of providers. <br><h3>Role of the schools: </h3>Schools serve as the central institution within communities, fostering relationships between the local project, community leaders, and area business groups. Schools also verify student enrollment, distribute marketing materials and provide education opportunities, and provide interpreters and translators for program activities and materials.<br><h3>Financing:</h3>Premiums are covered by a combination of state and local/community funds, as well as family contributions based on a sliding scale. In Florida, the state contributes 25 percent, local/community funds comprise 40 percent, and families contribute approximately 35 percent of the premium. The state's initial contribution is higher, allowing communities to implement the program with minimal start-up contributions<br>(approximately five percent). The state portion declines over time as the local match and program enrollment increases.<br><h3>Administration:</h3>In Florida, the Healthy Kids Corporation facilitates the efforts of all the parties in each site. This state-funded, 501(c)(3) corporate entity, manages the contractual arrangements for billing and administration of the product, and manages the bidding process with insurers at each site. A private third party administrator (TPA) helps with initial eligibility determinations, and handles the enrollment functions by processing applications and collecting monthly premiums paid by the families. In addition, the TPA verifies continuing eligibility by checking monthly to see that program participants are not receiving any services through the state Medicaid program. <br><h3>The Program</h3>This program will support the replication of the Florida Healthy Kids model in approximately seven states. While states are not expected to develop a Healthy Kids program identical to Florida's, their proposed project is expected to create a comprehensive insurance product for uninsured children that is sold through schools. <br><br>The Foundation has made $3 million available under this three-year competitive program. Grant funds will be made available for planning and development activities and for implementation activities. <br><br>Planning and development grants of up to15 months may be used for activities such as:<br><ul><li>product design and actuarial assessments; <li>securing adequate local and state funding contributions; <li>working with the schools and communities; and market<li>assessment and marketing plan development. </ul><br>Implementation grants of up to two years may be used for such activities as: <br><ul><li>enrollment and eligibility verification procedures and processes; <li>management information systems; <li>billing and claims processes; <li>securing suitable insurance partner(s); and <li>implementing a marketing plan. </ul><br><h3>Eligibility and selection criteria</h3>All states are eligible to apply under this program. A single state agency or organization designated by the state must make the application. The applicant must show it can coordinate all relevant agencies and organizations necessary for the program's success (e.g., state departments of insurance, health, social services, or child welfare, and local business groups). The applicant must demonstrate its qualifications to serve as the lead organization. States seeking money for implementation activities must make a one-to-one match of the funds requested in the application; the match may be in-kind or in cash.<br><br>Criteria used to assess applicants for replication projects will include: <br><ul><li>evidence of support from key state and local decision makers; <li>demonstrated understanding of the technical capacity and<li>resources necessary to carry out the project; and <li>evidence of sustainability.</ul><h3>Use of grant funds</h3>Grant funds may be used for program planning, development, implementation, and coordination. They may be used for salaries for staff and consultants involved in product development, data processing, supplies, related travel and office expenses, and a limited amount of equipment related to the project. Planning activities, public outreach, convening, special youth activities, and education campaigns commensurate with the scope of the project will also be supported.<br><br>In keeping with Foundation policy, funds may not be used to subsidize individuals for the cost of health care, to construct or renovate facilities, or as a substitute for funds currently being used to support similar activities. Grantees will be required to submit annual, final narrative and financial reports. Project directors may be asked to attend periodic meetings and give progress reports.<br><h3>Program direction</h3>In addition to providing direct grant support, the Foundation has funded a national program office headed by Rose M. Naff, director and Jill E. Meenan, deputy director. Foundation staff responsible for the program are Terri C. Gibbs, program officer; Robert G. Hughes, PhD, vice president; Dolores Slayton, program assistant; Paul Tarini,  communications officer; and Sheila Weeks-Brown, financial analyst. <br><br>The national program office will provide technical assistance to grantees on key design, implementation, and operational issues. It will conduct workshops and small group meetings for states with similar issues to address. It also will prepare and disseminate technical assistance materials to grantees and other interested parties. <br><br>A national advisory committee will help review proposals, participate in site visits during the review process, make recommendations for grants to Foundation staff, and assist in monitoring the progress of the program. Foundation staff will make final recommendations for funding to the Foundation's Board of Trustees.<br><h3>Evaluation</h3>An evaluation of the national program may be funded by the Foundation. Such an evaluation would be conducted by an independent research group and would focus on key questions regarding the program's impact. As a condition of accepting grant funds, all grantees will be required to participate in such an evaluation.<br><h3>How to apply</h3>Application forms with complete instructions will be available at the applicant workshop to be held in Dallas, TX on February 25, 1997. After the workshop, application forms and instructions may be obtained by contacting the national program office at the address below. Attendance at the applicant workshop is not required. For those unable to attend, a summary of the major questions raised and the responses may be obtained from the national program office. This information will also be posted on the Foundation's web site. Cassette recordings of the workshops will also be available from the national program office.<br><h3>Inquiries</h3>All inquiries regarding the applicant workshop and program should be addressed to: <br><br>Rose M.

Such an "environmental approach" was key to the success of the first substance abuse prevention group to receive funding from the California Endowment, a multi-billion-dollar foundation created through the conversion of the non-profit Blue Cross of California to a for-profit company.<br><br>The Boys & Girls Club of West San Gabriel Valley received $60,375 in November 1996 from the California Endowment in order to establish and maintain a coalition of community members and youth to reduce and prevent alcohol and drug problems. The one-year grant will pay for planning and a community needs assessment, with the anticipation that the reported results will lead to a longer-term commitment from the foundation to fund implementation of a model program.<br><br>Like many conversion foundations, the California Endowment has no specific stated interest in substance abuse, but rather defines the goals of its Community Health Investment program as funding "projects and programs that strengthen and improve the capacity and functioning of systems that impact both personal and public health." For B&GC Executive Director Daniel Harren, this meant moving away from the agency's youth education-oriented Smart Moves drug prevention program and presenting the foundation with a model (developed in consultation with the Marin Institute) that addressed the broader needs of the community. "Our approach was to show how the health of the community was being disrupted and how substance abuse played into that through the proliferation of liquor stores in the community, the use of tobacco as a gateway drug, the number of gangs, and a lack of parenting skills," among other factors, Harren told Join Together. "We looked at the environment to see what was contributing to kids' use of alcohol and other drugs."<br><br>Phaizon R. Wood, Ph.D., senior program officer for the California Endowment, said that programs that follow the model of creating broad-based community coalitions to address public health problems (such as that promulgated by Join Together) are very attractive to the foundation. "Our intent and investment are in terms of communities ... We're much more interested in investing in communities than agencies," he told Join Together. "The environmental approach applied to a lot of things, such as giving young people the skills to make a difference in their community. Basically, this [B&GC] award is to set up a community advocacy task force ... They're strongly investing kids in the program."<br><br>The foundation was impressed with the fact that B&GC worked with Marin to develop its program. "It was a collaboration from the start," Wood noted. Another plus was the fact that the club already offered education, gym, arts and crafts, counseling, tutoring, and other services to the local community. "All helped prove that we had a good track record and that we served the community quite well," said Harren.<br><br>Advocacy, prevention, even treatment and other direct services could receive funding under the foundation's community health program. Wood notes, for example, that the California Endowment currently is looking at programs that tackle the issue of dual diagnosis, while the recently funded VOICE program educates health care consumers about the wide range of health services that are available, including substance abuse services. "What has not be so apparent, because it's not in our [guidelines or other program materials], is that through the meetings of our board one of the things that has surfaced is the notion of our approach as an investment model," said Wood. "We are looking for the best investments in the community, meaning that the overall health status is our focus; we're not looking to any specific disease approach."<br><br>But does the foundation consider substance abuse to be one of those 'best investments'? "I think it has the potential to be," Wood said. "There are no limitations placed on it beforehand. We are beginning to see a couple of program examples, and  hope to be able to support some of those."<br><br>Daniel Harren, Executive Director, B&GC: 818-573-2831. Phaizon R.

(MH CDC) was the driving force behind the District of Colombia's decision to use city funds to site a drug treatment program in the Ward 7 neighborhood. And while many fund-raising experts say that non-profit boards should be comprised mainly of government officials, captains of industry and other movers-and-shakers, the MH CDC's  political power is derived mainly from the fact that it is truly representative of the entire Marshall Heights community, according to a top official.<br><br>Rose Strickland, MH CDC's deputy director of health and community wellness, tells Join Together that the board includes representatives from every civic association, church, educational institution and stakeholder in the community. Such a diverse group is bound to conduct heated internal discussions. But when a consensus is reached -- as was the case regarding the need for a drug treatment program in the community -- the MH CDC is able to speak with a single, powerful voice on behalf of local residents.<br><br>The MH CDC does have bank vice presidents, foundations directors and policy decison-makers as advisors, and they do help the group with fund-raising. But the board is comprised entirely of community residents and leaders. "We do have a bit of clout because of the fact that our board is made up of community people," said Strickland. "That's the difference between us and a lot of other community organizations. I sit on a lot of other boards with high-powered people, and I don't see them leveraging any more than we do."<br><br>For the past five years, the MH CDC has included the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's (RWJF's) Marshall Heights Fighting Back initiative, but Strickland noted that the initial request for the treatment program pre-dated Fighting Back. All seemed smooth sailing as the city agreed with community residents that the treatment program was needed. "Local residents even told the city where the program could be sited," said Strickland. However, it soon came to pass that what had been promised as a multi-modality, abstinance-based program had quietly been transformed through politics into a methadone clinic.<br><br>"The community went ballistic," noted Strickland, and the MH CDC called a town meeting where residents demanded that an abstinance-based program be added to the center and that the city add funding for the program to its budget. "What we did was facilitate the meetings between community and city officials, as well as taking our show on the road, along with RWJF officers, to make the presentation to city officials," including the mayor, said Strickland. Foundation officers made the point that if RWJF was making a $3 million commitment to the city through the Fighting Back program, the city should be supportive of the stated needs of the local community.<br><br>"What made it work was when the city saw the community was not going to accept just the methadone center," recalled Strickland. The city substance abuse agency head agreed to add the abstinance program, but said that because of regulations the center could not be co-located with the methadone clinic. MH CDC came up with a solution, moving some tenants of its community resource center to the methadone clinic building in order to make space for the new treatment program.<br><br>If the MH CDC's pilot is its diverse board, then the engine that powers the group is the way it has approached community problems, which in large measure has been responsible for the group's success in bringing the whole community together under one roof. "At one time Ward 7 was almost devoid of city services," explained Strickland. "The CDC was formed out of a civic association with the idea that we needed to take a holisitic approach to community problems. We can't bring in jobs without dealing with problems like alcohol and drug abuse ... We do more than build houses and bring business in; we do job training, offer emergency services, provide housing counselors" and more, she added.<br><br>For MH CDC, the direct dollars-and cents benefit of the treatment program has been small; the group acts as the landlord for the center, and the city has provided a nurse and a guard for the building. But that fact that the group was able to bring in the services the community wanted can only serve to enhance its long-term standing. "You have to have the citizens buy in," said Strickland, explaining the group's influence. "You can't have anything happen without that ... Our board is very active; we've never not had a quorum."<br><br>For information about the Marshall Heights CDC, call (202) 396-1200. <br>Rose Strickland : (202) 397-7300.<br><br></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR><FONT SIZE = "-1"><TABLE WIDTH ="100%"><TR><TD WIDTH="30%"><B>Date:   </B>01/10/1997</TD><TD ALIGN="RIGHT"><b>Source: </b>Join Together Online</TD></TR></TABLE></FONT><P><CENTER><A HREF="/Mapserve/footer.map"><IMG SRC="/MapServe/footer.gif" WIDTH="441" HEIGHT="27" BORDER="0" ALIGN=middle ISMAP><BR><BR></A><FONT SIZE="-1"><A HREF="/default.html">JTO</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/index.html">Index</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/search.html">Search</A> | <A HREF="/JTO/comments.html">Comments</A>| <A HREF="/JTO/help.html">Help</A></FONT><BR><BR><HR><FONT SIZE="-1">Distributed by Join Together<BR><A HREF="/">http://www.jointogether.org</A></FONT> </CENTER></BODY>

<BODY>

<P>Join Together is one of a number of resources that non-profit organizations
can use to establish a free or low-cost presence on the World Wide Web.</P>

<P>For community-based non-profit organizations, the Internet can be a powerful
tool for increasing public awareness, communicating with supporters, even
raising money to pay for services. For the uninitiated, however, the first
steps from being a Web user to a part of the Web itself can be daunting.</P>

<P>Fortunately, non-profit groups in particular can find plenty of help
getting started. A number of non-profit organizations, such as the <A HREF=
"http://www.contact.org/">Contact Center Network</A> and <A HREF="http://www.compumentor.org/">CompuMentor,</A>
have been established specifically to help other charitable organizations
get on the Web. The <A HREF="http://www.contact.org/">Contact Center Network</A>,
for example, allows non-profits that don't have a Web site to enter information
on a searchable database accessible to any site visitor. The Center also
maintains a database of links to over 8,000 non-profit Web sites already
online. If you already have a Web page, you can add your site to the database
and increase your national and international exposure. </P>

<P>Russ Finkelstein, Contact Center Network's webmaster, recently said that
many groups are hesitant about setting up their own Web sites because of
&quot;start-up costs, time constraints, or fear. </P>

<P>&quot;Our system allows them to try the Web, and be able to update from
anywhere with a password they create, and at no cost,&quot; he noted. About
1,100 groups have already entered their information on the Contact Center
Network's &quot;Idealist.&quot;</P>

<P>The Contact Center Network Web site also is a good starting point for
finding other Web-related resources available to non-profits. For example,
<A HREF="http://www.contact.org/orgs/frspace.htm">a number of groups</A>
will provide free space on their server to non-profits. And some Web-page
designers have taken it upon themselves to offer their services free of
charge to charitable organizations, such as <A HREF="http://www.tcac.com/~deema/nonprfit.htm">Doodles
by Deema--a free graphics/HTML service</A> and <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Park/2961/">Miss
J's Free Web Page Graphic Making Service</A>.</P>

<P>One frequent complaint about Web sites is that too many are &quot;all
sizzle, no steak&quot; -- another way of saying they have a lot in the way
of pretty pictures but little in the way of useful content. Fortunately,
<A HREF="mailto:info@jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A> is one of the
few &quot;Netizens&quot; out there that offer non-profits free, timely and
valuable content that they can &quot;plug into&quot; their own Web sites.</P>

<P>JTO Plug-Ins work like this: </P>

<P>Join Together staff prepares content such as:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>a daily news clipping service highlighting stories on alcohol, drugs
  and other topics
  <LI>a searchable national calendar of substance-abuse related events, seminars
  and conferences
  <LI>a database of links to alcohol and other drug-related Web sites on
  the Internet
</UL>

<P>This content is then automatically &quot;plugged into&quot; your Web
page,where it appears to your users and can be accessed as directly as if
you had written and posted the information yourself. Administration and
updating is done daily and automatically by Join Together. </P>

<P>Join Together Online includes an <A HREF="http://www.jointogether.org/demo">overview
of JTO Plug-Ins and other emerging services</A>. From this page you can
also link to the sites of other non-profit organizations that already are
using JTO Plug-Ins to enhance the value of their own Web sites, including
the <A HREF="http://www.drugs.indiana.edu/home.html">Indiana Prevention
Resource Center</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.macad.org/">Metropolitan
Atlanta Council on Alcohol and Drugs</A>. For more information on JTO Plug-Ins,
contact <A HREF="mailto:info@jointogether.org">Join Together Online</A>.</P>

L. 103-322)<br>  authorizes the Department of Justice to make grants for the hiring or<br>  rehiring of law enforcement officers to engage in community policing. The<br>  COPS Universal Hiring Program permits interested agencies to supplement their<br>  current sworn forces or to establish a new policing agency, through grants<br>  for up to three years. All policing agencies, as well as jurisdictions<br>  considering establishing new policing agencies, are eligible to apply for<br>  this program. In addition, policing agencies serving specialized<br>  jurisdictions, such as transit, housing, college, school, natural resources,<br>  and others, are eligible to apply for this program. There are three<br>  application deadlines for this program: March 14, 1997; June 13, 1997; and<br>  August 1, 1997. Departments may apply before any one of the deadlines and<br>  equal consideration will be given to all applications submitted by he same<br>  deadlines.<br>    All applicants will be asked to provide basic community policing and<br>  planning information for their area of jurisdiction. In addition, new<br>  applicants serving jurisdictions of 50,000 and over, as well as all those<br>  jurisdictions seeking to establish a department and agencies serving<br>  specialized jurisdictions (such as transit, housing, college, school, or<br>  natural resources), will be asked to provide additional information relating<br>  to the applicant's community policing plan, local community policing<br>  initiatives and strategies, local community support for the applicant's<br>  community policing plan, and plans for retaining the officers at the end of<br>  the grant period. In addition to the requested community policing<br>  information, all applicants will be asked to submit a streamlined budget<br>  summary containing information relating to planned hiring levels, salary and<br>  fringe benefits, and decreasing federal share requirements. The COPS<br>  Universal Hiring Program Application offers two alternative budget worksheets<br>  which are tailored to the number of officers requested by each applicant;<br>  applicants requesting five or fewer officers will complete one budget<br>  worksheet for each officer, while applicants requesting more than five<br>  officers will complete a single budget worksheet based on the average yearly<br>  cost per officer.<br>    Grants will be made for up to 75 percent of the total entry-level salary<br>  and benefits of each officer over three years, up to a maximum of $75,000 per<br>  officer, with the remainder to be paid by state or local funds. Waivers of<br>  the non-federal matching requirement may be requested under this program, but<br>  will be granted only upon a showing of extraordinary fiscal hardship. Grant<br>  funds may be used only for entry-level salaries and benefits. Funding will<br>  begin once the new officers have been hired or on the date of the award,<br>  whichever is later, and will be paid over the course of the grant.<br>    In hiring new officers with a COPS Universal Hiring Program grant, grantees<br>  must follow standard local recruitment and selection procedures. All<br>  personnel hired under this program will be required to be trained in<br>  community policing. In addition, all personnel hired under this program must<br>  be in addition to, and not in lieu of, other hiring plans of the grantees.<br>    An award under the COPS Universal Hiring Program will not affect the<br>  eligibility of an agency for a grant under any other COPS program.<br> <br>    The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance reference number for this<br>  program is 16.710.<br> <br>    Dated: January 17, 1997.<br> <br>  Joseph E.

The program, initiated in 1988, provides grant funds to replicate a successful model in Florida that helps families that do not qualify for government aid -- but that cannot afford private health insurance -- buy health insurance for their children. <br><br>Florida Healthy Kids is a subsidized insurance product sold through schools. School districts are used as a grouping mechanism to lower the cost of insurance for children, similar to the role employers play in providing group coverage to their employees. <br><br>Up to $3 million has been made available for the Healthy Kids replication program. Under this three-year competitive program, approximately seven states will be awarded grants. These include planning grants for states to develop their programs and implementation grants for those ready to proceed.<br><h3>Background</h3>One child out of every seven in America does not have health insurance, according to a 1996 study by the Employee Benefits Research Institute. The number of uninsured children is increasing and current trends in private health care coverage and welfare reform threaten to accelerate the rate of increase. <br><br>The majority of Americans get their health insurance coverage from group insurance plans provided through their employers. Historically, covering a worker generally meant covering his or her children as well, but rising health care costs have begun to change that. Recent years have seen a drop in employer-provided dependent coverage (from 61 percent of children in 1988 to 54 percent in 1993). Additionally, many lower-wage workers cannot afford the higher costs of family coverage.<br><br>Expansions in state Medicaid programs were able to cover many children who otherwise would have been uninsured. But rising health care costs and recent changes in federal welfare rules have many experts predicting that further expansions will not be possible. The result of these two trends is that children are 40 percent more likely to be uninsured than adults. For children with medical problems, lack of insurance doubles their chance of not getting care. <br><br>Very few insurance companies offer policies only for children, but a model program, Florida Healthy Kids, has demonstrated that a children's insurance product has a place in the market. The feasibility of a children's, school enrollment-based health insurance program  was first explored in a 1988 University of Florida study and in a subsequent pilot program, jointly funded by the State of Florida and The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The program designed a children's insurance product and used school districts to group children into purchasing pools to make the product affordable. The product was sold to families who did not qualify for government aid, but could not afford private health insurance for their children.<br><br>Moving the insurance contract from the employer to the school district also enhanced the portability of coverage, especially for families with a child with a pre-existing condition. A recent evaluation of the program found a 70 percent decrease in emergency room visits per enrollee. In 1995, enrollees had more than 110,000 primary care visits, more than 9,500 children were immunized and 719 children received eyeglasses. Teachers also reported improved attendance in school. <br><br>The Florida Healthy Kids model has two goals: create a comprehensive insurance product for school children and facilitate the provision of preventive care for children. <br><br>The Florida program has the following components: <br><h3>Eligibility: </h3>All children enrolled in school grades K_12 are eligible to participate in the program. Pre-school age siblings may also join. <br><h3>Benefits: </h3>The benefits package emphasizes prevention and is designed specifically for children's medical needs. It features inpatient and outpatient care, including dental, vision, and mental health. There are no pre-existing condition limitations and no medical underwriting. Co-payments are required for some services, such as emergency rooms, eyeglasses, office visits, and prescriptions. In each school district, insurance companies bid to participate in the program. To participate, companies must demonstrate that they have an adequate and accessible network of providers. <br><h3>Role of the schools: </h3>Schools serve as the central institution within communities, fostering relationships between the local project, community leaders, and area business groups. Schools also verify student enrollment, distribute marketing materials and provide education opportunities, and provide interpreters and translators for program activities and materials.<br><h3>Financing:</h3>Premiums are covered by a combination of state and local/community funds, as well as family contributions based on a sliding scale. In Florida, the state contributes 25 percent, local/community funds comprise 40 percent, and families contribute approximately 35 percent of the premium. The state's initial contribution is higher, allowing communities to implement the program with minimal start-up contributions<br>(approximately five percent). The state portion declines over time as the local match and program enrollment increases.<br><h3>Administration:</h3>In Florida, the Healthy Kids Corporation facilitates the efforts of all the parties in each site. This state-funded, 501(c)(3) corporate entity, manages the contractual arrangements for billing and administration of the product, and manages the bidding process with insurers at each site. A private third party administrator (TPA) helps with initial eligibility determinations, and handles the enrollment functions by processing applications and collecting monthly premiums paid by the families. In addition, the TPA verifies continuing eligibility by checking monthly to see that program participants are not receiving any services through the state Medicaid program. <br><h3>The Program</h3>This program will support the replication of the Florida Healthy Kids model in approximately seven states. While states are not expected to develop a Healthy Kids program identical to Florida's, their proposed project is expected to create a comprehensive insurance product for uninsured children that is sold through schools. <br><br>The Foundation has made $3 million available under this three-year competitive program. Grant funds will be made available for planning and development activities and for implementation activities. <br><br>Planning and development grants of up to15 months may be used for activities such as:<br><ul><li>product design and actuarial assessments; <li>securing adequate local and state funding contributions; <li>working with the schools and communities; and market<li>assessment and marketing plan development. </ul><br>Implementation grants of up to two years may be used for such activities as: <br><ul><li>enrollment and eligibility verification procedures and processes; <li>management information systems; <li>billing and claims processes; <li>securing suitable insurance partner(s); and <li>implementing a marketing plan. </ul><br><h3>Eligibility and selection criteria</h3>All states are eligible to apply under this program. A single state agency or organization designated by the state must make the application. The applicant must show it can coordinate all relevant agencies and organizations necessary for the program's success (e.g., state departments of insurance, health, social services, or child welfare, and local business groups). The applicant must demonstrate its qualifications to serve as the lead organization. States seeking money for implementation activities must make a one-to-one match of the funds requested in the application; the match may be in-kind or in cash.<br><br>Criteria used to assess applicants for replication projects will include: <br><ul><li>evidence of support from key state and local decision makers; <li>demonstrated understanding of the technical capacity and<li>resources necessary to carry out the project; and <li>evidence of sustainability.</ul><h3>Use of grant funds</h3>Grant funds may be used for program planning, development, implementation, and coordination. They may be used for salaries for staff and consultants involved in product development, data processing, supplies, related travel and office expenses, and a limited amount of equipment related to the project. Planning activities, public outreach, convening, special youth activities, and education campaigns commensurate with the scope of the project will also be supported.<br><br>In keeping with Foundation policy, funds may not be used to subsidize individuals for the cost of health care, to construct or renovate facilities, or as a substitute for funds currently being used to support similar activities. Grantees will be required to submit annual, final narrative and financial reports. Project directors may be asked to attend periodic meetings and give progress reports.<br><h3>Program direction</h3>In addition to providing direct grant support, the Foundation has funded a national program office headed by Rose M. Naff, director and Jill E. Meenan, deputy director. Foundation staff responsible for the program are Terri C. Gibbs, program officer; Robert G. Hughes, PhD, vice president; Dolores Slayton, program assistant; Paul Tarini,  communications officer; and Sheila Weeks-Brown, financial analyst. <br><br>The national program office will provide technical assistance to grantees on key design, implementation, and operational issues. It will conduct workshops and small group meetings for states with similar issues to address. It also will prepare and disseminate technical assistance materials to grantees and other interested parties. <br><br>A national advisory committee will help review proposals, participate in site visits during the review process, make recommendations for grants to Foundation staff, and assist in monitoring the progress of the program. Foundation staff will make final recommendations for funding to the Foundation's Board of Trustees.<br><h3>Evaluation</h3>An evaluation of the national program may be funded by the Foundation. Such an evaluation would be conducted by an independent research group and would focus on key questions regarding the program's impact. As a condition of accepting grant funds, all grantees will be required to participate in such an evaluation.<br><h3>How to apply</h3>Application forms with complete instructions will be available at the applicant workshop to be held in Dallas, TX on February 25, 1997. After the workshop, application forms and instructions may be obtained by contacting the national program office at the address below. Attendance at the applicant workshop is not required. For those unable to attend, a summary of the major questions raised and the responses may be obtained from the national program office. This information will also be posted on the Foundation's web site. Cassette recordings of the workshops will also be available from the national program office.<br><h3>Inquiries</h3>All inquiries regarding the applicant workshop and program should be addressed to: <br><br>Rose M.

Considering its size today, it is difficult to believe that the University of Colorado, founded in 1876, had humble beginnings on its Boulder campus with one building, one instructor, and 44 students. Although the Boulder campus has grown dramatically over the years to its present 786 acres, its beauty remains untouched against the backdrop of the Flatirons and the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. With a curriculum as impressive as its scenery, CU-Boulder offers its more than 25,000 students approximately 150 areas of study on the baccalaureate and graduate levels. Widely recognized as one of the nation's top research universities, CU-Boulder boasts an impressive faculty, which includes the 1989 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, members of the National Academy of Sciences, and members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<B>The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</B></A><BR>
Established in 1965, CU's Colorado Springs campus today serves approximately 6,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Located 60 miles south of Denver at the base of Pikes Peak, the campus spans a generous 480 acres. Through its School of Education, its Graduate School of Public Affairs, and its Colleges of Business and Administration, Engineering and Applied Science, and Letters, Arts and Sciences, CU's Colorado Springs campus offers more than 35 academic programs in which to obtain baccalaureate and graduate degrees. The campus provides a variety of scheduling options to accommodate full-time, part-time, and mid-career students. Its Housing Village is home to approximately 300 students who choose to experience the rewards of campus life on a full-time basis.

<B>The University of Colorado at Denver</B></A><BR>
Founded in 1912, the University of Colorado's Denver campus has the distinction of being Colorado's only public urban university. Situated in the heart of the city, CU-Denver serves nearly 11,000 students of diverse backgrounds and ages. A nonresidential campus, CU-Denver offers its students the riches of city life while promoting strong ties with surrounding communities in the Denver metro area. Challenging undergraduate and graduate students in academic areas ranging from the liberal arts to the applied sciences, the Denver campus has one of the best student-faculty ratios (18:1) of any public university in the West. CU-Denver's New Urban University initiative includes four focal points for the campus: to establish Millennium College; to connect the campus to the community; to become increasingly user-friendly; and to integrate teaching, research, and service.

<B>The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center</B></A><BR>
The University of Colorado's Health Sciences Center, located in southeastern Denver, is the only academic health center in the state of Colorado. The UCHSC campus serves more than 2,000 students and offers patient care at the affiliated Colorado Psychiatric Hospital and University Hospital, the latter of which was rated the #1 medical center in the state last year by U. S. News and World Report. With Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Graduate Education, the Health Sciences Center offers its students an outstanding and comprehensive curriculum in the medical sciences. Over the decades UCHSC has earned an international reputation for excellence through its many notable contributions to the medical profession. These include the world's first successful liver transplant, the world's first digital 3-D pics of the human body derived from anatomical sections, and the nation's first School Nurse Program.

Offering students an innovative way to work toward an undergraduate degree, CU Online offers liberal arts and sciences courses both in phase and out of phase with the academic calendar.  In addition to course work, CU Online provides access to student and administrative services.

<P>

As the flagship system of higher education in the Rocky Mountain region, the University of Colorado must be a leader in charting educational and organizational change. We must develop innovative new practices and listen even harder to our internal and external constituents. By doing this, the University of Colorado can become a "Total Learning Environment." 

<P>

We must make the philosophical, structural and cultural changes required to ensure that this University is the best learning environment in the state of Colorado, if not the country. To do this, we will be calling on the advice and counsel of those within the University as well as those throughout the state of Colorado. Focus groups, community meetings, departmental gatherings and open forums will be used to solicit ideas about how we can best:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Support innovation in undergraduate and graduate education;
<P>
<LI>Be more responsive to our students and other constituents; 
<P>
<LI>Use technology to improve teaching, learning, and management; and
<P>
<LI>Enhance the human, capital, financial, and organizational infrastructure for the University.
</UL>

<P>
This is a time of great change at the University of Colorado. I look forward to working with you as we seek to revitalize one of this nation's great institutions.

Events during the next fifteen years includingthe Civil War, delayed the Act's realization. Upon admission of Coloradointo the Union on August 1, 1876, the University was declared aninstitution of the state, and the Board of Regents was established underthe Constitution as its governing authority. Forty-five students beganclasses on September 5, 1877.<P>The board is charged constitutionally with the general supervision of theUniversity and the exclusive control and direction of all funds of andappropriations to the University, unless otherwise provided by law.<P>The Board of Regents consists of nine members serving staggered six-yearterms, one elected from each of the state's six congressional districtsand three from the state at large. The members select their own chair andvice-chair. Prior to July 1, 1973, the board was made up of six regents,all elected from the state at large. </TD></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><CENTER><A HREF="mailto:Milagros.Caraballo@Colorado.EDU"><IMG SRC="../../../../pics/common/opendoor.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH="36"HEIGHT="48"><BR>Comments</A><P><A HREF=/cgi-bin/imagemap/i-bar.map><IMG SRC="../../../pics/common/i-bar.gif" BORDER=0  WIDTH="284" HEIGHT="20" ISMAP USEMAP="#i-bar"></A><MAP NAME="i-bar"><AREA SHAPE="rect" HREF="http://www.cusys.edu/Search/index.html" COORDS="0,0,94,20"><AREA SHAPE="rect" HREF="http://www.cusys.edu/Help/index.html" COORDS="95,0,189,20"><AREA SHAPE="rect" HREF="http://www.cusys.edu/~regents" COORDS="190,0,284,20"></MAP><P> <FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="../../../Search/">Search</A> | <A HREF="../../../Help/">Help</A> | <A HREF="http://www.cusys.edu/~regents/">Home</A></CENTER><P>Copyright &copy; Board of Regents, University of Colorado<BR></FONT></BODY></HTML>

<P>


Of the over $1 billion in total resources available to the 
University of Colorado in FY 1994, 16.3% was in the form of state 
appropriations.
<P>

About 20,000 people are employed by CU. An estimated 16,000 
additional jobs in Colorado are also directly attributable to CU. Total 
Colorado employment generated by the University is estimated at about 
36,000, which accounted for over 2% of total state employment in FY 1994.   
<P>

CU spent about $227 million in the state of Colorado on
operating expenses in FY 1994 on such items as capital outlays and
intermediate goods and services.
<P>

Travel dollars spent in Colorado that were generated by 
University visitors, employees, and students are estimated at over $93 
million dollars in FY 1994 alone.
<P>

Student spending constitutes the most significant single direct 
effect of CU on Colorado's economy. The estimate for FY 1994 indicates 
that students spent almost $720 million in Colorado.
<P>

CU's direct expenditures of slightly over $1 billion translate 
into about $1.95 billion in incremental Gross State Product (GSP).
<P>

Based on employment, the state treasury recaptures at least 42 
cents of every dollar allocated to CU. Based on GSP, the treasury 
recaptures 40 cents of every dollar allocated to CU.
<P>

As of August 1995, CU held an equity position in nine private 
companies that accounted for 275 employees in Colorado. These nine 
companies were the direct result of the transfer of technologies from CU 
to the private sector.

Executive Summary</FONT>
<P>

<FONT>
This report addresses many of the commonly asked questions about the
University of Colorado's performance in fulfilling its special role in
higher education in Colorado.  Performance indicators are measures of
CU's efforts to accomplish its missions of teaching, research, and
service while making effective and efficient use of
its resources.  This report:<p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>measures some of the benefits to the state of CU's teaching and research activities;
<li>profiles the students who are admitted to and enrolled at CU;
<li>describes aspects of the CU academic experience;
<li>analyzes costs to the student for attending CU; and
<li> summarizes CU's fiscal accountability in meeting the needs of Colorado's citizens.
</ul>
<HR>
Clearly, there are areas in which the University and individual campuses excel.  A few highlights include:<p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The University of Colorado is the only higher education system in the state offering baccalaureate, graduate, and professional degree programs at multiple sites.
<li>CU grants 44% of all baccalaureate, masters, first professional, and doctorate degrees awarded by all public research universities and four-year institutions in the state.
<li>The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center is the only comprehensive academic health center in the state.
<li>All four campuses provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to work on research and creative projects.
<li>CU ranks in the top 20 of all U.S. academic institutions in the number of patents granted for research discoveries.
<li>Currently, the CU campuses exceed the CCHE goal for resident ethnic minority undergraduate degree recipients by at least two percentage points.
<li>The faculty profile at CU exhibits greater ethnic diversity than the statewide averages of public universities/colleges and research universities.
<li>All CU campuses have processes for assigning to students faculty advisors, who help them make responsible decisions as they develop educational plans compatible with their potential and their career and life goals.
<li>CU generates $10.17 of gross state product for each $1 of state general fund support provided to the University.
<li>University expenditures have remained steady in instruction and research, accounting for 52% of University expenditures in FY 1989-90 and 53% in FY 1994-95.  Administrative costs as a proportion of total expenditures have remained steady at 7%.
</ul>
<HR>
There are also areas that require further attention on the part of the University.<p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>CU systemwide enrollment is projected to increase by 24% by 2004.  Although the CU system and individual campuses have enrollment management plans in place, careful monitoring and updating of plans will be necessary to meet the higher education needs of a growing population in Colorado.
<li>Although the CU campuses exceed the CCHE goals for resident ethnic minority enrollment now, meeting CCHE's aggressive future goals presents a challenge.
<li>The diversification of the student population in terms of traditional and nontraditional students pursuing traditional and nontraditional programs of study will test the resourcefulness of all campuses to successfully meet an increasing variety of educational needs.
<li>The delivery of education via telecommunications and the goal that every new University classroom be a "smart" or computer-friendly classroom may help address the various needs of a growing student population, but they will also require a commitment of additional resources.
<li>Colorado currently ranks 35th nationally in the amount appropriated per capita for the operating expenses of higher education.
<li>The largest source of financial aid is currently the federal government.  As the growth in federal grant programs has slowed, the reliance on loans has increased considerably.  Proposed federal cutbacks to grants programs and changes in the federal student loan program could great restrict the availability of financial aid.
<li>As the percentage of CU's budget from state appropriations has decreased, revenues from tuition and fees have proportionally increased.  CCHE limits the maximum annual increase in CU resident undergraduate tuition to be rate of increase of the Denver-Boulder consumer price index, but resident tuition has still increased an average of 3.2% per year.
</ul>
<HR>
Many more CU performance highlights and areas that will present significant future challenges are discussed in this report.<p>
The task of designing and implementing performance indicators was complex, and there are other measurements that should and will be made of the University's performance in the years ahead.  While this first performance indicators report may not answer all of the questions related to CU's performance, it is an ongoing dialogue between the University of Colorado and its constituents about the ways the University fulfills its role and mission while using its resources wisely to serve the needs of the state.

<H4>Colorado Commission on Higher Education</H4>

<P>The Colorado Commission on Higher Education is a nine-member lay board,
appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate, that acts as a central
policy and coordinating board for Colorado public higher education. One
commissioner is appointed from each congressional district and three are
appointed at large. The Commission works in consultation with the six governing
boards in the development and implementation of legislative directives and
statewide higher education policy.
<H4>Affirmative Action Statement</H4>

<P>At their April 20, 1995 meeting, the University of Colorado Board of Regents
unanimously<I> </I>reaffirmed<I> its absolute commitment to the promotion of
diversity in the university community. Specifically, the Board affirmed that a
supportive campus environment demands that all participants in the university be
treated with absolute respect for their persons and their work. The realization
of such a climate of respect must include an openness, on the part of the
university, to new definitions of what constitutes valid and valuable research,
pedagogy and service. Additionally, the Board recognizes and affirms that a
respect for diversity requires a sincere willingness on the part of the
institution to allow all its diverse stakeholders to share in the decisionmaking
process, and that no individual or group shall be marginalized or systematically
excluded.</I>
<H4>History</H4>

<P>The University of Colorado (CU) is composed of four unique campuses, each of
which has a distinct role. Together they constitute one of the most
distinguished public institutions of higher education in the United States
today. The University system includes the 700-acre campus at Boulder, the campus
at Auraria in downtown Denver, the Health Sciences Center in Denver, and the
400-acre campus at Colorado Springs. The campuses have a combined headcount
enrollment of over 43,000 students. The University has 3,423 full-time
instructional faculty members and employs over 20,000 persons. The annual
operating budget for the University now exceeds $900 million.

<P>Just over a century ago, at the first session of Colorado's territorial
legislature in 1861, an act providing for a university at Boulder was passed.
Three citizens of Boulder donated 52 acres of land south of the town as a site
for the campus and the territorial legislature appropriated $15,000, which was
matched by Boulder residents, to establish the University. The Civil War,
however, delayed the University's formal founding until 1876 -- the same year
Colorado became a state in the Union. The cornerstone for the first building
(Old Main, which is still in use) was laid in 1875. The University opened its
doors on September 5, 1877, with 44 students, one instructor, and a president,
Joseph A. Sewall.

<P>From these beginnings, the University has grown into a four-campus system,
each campus characterized by complementary strengths and areas of emphasis. The
University is a member of the American Association of Universities (AAU), and
each campus is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and
Secondary Schools. The various schools and colleges are recognized or accredited
by at least 20 other organizations devoted to various aspects of higher
education.

<P>For over 100 years the Boulder campus has been distinguished by the scope of
its programs. It is recognized for the quality of its faculty and students and
the sophistication of its research. CU-Denver serves the urban student and
community with programs especially sensitive to their needs, such as
Architecture and Planning, Business, and Public Administration. The Colorado
Springs campus provides programs to southern Colorado as well as distinguishing
itself in space and electronics research. The Health Sciences Center's Schools
of Medicine, Dentistry, Nursing, and Pharmacy and the Graduate School make major
contributions in biomedical research in addition to the instructional and
service components. In addition, the University Hospital and the Colorado
Psychiatric Hospital are important to the mission of the Health Sciences Center.

<P>CU is among the top universities in the country in gaining research support.
Revenues from contracts and grants reached over $321.9 million in 1995. The
University is ranked 18th among the top 100 public research universities in
overall research expenditures. CU emphasizes both quality teaching and research
as dual components of fine scholarship and has established a number of
mechanisms to encourage this synergy.

<P>Source: Campus Student Diversity Reports and Fall 1995 CCHE Census data
<HR>

<P> At the Denver campus, overall minority enrollment increased 5.6%, from
1,793 students in fall 1994 to 1,893 in fall 1995. Undergraduate enrollment of
all ethnic groups grew; however, most significant gains were seen among African
Americans, who with 21 students realized a 9.4% increase, and American Indians
representing a 8.8% increase (5 students). In 1994-95, 17.3% (167) of all
resident undergraduate degrees awarded at UCD were awarded to minority students.

<P> At the Health Sciences Center, the Schools of Medicine and Nursing have
shown an increase in minority enrollment (13 and 4 students, respectively) over
the past six years. First-year minority student enrollment in the School of
Pharmacy also increased (from 20 in fall 1989 to 48 in fall 1995), while
minority enrollment in the School of Dentistry saw a decline of 4 students over
the same time period.

<P>Enrollments of non-traditional students, particularly at the Denver and
Colorado Springs campuses, have increased at a greater rate than that of
traditional students, reflecting the changing demographics of Colorado.

<H3>President's Teaching Scholars </H3>

<P>The President's Teaching Scholars Program is designed to recognize and
reward excellence in teaching among faculty members of the University of
Colorado system. 

<P>Each year the University designates a maximum of six outstanding faculty
members as President's Teaching Scholars. Each scholar receives a significant
stipend for two years, has access to campus funds reserved for the promotion of
excellence in teaching, and holds the title President's Teaching Scholar for
life. In addition to self-selected projects related to teaching, the scholars
participate in various university-sponsored activities designed to foster and
recognize elements of teaching excellence. The President's Teaching Scholars
form a cadre of outstanding faculty members at the forefront of the University's
educational mission.

<P>Each of the campuses is also pursuing its own efforts to recognize and
enhance teaching, including mentoring, videotaping, and seminars for graduate
students and faculty on teaching effectiveness.

<H2>Intercollegiate Athletics</H2>

<P>The University of Colorado offers an extensive sports program for students
through varsity, club, and intramural sports.

<P>CU-Boulder competes in Division IA of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association (NCAA) and is a member of the Big Eight Conference (soon to be the
Big Twelve Conference), which sponsors varsity intercollegiate athletic
competition for both men and women. Varsity sports offered for men include
basketball, football, cross-country, golf, skiing, tennis, and track and field.
Varsity sports offered for women include basketball, cross-country, golf,
skiing, soccer, tennis, track and field, and volleyball.

<P>The mission of the Intercollegiate Athletics Department is to advance the
winning spirit and drive that characterize all great institutions. Over 230
student athletes have earned All-American honors in their careers (led by 101 in
skiing); 52 have competed in summer or winter Olympic Games; and five have
earned Rhodes Scholarships. The ski team has won 14 national championships,
while the football team has been invited to 20 postseason bowl games, winning
the 1991 Orange Bowl and the National Championship. In 1994, Rashaan Salaam
became the school's first Heisman Trophy winner. The men's basketball team has
won several Big Eight titles and advanced to the Final Four twice. The women's
basketball and women's volleyball programs are among the most successful in the
nation. In each of the last three years, CU had an unprecedented 11 of its sport
programs ranked in the nation's top 25. The department operates a program that
is nationally competitive, academically strong, ethically sound, and physically
safe. 

<P>At UCCS, intercollegiate athletics is a relatively new addition to the range
of student activities available. The first varsity team was fielded in the fall
of 1986. There are presently eight varsity-level team sports--four women's and
four men's--associated with the NCAA Division II. Varsity teams include men's
basketball, soccer, tennis, and golf, and women's basketball, volleyball,
tennis, and softball. The sports program is a founding member of the Colorado
Athletic Conference. 

<P>There are student recreation centers at both the Boulder and Colorado
Springs campuses that support a wide range of team, intramural, and individual
sports. The Denver campus, as part of the Auraria Higher Education Center, has
access to the physical education facilities on the Auraria campus. Opportunities
for sports at the Health Sciences Center are limited.

<H2>Libraries</H2>


<P>With total expenditures of $13,206,606, 28,440 current serials, and
2,575,290 total volumes, the University of Colorado ranked 29th among all U.S.
public institutions in the 1995 <I>Chronicle of Higher Education's</I>, annual
ranking of research libraries.

<P>Norlin, the central library located on the <B>Boulder campus,</B> and the
five branch libraries--Business, Earth Sciences, Engineering, Math/Physics, and
Music--contain collections of more than ten million books, periodicals,
microforms, and related materials, and provide electronic access to libraries
and information across the country and around the world. A separately
administered Law Library is housed in the School of Law building.

<P>The government publications department collects documents from state,
federal, and local governments. Already, a depository for the United States, it
was recently selected as a regional United Nations depository. The special
collections department has approximately 60,000 volumes, including papyrus
documents, medieval manuscripts, some of the earliest printed books from
fifteenth century Europe, and one of the finest mountaineering collections in
North America. The archives department houses University archives and
collections on Colorado and western history, human rights, labor, peace, and
women.

<P>The <B>Colorado Springs </B>library houses more than 735,300 items,
including books, microforms, periodicals, maps, and media articles. Services
include a comprehensive library instruction program, electronic access to
libraries worldwide, interlibrary loan program, document delivery, and reference
services.

<P>The Auraria Library, which serves students and faculty of the three
institutions on the Auraria campus, is administered by the <B>University of
Colorado at Denver.</B> The library's collections are tailored to meet the needs
of a diverse user base, ranging from community college students to research
faculty. Total holdings include over 730,000 volumes of monographs, audio-visual
materials, and microforms. The Library receives over 3,500 current periodical
publications and is a selective depository for United States government
publications. Business, architecture, public administration, and education are
particularly strong areas of the collection. The Auraria Library is a founding
member of the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL) and provides
electronic access to libraries across the nation and around the world.
Comprehensive information delivery and interlibrary loan services are available
to all users.

<P>Denison Memorial Library on the <B>Health Sciences Center </B>campus has a
collection of more than 240,000 print and audiovisual volumes specializing in
medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacy, allied health, and basic sciences. Over
1,700 journal subscriptions are currently received and access is available to
Medline, CINAHL, Psychlit, Current Contents, and other databases.
Computer-assisted instruction is provided in the Learning Resources Center.

<H3>Awards</H3>

<P>Total University of Colorado contracts and grants from all sources
increased from $185.9 million in 1990 to over $310 million in 1995. This
represents an increase of more than 55%.

<P>In 1995, federal awards to the University comprised 76% of total Sponsored
Program Awards. Over the last decade, the University has been successful in
approximately 24% of the total Sponsored Program Awards.

<P>In 1995, the University received 2,672 awards, up 29% over FY 1990. The
average dollar amount of awards has also increased to $116,272 in 1995, up 20%
over FY 1990.

<P>Research advances knowledge, adds to the educational experience of students,
improves the quality of the intellectual community, and provides a direct
economic benefit to the state, both in terms of direct expenditures and as an
attraction for bringing high technology industry to Colorado.

Expenditures, March 1996

<H2>Students</H2>
<H3>Academic Preparation</H3>

<P>Admission to the University is based on many criteria. For undergraduates
these include graduation from high school or its equivalent, evaluation of work
taken in high school and other educational institutions, results of the
Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) or American College Test (ACT), and other
material concerning student background. In addition, each campus and
school/college within the campus has its own distinct admissions criteria.
Prospective students are considered on an individual basis.

<P>The University of Colorado has taken the initiative and fulfilled its
legislative role and mission by becoming clearer and more selective in its
admission standards. Recognizing that a rigorous course of study in high school
is the best preparation for college, the Board of Regents established the
minimum academic preparation standards (MAPS) that became effective in 1988.
These MAPS specify the courses a student either must complete in high school or
must meet by equivalent college-level work before graduating from CU:

<P>a) four years of English (with emphasis on composition);

<P>b) three years of college preparatory mathematics (excluding business and
consumer mathematics);

<P>c) three years of natural science (including one year of laboratory
science);

<P>d) two years of social science (including one year of United States or world
history); and

<P>e) two years of a single foreign language.

<P>Admitted freshmen and undergraduate transfers must also meet admission
standards that are defined as &quot;high&quot; (UCB and UCD) or &quot;selective&quot;
(UCCS) by the Colorado Commission on Higher Education. These standards require
that 80 percent of admitted students meet specific criteria based on high school
performance, standardized tests, and any transfer work. The campuses are also
allowed &quot;windows&quot; to recruit students who do not meet the criteria but
have special qualifications.

<P>At the Boulder campus, 81% of the first-time enrolled undergraduate
students were between the ages of 17 and 19.

<P>At the Colorado Springs campus, 42% of the first-time undergraduate
enrolled students were between 17-19 years of age, while another 52% were
between the ages of 20 and 40.

<P>At the Denver campus, 30% of the first-time enrolled undergraduate
students were between the ages of 17 and 19, and another 65% between 20 and 40
years.

<H2>Tuition/Fees and Financial Aid</H2>


<P>The University is committed to a program of financial aid both to promote
access for qualified students who demonstrate financial need and to recognize
merit. 1994-95 financial aid dollars (undergraduate and graduate awards)
totalled over $160 million for the four CU campuses--$101.7 million at the
Boulder campus, $12.5 million at the Colorado Springs campus, $24.9 million at
the Denver campus, and $21.5 million at the Health Sciences Center. Sources of
funding for financial aid include federal, state, institutional, and other
dollars. Federal sources contributed the greatest piece of the financial aid
pie, accounting for 71.5% of the dollars available. Financial aid is made
available to students in the form of grants/scholarships, loans, and work. As at
other public institutions, loans constitute the largest portion of financial aid
available to students, accounting for 72% of the overall total aid. Grants,
scholarships, and work make up 28% of financial aid awarded.

<H2>Economic Impact Highlights</H2>
<P>Of the over $1 billion in total resources available to the University of
Colorado in FY 1994, 16.3% was in the form of state appropriations.
<P>About 20,000 people are employed by CU. An estimated 16,000 additional jobs
in Colorado are also directly attributable to CU. Total Colorado employment
generated by the University is estimated at about 36,000, which accounted for
over 2% of total state employment in FY 1994.
<P>CU spent about $227 million in the state of Colorado on operating expenses
in FY 1994 on such items as capital outlays and intermediate goods and services.
<P>Travel dollars spent in Colorado that were generated by University visitors,
employees, and students are estimated at over $93 million dollars in FY 1994
alone.
<P>Student spending constitutes the most significant single direct effect of CU
on Colorado's economy. The estimate for FY 1994 indicates that students spent
almost $720 million in Colorado.
<P>CU's direct expenditures of slightly over $1 billion translate into about
$1.95 billion in incremental Gross State Product (GSP).
<P>Based on employment, the state treasury recaptures at least 42 cents of
every dollar allocated to CU. Based on GSP, the treasury recaptures 40 cents of
every dollar allocated to CU.
<P>As of August 1995, CU held an equity position in nine private companies that
accounted for 275 employees in Colorado. These nine companies were the direct
result of the transfer of technologies from CU to the private sector.
<H2>The University of Colorado: A Sound Investment</H2>
<P>The University of Colorado, with campuses at Boulder, Colorado Springs,
downtown Denver, and the Health Sciences Center, also in Denver, makes a
significant contribution to the economic vitality of Colorado. This overview
brochure summarizes highlights of a quantitative study completed in 1995 that
assessed how public and private resources invested in the University yield
economic benefits to the state in terms of increased employment, local
expenditures, gross state product, and tax revenues. (See <I>Economic Impact
Study</I> by Michael J. Greenwood, Christiane W. Griffin,  and J. Alan Owen,
University of Colorado, Office of Central Information and Analysis, September
1995. )
<P>This study is mostly concerned with analyzing the <B>demand-side effects</B>
of the University on the state's economy. In other words, what are the effects
that the University has on Colorado's economy based on what goods and services
CU and its employees, students, and visitors purchase locally? These effects are
quantifiable because, for example, University employment and local purchases are
known.
<P><B>Supply-side effects</B> or the effects that the University has on the
Colorado economy based on the resources it offers to the state, such as research
facilities and highly skilled labor, are also important to understand, even
though they are often harder to quantify. The presence of research facilities
and highly skilled labor attracts further business activity to the state, for
example, some of which may be directly attributable to the University.
<P>Any attempt to evaluate the economic benefits of a complex public
institution such as CU will reveal that there are many other benefits that are
difficult if not impossible to measure. For example, every major medical
breakthrough at the Health Sciences Center provides countless benefits to those
whose health is directly affected. By providing access to libraries, non-credit
courses, cultural, and athletic events, CU enhances the quality of life for all
citizens of the state. Such <B>unmeasured benefits</B> of CU are likely to be
even greater than the measured ones, which is the reason why CU continues to
receive public financial support. The people of Colorado know that financial
support for CU is a sound investment in Colorado.

<H2>Total Economic Impact</H2>
<P>During FY 1994, the state of Colorado provided 16.3% of CU's total budget of
$1.091 billion. The University employed over 20,000 persons and had a payroll in
excess of $47.18 million. The University attracts funding from many sources
other than the state, such as tuition from its students and grants and contracts
from federal agencies and other supporters of its research mission. Since these
funds are spent in Colorado, they generate additional jobs, business activity,
and tax revenues for the state.

<HR>
<P>This study sought to quantify the economic impact of CU on the state on
three levels. First, it measured <B>direct </B>effects, such as the effects of
the University's payroll, operating expenses made locally, and local purchases
made by students and persons attending University-related functions. Second, it
estimated the <B>indirect </B>effects, or the economic activity generated
between Colorado firms in order to meet University demand for local goods and
services. Third, it looked at the <B>induced</B> effects, which result from
expenditures made in the state by CU employees. All three effects were estimated
and totaled in order to determine a <B>total economic effect.</B>
<P>To calculate these effects, conservative methods were used to determine a
range of estimates. (Two sets of estimates, upper-bound and lower-bound, were
used to measure the direct, demand-side effects of CU on the economy.
Methodologies for reaching these estimates are derived in the complete report,
<I>Economic Impact Study</I>. Upper-bound estimates, which are still
conservative, are used throughout this summary.) The study is also conservative
in its use of multipliers. A
<B>multiplier</B> is the ratio between direct employment and spending effects
to allow for the calculation of an estimate of the total economic effect of the
University. The multipliers used in this study are on the low end of comparable
multipliers used to study economic impacts at other universities. (The economic
impacts of CU as estimated in this study are therefore quite conservative,
because lower mulitplier values translate into lesser economic impacts, other
factors being constant.)

<HR>
<P>When people are employed by CU, they create a direct demand for further
goods and services in the local economy. An average employment multiplier of 1.8
for all four campuses describes how many more demand-side jobs are created by CU
employment. (The employment multipliers actually range from 1.74 to 1.98,
depending on the campus. The average is 1.8 for all campuses. )
<P>During FY 1994 Colorado, as a whole, had 1,710,900 jobs. This estimate of
the demand-side effects of the University suggests that about 2.1% of these jobs
can be attributed to CU through direct, indirect, and induced effects.
<P>An extremely conservative estimate of the supply-side impact of the
University adds another 7,189 jobs, not to mention about 7,500 more jobs due to
the location in Colorado of various federal science laboratories that work
closely with CU and that may not have been located in Colorado in the absence of
the University.
<H2>University Expenditures</H2>
<P>Another way that the University benefits Colorado's economy relates to the
local expenditures it makes associated with operating expenses, such as
purchasing office supplies, motor vehicles and their maintenance, utilities,
books and periodicals, custodial and repair services, and insurance, just to
name a few. In addition, there are capital outlays for equipment, the
construction of new buildings, and the improvement of existing ones.

<P>For the purposes of this study, travel expenditures related to CU were
categorized as (1) visitors who come from outside Colorado to attend University
functions, (2) official University travel sponsored by University funds, (3)
out-of-state visitors who come to see students, and (4) Colorado vacations taken
by students.
<P>Several sources were used to estimate travel demand. The number of visitors
who came from outside Colorado to attend University functions was obtained from
the departments sponsoring such activities, such as the Athletics Department or
Conference Services. Estimates of the number of out-of-state visitors who came
to see students and the impact of student vacations were made using data from
the <I>College Costs Survey</I> conducted in 1988 by the Office of Policy and

<H2>Gross State Product</H2>
<P>Gross state product (GSP) is a measure of the total value of goods and
services produced in Colorado. With an average multiplier of 1.9 for this type
of economic activity, the University's direct expenditures of slightly over $1
billion translate into about $1.92 billion in incremental GSP.
<P>These respective estimates suggest that, based on $188.9 million of state
support (including some local government), CU generates about $10.17 of
additional GSP per dollar of state support. These figures are very high compared
to other uses of state funds and refer to demand-side effects only.

<H2>Taxes</H2>
<P>Some fraction of what CU receives in state support flows back into the state
coffers as incremental tax returns due to the economic activity attributable to
CU. These incremental tax revenues are difficult to measure with any precision,
but they suggest that a large fraction of state support provided to CU flows
back into the state treasury. Based on incremental employment due to demand-side
effects only, the state treasury recaptures at least 42 cents of every dollar
allocated to CU. Based on GSP, the treasury recaptures at least 40 cents for
every dollar allocated to CU.
<P>In any case, because the state provides only a relatively small fraction of
the University's total budget and because tax revenues are generated on much of
the University's total spending, the net cost to the state treasury was not
$188.9 million (FY 1994) but a substantially smaller sum.
<P>The above estimates of tax receipts per dollar of state spending on CU
consider demand-side effects only. These estimates do not include, for example,
the greater income tax collections made possible for higher earnings due to the
education provided to CU graduates. Neither do they include any supply-side
influences, such as the presence of research facilities associated with CU that
attract professionals with higher incomes to the state. It is safe to conclude
that a large portion of state spending on CU returns to the state in the form of
tax collections made possible by economic activity stimulated by the University.
These tax collections may even exceed the total state allocations made to CU.

<HR>
<H2>Unmeasured Benefits</H2>
<P>Not all benefits and costs of any major institution are easily measurable.
For example, the benefits to society of having a more highly educated population
are great, but they are not treated as a component of this study.
<P>Moreover, like any major research university, CU has a number of satellite
institutions and private firms in its vicinity. Certain of these institutions
and firms are located in the areas due to the presence of the University. They
have employees, meet payrolls, and generate multiplier effects much like those
generated by the University itself. Although these types of organizations are
not accounted for in the direct or indirect effects of CU, their presence is
important to the state and the local economies.
<P>As a major research institution, CU has many such satellite operations
associated with its presence. Certain of these operations have loose ties to the
University. For others the ties are more tangible. In the absence of a detailed
survey, a few of these operations can at least be noted.
<P><B>Technology Transfer.</B> University of Colorado professors and other
research scientist develop new, often patentable, technologies and the
University participates as a partner in the commercial application of these
technologies. In 1994 the University's Office of Intellectual Resources and
Technology Transfer generated $2 million in royalty licensing and income. As of
August 1995, CU held an equity position in nine private companies that accounted
for 275 employees in Colorado. These nine companies were the direct result of
the transfer of technologies from the University to the private sector.
<P><B>Educational Facilities. </B>A second type of satellite operation are the
many educational facilities that cater to CU students and others. For example,
the Economics Institute in Boulder employs 87 people and provides high quality
academic training in the English language to international students and
professionals who plan to study in the United States or Canada.
<P><B>Federal Scientific Installations. </B>Third, faculty members and
professional staff at CU have numerous interactions with the scientific
community in Colorado. Indeed, the location of a number of major federal
scientific installations in Colorado is due to the presence of the University.
The direct effects of these federal facilities are not accounted for in this
report, but the magnitude of their operations is illustrated below.
<P>In 1995 five of these federal facilities alone account for over 3,300
employees in Colorado. With a multiplier of 2.28, these federal jobs would
support about 7,500 total jobs in Colorado, which would in turn generate roughly
an additional 8.3 cents of tax revenues per dollar of state and local support
allocated to CU.  (Data from the 1989 <I>Colorado Business Survey</I> produced
by the Colorado Office of Economic Development and Analysis were used to
calculate this multiplier.)

<H2>Letter From the President</H2>

<P>February, 1996

<P>Dear Citizens of Colorado:

<P>One of the reasons the University of Colorado four-campus system exists is
for the benefit of the citizens of Colorado. Its purpose is to discover and
create new knowledge, analyze and integrate knowledge, interpret and apply
knowledge, and transmit knowledge and the skills for lifelong learning. Although
the University of Colorado continues to demonstrate success in most of these
activities, it is apparent that not everyone comprehends the role of the
University nor is aware of its accomplishments.

<P>As a public institution of higher education, we must always demonstrate that
we are good stewards of the resources that are provided to us. This report is
intended to address many of the commonly asked questions about our performance
in fulfilling our roles and missions. In it we have attempted to be honest with
ourselves and with the public at large. Clearly, there are some areas in which
the University and its individual campuses excel. There are also areas which
require focus and commitment for improvement.

<P>In my many years at the University, I have come to appreciate our
willingness to ask ourselves tough questions. I am proud that, as an academic
community, we have developed a strong culture of self-evaluation. Indeed, most
of the information in this report comes from long-time institutional practices
of student evaluations of faculty, alumni and employer surveys, program reviews,
and management information analyses.

<P>The task of designing and implementing performance indicators is complex.
There are other measurements that should and will be made of the University's
performance in the years ahead. This initial report represents our commitment to
maintain an ongoing dialogue between the University of Colorado and its
constituents about how we fulfill our roles and missions in meeting the needs of
Colorado.

<P>Sincerely,

<P>John C. Buechner<BR>
President<BR>

<HR>
<H2>Executive Summary</H2>

<P>This report addresses many of the commonly asked questions about the
University of Colorado's performance in fulfilling its special role in higher
education in Colorado. Performance indicators are measures of CU's efforts to
accomplish its missions of teaching, research, and service while making
effective and efficient use of its resources. This report: 

<P>measures some of the benefits to the state of CU's teaching and research
activities; 

<P>profiles the students who are admitted to and enrolled at CU;

<P>describes aspects of the CU academic experience; 

<P>analyzes costs to the student for attending CU; and

<P>summarizes CU's fiscal accountability in meeting the needs of Colorado's
citizens. 

<P>Clearly, there are areas in which the University and individual campuses
excel. A few highlights include: 

<P>The University of Colorado is the only higher education system in the state
offering baccalaureate, graduate, and professional degree programs at multiple
sites. 

<P>CU grants 44% of all baccalaureate, masters, first-professional, and
doctorate degrees awarded by all public research universities and four-year
institutions in the state. 

<P>The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center is the only comprehensive
academic health center in the state. 

<P>All four campuses provide opportunities for undergraduate and graduate
students to work on research and creative projects. 

<P>CU ranks in the top 20 of all U.S. academic institutions in the number of
patents granted for research discoveries. 

<P>Currently, the CU campuses exceed the Colorado Commission on Higher
Education (CCHE) goal for resident ethnic minority undergraduate degree
recipients by at least two percentage points. 

<P>The faculty profile at CU exhibits greater ethnic diversity than the
statewide averages of public universities/colleges and research universities.


<P>Each campus has processes for assigning faculty advisors to students to help
guide the students toward the most responsible and direct route toward
graduation.

<P>CU generates $10.17 of gross state product for each $1 of state general fund
support provided to the University. 

<P>University expenditures have remained steady in instruction and research,
accounting for 52% of University expenditures in FY 1989-90 and 53% in FY
1994-95. Administrative costs as a proportion of total expenditures have
remained steady at 7%.

<P>There are also areas that require further attention on the part of the
University. 

<P>CU systemwide enrollment is projected to increase by 24% by 2004. Although
the CU system and the individual campuses have enrollment management plans in
place, careful monitoring and updating of plans will be necessary to meet the
higher education needs of a growing population in Colorado. 

<P>Although the CU campuses exceed the CCHE goals for resident ethnic minority
enrollment now, meeting CCHE's aggressive future goals presents a challenge.

<P>The diversification of the student population in terms of traditional and
nontraditional students pursuing traditional and nontraditional programs of
study will test the resourcefulness of all campuses to successfully meet an
increasing variety of educational needs.

<P>The delivery of education via telecommunications and the goal that every new
University classroom be a &quot;smart&quot; or computer-friendly classroom may
help address the various needs of a growing student population, but they will
also require a commitment of additional resources. 

<P>Colorado currently ranks 35th nationally in the amount appropriated per
capita for the operating expenses of higher education. 

<P>The largest source for financial aid is currently the federal government. As
the growth in federal grant programs has slowed, the reliance on loans has
increased considerably. Proposed federal cutbacks to grants programs and changes
in the federal student loan program could greatly restrict the availability of
financial aid.

<P>As the percentage of CU's budget from state appropriations has decreased,
revenues from tuition and fees have proportionally increased. The Colorado
Legislature limits the maximum annual increase in CU resident undergraduate
tuition to the rate of increase of the Denver-Boulder consumer price index, but
resident tuition has still increased an average of 3.2 % per year.

<P>Many more CU performance highlights and areas that will present significant
future challenges are discussed in this report.

<P>The task of designing and implementing performance indicators was complex,
and there are other measurements that should and will be made of the
University's performance in the years ahead. While this first performance
indicators report may not answer all of the questions related to CU's
performance, it is an attempt to initiate an ongoing dialogue between the
University of Colorado and its constituents about the ways the University
fulfills its role and mission while using its resources wisely to serve the
needs of the state.
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<P>The four-campus University of Colorado system serves a special role in
higher education in Colorado. It is a comprehensive research institution and the
only higher education system in the state offering baccalaureate, graduate
education, and professional degree programs at multiple sites. 

<P>As a comprehensive institution, the University engages in scholarship and
teaching that encompass a broad set of disciplines and professional programs
addressed from the most basic levels to the frontiers of knowledge. As a
research institution, the University is actively involved in the discovery of
new knowledge, and faculty research permeates the learning experience of
students at CU, both in the form of classroom content and in the teaching of
research skills. 

<P>The synergy of this four-campus system makes a unique contribution to the
needs of the state. Through the collaboration of the faculty and the sharing of
resources (e.g., libraries and special courses) among campuses, students are
afforded more opportunities to realize their academic and career aspirations
than if they were confined to a single campus. Likewise, business and industry
have access to the services and discoveries of the institution as a whole.

<P>CU plays a vital role in Colorado higher education through its missions of
teaching, research, and service, shared by all four campuses. Each campus also
has a special function within the CU system: 

<P><B>The University of Colorado at Boulder</B> is committed to the liberal
education of students and to a broad curriculum ranging from the baccalaureate
through the postdoctoral levels. The mission at CU-Boulder is to lead in the
discovery, communication, and use of knowledge through instruction, research,
and service to the public. The educational experience at CU-Boulder is
distinguished by the wide scope of its programs and course offerings, the
notable reputation of its research facilities and faculty, and the diversity of
the student body, which includes students from across the state, the country,
and the world.

<P><B>The University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</B> is a comprehensive
baccalaureate liberal arts and sciences institution with selective admission
standards. Part of the mission at CU-Colorado Springs is to provide selected
professional programs and graduate programs that serve the needs of the Colorado
Springs metropolitan area, emphasizing those programs not offered by other
institutions of higher education in the Pikes Peak region. CU-Colorado Springs
serves primarily the southern half of Colorado; it also counts significant
numbers of students from the Front Range, San Luis Valley, and eastern plains.

<P><B>The University of Colorado at Denver </B>seeks to become one of the ten
best urban universities in the United States. CU-Denver is embarking on a new
urban initiative to build upon the excellence of its faculty, students, academic
programs, support services, research and creative works, and outreach.
Components of the new urban initiative include new graduate degree programs at
the master's and doctoral levels appropriate to an urban campus; extensive
collaborative efforts with community-based partners in the arts, transportation,
government, business, education, and other sectors; and state-of-the-art
course-delivery programs, such as courses using telecommunications.

<P><B>The University of Colorado Health Sciences Center </B>is the only
comprehensive academic health center in the state. The CU-Health Sciences Center
seeks to improve human health, especially the health of the residents of
Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region, by fulfilling a set of interrelated
missions. The Health Sciences Center educates and trains health practitioners,
delivers exemplary health care, conducts research in health sciences, and
effectively manages its development and operations. The basic academic goal of
the Health Sciences Center is to provide high quality education programs at the
undergraduate and graduate levels, preparing students for careers as health
professionals, scientists, and educators.
<H2>The Benefits of CU to the State</H2>

<P>An education at the University of Colorado provides students with a sound
foundation of knowledge and the skills necessary for lifelong learning. The
University is committed to providing its undergraduates with a well-conceived
core curriculum that develops competencies in reading, writing, oral
communication, mathematics, and critical thinking across the natural, physical,
and social sciences, as well as the arts and humanities.

<P>Because the University of Colorado is a graduate research university system,
the learning environment is enhanced by comprehensive and diverse fields of
study, as well as access to library and computing resources and laboratory and
cultural experiences that characterize such an institution.

<P>The University of Colorado prepares students to enter the world of work,
including the professions of business, education, architecture, medicine, law,
music, engineering, and other related fields. In addition, it prepares for
graduate study the students who will be the next generation of scholars in their
fields.

<HR>

<P><B>What do students learn at the University of Colorado?</B>

<P>Each campus has developed a formal set of learning objectives. Program
review processes are informed by the use of instructor and course evaluations,
systematic undergraduate outcomes assessment, student and alumni surveys, and
licensing exam scores.

<P>The University of Colorado has a commitment to educating students who will
make significant intellectual, artistic, humanitarian, and economic
contributions to the state, the nation, and the world. Students are afforded the
opportunity to acquire the foundation of skills and knowledge necessary for
lifelong learning. They learn how to:

<P>live and work effectively in a complex global environment;

<P>achieve depth in a field of knowledge;

<P>incorporate practical experiences and academic work into preparation for
real-world challenges;

<P>learn, communicate, and solve problems;

<P>make informed decisions; 

<P>participate fully in their own educational successes and contribute fully to
the quality of campus life; and

<P>have an understanding of other cultures and the wider world in which we
live.

<P>A mechanical engineering major at CU-Boulder says<I>, </I>&quot;My major
prepared me for the real work world!&quot; An Architecture and Planning senior
comments, &quot;At CU-Boulder you can expect more than an education. Expect to
broaden yourself socially, physically, and emotionally.&quot; 81% of the
respondents to CU-Denver's 1995 alumni survey indicated that their degree aided
them in advancing their career. 

<P><B>What do students do after receiving their baccalaureate degrees?</B>

<P>The answer to this question varies with the role and mission of each campus.
Based on regularly conducted surveys of University of Colorado graduates, we
know that: 

<P>From the <B>Boulder campus</B>, 38% go on to attend graduate school within
four years of graduation, 53% are working in their fields, and 6% are working in
other fields by their own choice.

<P>The <B>Health Sciences Center</B> has 95% of its graduates working in their
fields of study.

<P>Of <B>Denver campus </B>graduates, 26% are in graduate school, 48% are
working in their fields, and 14% are working in other fields of study. 

<P>88% of <B>Colorado Springs</B> alumni are employed either within their
fields or in other areas of study. Of those, 22% are also attending graduate
school.

<P><B>What do CU graduates contribute to the workforce?</B>

<P>CU graduates take their place throughout the Colorado workforce, many having
graduated from programs that are available only at one of the University of
Colorado's four campuses. For example, CU has the only public schools of
pharmacy, medicine, public affairs, law, and dentistry in the state. In
addition, CU's academic leadership in environmental and space sciences,
biosciences, telecommunications, and electrical and computer engineering brings
graduates into highly skilled and highly paid positions that add strength to the
state's economy.

<P>Of the <B>University of Colorado at Boulder</B> 1989 bachelor degree
recipients surveyed in 1993, 40% earned over $30,000, and 10% earned over
$40,000 per year. Based on an average salary of $26,000, the 1,300 1989
graduates living in Colorado would have earned over $30 million and paid $1.4
million in Colorado taxes in 1993 alone.

<P>Of the <B>University of Colorado at Colorado Springs</B> recently sampled
alumni who are employed full-time, 27% earned $15,000-$24,999, 29% earned
$25,000-$49,999, and 2% earned $50,000 or more in personal income. Eighty-four
percent of the surveyed alumni chose to remain in the Pikes Peak region to
contribute to the vibrancy of the local economy, which has a median 1994
household income of $32,765.* 

<P>* Source: <I>El Paso County Snapshot</I>, Pikes Peak Area Council of
Governments.

<P><B>University of Colorado at Denver </B>alumni consistently contribute
significantly to the economy of the metro area and the state, and with 62%
earning salaries between $20,000-$59,999 and another 23% with salaries of
$60,000 and above. 

<P><B>University of Colorado Health Sciences Center </B>undergraduate degree
recipients are currently earning the following salaries in their professional
fields: in Dental Hygiene 100% earn $25,000 or above; in the Medical Laboratory
Sciences 100% earn between $25,000 and $40,000. Nursing has a wider range of
salaries, but the majority (64%) earn between $25,000 and $40,000; and in
Pharmacy 86% earn $40,000 or more.

<P><B>What contribution does CU's research make?</B>

<P>The creation of new knowledge is an activity that differentiates the
University of Colorado from most other institutions of higher education in the
state. Research is one of the unique aspects of the role and mission of the
University and permeates all of its activities. The discoveries made by faculty
and students are of both academic and economic benefit to the state. Teaching
and curriculum are informed by the frontiers of knowledge. Students receive not
only a depth of content in their discipline, but also are provided skills in
problem solving and critical thinking. Businesses transform newly discovered
techniques and technologies into useful products and services. CU research
activity produces highly marketable graduates, serves as a strong magnet that
attracts businesses to the state, and creates additional jobs for Colorado
citizens.

<P><B>The relationship between teaching and research.</B> Surveys of students
consistently reveal their appreciation that the best researchers are also some
of the best teachers. Faculty members bring to the classroom an excitement about
their disciplines that motivates students and exposes them to material at the
cutting edge of their field.

<P>Recognizing their role in producing the next generation of scholars, the
campuses of the University of Colorado System have developed a number of
programs that provide students with first-hand experience in research projects.

<P><B>CU-Boulder </B>provides opportunities for undergraduate students in
faculty research or creative projects through the Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Program (UROP). This program involves students in all areas of
research, from writing proposals to analyzing data and presenting findings. UROP
has provided more than $1.2 million in stipends to nearly 1,800 undergraduate
students since 1986. Graduate students have even more opportunities to take part
in faculty research projects, including research investigations at seven
on-campus research institutes, involvement in faculty research programs and in
cooperative research programs with federal agencies, and work with private
laboratories and industry. Academically relevant preprofessional experience is
available to undergraduate and graduate students through the Cooperative
Education Internships program.

<P><B>CU-Colorado Springs</B> participates in specialized research and service
projects that enhance both the campus environment and student learning. One
example is the CU-Colorado Springs Microelectronics Research Laboratories, where
students work at the forefront of the microelectronics field. In addition, the
campus provides a variety of opportunities for cooperative education and
internships to all students, so that they can apply classroom learning through
professionally supervised field experiences.

<P><B>At CU-Denver </B>UROP provides funding for undergraduate students
engaged in research projects or creative work, with annual awards granted to
individual students and to faculty members for teams of students at a maximum of
$1,150 per student for a part-time, semester-long project. From 1993 to 1995,
over 60 CU-Denver undergraduate students received grants averaging $800 each.

<P><B>At the CU-Health Sciences Center </B>research is a necessary foundation
for excellence in education and in the provision of quality patient care. As the
major health-related research institution in Colorado, the CU-Health Sciences
Center advances health knowledge through basic and applied research aimed at
benefitting the individual, society, and health-care delivery systems. Faculty
and students at the CU-Health Sciences Center play an integral part in the vast
regional and national network of health-related research activities through such
affiliates as the University of Colorado Cancer Center, the Webb Waring
Institute for Biomedical Research, the Barbara Davis Center for Childhood
Diabetes, the C. Henry Kempe National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of
Child Abuse and Neglect, the John F. Kennedy Center for Child Development, the
Center for Health Services Research, and the Colorado Prevention Center.

<P><B>The relationship of research to the needs of Colorado</B>. The areas of
research expertise that have developed over time at the University of Colorado
relate to many of the social, environmental, medical, and economic needs of the
state. Areas in which CU research efforts have made the greatest contributions
include the biomedical sciences and biotechnology; electronics, advanced
materials, and computing; telecommunications; environmental sciences; and space
sciences and engineering. Examples of research programs on the campuses include:

<P><B>The CU-Health Sciences Center </B>hosts the Regional National Cancer
Center. It provides leadership for interdisciplinary work in basic cancer
research, clinical treatment, cancer control activities, and education.

<P>The Optoelectronic Computing Systems Center at <B>CU-Boulder </B>is a
National Science Foundation (NSF)-funded Engineering Research Center. The center
investigates the use of photons (light) rather than electrons to carry, process,
and store information. The center is working in partnership with IBM to develop
an inexpensive tunable optical fiber for high-speed use in linking computer
workstations.

<P>The Center for Environmental Sciences at <B>CU-Denver </B>conducts research
on many issues of interest to Colorado including the Front Range &quot;brown
cloud,&quot; the health impacts of hazardous waste sites, and the toxic effects
of lead.

<P><B>CU-Colorado Springs</B> has evaluated the Drug and Alcohol Resistance
Education (D.A.R.E.) program for the city of Colorado Springs for the past five
years. This campus/community effort has provided direction to the Colorado
Springs Police Department and D.A.R.E. officers in the administration of the
program. Furthermore, the CU-Colorado Springs Social Science Evaluation Center
has conducted a youth lifestyle survey since 1983, funded by school districts
from the Pikes Peak region, to reveal trends in drug use as well as sample the
opinions and attitudes of local youth on a variety of issues.

<P><B>Colorado businesses started by CU research discoveries. </B>Each campus
is a strong partner in the technology transfer process. While the University has
no intent to become a commercial research laboratory, it does seek to facilitate
applications of its basic research through the CU Office of Intellectual
Resources and Technology Transfer. Some of the more notable businesses created
as a result of University of Colorado research include:

<P><I>Displaytech, Inc.</I> manufactures ferroelectric liquid crystal,
optoelectronic devices, and materials to modulate or shutter light.

<P><I>Symetrix</I> manufactures ferroelectric liquid crystal flat-panel
displays.

<P><I>Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals</I> is dedicated to the development of
ribozymes for commercial applications.

<P><I>NeXagen</I> specializes in developing oligonucleotides to use in
diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

<P><I>Superconducting Core Technologies (SCT)</I> develops superconducting
materials useful in the aerospace and telecommunications industries. 
<H2>Sponsored research</H2>

<P>According to a National Science Foundation (NSF) survey for fiscal year
1993, the University of Colorado ranked 29th out of 555 public and private
institutions and 18th among the top 100 public universities and colleges in
overall research expenditures. In federally sponsored research programs, the
University ranked 10th among all public universities.

<P><B>Who are the students at the University of Colorado?</B>

<P>The four-campus University of Colorado system serves a wide and diverse
community of students. Each campus is unique in its role and mission, location,
and program offerings and competes very favorably with its peer institutions at
attracting and meeting the educational needs of the particular students it
serves.

<P>The <B>Boulder</B> campus has national appeal and serves the traditional
high school graduate. Undergraduates comprise approximately 80% of the student
body; 32% of the student body comes from outside Colorado.

<P>The <B>Colorado Spring</B>s<B> </B>campus meets the needs of the southern
half of the state, with Colorado residents comprising 94% of its student body.
This campus attracts community college transfer students, first-time freshmen,
and nontraditional, working adults, who constitute the fastest growing component
of higher education in the country today.

<P>The <B>Denver </B>campus serves the urban area's adult professional and
working population. This is reflected in the fact that 54% of the undergraduate
students typically carry less than a full-time student credit hour load and
almost half (44%) of the student body is enrolled in graduate and
first-professional degree programs. 

<P>The <B>Health Sciences Center </B>has 32% of its student body engaged in
undergraduate work, primarily in nursing and pharmacy, and the remaining 68%
enrolled in first-professional, graduate, and Ph.D. programs.

<P>The diversity of students served by the University of Colorado campuses is
further illustrated by the age distribution of its first-time undergraduate
students. The average age for a first-time undergraduate student in the fall of
1995 was 18.8 years at Boulder, 22.8 years at Colorado Springs, and 23.0 years
at Denver.

<P>Projections indicating significant enrollment increases on all four campuses
have made it necessary for the University to plan for enrollment growth.
Colorado residents in particular and undergraduates in general are predicted to
make up most of this enrollment growth. Of the four campuses, CU-Colorado
Springs is expected to have the biggest enrollment increase. Current projections
indicate that the University of Colorado will see a 24% increase in enrollment
over the next ten years. (For more information, see the <I>Enrollment
Management Plan</I> report produced by CU's Office of the Vice President for
Budget and Finance, 1995.) 
<H3>Who is admitted to CU? </H3>

<P>Unique circumstances contribute to the makeup of every incoming class at
each campus. For new freshmen, the Colorado Commission on Higher Education
(CCHE) has developed the &quot;Admissions Index,&quot; a single admissions scale
for first-time freshmen students. Each applicant's High School Performance Index
(calculated from high school rank or grade point average) is added to the
Standardized Test Index (calculated from ACT and SAT scores) to arrive at a
total CCHE Index Score. Eighty percent of admitted freshmen must have index
scores at or above the CCHE Index Scores listed below for the specific
institution:

<P>* Revised CCHE admission standards go into effect in the fall of 1996.
<HR>

<P>In addition, up to 20% of freshmen admitted by each Colorado institution may
have indices under the specified level. This &quot;window&quot; exists to allow
institutions greater flexibility in recognizing promising students who do not
meet the numerical standards, but who the institution nevertheless believes will
succeed. The University of Colorado also considers special student criteria
including graduation from high school or its equivalent, evaluation of work
taken in high school and other educational institutions, and other materials
concerning student background. Finally, each campus and school/college has its
own distinct admission criteria in conjunction with its educational role and
mission.

<P>Above are the average ACT/SAT scores of first-time freshmen enrolled at the
three general campuses of the University of Colorado compared to average scores
of Colorado and national test takers.

<P>Applicants to the University of Colorado are classified in one of four new
student admission categories: first-time freshmen, undergraduate transfers, new
graduate students, and new non-degree students. The following graphs
highlighting the applicant pool at the three general CU campuses illustrate the
great variance possible in the composition of an incoming class.

<P><B>At the University of Colorado at Boulder: </B>

<P>The competitive nature of the national market for first-time undergraduate
students is illustrated by the observation that 52% of all residents who are
admitted actually enroll, while less than 25% of all nonresident students
admitted do so.

<P>First-time freshmen constitute 54% of the new students.

<P>89% of the Colorado resident freshmen who apply at the University of
Colorado at Boulder gain admission.

<P><B>How is diversity fostered at the University of Colorado?</B>

<P>At their April 20, 1995 meeting, the University of Colorado Board of Regents
unanimously<I> </I>reaffirmed<I> </I>&quot;its absolute commitment to the
promotion of diversity in the university community. Specifically, the Board
affirmed that a supportive campus environment demands that all participants in
the university be treated with absolute respect for their persons and their
work. The realization of such a climate of respect must include an openness, on
the part of the university, to new definitions of what constitutes valid and
valuable research, pedagogy and service. Additionally, the Board recognizes and
affirms that a respect for diversity requires a sincere willingness on the part
of the institution to allow all its diverse stakeholders to share in the
decisionmaking process, and that no individual or group shall be marginalized or
systematically excluded.&quot;

<P>Currently, the University of Colorado campuses exceed the CCHE goal for
resident ethnic minority undergraduate degree recipients by at least two
percentage points. Several factors contribute to this success. Each individual
campus, school, college, and department of the University has a diversity plan
to clarify its goals and to serve as an annual reporting mechanism to further
its efforts in the recruitment and retention of students of color. Continuing to
meet these aggressive goals in the future will present a significant challenge
(see fig. 10).

<P>Source: <I>Annual Diversity Profile</I> reports to the Regents and Campus
Institutional Research Offices.
<HR>

<P>Each campus has produced detailed diversity plans describing its initiatives
and programs intended to foster diversity at the University of Colorado.

<P><B>At CU-Boulder</B>, the four goals of its comprehensive diversity plan
are to: 1) increase the diversity of administrators, faculty, staff, and
students; 2) expand the educational experience for all members of the campus
community to deepen an understanding of and respect for diversity; 3) improve
the campus climate for diversity; and, 4) develop campus and community relations
within a pluralistic framework. Two principal programs that promote these goals
are the Pre-Collegiate Development Program and the BUENO program. The
Pre-Collegiate Development Program works with 16 regional high schools to
encourage high school attendance and to help prepare students for entry into the
University. The BUENO program in CU-Boulder's School of Education promotes
bilingual and multicultural education.

<P><B>At CU-Colorado Springs</B> the campus climate for ethnic minorities
continues to improve. There are more programs celebrating cultural diversity,
more minority student advocacy organizations, a special orientation program for
entering minority students, and a minority student recruitment and retention
effort as a component of CU-Colorado Springs' student success program. Concerted
efforts are being made to attract, inspire, and assist ethnic minority students
to excel in higher education, e.g., CESDA, statewide recruiting efforts, and the
Pre-Collegiate Development Program.

<P><B>CU-Denver</B> seeks to increase diversity with programs such as the
Pre-Collegiate Development Program, CU-SUCCEED, Student Advocacy Center,
Learning Assistance Center, Minority Scholars Program, Stepping Stones Program,
and Minority Engineering Programs. There are also efforts underway to increase
the diversity of faculty in order to provide role models for the students. 

<P><B>The CU-Health Sciences Center </B>envisions its campus to be one that
harbors, fosters, and benefits from the unique qualities, rich histories, and
wide variety of cultural values that a diverse faculty, student population, and
staff bring. The Health Sciences Center has a public responsibility to adapt
positively to the changing demographic profile of American society with its
rising African American, Latino American, Asian American, and other ethnic and
underrepresented populations. To this end, the Health Sciences Center is
dedicated to educating, employing, and promoting persons of color. With many
programs currently in place, the Center for Multicultural Enrichment is central
to the campus diversity mission to recruit and retain students.
<H2>Academic Experience</H2>

<P><B>How long do CU students take to complete their baccalaureate degrees?</B>

<P>A variety of institutional factors affect progress to graduation. However,
research indicates that issues of student funding, maturity, and goal
orientation, as well as personal interests and choices, can make all the
difference in a student's ability to complete his or her degree within a
prescribed time-line. Consequently, an institution with four unique campuses
meeting the needs of traditional and nontraditional students in traditional and
nontraditional programs will have a broad range of time-to-graduation statistics
for baccalaureate degree-seeking students. CCHE reports the following graduation
rate statistics for institutions throughout the state.

<P>At <B>CU-Boulder, </B>seniors who take more than four years to graduate
cite many reasons: &quot;pursuing interests beyond the required courses for a
single major and degree;&quot; &quot;getting off to a slow start;&quot; &quot;changing
academic or career interests;&quot; &quot;working to support themselves or to
avoid large debts;&quot; &quot;taking time off for travel and reflection;&quot;
or &quot;being unable to enroll in needed courses.&quot; Very few of the seniors
surveyed, however, were unhappy about taking more than four years to graduate,
while many stated that they have benefitted from the things that led them to
take five years.

<P>Students at <B>CU-Colorado Springs</B> are often employed full-time, have
family and personal responsibilities, and many never considered graduation
within the traditional 4- to 6-year period as their goal. This nontraditional
student body consequently lends itself to a nontraditional graduation rate (42%
of the fall 1994 students were part-time students). Surveyed students cite
various reasons for not pursuing a rigid degree track: &quot;I was very happy
with school and my classes. I want to go back; however, I just switched jobs and
I need to get settled first;&quot; &quot;I can't do everything, be a wife,
mother, work and school. The only thing I could change was school.&quot;

<P>At <B>CU-Denver</B> a variety of institutional factors affect progress
toward graduation including: 1) the time of day a class is offered, 2) the
structure of the curriculum, and 3) the availability of courses. To meet the
needs of nontraditional students, the campus is seeking to provide alternative
learning options, such as self-paced courses, telecourses, and other learning
technologies. However, because many of CU-Denver's students are older,
nontraditional students maintaining family and work responsibilities, personal
factors also influence the rate at which students attain their B.A. degrees at
CU-Denver.

<P>At the <B>CU-Health Sciences Center</B>, students are involved in programs
specific to their educational interests and goals in the fields of medical and
dental sciences. Given the tightly structured nature of those programs, the
Health Sciences Center has high on-time completion rates (86%-96%) for students.

<P><B>Who are the faculty at the University of Colorado?</B>

<P>The University of Colorado is a comprehensive research university with four
unique campuses and missions. The three components considered when evaluating
faculty effectiveness are teaching, research, and service. 

<P><B>Teaching excellence.</B> Each campus rigorously pursues efforts to
recognize and enhance teaching by sponsoring mentoring programs, videotaping
teachers teaching, and offering seminars in teaching effectiveness.

<P><B>President's Teaching Scholars:</B> As a system, the University
recognizes a number of faculty members every year who are outstanding teachers
and scholars. Each scholar receives a stipend for two years, has access to
campus funds reserved for the promotion of excellence in teaching, and holds the
title &quot;President's Teaching Scholar&quot; for life. The President's
Teaching Scholars form a cadre of outstanding faculty members at the forefront
of the University's educational mission. As of January, 1996, 46 faculty have
been selected as President's Teaching Scholars. 

<P><B>Distinguished Professors: </B>The University of Colorado extends this
title to recognize the outstanding contribution of CU faculty members to their
academic disciplines. Candidates recommended for a distinguished professorship
must demonstrate accomplishments in accordance with the following criteria: 1)
exemplary teaching, and 2) distinguished scholarship or creative work. This
title signifies a select group of faculty members who are leaders in their
respective fields as attested to by national or international recognition and/or
their significant public service achievements. As of January, 1996, 24 CU
professors have been selected as Distinguished Professors. 

<P><B>Faculty Awards and Honors: </B>1 Nobel Laureate, 17 National Academy of
Sciences Awards, 7 National Academy of Engineering Awards, 12 American Academy
of Arts and Sciences Awards, 18 NSF Presidential Young Investigator Awards, 7
National Institute of Medicine Awards, 6 National Institute of Health Awards, 41
Fulbright Scholars, 3 MacArthur Awards, and 4 Javits Awards. 

<P><B>Faculty contact with students.</B> Student/faculty ratios at the
University of Colorado differ from year to year and vary by class type, student
level, and campus. The overall averages for 1994 range from 14 to 18 students
per faculty member.

<P>Faculty in the ranks of professor, associate professor, and assistant
professor taught the following percentages of student credit hours of all
regular courses, including lectures, seminars, and studio and laboratory
instruction, during academic year 1994-95.

<B>Fig. 15: Percentage of Regular Instruction by Ranked Faculty by Student
Credit Hours</B>
</A>
<P><B>What can students expect of their CU academic experience?</B>

<P>Students at CU can choose from a variety of courses of different types and
sizes ranging from independent study with a particular faculty member, to small
seminars and labs, and to larger-scale lectures. Research indicates that large
group learning is most efficient for transmitting information, while critical
thinking skills are best taught in smaller class settings. CU's general campuses
offer a variety of class sizes to capitalize on the different settings for
optimum learning.

<P><B>Academic advising. </B>Advising is an integral part of undergraduate
education. The goal of all academic advising is to assist students in making
responsible decisions as they develop educational plans compatible with their
potential and their career and life goals. Each campus has processes for
assigning faculty advisors to students to help guide the students toward the
most responsible and direct route toward graduation. All campuses also have
centers for career advising, which supply students with relevant market
information relating job, salary, and industry data to a student's specific
interests, skills, and career goals.

<P><B>Course availability</B>. At CU's three general campuses procedures are
in place to ensure access to core courses for each and every student. Course
monitoring procedures help facilitate 

<P>1) full enrollment 

<P>2) wait lists for identifying students who seek enrollment 

<P>3) lists of students for preferred enrollment in subsequent semesters, and
4) dean's review of the course request process to increase enrollment limits,
add sections, and relocate resources to help meet course demand.

<P><B>Computer technology. </B>CU, like other institutions, has made
significant investments in computer technology. Technology becomes a critical
learning tool within higher education through the use of computer-aided
instruction, interactive video, and computerized access to a vast array of
information from a variety of sources. For example, the term paper has evolved
from typewritten to laser printed and is moving toward a paperless, multimedia
version that incorporates video and sound. In dormitories at CU, it is possible
for students to retrieve vast amounts of information using networked computers
that provide access to the Internet. This dissemination of information does not
stop at campus boundaries. The ability to transmit information via
telecommunications is allowing the University to reach students all over the
world and for a greater number of students to be educated in a more efficient
manner. One of the goals of the University is for every new classroom to be a &quot;smart
classroom.&quot; A smart classroom is fully equipped to provide faculty and
students access to the Internet and other media to enhance the curriculum.
<H2>Internships and cooperative education:</H2>

<P><B>CU-Boulder</B> involves almost half of its first-time freshmen in small
group programs to enhance the learning experience. A few examples include: the
Arts and Sciences Honors Program, FALLFEST, the Minority Arts and Sciences
Program in Mathematics and Sciences, the Minority Engineering Program,
President's Leadership Class, and residence-hall based academic programs in
Farrand Hall, Sewall Hall, and Williams Village. On the senior survey, one-third
of those who said they would look for full-time employment in the year after
graduation reported having had a &quot;substantial amount&quot; of experience in
jobs related to their field while attending CU-Boulder.

<P><B>CU-Colorado Springs </B>provides a variety of opportunities for
cooperative education and internships to students. Academic departments provide
internship experiences by placing students in community agencies to explore and
become familiar with occupational positions in their majors. In addition, the
University Center addresses an assortment of cultural, social, recreational, and
educational needs. For example, the Program Board sponsors and organizes many
programs, including speakers, films, musical events, workshops, and tournaments,
designed to meet the diverse interests of the campus community. Nationally
recognized scholars are invited to campus to speak on contemporary research
issues, trends, and findings. Elected students serve on several important
university committees, both advisory and policy making, and all students are
members of the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs Associated Students,
the official student government organization.

<P><B>CU-Denver</B> offers over 40 faculty-sponsored student organizations to
help students learn leadership and management skills, gain valuable life
experience, and put into practice what they learn in the classroom. The city of
Denver and the metropolitan area provide the perfect laboratory environment for
applying skills and enhancing experience at the New Urban University.
CU-Denver's Center for Internships and Cooperative Education has served over
10,000 students since 1973 by recruiting, screening, and placing students with
corporations, businesses, and government agencies in the Metro-Denver area as
well as out of state. The campus also has developed numerous affordable, long-
and short-term study abroad and local cultural exchange programs. 

<P><B>CU-Health Sciences Center </B>students learn outside the classroom
setting by participating in a multitude of programs that involve community
education, community outreach, and the state's K-12 education system. For
example, they are given the opportunity to serve as peer counselors in the
Summer Health Careers Institute, which encourages high school students from
rural or medically disadvantaged areas to explore health-care careers.

<H2>Costs to the Student</H2> 

<P><B>What does it cost to attend CU?</B>

<P>The cost of attending the University of Colorado includes tuition and fees,
room and board, books and supplies, medical expenses, transportation, and
personal expenses. Increases in tuition and fees usually receive the most
scrutiny from the public.

<P>Tuition and fees at the University of Colorado are proposed by each campus,
subject to approval from the Board of Regents. Overall, tuition must fall within
regulations established by the Colorado Legislature. The 1995 Colorado General
Assembly voted to limit the maximum annual increase in resident undergraduate
tuition at all campuses to the rate of increase in the Denver-Boulder consumer
price index. Resident undergraduate tuition at the University has increased at
an average of 3.2% per year over the past five years (compared to 8% per year
for nonresidents). Resident graduate tuition has increased at an average rate of
4% per year.

living expenses included in the financial aid calculations are standardized
student expense budgets based on a CCHE survey of students enrolled in Colorado.
The above graph illustrates the role of tuition/fees, room and board, and other
expenses in determining student costs. For resident students living away from
home, either on or off campus, room and board costs constitute the largest
portion of student expenses. For commuter students, other expenses, such as
books and supplies, medical expenses, transportation, and personal expenses,
make up the largest portion.

<P><B>What financial aid is available?</B>

<P>Financial aid at the University of Colorado falls into three categories:
gift aid, work-study aid, and loans. Gift aid consists of grants, fellowships,
and scholarships and does not have to be repaid. The student usually has to
maintain reasonable academic progress to continue receiving gift aid. The
majority of grants are funded through federal and state sources. For work-study
aid, the student receives payment for approved, supervised work on or off
campus. Funding for work-study aid comes primarily from the federal and state
government. Loans are long-term, low-interest funds that must be repaid after
the student has graduated or is no longer enrolled at least half-time. The
largest source of financial aid is the federal government.
<HR>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<A HREF="pics/Fig19.gif">
<B>Fig. 19: University of Colorado Sources of Financial Aid</B>

<HR>

<P>Financial aid is awarded based on documented financial need and, in some
cases, other criteria. Financial need is determined by federally established
formulas based on a family's income and assets. Financial need is a requirement
to receive financial aid from federal or state sources. The other criteria may
include academic merit, geographic origin, or special skills in music or
athletics. However, the majority of financial aid is awarded based on financial
need.

<P>Financial aid availability at the campuses can be described as follows: 

<P><B>CU-Boulder</B>

<P>In 1994-95, the Boulder campus administered $54 million in aid for 12,694
undergraduate and graduate students.

<P>54% of resident undergraduates received some type of financial aid, for an
average award of $6,854 from all sources.

<P>81% of all aid to resident undergraduates was from the federal government;
67% was in loans, and 56% was on the basis of financial need.

<P>The average amount of federal aid awarded to resident undergraduates was
$6,600. The average loan was $6,000, and the average amount of need-based aid of
all types was $5,250.

<P>45% of resident graduating seniors in 1994-95 and 5% of those who graduated
as nonresidents had accumulated some debt from federal loans.

<P>The average amount of accumulated debt for graduating seniors rose from just
under $12,000 in 1991 to nearly $16,000 in 1994. (Part of this rise was due to
increased availability of funds; borrowing limits were increased by the federal
government in 1992-93.)

<P><B>CU-Colorado Springs</B>

<P>In 1994-95, 2,703 students at the Colorado Springs campus received financial
aid.

<P>Of this total, 95% were residents and 89% were undergraduates.

<P>The average award package consists of $3,735 from federal sources, $1,874
from state sources, $1,979 from institutional sources (including hourly work on
campus), and $949 from other sources.

<P>The average accumulated debt for a student enrolled in 1994-95 was $9,820.

<P><B>CU-Denver</B>

<P>In 1994-95, 4,659 students received $25 million in financial aid.

<P>The average award was $5,544.

<P>Of the total recipients, 77% received federal financial aid and 22% received
state of Colorado aid.

<P>Residents made up 95% of all recipients.

<P>Undergraduates received 66% of the financial aid.

<P>Average accumulated indebtedness at graduation was $13,706 for
undergraduates and $17,330 for graduates.

<P><B>CU-Health Sciences Center</B>

<P>In 1993-94, the Health Sciences Center awarded $17 million in financial aid.

<P>Financial aid sources were as follows: 86.2% from federal sources, 3.9% from
the state, 5.6% from the institution and other sources, and 4.3% from other loan
sources. 

<P><B>Has financial aid kept pace with need and cost? </B>

<P>Fig. 20 illustrates the increasing reliance on loans as a source of
financial aid. This change mirrors national trends, which have seen a 192%
increase from 1984 to 1994 in the use of loans to finance higher education.
Again, part of this can be explained by the changes in the federal loan program
making it easier to borrow money. In addition, as growth in federal grant
programs has slowed, the reliance on loans has increased considerably.

<HR>

<P>Growth in grants and scholarships has kept close to the growth in resident
tuition at the University. However, the use of loans to finance college costs
has outpaced both the growth in grants/scholarships and tuition increases. Fig.
21 illustrates the growth of loans and grants/scholarships compared to
educational cost factors such as tuition rate increases and the Denver-Boulder
consumer price index during the period from FY 1990 to FY 1994. The
Denver-Boulder consumer price index represents the change in the cost of living
in the metro area since 1992. In 1995, this index defined the maximum allowable
tuition increase. The tuition price index is included to illustrate the growth
of tuition rates on a national level.

<HR>

<P>It is likely that financial assistance will continue to be primarily in the
form of loans for undergraduate students at the three general campuses of the
University. Proposed federal cutbacks to grants programs and changes in the
federal student loan program could greatly restrict the availability of
financial aid, particularly because the federal government is the largest source
of financial aid at the University.
<H2>Fiscal Accountability</H2>

<P><B>What is the state's investment in CU?</B>

<P>For fiscal year 1995-96, the state of Colorado is investing $172.2 million
in the University of Colorado, representing 35% of the higher education
appropriations made to Colorado's higher education governing boards.* In
exchange for its investment in the University, the state of Colorado has
received the following educational benefits. In FY 1992-93, 44% of all B.A.,
M.A., first-professional, and Ph.D. degrees in the state were awarded by the
University of Colorado. 

<P>From FY 1989-90 through FY 1992-93, degrees produced by the University
increased by 16%. During the same time period, appropriations from the state
increased by 7%.

<P>The state also receives economic benefits from its investment in the
University. According to the <I>University of Colorado Economic Impact Study</I>,
the University directly and indirectly generates 36,200 jobs in Colorado. The
University also generates $10.17 of gross state product (the total value of
goods and services produced in Colorado) for each $1 of state support provided
to the University. The increases to employment and the gross state product also
produced additional tax revenue to the state. The study conservatively estimates
that at least $.40 is returned to the state treasury for every state dollar
provided to CU, offsetting state spending for the University.

<P>The state's investment in CU is providing both educational and economic
returns to the citizens of the state.

<P><B>What are the trends in Colorado's support of higher education?</B>

<P>Colorado currently ranks 35th of the fifty states in the amount appropriated
per capita for the operating expenses of higher education. K-12 and higher
education's share of general fund appropriations has decreased from 60% of state
general fund appropriations to 53% over the past five years. Appropriations for
human services and health care increased by 69% from FY 1990-91 to FY 1995-96.
This reflects a shift in federal priorities with the state having to assume more
responsibility for Medicare and other federal social welfare programs. In
comparison, higher education appropriations increased by only 16%.

<P>Fig. 24 illustrates the changes in general fund appropriations by governing
board from fiscal year 1990-91 to fiscal year 1995-96. Overall, the proportions
have remained consistent, with the community colleges seeing a small increase
while the CU Regents have seen a small decrease in funding. The small increase
in funding to the community colleges illustrates the state's response to
enrollment growth, as community college enrollments increased--so did state
funding. However, CCHE estimates a 30% increase in high school graduates over
the next 10 to 15 years, which will seriously challenge the state's ability to
fund enrollment.

<HR>

<P>During the past ten years, notable changes have occurred in the University's
revenues. State appropriations dropped from 24% of the operating budget in FY
1985-86 to 18% in FY 1995-96. Revenue from gifts, grants, and contracts
increased from 20% to 34% of the operating budget.

<P>As the percentage of University's budget from state appropriations has
decreased, revenues from tuition and fees have proportionally increased as a
revenue source for the University.

<P><B>What are the University's expenditures for instruction?</B>

<P>There are a number of variables that affect the costs of instruction at the
three general campuses. Among these are: the method of instruction, such as
lectures or smaller seminars; the type of program, because some areas such as
engineering may be more capital intensive; and the faculty salary levels, as the
salaries in some areas such as business, engineering, and the sciences have
higher faculty salaries to keep pace with salaries in the private sector. 
<HR>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<A HREF="pics/Fig27.gif">
<B>Fig. 27: University of Colorado Instructional
Expenditures per Student FTE</B>
</A>
<HR>

<P>The instructional expenditures shown in Fig. 27 are based on the
expenditures associated with direct student instruction, such as faculty
compensation and support costs for each academic unit, but do not include
academic administration and indirect costs. Graduate education is significantly
more expensive than undergraduate because of the smaller class sizes and
collaborative teaching/research methods at the graduate level.

<P>At the Ph.D. level, Boulder is the only campus with a significant amount of
instruction. Graduate expenditures are significantly higher than undergraduate
expenditures, particularly at the Ph.D. level. Ph.D.s account for 41% of the
graduate FTE at CU-Boulder, 1% at CU-Colorado Springs, and 4% at CU-Denver.
<HR>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<A HREF="fig28.html">
<B>Fig. 28: University of Colorado Expenditures by Purpose
as a Percent of Total Expenditures</B>
</A>
<HR>

<P>At each campus, the faculty compensation costs are roughly 80% or more of
the instructional costs, making this a key component in evaluating the
expenditures per FTE. Support staff expenditures range from 7% to 11% at each
campus, with operating expense and capital outlay ranging from 4% to 7%. These
percentages have remained consistent over the last three fiscal years.

<P>In general, University expenditures have remained steady in instruction and
research, accounting for 54% of University expenditures in FY 1989-90 and 53% in
FY 1994-95. As a percentage of total expenditures, the greatest change was in
scholarships/fellowships, which increased from 4% to 11% of the total
expenditures. The increase in scholarships and fellowships is a result of the
introduction of the direct student loan program. In FY 1994-95, the direct
lending expenditures were approximately $62 million, or 7% of total University
expenditures. However, this program may be affected by future federal
legislation. The administrative costs as a proportion of the total expenditures
of the University have remained steady at 7%.
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>The task of designing and implementing performance indicators was complex,
and there are other measurements that should and will be made of the
University's performance in the future. While this first performance indicators
report may not provide all of the answers to questions about CU's performance,
it is an attempt to initiate an ongoing dialogue between the University of
Colorado and its constituents about the ways in which the University fulfills
its role and mission while using its resources wisely to serve the needs of the
state.

The University of Colorado System has initiated the Administrative Streamlining

Project, or A.S.P. for short.  The project, approved by the University Board of

Regents at its June 1996 meeting, will greatly improve the way we conduct

business by replacing our antiquated human resource and financial information

systems over the next several years.                                            

 <P>                                                                               

This project is much more than purchasing new systems.  It is designed to make

University processes more efficient and to reduce the cost of our transactions.

 I am persuaded that the costs of not implementing this project are quite high,

primarily because maintaining our current, old systems with no improvements

will necessitate major new and deep investments.  Further, I believe that the

improved ways of conducting University business will allow us to save on our

current administrative expenses as well as avoid future costs.  An additional

and important advantage will be that CU faculty and staff will have more direct

access to important financial, programmatic, and other information, providing

them with more time to devote to the academic mission.  A.S.P. should also

enable us to delegate more direct responsibility for various activities to

schools, colleges, and departments.                                             

<P>                                                                                

The A.S.P. is a solid example of what can be achieved by thinking ahead and

working together, but in order to succeed it will require widespread

participation of faculty, staff, and administration to maximize benefits.  The

system vice presidents and three senior campus administrators constitute a

Project Leaders Team to insure broad support and oversight to the project, and

Brian Mooney will serve as the project director.  It is important for everyone

to stay informed about the project.  The following <a href="q-a.html">informational material</a> is

designed to answer some basic questions about the A.S.P.  Please take time to

read it and use the e-mail addresses provided to obtain more information.  As

the project moves ahead, additional question and answer articles will be part

of a complete communication plan.                                               

<P>                                                                                

In the meantime, I want to congratulate everyone involved in the project for

their commitment and foresight.                                                 

<P>

<strong><a name="managers"> PROJECT MANAGERS</strong>
<br><br>

In the last two months, three project managers have joined the administrative streamlining project.  Joining Brian Mooney/Director, Deb Lombardi/Associate Director and Sandy Tureson/Executive Assistant, are Julia Clarey/Financial Project Manager, Don Diebert/Human Resources Project Manager and Mike McKee/Information Systems Project Manager.
<br><br>

Ms. Clarey comes to the project from the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs campus where she had been the Controller/Budget Officer. Previous to the Springs, she had been with the University of Southern Colorado in Pueblo and Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Julia has both undergraduate and graduate degrees in Accounting from Oklahoma State University and brings over ten years of extensive management, financial and budgetary higher education experience in administrative and academic areas to the project.
<br><br>

Mr. Diebert comes to the project from the University of Colorado, Boulder campus where he had been the Director of Compensation Services (Payroll/Benefits) and Human Resources Information Management. During his eleven years with the University, he has actively served on numerous University-wide projects and committees. Previous higher education experience includes assignments as a budget analyst/assistant director and accounting supervisor. Don has an undergraduate degree and graduate work in Business Administration from Western Washington University.  He brings over nineteen years of extensive higher education experience in management, human resources, financial and budget areas to the project.
<br><br>

Mr. McKee comes to the project from private industry with a background in information technology architecture development and re-engineering for large enterprises. Previous experiences include assignments as information technology manager for a fortune 500 enterprise, project manager for a software company, project manager for a leading systems integration consulting firm, as well as programmer and analyst assignments for the federal government and private industry. Mike has an undergraduate degree in Computer Information Systems (CIS) from Bentley College and a graduate degree from the University of Colorado - Telecommunications Program. Mike brings over 13 years experience in information technology development and project leadership to the project.
<br><br>

Each of the project managers are very excited to be members of the A.S.P. Project Team and are looking forward to working with the University community.
<br><br></a>

<strong><a name="status"> PROJECT STATUS</strong>
<br><br>

Phase I (Project Organization) of A.S.P. is substantially completed and Phase II (Business/Technology Assessment) is beginning.
<br><br>

Phase I focused on many activities to create the infrastructure to support the project, substantial communications, and obtaining the services of a consultant. During the month of November, a Request for Proposal was sent to over twenty potential vendors to bid on consulting services for the project. Particular emphasis was placed on Phase II activities but it is currently assumed the consulting organization would continue through project completion. On Friday, December 13th, eleven proposals were received and reviewed by the Project Team over the ensuing weekend. At the end of this preliminary review, a group of three semi-finalists were developed by December 16th. These semi-finalists then made presentations to the Evaluation Committee and Project Team on December 20th and 21st.
<br><br>

The evaluation committee, made up of the Project Leaders, were responsible in making the selection of the consulting firm to partner with A.S.P. An unanimous decision was made by the evaluation committee on December 21st  to select Coopers & Lybrand LLP and an Intent to Award was issued by the Office of Buying and Contracting. Excerpts from the final evaluation report included the following:

<ul>

<li>The key personnel demonstrated tremendous individual experience in the higher education environment with business process redesign, information technology and change management.
<br><br>
<li>The higher education experiences of the Coopers & Lybrand LLP key personnel instilled confidence they could provide a conceptual leadership perspective to the project, the ability to transfer their knowledge/experience into operational benefits and an ability to assist the University to address critical project issues.
<br><br>
<li>Coopers & Lybrand LLP demonstrate significant quality and depth of understanding related to change management issues because of their prior higher education engagements.  In particular, the firm demonstrated how change management issues are best integrated with business practice and technology changes.  The understanding of change management issues in higher education was significant in assuring the fit of the proposed firm and personnel are best for the University.
<br><br>
<li>Coopers & Lybrand LLP demonstrated commitment of their organization at the National level to our success.  Key players to the project are national leaders who bring substantial value to the University.
</ul>

In accordance with State and University procurement regulations, contract negotiations were allowed to begin on January 7, 1997. Assuming contract negotiations are successful it is anticipated that Coopers & Lybrand will begin full time on the project on January 21st.
<br><br>

Phase II is currently expected to continue through mid-June and will lead to or may run concurrently with Phase III. Phase III will focus on preparing, issuing, and evaluating a Request for Proposal for software and hardware.
<br><br></a>

<strong><a name="team"> PROJECT CORE TEAM</strong>
<br><br>

In order to begin Phase II (Business/Technology Assessment), a core team of individuals are being hired as members of the Project Team. It is anticipated these individuals will remain through the duration of the project. In the Silver and Gold January 9th edition, a position announcement was placed requesting applications for the Financial, Human Resources, and Information Technology Project Teams. The announcement will also run on January 16th  and a review of the applications received will begin January 17th. The interview/hire process will move quickly with initial core team members beginning employment immediately.
<br><br></a>

<strong><a name="things"> THINGS TO COME</strong>
<br><br>

Phase II will focus on several major tasks. Those tasks include an assessment of current finance and human resource practices, determining critical information needs, and developing some conceptual redesigns of transaction processes. Coopers & Lybrand will bring structured methodologies to accomplish these tasks and will assist the University in establishing a structure to move through the tasks most efficiently. In particular, Coopers & Lybrand will bring their prior experience with other higher education institutions to assist the University in establishing the appropriate structure and guidelines to receive input and participation.
<br><br>

<strong>Process Analysis/Information Needs</strong>
<br><br>

In the next few weeks University personnel will begin seeing some familiar and unfamiliar faces around each campus and at system. Members of the Project Team, as well as staff from Coopers & Lybrand LLP, will be gathering information and doing analysis to determine process workflow as well as seeking from campus users what their specific information needs are.
<br><br>

<strong>Subject Matter Experts</strong>
<br><br>

Over the next few months, assistance will be requested from the University community to provide "Subject Matter Experts" to the project. These are individuals who have functional experience in one or more of the financial areas (for example, accounts payable, accounts receivable, budget, fixed assets, general ledger, inventory, purchasing, sponsored programs) or human resource areas (for example, applicant tracking, benefits administration, diversity, employee relations, appointment and compensation administration, payroll, position management, time and effort reporting and training/career development). Subject matter experts will also be utilized in the information technology area and are considered important resources for the project. It is anticipated that these Subject Matter Experts may need to be utilized full time for short lengths of time.

<h3><a name="document">What this Document Presents</B></h3>
<P>
The ability of the University to achieve its educational, research,
and public service mission is directly tied to the strength, flexibility,
and efficiency of the underlying administrative infrastructure.
In September 1992, the Strategy Team on Systems for Managing Information
comprised of faculty, administrators, and advisors recommended
the University strengthen the underlying administrative infrastructure:<STRIKE>
</STRIKE>
<P>
<I>&quot;The team is unanimous in its conclusion that significant

improvements in the management information systems are needed.

The team is also unanimous in its belief that the key factor in

ensuring both the short term and the long term value of the system

is a greater sense of &quot;ownership&quot; by the President and

top management of the university in advocating and sponsoring

change....The University must develop a bias towards action.....In

conclusion, the Strategy Team believes that the University should

commit itself to move quickly to improve the management information

systems.&quot;</I> 

<P>

In response to the Strategy Team recommendation, this document

presents a project proposal for a comprehensive administrative

improvement project designed to improve Financial and Human Resource

Management. The proposed project will:

<P><ul>

<LI> Lead to redesigned business processes and supporting organizational

structures to adopt improved business practices, improve service

to both internal and external customers, lead to the implementation

of enabling client/server technology, and achieve cost savings.

<P>

<LI> Lead to the design of business practices that will optimize

benefit for the University. To accomplish these goals, organizational

structures different from the structures existing at the four

campuses and the System Office will likely be necessary.

<P>

<LI> Require substantial commitment of personnel and resources.

<P>

This project is designed to bring about significant improvements

in the way the University conducts business. These changes are

important to achieving the University mission because they will

strengthen the University's ability to manage financial and human

resource investments.

</ul></a>

<hr>

<P>
<h3><A name="learned">What We Have Learned</h3>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1994, the University has been engaged in

a project to improve the University&Otilde;s procurement process

while attempting to contract for the first of these new systems,

a Financial Management System. While these efforts have not resulted

in the progress we hoped for, they have confirmed the following:



<P><UL>

<LI> The University's business processes need significant revision

and there is potential for realization of meaningful benefits.

Making minor changes to the business practices or attempting to

improve our existing information technology on the periphery will

no longer bring any significant benefit - these areas need fundamental

change.

<P>

<LI> Changing the manner in which the University conducts business

will be challenging and difficult. The University will be faced

with numerous implementation issues including human resource reallocation

decisions, policy issues, and competing priorities.

<P>

<LI> Software vendors have embraced client/server technology

and the products have proven they are capable of supporting quantum

improvements in management information and business practices

in large organizations.

<P>

<LI> Integration of financial and human resource data is critical

to gaining process efficiencies and improving management data.

Accordingly, a combined financial and human resource project provides

maximum benefit.

<P>

<LI>The project will only be completed on a timely basis if

there is a substantial commitment of personnel and resources.<STRIKE>

</STRIKE></ul>

<P>

Many of the University's peer group institutions, including Ohio

State, Michigan, California-Berkeley, Pennsylvania, Cornell, and

Stanford, have reached identical conclusions. These institutions

are embarking on aggressive programs to overhaul their administrative

structures, underlying technology, and related business practices.

These are no longer leading edge projects but mainstream trends.<P></a>

<HR>
<P><h3><A name="wait">Why the University Can't Wait</h3>
<P>

Many of the University's administrative processes have become

so controlled and complex that even the simplest of transactions

are costly to complete. Because the underlying technology is so

rigid, the cost of incrementally improving these processes or

modifying the processes to meet new regulations is prohibitive.

<P>

Within the next five years, much of the University's existing

mainframe administrative technology will either be obsolete or

unsupported by the vendors and the University will be in a position

of forced replacement. Obsolete technology and complex inefficient

processes contribute to a third problem - information needed to

manage financial and human resources is unavailable or inaccessible.

<P>

Inefficient processes, obsolete technology, and lack of management

information will be increasingly detrimental factors as the University

tries to reduce administrative costs in support of the academic,

research, and public service missions. Only by addressing these

issues in a comprehensive manner, will the University garner the

benefits promised in the implementation of modern technology.<P></a>

<HR>
<P>
<h3><A name="proposal">Project Proposal</h3>
<P>

The University should initiate a comprehensive administrative

improvement project designed to:

<P><ul>

<LI> Assess Human Resource and Financial Management needs.

<P>

<LI> Recommend management information, process, and technology

solutions to address the identified needs.

<P>

<LI> Implement identified solutions.

</ul>

<P>

The proposed project includes the definition of management information

needs, the redesign of administrative processes, the assessment

of desired organizational change, and the implementation of enabling

client/server technology in two critical administrative areas

- Human Resources and Financial Management. The proposed project

does not presume centralized, decentralized, or any other organizational

structure. Rather, the proposed project will evaluate modern business

practices, will evaluate the chosen software selection against

key components of the University's business process vision, and

will determine how to implement better business practices, any

supporting organizational change, and the chosen software solution.<P></a>

<h3><A name="strategy">Project Strategy</h3>
<P>
The University can accomplish project objectives by adopting the

following strategies:

<P><ul>

<LI>Arrive at improved business practices by utilizing process

change methodologies to identify changes in business processes,

any desired organizational changes, process metrics, and information

requirements.

<P>

<LI>Identify and acquire enabling client/server technologies

to support redesigned business processes and information requirements.

<P>

<LI> Implement a comprehensive change management program (leadership,

training, communications, personnel management) to support the

project.

<P>

<LI> Adopt an aggressive schedule to implement the redesigned

business processes, any desired organizational changes, and enabling

client/server technologies.

<P>

<LI> Develop an appropriate implementation plan for the project

which includes the definition of leadership, sponsorship, and

support roles for management.

</ul>
<P>

<I>To accomplish these goals, organizational structures different

from the structures existing at the four campuses and the System

Office may be necessary.</I> <I>This is a change from the previous

FMS proposal endorsed by the Senior Administrator&Otilde;s Group

and, if accepted, will cause significant change in the manner

in which the University conducts business.</I> Adopting a less

comprehensive process change strategy (e.g., limit changes to

organizational structures) will have severe impacts on potential

cost savings.<P></a>
<HR>

<P>
<h3><A name="factors">Critical Success Factors</h3>

<P>
The proposed project will require an extraordinary commitment

from the University. The commitment must be embraced by all members

of the University community but must be championed by the Executive

leadership.

<P>

If any of the following critical success factors are not endorsed

by the University, the project should not be undertaken:

<P><ul>

<LI> The University must develop and utilize an implementation

plan for the project. The implementation plan must consider the

necessary steps to actively engage the leadership of the University

and must recognize the need for active participation of the executive

group in managing change.

<P>

<LI> The Board of Regents, President, Vice Presidents, Chancellors,

and Vice Chancellors must be committed to making the project a

high priority and a success. Each must be willing to commit to

the project in the appropriate role - to unequivocally endorse

the project, provide unrelenting support for the project, or serve

as the sponsors/champions of the project.

<P>

<LI> The University must commit to adopting consistent business

practices and implementing organizational changes which support

improved business practices. This means the University must implement

business practices designed to optimize benefit for the University.

<P>

<LI> The University must commit to providing project resources

(personnel and funds). The project may be aborted at the completion

of a Phase, but resource commitments for approved Phases must

be absolute.

<P>

<LI> The University must be willing to empower the appropriate

personnel to make decisions regarding the project after considering

input from others. A formal decision making process must be developed

and strictly adhered to.<P></a>

</UL><HR>

<P><h3><A name="project">Strategic Issues Addressed by the Project</h3>

<P>

In today's environment of limited resources, every project requiring

a commitment of resources (personnel and funds) must address <I>strategic</I>

issues. The recommended project is designed to address the following

four strategic issues:

<P><ul>

<LI> <I>Improve Management Data</I> - Management of the University,

at all levels, will need information that is accurate, accessible,

and timely to successfully manage the institution through a dynamic

environment.

<P>

<LI> <I>Improve Business Processes</I> - The University must

maximize every administrative dollar by eliminating duplicative

work, simplifying processes, reducing costs, and increasing customer

satisfaction.

<P>

Improving business processes and management data also means creating

new organizational context. The University must create different

ways of thinking and new organizational structures to best serve

student customers and internal management in an environment of

limited resources.

<P>

<LI> <I>Improve Technology Environment</I> - The University

must implement client/server technology to support increasing

information demands and changes in business processes.

<P>

<LI><I>Respond to Economic and External Pressures</I> - The

University must increase our responsiveness to external pressures

and mandates while preparing for a rapidly changing academic and

business environment

<P>

If the Executive Committee does not believe these issues are critical

to the strategic mission of the institution then resources should

not be committed to this project.<P></a>
</ul><HR>

<P>
<h3><A name="problems">Address Strategic Issues = Solve Underlying Problems</h3>
<P>

To address the strategic issues, this project must solve underlying

problems in each of these areas. The critical underlying problems

in each area are:

<P><ul>

<LI> <I>Management Information</I> <I>- </I>Current systems

and processes produce management data which is either unreliable,

non-existent, lacks integration with other systems, or is difficult

to access. The lack of management information creates difficulty

in completing long-range strategic planning and has created an

environment which encourages managers to make decisions based

on intuition rather than data.

<P>

Management information <U>includes</U> the development of an organizational

management culture focused on the use of data and information

rather than the processing of transactions.

<P>

<LI> <I>Business Processes</I> - Current business processes

are labor intensive, complex, transaction oriented, difficult

for customers, fail to take advantage of economies of scale, lack

an efficient approach to internal controls, and do not reflect

best business practices used by other large business organizations.

<P>

<LI><I>Technology Environment</I> - Current technology environment

is costly to maintain, inflexible, difficult to use, fails to

achieve integration between systems, is nearing technical obsolescence

or is already obsolete, and is designed for large mainframe transaction

processing.

</ul>

<P>

Solving the underlying problems described above will increase

the ability of the University to respond to external and economic

problems including increasing budget pressures, an inability to

adapt to changing environments, an increasingly technically advanced

customer base, and demands for increasing accountability by critical

funding sources.<P><HR></a>

<P>
<h3><A name="object">Maximize Benefit by Combining Objectives</h3>

<P>

Each of the strategic business issues could be addressed individually;

however, the interrelationship of these areas is so significant

that value will only be realized if the issues are addressed in

a coordinated and comprehensive approach. Illustratively:

<P><ul>

<LI> Accessibility to management data could be improved by the

expansion of a central data repository. However, because data

is derived from the underlying processing and information systems,

failure to redesign the process would perpetuate data inaccuracy

and lack of management data.

<P>

<LI> While underlying business processes can be improved by

eliminating non-value added processes, implementation of solutions

to increase productivity or reduce costs typically require enabling

technologies. In addition, redesigning the business process provides

opportunities to capture critical management data previously not

recorded in the information systems.

<P>

<LI> The replacement of an information technology architecture

can bring some benefits through the use of workflow technology,

quicker response times, and the establishment of more flexible

platforms. The institution can't view technology as a <I>comprehensive</I>

<I>solution</I> - it automates data capture (or lack of capture)

or automates processes designed efficiently (or inefficiently).

<P>

<LI> The expansion of the project to include Human Resources

will increase complexity and increase organizational disruption;

however, the change also provides an opportunity to realize additional

benefits. Significant integration of data between the Financial

and Human Resource systems will lead to improved human resource

and financial management information and increased management

accountability due to the ability to correlate human resource

expenditures with financial impact.

</ul>

<P>

Addressing the first three strategic business issues serve as

components to addressing the fourth issue, Economic and External

Pressures. Economic and external pressures are affected by other

factors including budget pressures and increasing accountability.<P></a>

<HR>

<h3><A name="avoid">Project Cost and Cost Avoidance</h3>
<P>

Project cost is dependent on the degree of change, the degree

to which the University utilizes external resources and project

scope. Estimating total project cost at this time is not practical

since the University has not completed visioning or redesign of

improved business processes. Until the scope of recommended change

is known and the chosen technology solution is evaluated against

the vision elements, all project cost estimates represent approximations.

<P>

Experience of other institutions indicate incremental costs (consultants,

hardware, software, etc.) typically run 25-40% of total project

costs; additional project costs consist of University personnel

committed to the project. If the experiences of other institutions

is an accurate barometer, incremental costs would approximate

$12-18 million and the project timeline is preliminarily estimated

at 36 months. The University is facing these incremental costs

even if a multi-year plan to phase in each system implementation

was adopted. By combining the Finance and Human Resources projects,

the University accelerates the cash expenditure but hopes to realize

some reduction from vendors in product pricing.

<P>

The recommended project will not cause a decrease in expenditures

for information technology. Rather, the project provides an opportunity

to:

<P><ul>

<LI> Avoid significant investments which will be required to

maintain the older mainframe systems. The University will spend

approximately $2 million for one-time investments in the next

five years to keep the current systems operating, address the

Year 2000 issue, procure hardware upgrades, and respond to increased

user requirements; this is in addition to the on-going maintenance

costs. Proceeding with the project will limit these expenditures

to the absolute minimum.

<P>

<LI> Manage our investment in information technology; combining

Finance and Human Resources into one project will ensure appropriate

standards are established for the implementation of client/server

technology, capitalize on economies of scale in technology purchases

and maximize integration of data.

<P>

<LI> Reduce our continuing investments in inflexible systems

unable to support changes required by external forces. The University

must implement information technology that supports rather than

inhibits change.</a>

</ul><P><HR>

<P>
<h3><A name="invest">Return on Investment</h3>

<P>

If the experience of peer institutions and other large business

organizations is accurate, the proposed project has the potential

to save 10-30% of System level and campus central office costs

by eliminating duplicative organizational structures, non-value

added work, and adopting enabling technologies. The University

spends in excess of $30 million annually on finance management,

human resource management, and related centralized administrative

technology - additional costs are incurred at the departmental

level.

<P>

For the University of Colorado, capturing savings while increasing

customer satisfaction and employee morale will be a challenge.

A comprehensive change management strategy must be implemented

to address the following:

<P><ul>

<LI> Identification of the leadership role to be played by management

to implement proposed changes.

<P>

<LI> Training of personnel in new human resource and finance

management concepts and strategies.

<P>

<LI> Training of personnel in new client/server technologies

and new processes.

<P>

<LI> Development of a re-training and re-deployment strategy

for employees affected by organizational and process changes.

</ul>

<P>

Unquantifiable benefits related to employee empowerment, better

management information, and creation of flexible administrative

infrastructures will be realized.</a><P><HR>
<P>
<h3><A name="action">Alternative Courses of Action</h3>
<P>

The University should not delay in improving business practices

or in implementing client/server technology for mission critical

systems. Two alternative courses of action were considered and

rejected; a summary of these alternative courses of action and

the reasons for rejection are as follows:

<P><ul>

<LI>Proceed with phased approach to Finance and Human Resource

system implementations. Financial systems in 18-30 months and

Human Resource systems in 30-48 months. This was rejected because

benefits related to desired improvements in systems integration

and organizational structures would be<STRIKE> </STRIKE>reduced.

<P>

<LI> Proceed with single system implementation (Finance or Human

Resources). System implementation in 18-24 months. This was rejected

because benefits related to desired improvements in organizational

structures and systems integration will not be realized and overall

project benefits will be reduced.
</a>
</ul><P><HR>
<P>

<h3><A name="mi">Business Case for Change - Management Information</h3>
<P>

Administrative Information Technology has accomplished the task

of automating high volume transaction processing; i.e. paying

University vendors and employees or producing accounting oriented

financial statements. These systems were designed when the focus

was on the needs of the operational user. Consequently, data available

from these systems is difficult to access and merge with data

from other systems and is more operational-oriented versus management-oriented.

The development of the data warehouse has improved the University&Otilde;s

ability to extract and manipulate existing data efficiently and

maintain the quality of data through documentation and the development

of data definitions. However, the data warehouse on its own is

incapable of solving many larger management information issues:

<P><blockquote>

<B>Unreliable Data in Systems</B> - The data in many of the administrative

applications supporting financial services and payroll/benefits

is easily misinterpreted or incomplete. Data definitions and standards

have not been developed and enforced, data elements are used differently

by different departments and campuses, and critical data is not

captured.

<P>

<B>Lack of Management Information Data</B> - Because the design

of the administrative applications was to support transaction

processing, the data stored in the applications does not readily

support decision-making and planning. The underlying data models

allow for little flexibility and are difficult to enhance to capture

management information. When combined with the difficulty to access

the data that exists, management information becomes rare and

ad hoc queries on specific management issues are virtually impossible.

<P>

<B>Lack of integrated and correlated data </B>- Administrative

applications were designed to support a specific function and

interfaces were developed to pass data between systems or functions

in a batch mode. Little attention has been paid to the inter-relationship

between functions and the data in the systems that support those

different functions. It is virtually impossible to link data between

systems (e.g., Payroll to Financial) since the data is stored

in different formats, is used differently, has different data

definitions, is out-dated, or is on a totally different technology

platform.

<P>

<B>No way to access/manipulate data - </B>Current data structures

supporting high-volume transaction processing are difficult to

understand by the casual user. The user must be familiar with

complicated data access methods and batch reporting languages

to access the data. It is often impossible to extract historical

data required to review trends or make planning decisions since

data is often purged to facilitate system performance. As a result,

many users have developed their own PC-based systems to collect

and manipulate financial data. This results in duplicate entry

and the maintenance of many shadow systems.</a>

</blockquote><P><HR>

<h3><A name="bp">Business Case for Change - Business Processes</h3>
<P>

Business processes comprise the rules, policies, and transaction

flow to accomplish the administrative tasks of the University.

Substantially all of the University's business processes have

evolved and expanded over the past two decades to address perceived

needs, legislative requirements or audit comments. Few, if any,

of these processes have been subjected to a thorough review to

eliminate non-value added activities, duplicative controls, or

unnecessary tasks and the processes fail to incorporate best business

practices. Significant deficiencies in the current processes include:

<P><blockquote>

<B>Labor Intensive</B> - The University's business processes require

substantial human involvement because they fail to utilize technology

to accomplish routine tasks. Because basic technology such as

electronic authorization and processing are unavailable, many

user departments must implement complex manual procedures to rout

documents, obtain signatures, and record basic information.

<P>

<B>Processes are Complex and Convoluted</B> - The complexity of

the University's business processes has increased substantially.

Many of the processes require 5-10 personnel to handle a document

to complete a single transaction. The underlying steps to handle

a similar transaction may vary by campus or even by department

within a campus; multiple approval processes required for one

document are a common occurrence.

<P>

<B>Economies of Scale</B> - Because the University's business

processes vary by campus and by department, the University does

not have the ability to leverage University resources or attain

efficiencies due to economies of scale. Consistent processing

across all campuses with coordinated process management can allow

the University to maximize the University's investment in administrative

dollars.

<P>

<B>Internal Controls</B> - Because the University's business processes

have evolved over time, additional controls and duplicative controls

have been added to each process. These additional controls frequently

provide roadblocks to efficient processing of transactions without

significantly reducing the risk of processing the transaction

incorrectly.

<P>

<B>Best Practices</B> - The University's business processes do

not reflect best business practices used by other large business

organizations. Because little or no information concerning the

cost of transactions is kept, management has few tools to determine

if the business processes are accomplishing their goals in a cost

effective manner. The business processes and related systems were

never designed to provide management the information needed to

actually manage the process; rather the business processes just

established a set of tasks to accomplish transaction processing

objectives.</a>

</blockquote><P><HR>



<P>
<h3><A name="it">Business Case for Change - Information Technology</h3>
<P>

The University's financial and human resource systems are technologically

obsolete, cumbersome, inflexible, costly to operate and use, and

lack integration. The University faces the challenges of the next

century with &quot;hard-coded&quot; static programming written

ten to twenty years ago and systems incapable of supporting changes

in the way the University conducts its affairs. Numerous internal

and external studies have recommended the University embark on

an aggressive program to replace aging administrative technology

and identified the following technology issues related to the

existing suite of administrative applications:<blockquote>

<P>

<B>Cost &amp; Complexity of Maintaining Current Systems</B> -

Administrative applications have become so cumbersome that even

the smallest change is very costly, requires substantial effort

to complete and greatly increases the overall complexity of the

system. Coupled with limited University resources, larger investments

required to address the most significant business issues are unaffordable

and unreasonable.

<P>

<B>Systems are Inflexible and Difficult to Use -</B> Requests

for system changes to support revised policies, simple business

rule changes or improved processes are often denied because the

underlying technology can't support the change, the cost is prohibitive,

or programming resources are unavailable. Applications are based

on older, character-based technology and user interfaces differ

between systems. The lack of an intuitive, standard interface

makes the systems difficult to learn and use.

<P>

<B>Lack of Integration/Batch Processing </B>- Because these systems

were implemented at different times using different technology,

data is not inherently shared and must be passed back and forth

using batch interfaces. Most systems operate in a batch processing

mode and are not updated in real-time. Substantial functional

and technical resources are spent on reconciling data/systems

and maintaining interfaces.

<P>

<B>Unsupported Technology </B>- The systems are at the very end

of their product lifecycle and there is a significant possibility

the vendors will no longer support the technology on which they

are based. Some of the systems need to be upgraded to meet minimum

operating requirements (e.g., work in new operating system, Year

2000, etc.) but the cost of implementing these requirements is

prohibitive.

<P>

<B>Designed for Transaction Processing </B>- The systems and technology

were implemented when mainframe technology was state of the art

and modern business practices had yet to be developed. These systems

were designed primarily to serve as transaction processors (e.g.,

issuing an A/P warrant) and not to fulfill multiple objectives

related to management information requirements (e.g., track the

volume of purchases by commodity or vendor) or flexibility in

user needs.</blockquote></a><P><HR>

<P>
<h3><A name="ef">Business Case for Change - Economic &amp; External Factors
</h3>
<P>

Economic and external pressures provide the sense of urgency for

an organization to adapt goals, structures, and tasks to meet

future market demands and customer needs. Too often this sense

of urgency is only felt after the fiscal pressure is in full swing

and significant cost savings have been foregone. The University

faces significant economic and external pressures as it nears

the end of the century. While economic and external pressures

have been present in our recent past, their importance and impact

on the future of the University has never been greater and the

rate of change will continue to accelerate. The critical economic/external

factors facing the University include:<blockquote>

<P>

<B>Budget Pressures</B> - The University will face shrinking state

support, substantial competition for the tuition and fee dollar,

and a federal research base with severely limited growth. These

three factors will virtually eliminate any possibility of any

significant growth in &quot;new dollars&quot; to the University.

Therefore, investments in academic programs and University initiatives

will need to come from internal reallocations rather than growth

in existing revenue sources.

<P>

<B>Inflexible Administrative Structures</B> - The University's

current administrative structures (organization and processes)

do not possess the flexibility to easily adapt to technological

change, budget pressures, and increased accountability. These

demands will force the University to initiate rapid change in

administrative structure (organization and process) to meet the

dynamic external environment and change the manner in which the

University conducts business.

<P>

<B>Technologically Advanced Customer Base </B>- Institutions of

higher education will be confronted with an increasingly mobile

and technologically advanced student customer and business partner

population. The University has already begun to plan for the academic

changes needed to accommodate the educational needs of the student

customer; the University must also address the administrative

needs of business partners and student customers. The University's

ability to complete administrative functions (billing, paying,

registration, etc.) in a technologically advanced manner will

encourage business partners and student customers to continue

their relationship with the University.

<P>

<B>Increasing Accountability</B> - The University will be subjected

to increasing accountability from all critical funding sources

related to resource use, delivery of services, and legislative

mandates. It is becoming common for external parties to demand

information on policies, procedures, and practices. The University's

underlying technology, processes, and data fail to provide the

necessary information needed to respond to those requests. Failure

to demonstrate accountability will lead to difficulties in obtaining

resources and support from external entities. </blockquote><P><P>

What is the Administrative Streamlining Project (A.S.P.)? </b> <P>                     

                                                                              

A.S.P. is a multi-year project aimed at replacing our antiquated financial and

human resource systems (FRS, Payroll, A/P, etc.) and simplifying how the

university community performs human resource and administrative tasks.  A.S.P.

has three major goals:                                                          

<ul>                                                                             

<LI>Information Development - integrate financial and human resource

information and provide more reliable, accessible and timely management

information. This will increase the amount of information available for

decisions at all levels.                                                           

<P>                                                                                

<LI>     Process Revision and Simplification - eliminate paper intensive and

over-controlled processes by utilizing electronic workflow and forms (For

example, a departmental administrator may use their e-mail to route a personnel

action form).  Process revision includes simplifying policies and rules so they

are easy to understand and use.                                                 

 <P>                                                                               

<LI>     Technology Replacement - replace existing difficult to use batch systems

with on-line user-friendly point-and-click systems (Systems that operate like a

Windows or Macintosh machine).  At the present time, it is expected new modules

to be implemented include:  Human Resources, Payroll, Benefits, General Ledger,

Budget, Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Accounts Receivable, Sponsored Programs,

Fixed Assets and Inventory. 

<P>                                                    

                                                                            

</blockquote>                                                                            

<B>How will A.S.P. affect and improve our ability to accomplish the academic

mission?   </B>   <P>                                                                  

                                                                               

By simplifying our administrative tasks, departmental administrators, faculty,

and principal investigators will spend less time completing and monitoring

paperwork.  In addition, by having access to better information, these

personnel can complete administrative tasks (proposal preparation, hiring,

reporting, etc.) with less effort.                                              

<P>                                                                                

By reducing the amount of time to complete administrative tasks more time will

be available to support the academic mission of instruction, research, and

public service.                                                                    

<P>                                                                                

<B>                                                                                

How will the University community benefit from A.S.P.? </B>                         

<P>                                                                                    

A.S.P. will provide simplified ways to complete daily administrative tasks.  We

will be able to use our personal computers to process forms electronically,

generate and format reports, and more easily tailor the information systems to

our needs.                                                                      

 <P>                                                                               

In addition, users will be able to more easily link human resource and

financial information and all of the systems should have a similar -look and

feel- to allow for ease of use.                                                 

                                                                                  

                                                                                

 <P><B>                                                                               

How will A.S.P. change how we work? </B>

<P>                                                                                 

Personnel who spend time processing financial or human resource transactions

will be able to complete and monitor those transactions via their personal

computer rather than through paper forms.  For example, a PAF might be

completed by directly entering the data into an electronic form on a personal

computer and then sent to the appropriate authority by clicking a button.       

 <P>                                                                               

Almost all personnel should experience benefits from the implementation of

simplified rules surrounding the completion of administrative tasks.            

   <P>                                                                              

<B>                                                                                

Why should the University undertake the A.S.P. project now? </B>                    

 <P>                                        

A.S.P. must be done now for the following reasons:                              

  <ul>                                                                            

<LI> Within the next five years, much of the University-s existing

administrative technology will be obsolete or will be unsupported by the

vendors. By embarking on a comprehensive plan, we will avoid putting ourselves

in a position of forced replacement or being technologically deficient as we

enter the 21st century.                                                         

 <p>                                                                               

<LI> Many of our administrative processes are so controlled and complex that

even the simplest of transactions are extremely time consuming and costly to

complete. By simplifying these processes, we will be able to spend more time on

supporting the academic mission rather than on processing individual

transactions.                                                                   

<P>                                                                                

<LI> The cost of modifying our existing technology in support of improving or

modifying our administrative processes is prohibitive; as a result, the

frequent improvement and efficiency suggestions of our employees can't be

implemented.                                                                    

 <P>                                                                               

<LI> Management information for faculty, staff, departmental administrators,

and other management personnel is currently difficult to access or unavailable.

We can no longer expect our managers to operate in the most efficient manner if

the/y don't have information on which to base their decisions.                   

</ul>                                                                                

 <P>   <B>                                                                            

Why doesn't the University simply modify the existing human resource and

financial systems?  </B>                                                            

  <P>                                                                             

The cost of modifying and maintaining the existing systems is increasing while

the ability of those systems to meet the needs of users, even after

modification, is decreasing. The existing systems lack the flexibility to

support customer or user demands - therefore, changes are costly and serve as

short-term solutions.                                                           

<P>                                                                     

 <b>                                                                               

Is A.S.P. intended to primarily serve as a means of cutting costs and reducing

the workforce?                                                                  

</b><P>                                                                                     

A.S.P. is not a project being initiated solely to reduce the University's

workforce. In fact, our forecasted difficult budget environment and the need to

continue to minimize administrative costs will likely have more to do with any

potential position eliminations than will A.S.P.                                

<P>                                                                                

However, in working towards the objective of simplifying and streamlining the

administrative processes, it is possible some positions will be eliminated.

More likely, the nature of many jobs will change as existing work will be

redefined and the ability to use new technologies will become more important.

To the best of our ability, we will make efforts to minimize position

eliminations and layoffs and one of the first tasks in the project planning

phase is to develop change management strategies designed to manage human

resource issues arising from the project.                                       

<P>                                                                                

<B>How soon will we see changes from the A.S.P. project?  </B>                         

 <P>                                                                               

The A.S.P. project has a preliminary target completion date of June 30, 1999.

Based on the experiences and planning efforts at our colleague institutions,

this is an extremely aggressive time schedule.                                  

<P>                                                                                

Given the project timeline, significant changes to positions or nature of work

will probably not occur for at least 18 months. This provides the University

the opportunity, within the context of A.S.P., to develop the change management

strategies needed to cope with any changes arising from the project.            

<P> <B>                                                                               

Are other research based institutions embarking on similar projects?            

</b><P>                                                                                

Yes. Many of our colleague research based institutions have begun similar

projects for very similar reasons. In particular, projects are at various

stages of completion at Ohio State, Cornell, Michigan, Pennsylvania and

Cal-Berkeley.

What suggestions have we heard from these other institutions to ensure success

and how have we taken advantage of their advice?                                

</B><P>                                                                                

Our colleague institutions have reiterated the following four themes and we are

closely following their advice:                                                 

   <p>                                                                        

<b>Dedicate project personnel</b> - the project will have the best chance of

success if a core team of personnel are dedicated to the project.               

<p> <BLOCKQUOTE>

<b>Pay attention to managing the organizational change</b> - these projects are

much more than just process change or an implementation of technology; we

The A.S.P. project philosophy is very consistent with our existing efforts.

A.S.P. is designed to simplify administrative processes, empower the workforce,

allow for the implementation of employee suggestions to create new efficiencies

and enable the University to change how we think about and carry out our work.  

<p><b> <P>                                                                               

How much will the project cost and how will we fund it?                         

<p></b>                                                                                

Current estimates are between $25 and $35 million over the next three-four

years. Obviously, as procurements are made through the University's RFP process

and more knowledge is gained, these estimates will be adjusted. The estimates

include the cost of core project team personnel dedicated to the project,

hardware, software, external consultants, and project administration.

Not all of the project funding or investment will require -new money- -

approximately $15 million has already been identified from existing funding

sources during the next four years. These funding sources include the

University Initiatives Fund, reallocations, and amounts already designated for

replacement of administrative technology. The balance of the project funding

will come from other sources and may include internal borrowings repaid over

the useful life of the replacement technology.

What has been done on the project so far?

We are in the very early stages of a three to four year project and project

tasks to date have focused on completing those tasks needed to support the

project.  Those tasks include getting project personnel dedicated, establishing

project space, defining roles and responsibilities and outlining high level

project phasing. Detail project plans for the next phase will be developed once

critical project personnel are on board.

A full communication plan will be completed in November and routine

communication about the project will start. Significant announcements will be

made in the Silver & Gold and the current A.S.P. web page will be expanded. The

<P><HR><P>
A.S.P. Core Team</h3>

<P>
The A.S.P. Core Team will be committed to the project on a full-time
basis and will report to the A.S.P. Project Managers. Team members
will work with Project Managers to develop detailed project plans
and then execute the tasks identified on the plan.  The Core Team
will coordinate project plans and accomplish tasks with input
and assistance from Specialty Resource Groups and Campus Implementation
Teams.
<P>
The size of the Core Team will be determined after detail project
plans have been developed by the Project Management Team. It is
currently estimated the core team will not exceed 20 personnel
during the first two years and will be comprised of personnel
from throughout the University of Colorado System. <P><HR>

<P><h3>
Speciality Resource Groups</h3>

<P>
Specialty Resource Groups will be organized for a short period
of time to work with A.S.P. Core Team members and Project Managers
to accomplish specific project tasks and develop University-wide
solutions. For example, a Specialty Resource Group will likely
be necessary to create a new University-wide chart of accounts.
To accomplish this task, a small group of personnel from throughout
the University of Colorado System might meet for a brief period
of time (e.g., two days a week for three weeks) to work through
the concepts and solutions with the project personnel.
<P>
The A.S.P. Advisory Groups (existing Senior Administrator's Group,
Human Resource Policy Group, etc.) will be responsible for identifying
personnel from all campuses who would serve on these Specialty
Resource Groups to work with specific Core Team members in completing
tasks and developing University-wide solutions.
<P><HR>
<P><h3>
Campus Implementation Teams</h3>

<P>
As the project progresses and implementation of process and technology
changes grow near, Campus Implementations Teams will be organized
on each campus to prepare the campus for organizational changes
and final implementation of new processes and technology.  They
will work closely with the A.S.P. Project Team to determine campus
specific tasks that must be completed and the schedule for completion.
<P>
The size and complexion of the Campus Implementation Teams will
likely be significant in the last 18 months of the project. In
the first 18 months, a small group of personnel will spend a portion
of their time monitoring project tasks and assessing the required
campus actions to prepare for the implementation.

<hr>
<H2><font color=#D98719>Project Proposal</font></H2>
On June 27, 1996, the Board of Regents voted to endorse the full development of the administrative streamlining project.  
<P>A <a href="prop.html">project proposal </a> outlining the preliminary scope and objectives was 
presented and adopted by the Board of Regents.  The University is currently
refining the scope and objectives but anticipating the final package will be
similar to goals outlined in the project proposal.

 <P>The project mission is to improve the University's financial and human resource management by providing reliable management information, redesigning administrative processes, implementing modern technology, and streamlining organizational structures.<P>

This special funding has stimulated the developmentof new ways of using technology to more directly engage studentsin course content and in the process of their own learning.  The initiative has also augmented student and faculty access tonew technology-based learning resources, encouraged faculty torethink the organization of their courses, and provided a newopportunity for joint faculty projects among the CU campuses.  Brief descriptions of the 1995-96 Learning Paradigm projects,which received funds ranging from $6,000 to $35,000, can be foundat http://www.cusys.edu/Inside_CU/Sys_Admin/Initiatives/.<BR><P>The Office of the President ispleased to announce that an additional $400,000 has been allocatedto the Learning Paradigm initiative to support a second roundof grants in 1996-97.   This initiative compliments a number ofimportant technology-related activities throughout the University,such as the faculty mini-grants at the four campuses and the systemwide,five-year project on faculty development.  The appropriate integrationof technology in the University's teaching, learning, and managementactivities is a cornerstone of President Buechner's plan for aTotal Learning  Environment (TLE) at the University of Coloradotomorrow and into the next century.  The incentive funding providedthrough this initiative supports the TLE goals for innovation,responsiveness to students, and leadership in uses of technology.<BR><P><I><B>Request for Proposals<BR></B></I><P>This request for proposals invitesCU faculty to apply for special, one-time funding for projectsthat seek to<U> improve student learning through the creativeand appropriate use of technology</U>.   While one expected outcomeis an increase in the number of courses and other learning opportunitieswithin the CU system that utilize technology, the primary purposeof this program is to support more faculty in their efforts to:<BR><P>  Provide students with timelyaccess to rich course content and course-related information,<P>  Actively engage students throughdiscussions, team projects, electronic simulations, and otheractive, learning strategies,<P>  Provide more opportunitiesfor communications, discourse, and feedback among students andfaculty.<BR><P><I><B>Award Limits for Multi-Campusor Single Campus Projects<BR></B></I><P>For the initial 1995-96 cycleof the Learning Paradigm initiative, applicants were encouragedto submit multi-campus proposals.  Several such cooperative proposalswere funded, and the benefits of broader participation are evident. However, because some projects may not be suitable for this approach,the 1996-97 program has two categories:<BR><P>  Category #1 is for multi-campusprojects (ones that directly involve faculty from two or moreCU campuses).  $225,000 (or 56 percent of available funds) willbe spent in this category, with project awards ranging from $20,000to $50,000.  Partial funding of projects may be considered.<BR><P>  Category #2 is for single campusprojects.   $150,000 (or 37 percent of available funds) will bespent for projects that involve faculty from a single campus. Category #2 awards will range from $10,000 to $25,000, and partialfunding of projects may be considered.<BR><P>In addition, the Working Groupon Technology (WGOT) is concerned that the continuation of specialfunding programs such as this one require a comprehensive andsystematic assessment of the time, costs, outcomes associatedwith these projects.  Therefore, the WGOT has earmarked $25,000for the development of some pilot assessment strategies that willbe spearheaded by the Boulder campus.  All Paradigm-funded projects(1995-97) will be kept informed of this assessment pilot and involvedwhen appropriate.<BR><P><I><B>Eligible Applicants andExpenses<BR></B></I><P>All CU faculty are invited tosubmit applications, including faculty who received funding earlierthis year through the Learning Paradigm initiative.  No specialpriority will be given to the existing 16 projects, should theyapply.<BR><P>Few restrictions will be placedon individual budget expenses.  Funds may be used for the purchaseof services from campus resources (e.g. instructional designers,media and computing support), consulting services, commercialsoftware, equipment and hardware, and other such resources.  Courserelease time and summer salaries for faculty as well as salariesfor graduate students are all eligible expenses.  Travel and associationmembership fees will not be covered by these funds. <BR><P><I><B>Application Requirements<BR></B></I><P><B>Section A.  One-Page Cover Sheet</B><BR>including:<P>1. project title;<P>2. designation as a Category#1 or a Category #2 proposal;<P>3. dollar amount requested;<P>4. name and contact informationof the principal project director who will hold fiscal responsibilityfor the project.  For multi-campus proposals, include the nameand contact information of the project's co-director(s) at theother campus(es).<P>5. names and campus affiliationof other faculty and staff who will have a significant role during the 12 months of the project;<P>6. signature of the principalproject director's Chair (or Dean's signature for those Colleges without Dept. Chairs).  For multi-campus proposals, please includein the appendix a letter or  other evidence of support from theChair (or Dean) from the partnering campus(es).<BR><P><B>Section B.  Proposal Narrative</B><BR>not to exceed 1,500 words (or approximately four, double-spacedpages), including:<P>1.  clear statement of projectgoals relative to  improvements in student learning;<P>2. identification of expectedoutcomes/products;<P>3. evidence of a plan for achievingthe project goals, such as a description of principal project activities;<P>4.  timeframe for implementationof the principal project activities;<P>5. statement of anticipated valueto the University relative to the project's ability to serve (a)as a  model for other disciplines or campuses or (b) a significantnumber or special segment of the  student population;<P>6. a plan for monitoring thesuccess of the project and being able to provide information onthe  project's progress for the benefit of others.<BR><P><B>Section C.  Budget and BudgetJustification</B><P>1. breakdown of major budgetcategories (e.g, course release time, student  salaries, feesfor  services, hardware purchases, software licenses);<P>2. brief justification of majorexpenditures;<P>3. amount and source of otherfunding for the project, if relevant.<BR><P><B>Section D.

Regents' Budget and Planning Retreat<br>
June 5 &amp; 6, 1996</FONT></h2>
<img src="color_strip.gif"><P></CENTER>
<FONT COLOR="000044"><h2><CENTER>Enrollment Planning Update</CENTER></h2>
<P>
The University's enrollment management plan was based on several demographic and market driven assumptions gathered from the information available in the fall 1994.  Several key assumptions were:
<UL><li>there would be a substantial increase in the number of Colorado high school graduates over the next 15 year period,
<LI>changes in the transfer market increasing demand at the University and other four year institutions, and 
<LI>program driven growth would increase graduate enrollment.
</UL><hr><br>
In preparation for the budget retreat, each campus re-visited the assumptions concerning enrollment growth and revised their projections for enrollment growth through fall 2000.  Based on these projections, University enrollment could increase by 10% by fall 2000 over fall 1994 enrollment.  The enrollment management plan projected potential increases of 24% through fall 2004.  This indicates a slowing in anticipated enrollment growth.<P>
<P>
One factor impacting enrollment projections was the CCHE and state demographic predictions of a surge in Colorado high school graduates.  These projections indicated increases beginning as early as 1994 with a steep increase in 1997.  Thus far, increases have not been realized either at the University or other higher education institutions in the state.  The results are current enrollment projections that are far more conservative than previously reported, particularly for the traditional college-bound students.   The Boulder campus expects enrollment to increase more through targeted recruitment strategies and programs.  The Denver campus will see growth in the new freshman group mainly as a result of changes in the admissions index.  The Colorado Springs campus will be opening new dormitory facilities which increases its appeal to those high school graduates seeking a traditional residential experience.  Colorado Springs originally made enrollment projections at a time when Ft. Carson's fate was uncertain.  The Colorado Springs campus is the only campus whose earlier estimates were more conservative.<P>
<P>
Since the projected increases in high school graduates have not materialized, community college enrollment has not grown as expected.  The community colleges are one of the largest feeder sources for resident transfer students at the University and affects the campuses differently.
<UL><LI>Boulder's strength in the market for resident transfer students continues to be strong. However, Boulder's strength in the non-resident transfer market fell dramatically in 1995.  This market is expected to recover but at a slower rate.
<LI>At Colorado Springs, Pikes Peak Community College is the primary source of transfer students.  With PPCC's enrollment falling, the Colorado Springs transfer market is softer than it has been for some time.
<LI>Denver is directly impacted by enrollment at the five metro area community colleges since the majority of transfers from two year institutions are from within the metro area.
<LI>There is little to no impact for the Health Sciences Center.</UL>
<br>
At the graduate student level, enrollment growth will still be program-driven.  In the enrollment management plan, the majority of graduate student growth within the system was predicted for the Health Sciences Center.  The conversion of the pharmacy program to a doctoral program and other changes would contribute to increases in the number of graduate students.  Due to constraints on the ability of these programs to grow quickly, the increases in graduate students are expected to occur at a slower rate.  New programs at the other campuses are expected to continue to draw new graduate students to the University.<P>
<P>
<hr>
Due to the concerns over the projected increases in high school graduates, the enrollment management plan focused more on strategies to meet that need.  In periods of slow enrollment growth, greater attention is focused on the retention of current students.  Each of the three general campuses has initiated a number of efforts to strengthen retention. (Retention is not an issue for the Health Sciences Center.)<P>
<P>
At Boulder efforts include:
<UL><LI>involving faculty in student retention
<LI>providing more mentoring for students on probation
<LI>providing more career workshops, especially to undeclared majors
<LI>instituting a calling project for students not yet registered for the fall
</UL><br>

Colorado Springs efforts resulted in:
<UL><LI>increasing walk-in advising to five days per week
<LI>continuing the two-point-of-contact program for first-time freshmen and transfer students through Project Excel
<LI>working on a residential retention program to include freshman study tables and tutoring</UL><br>

Denver's retention initiatives include:
<UL><LI>creating a student services assistance center in the North Classroom Building
<LI>integrating time management, information literacy, oral and written communication skills, and career development into the freshman seminars
<LI>strengthening career planning and employment referral programs</UL>
<br>
Measures of student retention will be built into the performance indicators report and progress can be measured over a multi-year time period.<P>
<P><P>
<hr>
Although some of the assumptions have changed since the development of the enrollment management plan, the attached system-wide enrollment projections indicate continued expectations for enrollment growth.  These projections highlight the importance of the University having a plan to fund and manage enrollment.<P>

<FONT COLOR="000044"><br>
The University of Colorado faces many critical budgetary and funding issues as it moves toward the 21st century.  Our plans call for significant enrollment expansion in the next decade, the need for new uses of technology to enhance learning and reach broader audiences, and efforts to enhance the quality of undergraduate education, while maintaining essential development in graduate education, research and the creation of knowledge.  The expressed needs of the citizens of the State of Colorado represent critical goals.<p>
<br>
At the same time, The University has seen many critical changes in its environment.  Amendment One (TABOR) provides a new challenge limiting State revenue growth and changes the status of Enterprises.  Demographic shifts will dramatically increase the traditional college age population over the next ten years.  The global economy provides new and changing requirements for our graduates that need to be considered in academic and budgetary planning.<p>
<br>
It is due to these changing conditions, as well as the recognition of campus mission and objectives, current program funding requirements and the essential requirements of markets for students, faculty and staff, that provide the context for the Blue Ribbon Panel.  Its basic purpose must be to bring together all of these factors, so budgetary planning and development may proceed in an orderly fashion, being informed by past concerns and being thoughtful about future needs.<p>
<br>
The charge to the Panel, then, is:<p>
<ol>
<li>To examine the context for University budgeting and the factors which will impact future budget decisions.
<li>To compare the context for budget planning with the current budgets and budgetary strategies at each campus and to assess the degree of adequacy of our current methods and strategies for meeting the University's future.
<li>To identify the issues and factors needing resolution in order for the University's budgets to meet future needs and, where appropriate, to recommend specific resolutions.  These recommendations should recognize measures of success as well, if appropriate.
</ol>
<br>
The appointment of this broad based committee is to ensure that many perspectives are heard and alternatives considered.  However, it is essential to move toward a focus quickly, since the FY 1996-97 budget process must be underway by January, and the Panel's recommendations need to be available to lead that process.<p>
<br>
Because of the short timeframe, the Panel will need to rely primarily on existing data, but may call on campus presentations (through the Technical Advisory Committee) or on outside resources where appropriate.<p>
<br>
Findings and recommendations in all of these areas should be completed by early November for submission to the President<p>

<FONT COLOR="000044"><h2><CENTER>Issues in Financial Aid</CENTER></h2>
<P>
Over the past five years, the University
of Colorado has seen some notable changes in financial aid funding.
 The highlights include a 46% increase in state-supported financial
aid and the addition of direct lending at the Boulder campus in
1993.  Each change has greatly aided the University in providing
financial support to its students.<BR>
<HR>
<P>
<H3><CENTER><EM>Changes in Federal Financial Aid Funding and Policies</EM>
</CENTER></H3>
<BR>
<P>
The largest and most significant changes in financial aid has been at the federal level.  The federal government comprises the largest source of financial aid at CU, accounting for 67% of the financial aid awarded in FY 1994-95.
<BR>
<P>
In 1992, Congress revised the student
loan program which liberalized the borrowing criteria, increased
the borrowing ceilings and created two unsubsidized loan programs.
 The results were a dramatic increase in the amount of loans.
 In the ten years from 1984 to 1994, the amount borrowed by parents
and students to finance higher education costs tripled from $7.9
billion to $23.1 billion nationally.  More than half of the increase
occurred from 1992 to 1994, reflecting the liberalized borrowing
criteria and increased availability.  Within the same ten year
period, the median income in the U.S. increased by 46.6%, CPI
by 42.6% and the costs at public four year institutions increased
by 81.7%.<BR>
<P>
Ten years ago, students used to be
able to rely on grants to cover a significant portion of college
costs.  Pell Grants covered 20% of the average costs at private
universities and about half of the average costs at public universities.
 Stagnation and cuts to grants programs have also contributed
to the growth in loans.  Currently, Pell Grants cover about 10%
of the average costs at private universities and one-third of
the costs at public institutions.  For example, the maximum Pell
award of $2,470 would cover the resident undergraduate tuition
in Arts and Sciences at Boulder and less than half of the mandatory
fees.  In 1994-95, the average Pell award on the CU campuses fell
short of the $2,470 maximum, averaging $1,582 at Boulder, $1,353
at Colorado Springs, $1,493 at Denver and $1,869 at the Health
Sciences Center and the University awarded a total of $10 million
in Pell Grants to 6,520 recipients.<BR>
<P>
Actions over the past ten years in
federal financial aid policy have resulted in a growing imbalance
between grants and loans.  There is also every indication that
this imbalance will continue.  In the 1996 federal budget, Pell
Grants and work-study received no increases.  The State Student
Incentive Grants, which require matching funds from the states,
were cut by more than 50%.  Though federal policies have perpetuated
a reliance on loans, loans are also under scrutiny.  During the
discussions of the 1996 federal budget, there were talks of discontinuing
the direct student-loan program.<BR>
<HR>
<P>
<CENTER><H3><EM>Changes in State Financial Aid Funding</EM></H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
Although there are concerns over
changes in federal financial aid policies, the University has
benefited from steady increases in state funding for financial
aid.  Over the last five years, state sources of financial aid
have increased by 46%, from $6.6 million to $9.6 million.  State
financial aid funds are only in the form of either grant or work
aid.<BR>
<P>
For FY 1996-97, the University was
allocated an 8% increase, putting the total of state financial
aid at $10.3 million.  However, the passage of SB 206 could change
this allocation.  SB 206 provides for a high school achievement
award for Colorado twelfth graders graduating in the top 10% of
their class and subsequently enrolling in one of Colorado's public
institutions.  The award is $1,000 per year for four years, as
long as the student maintains a 3.5 GPA in college.  The bill
provides for no additional funding, requiring reallocation from
the current merit-based grant program.  If this bill is signed
by the Governor, the University could receive an additional $499,993
following the reallocation.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><H3><EM>Funding Trends at the University</EM></H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
The following charts graphically
illustrate the changes in financial aid funding at the University
over the last five years.<BR>
<P>
Figure 1 illustrates the growth in
loans compared to the other types of financial aid received by
the University.  The largest increase in loans occurred from 1992-93
to 1993-94, following the implementation of direct lending at
the Boulder campus.  Prior to direct lending,  the loans were
handled by private lenders.  From 1991-92, there is virtually
no growth in grants and scholarships and the amount of work aid
declined by more than half from 1989-90 to 1990-91.

<CENTER><H3><EM>For Further Discussion</EM></H3></CENTER>
<BR>
<P>
This review of national and University
financial aid trends highlights the need for additional discussion
on financial aid issues facing the University.  The discussion
can be targeted toward two primary areas, both with additional
underlying issues.<BR>

<P>
The first area is the changes in
federal financial aid policy and subsequent implications for the
University.  As discussed in this paper, federal funding for grants
and work aid is stagnating and loans are increasing, resulting
in an imbalance in the type of aid awarded.<BR>

<P>
Nationally, the average debt load
of college students in 1994 was $10,500.  At Boulder, the debt
accumulated by resident graduating seniors increased from just
under $12,000 in 1991 to nearly $16,000 in 1994.  At Colorado
Springs, the average debt for students enrolled in 1994-95 was
$9,820.  Average indebtedness reports at Denver indicate that
the average debt for undergraduates is $13,706 and $17,330 for
graduates.<BR>
<P>
This leaves the following questions
to be addressed:
<UL>
<LI>Given the increasing availability
and reliance on loans, should the University be actively seeking
strategies to achieve a better balance between loans, grants,
and work?
<LI>Should the University dedicate
additional institutional resources toward financial aid?
<LI>Should tuition and financial
aid policies be more closely integrated?
</UL>

<P>
<P>
The second area for discussion is
defining the University's financial aid goals, more specifically
should the University be accomplishing with its financial aid
policies.
<UL>
<LI>Is the University using financial
aid as a means to diversify the student population academically,
economically, and ethnically?
<LI>Should, and is, financial aid
enabling access to the University by increasing affordabilty to
those who might otherwise not attend?
<LI>With the increasing growth of
loans and loan availability, should the University re-examine
its self-help policies?
</UL>

BUDGET ALLOCATION MODEL</FONT></h2>
<img src="color_strip.gif"><P></CENTER>
<FONT COLOR="000044"><BR>
The University Budget Allocation Model was developed using the <A HREF="http://spot.colorado.edu/~lbauer/principles.html">principles</A> and <A HREF="http://spot.colorado.edu/~lbauer/guidelines.html">resource allocation guidelines</A>.  These principles and guidelines were developed with the assistance of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Budget Planning and Resource Allocation and were reviewed by the RAFAC committee of the Board at their meeting on March 20, 1996.  The incremental State general fund numbers are from the FY 1996-97 Long Bill, as amended, but as yet is unsigned by the Governor.  The final version of the Long Bill was amended to reflect a shift of funding from the University's base budget into the State's policy areas.   This amendment reduced the University's funding for FY 1996-97 by $196,045.  The model is based on the following assumptions:<P>
<BR>
<OL>
<LI>A 3.4% inflation factor on the current year base.<P>
<LI>Offsets for an enrollment reduction from the State general fund in the amount of $623,446 and a 1% travel/operating expenditure reduction of $247,389.<P>
<LI>Additional State funding of $1,695,545 to allow for a reduction of the resident tuition rate from 4.3% to 2.3%.<P>
<LI>Continued phase-out of the small campus supplement from Treasury earnings and a replacement of these funds with State general fund.  The model assumes accelerating to a three-year phase-out which will cost $412,500/year for the remaining two years.<P>
<LI>Creation of a President's Initiatives fund within the general fund allocation model to further systemwide goals and to assist the campuses in achieving campus goals.  These targeted funds will be augmented with one-time money from Treasury earnings.  (For further description of the President's Initiatives fund, see Attachment 2.)<P>
<LI>Tuition rate increases of 2.3% for resident students and 4.3% for non-resident students.<P>
<LI>Projected tuition revenue calculated on enrollment increases or decreases for each campus based on current projections for FY 1996-97 over their current year's enrollment.<P>
<LI>Differential tuition revenue of $401,000 at the HSC in five programs which have been approved by CCHE and the JBC.<P>
<LI>The funding model does not forward-fund future growth of enrollment at any of the campuses.  An enrollment funding policy will be developed, working with a campus-based advisory committee over the next six months, with the goal of implementing the group's recommendations in next year's funding model.<P>
</OL>
<HR>
It is important to remember that this model reflects only the incremental State general fund and tuition revenue available to each campus and the university system as a whole.  It does not reflect other campus-based income such as research grants and contracts, indirect cost recoveries, clinical earnings, auxiliary revenues and private gifts and donations.  It also does not yet reflect one-time appropriations from the University Initiatives Fund (i.e., Treasury Earnings) nor the grant programs for Technology and K-12 Linkages established by SB136.  These one-time grants will be reflected later in the process.<P>

<Font COLOR=#000044><H2><CENTER>Faculty Resources</CENTER></H2>
<P>
The principal mission of universities includes: the pursuit of
new knowledge through basic research, the transmission of knowledge,
and educating a future citizenry. Other important goals include
career training, public service, granting degrees, and economic
stimulation through the application of education and research.
However, one fact is clear, the faculty are the engine that drives
all of these interests. Their reputation, quality, and how they
apply these to institutional purposes and goals can determine
the University's success. Without question, they are the single
most important asset of any university.<BR>

<P>
At the same time, increasing numbers of people are questioning
the costs and management of higher education institutions including
questions on the commitment to educating students and rising costs.
Higher education is perceived as arrogant and unaccountable. At
the heart of much of this discourse is the faculty. Questions
of tenure and growing salaries, along with concerns about over-specialization
in disciplines and disinterest in undergraduate education, also
imply that faculty are viewed by many as both the cause of and
the solution to the increased scrutiny.<BR>

<P>
Faculty compensation represents the largest single expenditure
in the University's budget. In FY 1995-96, faculty compensation
represented $212 million and 46% of all expenditures in the University's
general operating budget. For this reason alone, faculty compensation
is worthy of discussion at a retreat dedicated to budget issues.
Keep in mind that the faculty contribute both to the University's
financial success, as well as the fiscal constraints. Faculty
at the University of Colorado bring in over $300 million in federal
and private grants each year. It is on their merits that the reputation
of the campuses is built, attracting students and tuition dollars.
This is not to say, however, that the costs of faculty couldn't
be better managed.<BR>

<P>
Despite what the public perceives as runaway tuition increases,
today only 20% of the country's colleges and universities are
financially healthy. Many of the remaining 80% see managing the
faculty resource as an important key to improving their financial
health.<BR>

<HR>

<H3><CENTER><EM>Faculty As An Institutional Asset</EM><BR></CENTER></H3>


<P>
For years, colleges and universities have counted facilities,
equipment, library and computer resources as assets. The faculty
are recognized as a asset of an institution to a much lesser extent.
Faculty salaries constitute the major portion of the total institutional
budget and are one of the primary investments made by institutions.
<BR>

<P>
The concept of regarding a university's human resources (faculty
and staff) as an institutional asset requires something of a paradigm
shift. This begins by viewing faculty as a long term institutional
investment to be developed and maintained, instead of just as
service providers. In turn, this paradigm shift will require substantive
changes in human resource management practices. The perspective
of simply &quot;purchasing services&quot; changes to the perspective
of &quot;investing in capacity&quot; which places the management
of human assets within a different decision-making context. For
example, institutional managers would have to examine what is
necessary to create and maintain the human asset and what must
be done to continue the on-going management and cost effective
utilization of this asset. This paradigm shift forces more of
the institution's efforts to be spent on the selective acquisition
and effective utilization of the institutional assets and less
on merely accomplishing the tasks at hand, such as providing the
educational services.<BR>

<P>
Accepting the view that faculty are assets and maximizing the
institution's acquisition and utilization efforts assumes a clear
understanding and widespread commitment to the institution's mission.
Identifying potential new assets is predicated on the assumption
that the institution first knows who and what it purports to be
and is able to determine whether the prospective asset can contribute
to the existing environment.<BR>

<P>
The broader question of appropriate and desirable staffing patterns,
which will be discussed later, must be addressed to realize the
asset concept fully. Therefore, questions of fit between the faculty
member and the institutional culture become paramount. A closer
look at the prior experiences of new faculty and a solid sense
that these experiences are appropriate for specific institutional
environments is necessary. Moreover, since the allegiance of most
faculty today tends to be to their professional disciplines, it
would be in the institution's best interest to discuss whether
the prospective faculty member's personal and professional priorities
are consistent with those of the institution.<BR>

<HR>

<H3><CENTER><EM>Can the University's campuses afford to make
the investments necessary to achieve the levels of faculty success
to which we aspire?</EM></CENTER></H3><BR>

<P>
This paradigm shift requires an institution to address its commitment
toward creating and maintaining assets. What level of investment
will the institution make to create the asset and at what level
will the institution continue to provide adequate compensation
to maintain the asset? Salaries are not the only consideration;
investments in laboratory spaces, graduate students, and equipment
often become negotiating tools.<BR>

<P>
Having committed to the investment in faculty, effective utilization
is critical. Institutions must be concerned with the effective
deployment of faculty skills and experience. With limited finances,
the allocation of faculty in the most cost-effective manner must
be a top institutional priority. An institution's mission should
provide the framework for allocating scarce assets to important
functions of the institution.<BR>

<P>
Finally, as with any investment, care and attention must be given
to make sure the asset does not depreciate. With the human asset
concept, on-going renewal is critical. Periodic staff development
activities in the form of sabbaticals, faculty development, and
professional travel opportunities increase the institution's investment
in the human asset and help ensure that the faculty continue to
provide significant contributions to the institution.<BR>

<HR>

<H3><CENTER><EM>Faculty Salaries</EM></CENTER></H3><BR>

<P>
Salaries are a function of history, market, performance, and ability
to pay. History suggests certain practices, such as tenure and
promotion rates, which help to establish a compensation base that
can be hard to affect. Market refers primarily to the competition
for both current and future faculty. Performance is meritorious
efforts and represents the only officially recognized criteria
for awarding salary increases to current faculty. Ability to pay
plays an important influence on faculty compensation, evidenced
by the fact that each CU campus lists faculty salary increases
among the highest priorities, yet is often unable to afford that
financial recognition.<BR>

<P>
History
<P>
Given the different roles and histories of the campuses, it is
reasonable to expect very different levels in tenure, age, and
rank of the faculties.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="facprof.gif"><FONT SIZE=2><br>
Note: Information taken from the Faculty Diversity Reports<p><BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Each of the campuses express concerns about compression and salary
equity, although the above graph suggests the historical conditions
at Boulder represent the largest challenges on these matters.
The HSC faculty is quite different from the three general campuses,
and a comparison, such as above, may not be helpful in interpreting
their historical concerns.<BR>

<P>
Retirement is also a significant compensation issue for the campuses.
The age of the faculty and the expected rate of retirements will
have a substantial affect on financial planning; both for cost
reduction through attrition and cost increases through the hiring
differentials in units where entering assistant professors command
salaries as high as some retiring full professors.<BR>

<P>
Market
<P>
Although compensation is not set by using a national salary standard,
it is useful to review the University's relative position to the
market or competition. Each year comparisons of salaries by rank
are made with similar institutions around the country to evaluate
the University's competitive position in retaining and recruiting
top faculty. Although there are significant differences by campus
as a general statement, salaries are clustered around the peer
average with assistant professors faring relatively better than
average and full professors relatively worse.<BR>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="peersal.gif"><FONT SIZE=2><br>
Note: HSC salaries are from the School of Medicine<p><BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
Another measure of relative competitiveness is the number of faculty
who choose to leave the University for other institutions. A review
of this information and a look at the types of universities they
are going to would be helpful in gauging both the quality of the
University's faculty and competitiveness in the market. A preliminary
review of this data for FY 1995-96 is currently underway.<BR>

<P>
Performance
<P>
How individual and the collective faculty are evaluated for salary
increases is a point of annual debate on each of the campuses.
Everything from changing the traditional 40%/40%/20% split to
performance goals for units rather than individuals is being discussed.
The Board of Regents has stated that merit is the only criteria
for awarding salary increases but the details of defining and
measuring merit is determined by the campuses.<BR>

<P>
Ability to Pay
<P>
In recent years, it has been finances that have hampered faculty
salary increases. Difficult budget years have led to salary delays
and reduced salaries, despite the best intentions of the campuses
to reward meritorious faculty.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="salpool.gif"></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=2>Note: The averages of the five year salary
pools are as follows: UCB 2.96%; UCCS 3.44%; UCD 3.38%; HSC 3.60%.
In some cases, campuses may have chosen not to fund the entire
authorized amount of the salary increase.<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
As previously mentioned, faculty increases are a strategic priority
but once all mandatory costs have been budgeted are often left
as the budget balancing variable.<BR>

<P>
For the faculty involved in research, an issue often raised is
who should pay. Many faculty on the HSC are paid from sources
other than the general fund. At Boulder, the practice of putting
tenured faculty on soft-money salary has been discouraged. Fiscally
stringent budgets suggest this practice should be revisited. However
with federal research funding in jeopardy, there is a question
about what financial obligations would the institution incur for
tenured faculty who subsequently lose their soft funding. <BR>

<P>
Other Compensation
<P>
In addition to salary, there are other compensation items such
as: sabbaticals, summer research and teaching stipends, grant-based
compensation, and consulting.<BR>

<HR>

<H2><EM>Other Faculty Resource Issues<BR></EM></H2>

<P>
In addition to the issues already raised, there are other management
issues which affect the faculty resource, including:<BR>

<P>
The Time of Faculty-Teaching, Research, and Service
<P>
Faculty are hired as teachers and researchers, but in reality
evaluated in the world of academia more heavily as researchers.
This point was observed by two members of the Harvard faculty
in 1958 and it seems as relevant today as it was then. Despite
good empirical data that faculty engage in substantial teaching
and tend to view themselves primarily as teachers, one campus
after another during the past three decades has begun to place
increased emphasis on scholarly research.<BR>

<P>
Major national studies have revealed that even though teaching
is what legislators and administrators want faculty to concentrate
on the &quot;ascendancy within the teaching profession of a norm
or model that emphasizes the importance of research&quot; and
campus after campus has been moving aggressively to upgrade the
importance of scholarly productivity as a criterion for academic
personnel decisions. The trend would not be surprising if it were
only present at major research universities but it seems to have
spread to regional universities, state colleges, and the liberal
arts campuses with strong teaching orientations.<BR>

<P>
Campus administrators need to focus more attention on better ways
to assess faculty research performance. Traditionally, research
performance has been measured by counting publications. As one
professor on the Boulder campus has commented: &quot;It is very
simple. We look at all the publications. Then the committee gets
together and we have a gut reaction.&quot; While this may be an
accurate reflection of the sentiments of many faculty and administrators,
it also expresses a common na&iuml;vet&eacute; about the true
complexity of measuring performance. For example, do the performance
measures take into consideration the following issues: Are the
publications of high quality? Should research performance be measured
solely by publications or by such criteria as conference paper
presentations, citations to published works, or even aspects of
teaching? Should different measures be used to evaluate performance
in state colleges than those used in research universities? Do
the measures vary from one subject to another? <BR>

<P>
Similar to the measurement issue is the effect of increased research
orientation on faculty roles and activities. What impact does
the expectation of research have on faculty who see themselves
primarily as teachers? What role conflicts result for the faculty?
How can administrators improve and enhance research performance
of college teachers? Recommendations need to be compiled so that
administrators can adequately address the changing climate toward
research.<BR>

<P>
Post-tenure Faculty Evaluation
<P>
The issue of post tenure faculty evaluation, or review, arose
in the 1980's in part from the impending elimination of the mandatory
retirement age for tenured faculty and the associated specter
of elderly professors continuing to work though they are no longer
productive. Another impetus is the national movement toward assessing
the effectiveness of higher education. As higher education moves
into the next century greater attention will be focused not only
on pre-tenure faculty but also will encompass the evaluation of
post-tenure performance and vitality.<BR>

<P>
Obviously, this issue is not popular among faculty. &quot;Post-tenure
review raises hackles among college faculty and their professional
associations&quot; such as the American Association of University
Professors (AAUP). Faculty believe that this issue arises because
another university constituency (regents, administration or legislators)
have placed it on the table.<BR>

<P>
Some of the objections stem from the belief that periodic, formal
evaluation of faculty is unnecessary because aspects are in place
through promotional reviews, annual salary reviews, the record
of success in obtaining external funding for research projects,
teaching evaluations, and so forth. Some faculty and their professional
associations such as the AAUP believe that post-tenure reviews
will bring little benefit, would chill creativity and collegial
relationships, and could possibly threaten academic freedom.<BR>

<P>
The purpose of this section is not to question the current beliefs
of the AAUP and CU professors but point out that if a post-tenure
review process is carefully thought out and developed, it can
be a catalyst for faculty development and vitality. To ensure
that this process would support faculty development, several measures
could be developed:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>The purpose of a review should be to provide information that
will assist career development.
<LI>Summative post-tenure review is inconsistent with the philosophy
of faculty development and would likely be perceived as a threat
to the tenure contract.
<LI>Faculty must be involved in the design of the program and
in the evaluation process itself.
<LI>The institutional research unit on campus can provide design
consultation and expertise in support of the development and implementation
of the system and it should address needs for research on post-tenure
review programs. Multiple sources of input to the evaluation process
are needed, also agreement on the criteria to be assessed and
the standards to be set.
<LI>A formative post-tenure evaluation should be sensitive to
life-course aspects of the faculty career. Older faculty will
have somewhat different interests, priorities, and plans than
faculty who are just getting established.
<LI>It will serve little purpose to undertake systematic post-tenure
reviews and risk engendering cynicism if the linkage between the
review process and institutional rewards and resources is not
effectively wrought.
</OL>

<HR>

<H2><EM>Hidden Costs Of Part-Time Faculty<BR></EM></H2>

<P>
A major development in higher education during the past 25 years
has been the growth in the number of part-time (or adjunct) faculty.
The number of instructors who teach only one or two courses a
year has increased to the point where part-time faculty at some
institutions outnumber the full-time tenure-track professors.
A recent national survey found that &quot;on average, about 27
percent of the part-time employees are assigned to cover about
20% of the educational program.&quot; They are anything but ancillary
to many institutions' teaching missions.<BR>

<P>
The reasons for augmenting the full-time faculty with part-time
faculty are numerous. Part-time faculty enrich a college's academic
offerings by drawing upon the expertise of practitioners. They
support core curriculum courses, writing courses, and foreign
languages. Part-time faculty also allow deans to support fledgling
programs until enrollments are sufficient to warrant full-time
appointment. Lastly, part-time faculty conserve instructional
dollars.<BR>

<P>
Conserving instructional dollars is often the prime consideration
as many universities face reductions in their budgets. Academic
administrators tend to see the use of part-time faculty as an
economic bargain. Unfortunately, this bargain can turn into a
costly experience. The growing cost of unemployment benefits for
part-time faculty could well undermine the supposed economic advantages
of employing them. Increasing numbers of part-time faculty are
filing and receiving unemployment benefits when their services
are no longer needed. It is the employing college or university
that must pay these benefits. Some part time faculty have become
adept at using unemployment benefits to supplement their income
in those months when they are not teaching. At a few urban institutions
the money being paid out in unemployment benefits is beginning
to approach the total money being paid in compensation for part-time
teaching faculty. Part-time faculty have to be employed for only
one quarter to be eligible for unemployment benefits for up to
26 weeks of the rest of the year.<BR>
<BR>

<H2><EM>For Further Discussion:<BR></EM></H2>

<UL>
<LI>How can the campuses better manage their faculty resources,
without harming their competitive position in the market?
<LI>Can the campuses afford to attract and keep the quality of
faculty they desire, given the limited financial resources available?
<LI>Would an early retirement plan help or hurt CU financially?
<LI>How should CU proceed with the issue of post tenure review?

<P>
The years ahead may be the most financially difficult for American
universities, especially for Colorado because of Amendment 1 limitations.

<FONT COLOR="000044">The Office of University Budgets plans and coordinates the University-wide budget and capital construction processes.  The Office also makes recommendations to the Board of Regents on budgetary issues and assesses the fiscal impact on the University of proposed and pending legislation .  The Budget Office works closely with the campus budget officers, the Office of University Relations, the system-wide faculty budget committee, the facilities planners, the Colorado Commission on Higher Education (CCHE), and the state legislature particularly the joint budget committee and the capital development committee.  The mission of the Office of University Budgets is to provide these services University-wide in an efficient, effective, and timely manner.<p>

<CENTER><h2><FONT COLOR="000044"> University Enrollment Management Plan<BR>
Executive Summary</FONT></h2>
<img src="color_strip.gif"><P></CENTER>
<FONT COLOR="000044">
Projections indicating significant enrollment increases over the next decade have made it necessary to develop a University-wide management plan for enrollment growth.  Current projections indicate that the University of Colorado will see a 24% increase in headcount enrollment over the next ten years.<p>
<br>
Resident headcount enrollment could increase by 30%, with nonresident enrollment declining slightly, during this time period.  If these projections hold true, the University would see an increase in resident FTE(1) of approximately 8,500.  At an average total current cost of $8,300(2) per FTE, an additional $70.5 million annually will be needed after 2004 to support enrollment growth.  This represents a 17% increase over the 1994-95 state-appropriated budget.  Projected construction to meet enrollment demands will cost approximately $320 million over the next ten years.<p>
<HR>
Due to the projected costs of funding increased enrollment, creativity and efficiency have played important roles in developing policy goals and management strategies.  The following are University-wide goals for enrollment management:<p>
<br>
<strong>Goal 1:</strong>  Manage enrollment growth through a combination of quality, accountability, and flexibility.<p>
<br>
<strong>Goal 2:</strong>  Emphasize current campus markets in Colorado for first-time college students, transfers, and graduate and professional education as the primary focus for enrollment planning.<p>
<br>
<strong>Goal 3:</strong>  Maximize resource use through efficiency and productivity improvements while recognizing that the proposed enrollment growth will require significant growth in available resources.<p>
<br>
<strong>Goal 4:</strong>  Apply new technological approaches to service delivery, increasing productivity, improving on/near-campus instructional quality, and meeting market demands.<p>
<br>
<strong>Goal 5:</strong>  Within the context of enrollment management, continue to articulate and implement campus- and University-wide diversity goals.<p>
<br>
These goals were developed through an examination of external and internal factors.  External influences included state enrollment projections, state demographic changes, economic projections, and state priorities.  Internal factors included Regental priorities, current campus strategies, individual campus planning assumptions, and campus enrollment projections.<p>
<HR>
The enrollment management strategies primarily address the potential increases in the traditional college student market since that is the area of greatest projected increase.  Strategies addressing graduate and professional education focus on programmatic changes related to market influences.  The management strategies also reflect the specific needs of each campus.<p>
<br>
Every effort is being made to accommodate enrollment growth without sacrificing the quality of the CU educational experience.  The successful implementation of the enrollment management plan requires the commitment and cooperation of every part of the University, as well as of the State of Colorado, to maintain and enhance CU's quality as enrollment increases.<p>
<HR>
<dfn>(1) FTE, Full-Time Equivalent, is a representation of full-time students based on the assumption that a full-time student enrolls in 15 credit hours per semester.</dfn><p>
<br>
<dfn>(2) All dollar amounts in this report are quoted in 1995 dollars.  The average cost of $8,300 represents the general fund allocation plus tuition at the three general campuses for FY95.  The FTE calculation also does not include the Health Sciences Center.</dfn><p>

It is becoming increasingly clear that the University of Colorado is entering a new era of fundamental change in higher education.  As in the nineteenth century, unprecedented social and technological change is driving societal demands for a new vision of education.  Even with all the technological advances and educational improvements that the University has seen, we know that we have only begun to experience the changes in learning the twenty-first century will bring.  It is time to think seriously about how the University of Colorado system with its faculty can respond, innovate, and provide educational leadership.  It is time to think more seriously about revamping our entire pedagogical paradigm.  The following goals provide a direction and a measurement process that will help meet the needs of a changing society.<P>

<hr>
Funding for these system initiatives will come from three sources.  Approximately $1.4 million of incremental state general funds have been targeted for the evolution of these goals.  The campuses will match these new general fund dollars on a dollar-for-dollar basis from incremental tuition revenue or from reallocation of their existing base budgets.  <P>
<BR>
Finally, up to $1.0 million in one-time funds from University treasury earnings will be used to supplement the above funding sources.  Development of performance indicators specifically tied to these goals will be developed in the coming months with the assistance of campus administrators and faculty.<P><br>

<CENTER><h2><FONT COLOR="000044">Proposed Resource Allocation Guidelines<BR>
FY 1996-97</FONT></h2>
<img src="color_strip.gif"><P></CENTER>
<FONT COLOR="000044">
<P>
The following guidelines will be used to determine the allocation of incremental funds among the campuses for FY 1996-97.  While the guidelines may be useful in a multi-year context, the specific factors may need to be adjusted annually to account for the University's changing environment.  Specific factors for tuition rate increases or inflation adjustments will be based on a combination of State and University policy.  These factors will be initiated by the President's Office and reviewed with the campuses, faculty governance, and the Board of Regents prior to incorporating them into the funding model.  The following guidelines are intended to be applicable within normal ranges of revenue growth and decline.  Revenue shortfalls of major proportions for any campus, i.e. greater than 10%, will need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.  There is no intended prioritization among the following principles as all of them will come into play during each budget cycle.<P>
<HR>
<OL>
<LI>Resource allocation decisions at the System Office will be limited to incremental State general funds appropriated by the State Legislature, investment earnings from the University Treasury and tuition rate increases at each of the campuses.  Other earned revenue including tuition revenue will remain with the campus.*<P>
<LI>Allocation of incremental State general funds will take into account each campus' unique ability to generate tuition revenue, given existing student markets and State policy regarding tuition rate increases.  Projected tuition revenue will be a factor in calculating the distribution of the incremental State general funds to the campuses.  A discount factor may be applied to projected tuition revenue to recognize the campus efforts and risks associated with generating tuition revenue.<P>
<LI>Incremental revenue derived from tuition rates specifically exempted by the State Legislature from the overall tuition cap will remain outside the allocation model, i.e., these incremental tuition dollars will not reduce a campus' claim on State general funds.<P>
<LI>The resource base for all campuses will be adjusted annually for inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  The CPI rate may be discounted in the allocation model to &quot;free up&quot; resources to address other policy goals contained in this document.<P>
<LI>A performance fund will be created to encourage each campus to implement its strategic plan through initiating new programs, strengthening existing programs or achieving significant cost savings in delivering programs.  State policy objectives specified in SB-136 and related legislation that encourage performance funding will be recognized in the University funding model to the extent that the State performance goals reinforce those specified by the University.<P>
<LI>Enrollment growth, student mix, or enrollment decline will be recognized in the allocation model.  To the extent that enrollment funds are allocated to the University as part of the statewide funding formula, those funds will be recognized in the allocation model according to individual campus performance regarding enrollment.<P>
<LI>Indirect cost recoveries on sponsored grants and contracts will remain with the campus which earns those recoveries.  Any shortfall of budgeted indirect cost recoveries will be the responsibility of the campus where the shortfall occurs.<P>
<LI>The University will phase out the small campus base supplements provided by interest earnings on the Treasury over a four three-year period beginning in FY 1995-96.  (the base budget supplements currently stand at $450,000 for CU-Denver and $375,000 for CU-Colorado Springs.)  The phase-out will be accomplished by an off-the-top allocation of State general funds and a simultaneous reduction in the transfer of funds from Treasury funds.<P>
<LI>Interest earnings on the University's Treasury provide a valuable source of investment funds to achieve University-wide priorities.  Priorities for these investment funds should be set in consultation with governance groups as part of the University budget process.  Past examples have included undergraduate education, faculty development, technology transfer and strategic fields of research such as global change and space technology.<P>
<LI>The proxy rate on invested cash balances will be set each year by the Treasurer and Vice President for Budget and Finance in consultation with the campuses based on prevailing market rates, projected cash balances and on-going University commitments against these funds.  Proxy rates should be targeted at levels high enough to encourage improved cash management by the campus units.<P>
<LI>The Board of Regents' Office and Internal Auditor's Office will receive an allocation of State general funds commensurate with their programmatic needs.<P>
<LI>Annual increases in the CU System Office budget will be based on strategic goals and objectives discussed with the campuses, reviewed by the President's Executive Committee and approved by the Board of Regents as part of the budgeting process.  The CU System Office budget will continue to be funded primarily through a chargeback mechanism known as the intercampus cost allocation (ICCA).  The basis for the campus chargeback is a combination of service usage statistics and relative size of each campus budget.  Targeted annual increases in the System Office budget will not exceed the average growth in the campus operating budgets except for major initiatives funded through the System Office.<P>
<LI>The base budgets of the four campuses will be monitored periodically with respect to comparable institutions having similar characteristics, such as size of student body, quality and type of program offerings, program mix and research funding.  Serious disparities of funding for a particular campus with its comparison group will be acknowledged in future funding allocations.

* It is recognized that the prioritization of capital construction requests and the subsequent allotment of debt capacity are also resource allocation decisions, but those are dealt with in the capital budgeting process.<P></font>

<FONT COLOR="000044">
The following represent the budgetary achievements from fiscal year 1995-96.<P>
<UL><P>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://spot.colorado.edu/~lbauer/aprvdbdgt.html">proposed revenue budget</A> (all sources of operating funds) for the University of Colorado for FY 1996-97 totals $1,046.6 million.  This represents an increase of $72.3 million, or a 7.4% increase, over the current year's revenue budget.  Next year's budget is constructed around four overarching goals which taken together will move the University toward the <A HREF="http://spot.colorado.edu/~lbauer/TLenviron.html">creation of a "Total Learning Environment."</A>  As envisioned by President Buechner, the University needs:<P>
<UL><LI>To support innovations in learning that include undergraduate and graduate programs<P>
<LI>To develop a student-centered enrollment management program and process<P>
<LI>To apply technological innovations in learning and management<P>
<LI>To enhance human, capital, financial assets and organizational infrastructure</UL><P>
<LI>The state appropriated budget, which includes state tax support, tuition, and student fees, increased $23.1 million, or  5.3%.  The state tax support increased $9.4 million, or 5.4%, while tuition and fee revenue is projected to increase $11.0 million, representing a 4.9% increase over the University's estimated tuition and fee budget for the current year.<P>
<LI>The University is within the legislative intent for tuition increases, which stated that the average tuition rate increases across the University for residents not exceed 2.3% and 4.3% for non-residents.<P>
<LI>The proposed University expenditure and transfers budget for FY 1996-97 totals $1,043.2 million, or an increase of $78.1 million, over the current year's expenditure budget.  Expenditure categories that have increased significantly include research (up $27.7 million for a 15.6% increase), public service (up $5.5 million), and student financial aid (up $15.8 million for a 15.6% increase).  In total, the University will be providing more than $117 million in grants, work study assistance and loans to its 44,000 students across the four-campus system.<P>
<LI>Each campus is recommending faculty and staff salary increases within the Board of Regents' policy passed at its April meeting, establishing a range of salary increases from 2.0% to 3.8%.

<TITLE>Human Resources Vision Statement</TITLE>

<BODY><P>

<BASEFONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN=Center></P>


<BR>
<P ALIGN=Center>Draft October 1996<BR><P>


<P ALIGN=Center><P ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=+1>The University of Colorado</FONT><BR><P>


<FONT SIZE=+2><P ALIGN=Center>A Vision Statement for Human Resources</P></FONT><BR>
<P ALIGN=Center><IMG SRC="Neat_LINE.GIF"</P><P>


The University's vision for human resources is based on the recognition that these resources are the most critical assets for meeting our role and mission as a university. The University is a community that works best when the institution and its faculty and staff have shared values and goals, and endeavor to meet fully their responsibilities.<BR><P>


In order that the University's human resources are best able to support, over time, the University's role and mission, CU must have ways of organizing and delivering work that are appropriate and consistent with a
rapidly changing set of expectations for the University. These may include new paradigms about service delivery, our relationship to our students, academic and administrative systems, the nature of work at the University and organizational structures.<BR><P>


Our human resource systems must therefore be highly adaptable to changes in those paradigms that result from changes in CU's demographics, economics, internal demands, increased public scrutiny, technology, and competitive environment.<BR><P>


As relates to human resources, the University therefore has the responsibility to:<P>

* define organization goals and objectives<BR>
* insure an effective structure to deliver programs and services<BR>
* hire and retain highly qualified people<BR>
* reward these people for their performance through fair compensation<BR>
* promote learning and professional development<BR>
* openly communicate timely and accurate information on institutional goals,issues, and programs.<BR><P>


For their part, faculty and staff have the responsibility to:<P>

* understand their role within the University<BR>
* perform at an outstanding level, with diligence and integrity<BR>
* promote and further the goals of the University<BR>
* identify new approaches to accomplish the work of the University<BR>
* participate actively in shared governance.<BR><P>


Together, to maintain and advance the community, the University and its
faculty and staff will:<P>

* strive to create a diverse workforce marked by understanding, mutual respect, trust and commitment, in a safe environment, and free from harassment<BR>
* create trust by communicating mutual expectations<BR>
* continually evaluate results to assure high levels of productivity.<BR><P>
<P><P>
<BR>

<FONT COLOR="00004F">This draft Vision Statement for Human Resources was prepared by CU's Human Resources Policy Group (HRPG). The vision statement attempts to articulate a common understanding about the responsibilities and the relationship among faculty, staff, and the University as an organization. In December, HRPG intends to submit to the President an HR vision statement which will serve as a cornerstone to HR initiatives within the Total Learning Environment.<P>


HRPG invites comments from the campuses and from faculty and staff council groups. Please send comments by November 25 to:<BR><P>

<I>If you</I> were a participant in the University of Colorado Qualified Retirement Plan prior to January 1, 1993, and <I>wish to continue your retirement investments with the funding vehicles offered by TIAA-CREF in the University of Colorado Retirement 

Plan, no enrollment or transfer forms are required.</I> Your contributions to retirement will continue to be forwarded to TIAA-CREF for your retirement.

<P>
<I>If you</I> are a new employee eligible for enrollment in the CU Retirement Plan or are a participant in the University Qualified Retirement Plan and <I>wish to redirect your retirement contributions or transfer your retirement fund accumulation</I> fro

m TIAA-CREF to funding vehicles offered by Fidelity Investments and/or Vanguard, please <I>contact your campus Benefits Office</I> for the appropriate forms. 

<P>
<I>Important: Eligible participants for the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan who elect to have all or some portion of their monthly retirement contributions or retirement accumulation with TIAA-CREF directed to Fidelity Investments 

funds or The Vanguard Group funds, or who elect payment methods at retirement outside of the lifetime annuity, must sign a Release and Waiver form relinquishing all rights to the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan. Read </I>Section D<

I> of this booklet and contact your campus Benefits Office. </I>

<P>
Beginning January 1, 1993, the University of Colorado will offer eligible faculty and University administrators a new CU Retirement Plan. The new program reflects a departure in design and philosophy from the University's previous retirement plan, which o

ffered only TIAA-CREF (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association -- College Retirement Equities Funds). The new retirement plan incorporates two new fund sponsors, Fidelity Investments and The Vanguard Group, in addition to TIAA-CREF. 

<P>
You will now have the opportunity to select funds offered by a single fund sponsor or mix investment funds among several fund sponsors. The new plan will allow you more flexibility in designing a well-balanced and diversified retirement portfolio. Each of

 the three fund sponsors will offer six funds for a total of eighteen fund combinations. Each fund selected for the new program is unique in its approach to the kinds of investments it makes and how it manages those investments. 

<P>
The new CU Retirement Plan allows you freedom of choice within the available options to design a personalized retirement portfolio suiting your needs. As a result, many of the responsibilities for retirement investment will shift from the University to yo

u and your family. You will be required to take an active role in the design, maintenance, and administration of your portfolio. This includes the responsibility for timely processing of application forms and required signatures for participation in the n

ew plan. For the majority of transactions, you will be in direct contact with fund sponsors to initiate changes in your portfolio. <I>If you are satisfied with the previous retirement plan offering TIAA-CREF funds only, you do not need to make any changes

 to remain fully invested.</I>

<P>
The University will act as the administrator of the CU Retirement Plan. In this capacity, the University will verify the operation of the plan under Internal Revenue Service Code 401(a), perform actuarial analysis for the determination of contribution rat

es to reach normal retirement, and ensure the timely distribution of funds to the specified fund sponsors.

<P>
Although the University's administrative role is important, the primary role of the University will be to provide you and your family with information regarding the investment of retirement funds. For reasons of liability, University benefits personnel ca

nnot act as individual financial advisors, but they will provide materials on the principles of retirement investment strategies, which you may use as a foundation for designing your retirement portfolio.

<P>
IMPORTANT NOTE:
<P>
If you plan to retire at the end of the academic year (May) and have a 9 month appointment but have been receiving your salary over 12 months (12 pay), it is strongly recommended that you change your pay option to be paid over the 9 (9 pay) months of the 
academic year. By having your salary paid over 9 months you should receive all of your 9 month appointment pay by May and your TIAA premiums will be paid by your retirement date. To change from the 12 pay option to the 9 pay option see your departmental p
ayroll liaison at the beginning of your retirement academic year.
<P>
NINE MONTHS PRIOR TO PROJECTED RETIREMENT DATE:
<P>
1. Contact the Department of Compensation Services Employee Benefits Office at 492-8053 for information. All retirement discussions remain confidential until you are ready to discuss retirement plans with your department head.
<P>
2. Contact the TIAA-CREF New York Office for notification and application materials at 1-800-842-2777. You may request a calculation of estimated annuity payments and options. Once you receive this packet of information, the TIAA-CREF Denver office has in
dividual counselors available to review the materials with you and answer questions. Call 861-8801 for an appointment.
<P>
3. If you are 62 or older, contact the Social Security Administration at 1-800-772-1213 or in Boulder at 443-5624 for notification and an estimation of benefits. The Employee Benefits Office has the "Request for Earnings and Benefit Estimate Statement" fo
r you to send to Social Security. You may begin receiving a reduced social security benefit at age 62 or full benefits at age 65. It is very important that you review your work history on file with Social Security for accuracy.
<P>
4. Review the Faculty Handbook (Part Seven) on retirement benefits especially Tables I and II (pp. 8 - 9) which list years of service and age requirements to receive full retirement benefits.
<P>
5. Begin discussions with your Department Chair and/or Dean to plan your retirement date.
<P>
SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO RETIREMENT DATE:
<P>
1. Make an appointment with the Social Security Office to set up your final paperwork for social security benefits and, if you are 65 or older, Medicare Insurance. Please keep in mind that it takes approximately three months for this paperwork to be proce
ssed.
<P>
2. Make final decisions about TIAA-CREF payout options. Complete TIAA-CREF paperwork and mail directly to TIAA- CREF. Keep in mind that TIAA-CREF will require final premium information from the Department of Compensation Services.
<P>
TWO MONTHS PRIOR TO RETIREMENT DATE:
<P>
1. Finalize vacation and/or sick leave accumulations with your department, if applicable. Unused earned vacation time will be paid on the final paycheck.
<P>
2. Review the "Weaving a Partnership" Retiree Health and Life Insurance book.
<P>
3. Contact the Employee Benefits Office at 492-8053 to schedule an appointment to complete a retiree application for health and life insurance.

<B>Points to Consider When Investing<BR>
</B>
<P>
The variety of investment offerings
is designed to suit different types of investors. Before you authorize
a payroll deduction for any investment, you should acquaint yourself
with the options and decide what your investment philosophy will
be. Your choices range from fixed accounts, with guaranteed minimum
returns, to aggressive growth funds, which may be quite volatile.
In making your decision, consider:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
1. <B>Diversification </B>&quot;Putting
all your eggs in one basket&quot; is generally considered an unwise
long&#173;term investment strategy. Diversification means spreading
your money around several types of investments because different
investments may perform well in different circumstances. For example,
instead of putting all of your money into a single stock fund,
you might want to divide your investments among stock, bond, and
money market funds. You can also choose among different types
of such funds, depending upon how much risk you want to take,
what part of the world you want to invest in, and what sector
of the economy you think will do well or you would like to support.
With proper diversification, when one part of your portfolio is
doing poorly, another part may be doing well enough to make up
for it. While no one can accurately predict market activity, diversification
will probably minimize losses.<BR>

2. <B>Risk vs. Return </B>A fundamental
axiom of investing is &quot;the greater the potential return,
the greater the risk.&quot; The vast majority of funds available
through this program do not have guaranteed returns, which means
that they may lose money- your money. A fund that consistently
returns 15% year after year is probably riskier than a fund that
consistently returns half that amount. This does not necessarily
mean that you should avoid the better performing fund. Just be
aware of how much risk you are taking and how much risk you are
comfortable with when you make an investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
3. <B>Long&#173;Term vs. Short&#173;Term
Investment </B>Over the long term, the stock market has always
risen, even after major declines. Because of this, a falling market
cycle probably should not worry an investor who is not going to
need access to his or her money for the next twenty years. However,
in the short run, markets have fallen and will continue to fall
periodically. Therefore, a person who is going to retire in one
year may choose not to risk the possibility of a market drop.
The amount of time over which you are investing may influence
the amount of risk you are willing to accept and the types of
investment decisions you make. Remember that, even though the
stock market has risen over the long term, no one can guarantee
what it will do in the future.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
4. <B>Inflation </B>A guaranteed return
for the next 20 years means very little unless you also know what
the inflation rate will be over that same period. Your real return
will be the difference between what your investment is earning
and the inflation rate. If your investment is making less than
inflation is taking away, you are losing money. Every investment
involves risk, and over the long term, inflation can represent
a very real risk. When making investment decisions, you should
always keep inflation in mind.<BR>

<P>
<B>Points to Consider When Investing<BR>
</B>
<P>
5. <B>Administrative Fees </B>All funds
levy administrative fees, but some fees are higher than others.
High administrative fees will effectively reduce your investment
return. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires investment
companies to list all fees in the beginning of the fund prospectus.
You should analyze the impact of these fees on your potential
investment before making investment decisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
6. <B>Loads</B></FONT>
<P>
A load is a sales commission. A front
load is taken at the time of purchase.</FONT>
<P>
A rear load is taken at the time of
withdrawal or transfer of funds. You</FONT>
<P>
should never make an investment decision
without taking into considera</FONT>
<P>
tion of all administrative fees and
loads.<BR>

Overview
</FONT>
<P>
The voluntary tax&#173;deferred investment programs
offered through the University of Colorado provide an excellent
way for you to invest money to supplement your retirement income
while reducing your current taxable income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Participating in a retirement plan (such as the Public
Employees' Retirement Association-PERA, and the Teachers Insurance
and Annuity Association&#173;College Retirement Equities Fund-TIAA&#173;CREF)
may not achieve your desired retirement income goals. We strongly
urge you to consult a financial planner or your retirement&#173;plan
company to determine what resources you will need when you retire.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
A tax&#173;deferred investment enables you to:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>reduce your taxable income by the amount you are
investing. Both principal and interest on your investment are
entirely tax deferred until you retire. Furthermore, because you
are not paying taxes on these earnings or interest, your funds
compound more rapidly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>choose from hundreds of mutual funds, variable annuities,
and fixed annuities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>invest by payroll deduction.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>take advantage of &quot;dollar cost averaging.&quot;
You invest a certain amount of money each month, no matter what
the stock, bond, or money markets are doing. You buy more shares
when prices are low, fewer when prices are high. Your average
purchase price will nominally be less than the average price of
the shares. (This does not guarantee that you will not lose money,
but dollar cost averaging does minimize some of the risk of investing.)
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>supplement your current retirement plan to increase
your retirement income.<BR>

<P>
The University of Colorado has a number of different
types of tax&#173;deferred investments available. They all allow
you to defer considerably more money than if you were to invest
in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). There is no restriction
against having a tax&#173;deferred investment through the University
and an IRA. You should consult a financial planner to determine
how much money you can legally tax defer to each.<BR>

Employees may choose from many different investment
vehicles, from conservative fixed or money market accounts to
aggressive growth stock funds. Investment companies use different
terms to describe their funds. The terms listed below are some
of the most popular, but their use is by no means consistent.
What the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>calls a &quot;balanced fund,&quot;
<I>Business Week </I>may call an &quot;income fund.&quot; The
fund prospectus will describe how the fund actually invests money.
<I>Always obtain and read the prospectus before investing.<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>1. Fixed Annuity </FONT>This is an account
with a life insurance company that usually guarantees a certain
return on your principal for a given period of time. However,
the guarantee is backed only by the financial stability of the
insurance company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>2. Mutual Fund</FONT>
<P>
A mutual fund pools the money of a group of investors
to purchase stocks,</FONT>
<P>
bonds, or other securities. A mutual fund is managed
by a professional</FONT>
<P>
investment company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Balanced Fund </FONT></B>A balanced
fund diversifies by investing in some combination of stocks, bonds
and/or money market instruments to obtain the highest return while
minimizing risk in fluctuating markets.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Growth Fund </FONT></B>A growth fund
is usually a common stock fund whose primary goal is capital gains.
When the value of a stock goes from $10 to $11, the owner of the
stock makes a &quot;capital gain&quot; of $1. These funds typically
invest in companies that reinvest most or all of their earnings
in expansion, research, or development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Income Fund</FONT></B>
<P>
An income fund focuses on generating current income
for the investor in</FONT>
<P>
the form of dividend and interest payments.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Growth and Income Fund </FONT></B>A
growth and income fund attempts to generate both long&#173;term
growth and steady income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>International and Global Funds </FONT></B>International
funds invest only in foreign securities. Global funds invest in
foreign <I>and </I>United States securities. Both types of funds
may invest in any type of foreign security. In addition to the
normal conditions that affect the value of funds, international
and global fund values may be affected by currency exchange rates.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Money Market Fund </FONT></B>This
is a mutual fund that seeks maximum current income through investment
in securities that usually mature in less than one year. These
include negotiable certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury bills.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Sector Fund</FONT></B>
<P>
A sector fund is a type of mutual fund that invests
in particular industries,</FONT>
<P>
such as precious metals, biotechnology, and energy.</FONT>

The amount of money you designate is deducted from your monthly
paycheck and sent to the investment company you have selected.
Your taxable income is reduced by the amount which you have invested.
The investment company will periodically send you statements to
update you on the&#173; performance of your investment.<BR>
</FONT>

<P>
<B>Tax Considerations<BR>
</B>
<P>
1. Maximum Exclusion Allowance</FONT>
<P>
The greatest amount of money the IRS will allow you
to tax defer in a tax-deferred investment is called your Maximum
Exclusion Allowance.
</FONT>
<P>
If you have more than one tax-deferred investment
or are participating in more than one type of plan, all plans
are combined to determine your Maximum Exclusion Allowance. Contributions
toward the University's mandatory retirement plans, such as TIAA-CREF
or PERA, are </FONT><I>not </FONT></I>considered
in determining your Maximum Exclusion Allowance. All University
and state of Colorado retirement plans, but not Social Security,
fall under Internal Revenue Code 401(a).). When discussing your
Maximum Exclusion Allowance with an investment company, be sure
to explain that your mandatory retirement plan is a 401(a) qualified
retirement plan.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The amount that you can tax defer to a tax-deferred
investment </FONT><I>will be reduced </FONT></I>by
your participation in the CU-Flex plan, which excludes a portion
of your salary from taxation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
It is in your best interest to contact a representative
of your investment company in order to calculate a Maximum Exclusion 
Allowance. This will ensure that you do not exceed the annual maximum
investment. The investment companies mentioned in this brochure
have all agreed to make such calculations free of charge.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If your salary reduction to a tax-deferred investment
exceeds your Maximum Exclusion Allowance, you are liable for taxes
on the excess amount. You may also be subject to a tax penalty.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Compliance with the laws pertaining to Maximum
Exclusion Allowance is entirely your responsibility. The University
of Colorado assumes no responsibility for your failure to comply
with the applicable laws, including your failure to monitor your
own investments.<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
2. &quot;Catch-Up&quot;</FONT>
<P>
The 403(b)) and 457 plans have a special &quot;catch-up&quot;
provision that enables</FONT>
<P>
eligible employees to exceed the normal Maximum Exclusion
Allowance</FONT>
<P>
for a specified period of time. Your investment company
can help you</FONT>
<P>
determine your eligibility.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>3. Loans</FONT></B>
<P>
Federal regulations make it possible for the 403(b)(1)
life insurance compa</FONT>
<P>
nies and 401(k) plans to allow you to borrow money
from your account for</FONT>
<P>
certain reasons. See your investment company representative
for more</FONT>
<P>
information about this provision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
4. Withdrawals</FONT>
<P>
The Internal Revenue Code may require you to pay
taxes on early withdrawals of tax-deferred contributions. Regular
income tax plus a 10% penalty applies to withdrawals from 401(k)
and 403(b) accounts before age 59-1/2 or, if terminating, before
age 55. You pay only regular income tax on withdrawals from 457
plans. All three options permit cash withdrawal </FONT><I>only
</FONT></I>upon retirement, termination of employment,
or financial hardship.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Tax Considerations<BR>
</B>
<P>
5. <B>Tax Savings Illustrations </B>Tax-deferred
investments reduce your current year income taxes. You can save
more with a tax-deferred investment than with a savings account,
certificates of deposit, or other investments that are subject
to current year income taxation. The examples below show possible
income tax savings for a tax-deferred investment compared to a
savings account.

<P>
<B>Points to Consider When Investing<BR>
</B>
<P>
The variety of investment offerings
is designed to suit different types of investors. Before you authorize
a payroll deduction for any investment, you should acquaint yourself
with the options and decide what your investment philosophy will
be. Your choices range from fixed accounts, with guaranteed minimum
returns, to aggressive growth funds, which may be quite volatile.
In making your decision, consider:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
1. <B>Diversification </B>&quot;Putting
all your eggs in one basket&quot; is generally considered an unwise
long&#173;term investment strategy. Diversification means spreading
your money around several types of investments because different
investments may perform well in different circumstances. For example,
instead of putting all of your money into a single stock fund,
you might want to divide your investments among stock, bond, and
money market funds. You can also choose among different types
of such funds, depending upon how much risk you want to take,
what part of the world you want to invest in, and what sector
of the economy you think will do well or you would like to support.
With proper diversification, when one part of your portfolio is
doing poorly, another part may be doing well enough to make up
for it. While no one can accurately predict market activity, diversification
will probably minimize losses.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
2. <B>Risk vs. Return </B>A fundamental
axiom of investing is &quot;the greater the potential return,
the greater the risk.&quot; The vast majority of funds available
through this program do not have guaranteed returns, which means
that they may lose money- your money. A fund that consistently
returns 15% year after year is probably riskier than a fund that
consistently returns half that amount. This does not necessarily
mean that you should avoid the better performing fund. Just be
aware of how much risk you are taking and how much risk you are
comfortable with when you make an investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
3. <B>Long&#173;Term vs. Short&#173;Term
Investment </B>Over the long term, the stock market has always
risen, even after major declines. Because of this, a falling market
cycle probably should not worry an investor who is not going to
need access to his or her money for the next twenty years. However,
in the short run, markets have fallen and will continue to fall
periodically. Therefore, a person who is going to retire in one
year may choose not to risk the possibility of a market drop.
The amount of time over which you are investing may influence
the amount of risk you are willing to accept and the types of
investment decisions you make. Remember that, even though the
stock market has risen over the long term, no one can guarantee
what it will do in the future.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
4. <B>Inflation </B>A guaranteed return
for the next 20 years means very little unless you also know what
the inflation rate will be over that same period. Your real return
will be the difference between what your investment is earning
and the inflation rate. If your investment is making less than
inflation is taking away, you are losing money. Every investment
involves risk, and over the long term, inflation can represent
a very real risk. When making investment decisions, you should
always keep inflation in mind.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Points to Consider When Investing<BR>
</B>
<P>
5. <B>Administrative Fees </B>All funds
levy administrative fees, but some fees are higher than others.
High administrative fees will effectively reduce your investment
return. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires investment
companies to list all fees in the beginning of the fund prospectus.
You should analyze the impact of these fees on your potential
investment before making investment decisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
6. <B>Loads</B></FONT>
<P>
A load is a sales commission. A front
load is taken at the time of purchase.</FONT>
<P>
A rear load is taken at the time of
withdrawal or transfer of funds. You</FONT>
<P>
should never make an investment decision
without taking into considera</FONT>
<P>
tion of all administrative fees and
loads.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<A NAME="performance">
<B>Financial Performance</B>
<P>
The investment companies listed in this brochure have been approved for 
deductions through the payroll system of the University of Colorado, but 
the University does not give tax or investment advice and is not 
responsible for the financial performance of any investment or company. 
Past performance of an investment is not a guarantee of future 
performance.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Always read the company's prospectus
before making an investment decision.<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
There are a number of independent sources
available that rank investment options. These include, but are
not limited to, </FONT><I>Lipper Analytical
Services, Money </FONT></I>magazine,
</FONT><I>Forbes </FONT></I>magazine,
</FONT><I>Business Week, Consumer Reports,
Fortune </FONT></I>magazine, and </FONT><I>Mutual
Fund Values. </FONT></I>Most university
and public libraries subscribe to these publications.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Again, we suggest that you consult with
a financial planner if you have questions or need advice.</FONT>

Overview
</FONT>
<P>
The voluntary tax&#173;deferred investment programs
offered through the University of Colorado provide an excellent
way for you to invest money to supplement your retirement income
while reducing your current taxable income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Participating in a retirement plan (such as the Public
Employees' Retirement Association-PERA, and the Teachers Insurance
and Annuity Association&#173;College Retirement Equities Fund-TIAA&#173;CREF)
may not achieve your desired retirement income goals. We strongly
urge you to consult a financial planner or your retirement&#173;plan
company to determine what resources you will need when you retire.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
A tax&#173;deferred investment enables you to:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>reduce your taxable income by the amount you are
investing. Both principal and interest on your investment are
entirely tax deferred until you retire. Furthermore, because you
are not paying taxes on these earnings or interest, your funds
compound more rapidly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>choose from hundreds of mutual funds, variable annuities,
and fixed annuities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>invest by payroll deduction.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>take advantage of &quot;dollar cost averaging.&quot;
You invest a certain amount of money each month, no matter what
the stock, bond, or money markets are doing. You buy more shares
when prices are low, fewer when prices are high. Your average
purchase price will nominally be less than the average price of
the shares. (This does not guarantee that you will not lose money,
but dollar cost averaging does minimize some of the risk of investing.)
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<LI>supplement your current retirement plan to increase
your retirement income.<BR>

<P>
The University of Colorado has a number of different
types of tax&#173;deferred investments available. They all allow
you to defer considerably more money than if you were to invest
in an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). There is no restriction
against having a tax&#173;deferred investment through the University
and an IRA. You should consult a financial planner to determine
how much money you can legally tax defer to each.<BR>

<P>
Employees may choose from many different investment
vehicles, from conservative fixed or money market accounts to
aggressive growth stock funds. Investment companies use different
terms to describe their funds. The terms listed below are some
of the most popular, but their use is by no means consistent.
What the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>calls a &quot;balanced fund,&quot;
<I>Business Week </I>may call an &quot;income fund.&quot; The
fund prospectus will describe how the fund actually invests money.
<I>Always obtain and read the prospectus before investing.<BR>
</I></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>1. Fixed Annuity </FONT>This is an account
with a life insurance company that usually guarantees a certain
return on your principal for a given period of time. However,
the guarantee is backed only by the financial stability of the
insurance company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>2. Mutual Fund</FONT>
<P>
A mutual fund pools the money of a group of investors
to purchase stocks,</FONT>
<P>
bonds, or other securities. A mutual fund is managed
by a professional</FONT>
<P>
investment company.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Balanced Fund </FONT></B>A balanced
fund diversifies by investing in some combination of stocks, bonds
and/or money market instruments to obtain the highest return while
minimizing risk in fluctuating markets.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Growth Fund </FONT></B>A growth fund
is usually a common stock fund whose primary goal is capital gains.
When the value of a stock goes from $10 to $11, the owner of the
stock makes a &quot;capital gain&quot; of $1. These funds typically
invest in companies that reinvest most or all of their earnings
in expansion, research, or development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Income Fund</FONT></B>
<P>
An income fund focuses on generating current income
for the investor in</FONT>
<P>
the form of dividend and interest payments.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Growth and Income Fund </FONT></B>A
growth and income fund attempts to generate both long&#173;term
growth and steady income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>International and Global Funds </FONT></B>International
funds invest only in foreign securities. Global funds invest in
foreign <I>and </I>United States securities. Both types of funds
may invest in any type of foreign security. In addition to the
normal conditions that affect the value of funds, international
and global fund values may be affected by currency exchange rates.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Money Market Fund </FONT></B>This
is a mutual fund that seeks maximum current income through investment
in securities that usually mature in less than one year. These
include negotiable certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury bills.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Sector Fund</FONT></B>
<P>
A sector fund is a type of mutual fund that invests
in particular industries,</FONT>
<P>
such as precious metals, biotechnology, and energy.</FONT>

<CENTER><B>DENTAL CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
Dental coverage is included with CU Silver and is optional with CU Gold. If you have waived medical coverage, or have chosen a State of Colorado health plan, you can still elect the State of Colorado Dental Plan.

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;State of Colorado Dental Plan

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;No coverage

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">CU Dental Plan</FONT>

<P>
Delta Dental Plan of Colorado administers the CU dental plan. When you need dental care, you decide who to see and where to receive dental treatment. Your choices are:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Delta Preferred Option (DPO)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Delta Participating Dentists

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Nonparticipating Dentist

<P>
Of the three options available, Delta Preferred Option (DPO) provides the highest level of benefits. You always have the option of selecting a dentist who is a Nonparticipating dentist, but the cost of care will
be greater to you.   

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Delta Preferred Option (DPO)</FONT>

<P>
Under the DPO approach, you use a DPO provider at the time of service and qualify for the highest level of benefits under the plan. The plan pays 100% of preventive and diagnostic care with no deductible. After an annual $25 per member deductible, the pla

n then pays a percentage of other covered services. The comparison chart on p.13 shows the coverage and plan payments. In brief, the advantages of using a DPO dentist are:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;You receive the highest benefit available for all services.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The dentist will file claims for you.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Because the DPO dentists have agreed in advance to a schedule of benefits payments, you will have no excess out-of-pocket expense. You pay only the deductible and/or coinsurance applicable to the service received.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Delta Participating Dentists</FONT>

<P>
If you use a Delta Participating dentist, you will receive the standard level of benefits. The Plan pays 100% of preventive and diagnostic care with no deductible. Other covered services require a $50 per member annual deductible before benefits are paid.

 The percentage paid depends on the treatment and is shown on the comparison chart on p.13.

<P>
In brief, the advantages of using a Participating dentist are:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The dentist will file claims for you.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Because the dentist accepts Delta's reasonable and customary fee level, you will have no excess, out-of-&#009;&#009;pocket expense. You pay only the deductible and/or coinsurance applicable to the service received.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Nonparticipating Dentist</FONT>

<P>
If you select a nonparticipating dentist (one who is neither a Participating member of Delta Dental Plan nor a DPO dentist), you will receive the standard level of benefits which is based on Delta's reasonable and customary fee schedule. The plan pays 100

% of preventive and diagnostic care with no deductible. 

<P>
Because Delta's reasonable and customary amounts are lower than what a non-DPO, Nonparticipating dentist may charge, your out-of-pocket costs may be greater than if you used a DPO or Delta Participating dentist. This is because you will be responsible for

 paying any amount above reasonable and customary amounts. In addition, you have to file your own claims.

<P>
See the comparison chart below for the payment percentages.

<P>
This chart shows the difference in benefits payable when you see a Delta Preferred Option (DPO) dentist, a Delta Participating dentist and a Nonparticipating dentist.

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">No Dental Coverage</FONT>

<P>
If you elect CU Silver health coverage, you automatically receive dental plan coverage. With CU Gold health coverage, you may elect or waive dental coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">State of Colorado Dental Plan</FONT>

<P>
If you enroll in a State of Colorado health plan, or waive health coverage, you are eligible to enroll in the state dental plan through United Dental Care of Colorado (UDC). You and your eligible dependents currently enrolled in the State of Colorado Prud

ential dental plan will automatically be enrolled in the out-of-network coverage in the new UDC dental plan. Each family member must select a UDC Primary Care Dentist (PCD) from the enclosed Directory of Dentists to receive in-network coverage. Each membe

r of your family can have a different PCD or the same PCD.

<P>
The State pays the premium for the employee's dental coverage. The employee pays the cost for dental coverage for dependents age five and older. Dependents under age five are free, but must be listed on your enrollment form to receive coverage.

<P>
UDC offers freedom of choice and a high level of coverage. Here is how the plan works:

<P>
* You need to select a PCD, within the managed care dental network, for yourself, your spouse, and your eligible dependents. To change your PCD, call UDC Customer Service by the 15th of the month for the change to become effective the first of the followi

ng month. When you need care, you can choose to use your network PCD and specialists referred by your PCD, or you can choose out-of-network dental providers.

<P>
* If you use your PCD and network specialists referred by your PCD, you will receive a higher in-network level of benefits with no deductibles or annual benefit maximums.

<P>
* If you received a specialty referral from Prudential and treatment was 
NOT started, a new referral must be submitted by your newly selected PCD 
for 1997. If treatment WAS started, refer to the "Pre-Existing 
Conditions" section below.

<P>

<UL>
<CENTER>Pre-Existing Conditions</CENTER>
<BR>
Charges for services and supplies received before January 1, 1997 are the 
responsibility of the current dental carrier, Prudential.  Services or 
supplies for employees who were <I>not enrolled</I> prior to January 1, 
1997, will <I>not</I> be the responsibility of Prudential or UDC.  For 
employees covered by Prudential prior to January 1, 1997, orthodontia 
services will be coordinated between Prudential and UDC.
<P>
For any dental services in 1996 which will be carried into 1997, please 
call UDC Customer Servuce, 1-800-409-8403, for information regarding 
benefit coverage for the services.
</UL>

<P>
* If you are currently receiving in-network specialty care (including orthodontia) under the State of Colorado Dental plan, a new referral must be submitted by your newly selected PCD for 1997.

<P>
* If you use out of network dental providers, your eligible services, except for preventative visits and exams, are subject to an out-of-network calendar year deductible of $50 per person. The calendar year benefit maximum is up to $1,000 per person.

<P>
* If you use out of network dental providers, your eligible orthodontia expenses will be subject to an out-of-network calendar year deductible of $50 per child. The calendar year orthodontia benefit maximum is up to $500 per child.

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">issues to consider</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;What are your and your family's dental care needs for the next year?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;How much can you afford to pay toward monthly premiums, deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Are you planning to establish a Health Care Reimbursement Account to reimburse yourself for out-of-&#009;&#009;&#009;pocket dental care expenses?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have coverage elsewhere; for example, your spouse's dental plan? If so, is it to your advantage &#009;&#009;&#009;to cover yourself and/or dependents through that plan?

<CENTER><B>MAKING YOUR CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
With CU Benefits you make the benefit choices which are right for you and your family. As you make your decisions, be sure to carefully evaluate your needs now and in the coming year. Since each of us has different needs, the benefits you choose will probably be different from those your co-workers choose. For example, if you are single, you may decide that Basic Life Insurance Plan coverage is the right choice for you. Your co-worker who is married with two children may elect a higher level of Optional Life Insurance Plan coverage and may elect to cover his or her spouse and dependent children.

<CENTER><B>DISABILITY PLANS</B></CENTER>

<P>
Because the financial impact of a disability can be significant, the University makes available disability and accident coverages designed to coordinate with sick leave, PERA and Workers' Compensation. Short-term and long-term disability coverage is provided at no cost to you.  

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Short-Term Disability</FONT>

<P>
The University provides you with sick leave benefits. However, it is possible that your illness may last longer than the amount of sick leave you have available. Short-term disability (STD) insurance provides a benefit equal to 60% of your pre-disability earnings beginning on the 31st day of your disability or after

<P>
all of your sick leave is exhausted, whichever is later. The weekly maximum benefit is $1,500 and continues through the 180th day of your disability. Enrollment is automatic when you are permanently employed with the University and there are no elections to make to receive this coverage. The University pays the full premium for this coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Long-Term Disability</FONT>

<P>
Long-term disability (LTD) insurance guarantees your future income if you should become permanently and totally disabled.  

<P>
Your LTD benefit is 60% of the first $8,333 of your basic monthly salary, less income from other sources, such as Workers' Compensation and PERA disability.  

<P>
If you become disabled and qualify for coverage, benefits are payable after 180 days (six months) of disability. If you become disabled and are age 62 or younger, benefits are payable until you reach age 65.

<P>
For benefit information if you become disabled after reaching age 62, contact your Campus Benefits Office.

<P>
Pre-existing condition limitations apply for this plan for those whose coverage begins on or after January 1, 1991. Enrollment is automatic and there is no cost to you when you are a permanent employee with the University. There is no election to make to receive coverage.

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>


The University of Colorado recognizes that its faculty and staff strive to balance their work and personal lives. This Family and Medical Leave Policy ("Policy"), applicable to faculty and unclassified staff ("staff"), is designed to support these efforts and to meet the provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 ("FMLA"). Generally, the FMLA requires employers to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave during a 12-month period for certain family and medical reasons.<BR><P>


The provisions of this Policy are intended to be consistent with the FMLA implementing regulations. These regulations, issued by the Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor at 29 CFR Part 825, should be consulted for clarification and amplification. This Policy is not intended to conflict with University obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ("ADA").<BR><P>


The rules of the State Personnel System provide classified staff with Family and Medical Leave opportunities. Those State personnel rules, along with FMLA requirements incorporated by campus procedures, are to be consulted for leaves applicable to classified staff.<P>



<B>DEFINITIONS</B><P>


1. <I>Spouse</I>: A husband or wife as recognized under State law for purposes of marriage in the state where the employee resides, including common law marriage in states where it is recognized. Colorado law recognizes common law marriages. <P>


2. <I>Parent</I>: A biological parent or an individual who stands or stood in loco parentis to a faculty or staff member when he/she was a child. Parent does not include parent-in-law. <P>


3. <I>Son or Daughter</I>: A biological, adopted or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is either under age 18 or age 18 or older and incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical disability as defined by the ADA.<P>


4. <I>Serious Health Condition</I>: An illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves: <P>


a. inpatient care;<P>

b. continuing treatment by a health care provider and any period of incapacity due to pregnancy or for prenatal care; <P>

c. a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days and continuing treatment by a health care provider;<P>

d. a period of incapacity or treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health condition (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy) and continuing treatment by a health care provider; <P>

e. a period of incapacity that is permanent or long-term due to a condition for which treatment may not be effective (e.g., Alzheimer's, severe stroke, or the terminal stages of a disease) and continuing treatment by a health care provider; or <P>

f. any period of absence to receive continuing treatment by a health care provider either for restorative surgery or for a condition that would likely result in a period of incapacity of more than three consecutive calendar days in the absence of treatment (e.g., cancer, severe arthritis, and kidney disease). <P>


Cosmetic treatments (e.g., most treatments for acne or plastic surgery) are not "serious health conditions" unless inpatient hospital care is required or unless complications develop. Unless complications arise, the common cold, flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, periodontal disease, etc., are examples of conditions that do not meet the definition of serious health condition.<P>


5. <I>Health Care Provider</I>: Any doctor of medicine or osteopathy, podiatrist, dentist, clinical psychologist, optometrist, nurse practitioner, nurse midwife and clinical social worker, performing within the scope of his/her practice as defined under State law. Chiropractors and Christian Science practitioners are health care providers to the extent defined under FMLA regulations. Also included is any health care provider recognized by the University's group health plan for reimbursement of services.<P>


6. <I>Equivalent Position</I>: A position that is virtually identical to the faculty or staff member's former position in terms of pay, benefits, and working conditions, including privileges, perquisites and status.<P>



<B>STATEMENT OF POLICY</B><P>


A. FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ENTITLEMENT. Consistent with the provisions of this Policy, eligible faculty and staff are entitled to a total of 12 work weeks of unpaid Family and Medical Leave during a rolling 12-month period, measured backward from the date a faculty/staff member uses any Family and Medical Leave* if leave is requested for any one or more of the following reasons: <P>


the birth of the faculty or staff member's son or daughter, and to care for the newborn child. (Leave must be completed within 12 months of the date of birth.);<P>


the placement with the faculty or staff member of a son or daughter for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly placed child. (Leave must be completed within 12 months of the date of placement.); <P>


to care for the faculty or staff member's spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition; and <P>


because of a serious health condition that makes the faculty or staff member unable to perform one or more of the essential functions of his/her position.<P>


1. Determination of Eligibility. A request for leave is contingent upon a determination that the individual is eligible for Family and Medical Leave. Unless waived by the Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate) for good cause after consultation with the campus office of human resources, a faculty or staff member, to be eligible for Family and Medical Leave, must have been employed by the University of Colorado for at least 12 months and have worked at least 1,250 hours during the most recent 12-month period. Full-time faculty on nine-or 12-month appointments are deemed to meet the 1,250 hour test. Eligibility also includes compliance with requirements of this Policy. The 12 work weeks is prorated for eligible part-time faculty/staff. For purposes of confirmation of family relationship, the University may require the individual to provide reasonable documentation or statement of family relationship.<P>


2. Substitution of Leave. Generally, Family and Medical Leave is unpaid. However, under the provisions of this section, a faculty/staff member may choose or may be required to substitute paid leave for unpaid Family and Medical Leave.<P>
 

a. Sick Leave. If the purpose of the leave is the serious health condition of the faculty or staff member, he/she will be required to substitute any accrued sick leave for unpaid Family and Medical Leave. The faculty or staff member may elect to substitute sick leave for unpaid leave to care for his/her spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition.<P>


b. Vacation Leave. If the purpose of the leave is the serious health condition of the faculty or staff member, he/she will be required to substitute any accrued vacation leave for unpaid Family and Medical Leave. The faculty or staff member may elect to substitute vacation leave to care for her/his spouse, son, daughter, or parent with a serious health condition. <P>


c. Short-term Disability Leave. The Family and Medical Leave 12-week entitlement will run concurrently with any leave without pay taken while a faculty or staff member is receiving short-term disability benefits, including any waiting period.<P>


d. Job-related Injury or Illness. A serious health condition may result from job-related injury or illness. Paid injury leave (staff) or leave while covered by the Workers' Compensation Plan (faculty), even though taken for an FMLA qualifying purpose, will not count against the 12-week Family and Medical Leave entitlement; except that, such leave will be counted against the individual's Family and Medical Leave entitlement if the injury leave/leave while covered by the Workers' Compensation Plan is exhausted and the individual requests Family and Medical Leave for the same work-related injury or illness.<P>


3. Spouse Limitation. If husband and wife both work for the same University department or administrative unit, and are eligible for leave, they are only entitled to a combined 12 work weeks of leave taken for birth, adoption, foster care, and to care for a parent. This provision may be waived by the Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate) for good cause after consultation with the campus department of human resources.<P>


4. Intermittent or Reduced Leave Schedule. A faculty or staff member taking leave for his/her own serious health condition or to care for a spouse, parent, son or daughter with a serious health condition need not take leave continuously. Leave may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule if the faculty or staff member provides certification of medical necessity. Faculty or staff needing intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule must attempt to schedule their leave so as not to disrupt the operations of his/her department. The Dean or Supervising Officer (or delegate) may temporarily assign the faculty or staff member to an alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits, during the period of the intermittent or reduced leave schedule, for which the individual is qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of leave. A faculty or staff member taking leave for birth or placement may take leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only with the approval of the Dean or Supervising Officer (or delegate).<P>


5. Designation Of Leave. It is the responsibility of the Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate) to designate leave, paid or unpaid, as Family and Medical Leave and to give notice of the designation to the faculty/staff member. If the Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate) does not have sufficient information about the reason for the use of leave, he/she should inquire to ascertain whether the leave qualifies as Family and Medical Leave. The designation decision will be based only on information received from the faculty/staff member (or spokesperson).<P>


The Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate) must promptly (within two working days, absent extenuating circumstances, after notice of the need for leave or after the Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate) has acquired knowledge that the leave is being taken for a Family and Medical Leave reason) notify the faculty/staff member that leave is designated and will be counted as Family and Medical Leave. This designation may be oral, but must be confirmed in writing, no later than the following payday (unless the payday is less than one week after the oral notice in which case the notice must be no later than the subsequent payday).<P>


If there is a dispute over designation of leave, it should be resolved through discussions between the Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate) and the faculty/staff member. Such discussions and decision shall be documented.<P>


B. REQUEST FOR LEAVE. Faculty shall request leave under this Policy whenever the University must hire a substitute for the faculty member or when the Dean or other administrative superior, after consultation with the department concerned, shall so decide. Staff shall request a leave under this Policy whenever paid or unpaid leave time for any purposes listed in Section A above, extends for a period of one week or longer. <P>


1. Notice to Dean or Supervising Officer. If the need for the leave is foreseeable, the faculty or staff member must provide notice of not less than 30 days to the Dean/Supervising Officer (or delegate). Leave will be denied, unless there is a reasonable excuse for the late notice, until 30 days' notice is provided. If the need for the leave is of an emergency nature, the request must be submitted as soon as practicable, but no later than two business days from the day the individual learns of the need for the leave, except in extraordinary circumstances where such notice is not feasible.<P>


2. Medical Certification. For leave to care for a family member with a serious health condition or for leave due to the individual's own serious health condition, medical certification must be provided, using a form provided by the University (Attachment A), within 15 calendar days of the date the leave request is made, unless it is not practicable under the particular circumstances. A second opinion, at University expense, from an independent medical provider selected by the University, may be required. If the two opinions conflict, the conflict may be resolved by a third opinion, at the University's expense, by an agreed-upon provider which shall be considered final.<P>


3. Written Notice. The University will provide the faculty or staff member with written notice, consistent with the attached notice format (Attachment B) and FMLA Regulation 29 CFR 825.301 (b) and (c), detailing the specific expectations and obligations of the individual and explaining any consequences of a failure to meet these obligations.<P>


4. Scheduling. If the leave is for the planned medical treatment of the faculty or staff member or family member, or requires intermittent or reduced schedule leave, faculty and staff may be required by their Dean or Supervising Officer (or delegate) to arrange a particular schedule or to reschedule appointments or treatments, subject to the consent of the health care provider.<P>


5. Periodic Reporting and Recertification. Faculty and staff on leave may be required to report on their status and intent to return. During leave, the University may also require recertification of the medical condition that caused the individual to take leave when the University obtains information that casts doubt on the continuing validity of the original certification, when the individual requests an extension of leave or when circumstances have changed. <P>


C. HEALTH PLAN BENEFITS DURING UNPAID LEAVE. During unpaid Family and Medical Leave, the University will maintain health plan coverage on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided if the faculty or staff member had been continuously employed during the entire Family and Medical Leave period.<P>


1. Timely Payment of Premiums. The University's obligation to maintain health insurance coverage will cease if a faculty or staff member's premium payment is more than 30 days late. If payment is not made in a timely manner, the health insurance program may be canceled or, at the University's option, it may be continued, subject to later recovery by the University of the employee's share of premiums. In order to drop coverage the University shall provide written notice that the payment has not been received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after the date of the letter unless the payment has been received by that date.<P>


2. Failure to Return to Work. The faculty or staff member will be required to reimburse the University for the employer's share of health insurance premiums paid on the employee's behalf during unpaid leave if the faculty or staff member does not return to work following Family and Medical Leave, or returns but fails to stay 30 calendar days, for a reason other than (1) the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would entitle the individual to Family and Medical Leave or (2) other circumstances beyond the individual's control. <P>


3. A faculty or staff member may choose not to retain the University's health insurance program during unpaid leave. When the faculty or staff member returns from leave, he/she is entitled to be reinstated on the same terms as prior to taking the leave, without any qualifying period, physical examination, or exclusion of pre-existing conditions.<P>


D. RETURN FROM FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE. Upon return from Family and Medical Leave, the faculty or staff member will be returned to the same position he/she held when the leave began or to an equivalent position with equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment, except that an individual has no greater right to reinstatement or to other benefits and conditions of employment than if he/she had been continuously employed during the period.<P>


1. Tenure Probationary Period. Consistent with Article 5.B.3(D)(1) of the Laws of the Regents, leave taken pursuant to this Policy does not count as part of the tenure probationary period. However, a faculty member may elect, no later than six months following his/her return to full-time service, to have the leave time count as part of the tenure probationary period. Such an election shall be made in writing and must be approved by the Dean and the Chancellor. The faculty member's election is irrevocable and not subject to modification.<P>


2. Accrual of Sick and Annual Leave. Accrual of sick leave and annual leave (for staff) while the faculty/staff member is on unpaid Family and Medical Leave will be determined by established University policy on leave without pay.<P>

3. Other Benefits. At the end of the Family and Medical Leave, other benefits, including group life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, and pensions must be resumed in the same manner and at same levels as provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of Family and Medical Leave affecting the workforce, unless otherwise elected by the faculty or staff member. Upon return from Family and Medical Leave, an individual cannot be required to requalify for any benefit enjoyed before Family and Medical Leave began. With respect to University pension plans, any period of unpaid Family and Medical Leave will not be treated as, or counted toward, a break in service for purposes of vesting and eligibility to participate. However, unpaid Family and Medical Leave will not be treated as credited service for purposes of benefit accrual vesting and eligibility to participate. <P>


4. Certification Upon Return. A faculty or staff member returning to work because of his or her own serious health condition may be required, consistent with FMLA Regulation 825.310, to present written documentation from his/her attending physician that he/she is able to return to work. A certification shall be required of any individual who is on Family and Medial Leave for more than 30 days due to his/her own serious health condition. A certification may be required for leaves of less than 30 days when it is determined that the nature of the health condition in relation to the individual's duties make such a certification consistent with business necessity. This Policy shall be applied consistently to all similarly situated individuals. The certification shall only address the particular health condition that caused the individual's need for Family and Medical Leave. This certification shall not be required of individuals taking intermittent Family and Medical Leave. Return to work may be delayed until the required certification is furnished. Any such medical inquiry will be conducted in accordance with the ADA.<P>


E. CONTINUATION OF THE PARENTAL LEAVE POLICY** The provisions of the Parental Leave Policy, approved by the Board of Regents on January 18, 1990, shall be maintained and implemented in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of this Policy.<P>


Provisions of this Policy are applicable to leave taken under the Parental Leave Policy only if the leave is taken for a Family and Medical Leave reason listed under Section A of this Policy. If leave is taken for such a Family and Medical Leave reason, provisions of this Policy are applicable only to that portion of the leave taken under the Parental Leave Policy that does not extend beyond the 12 work week entitlement.<P>


If leave is taken under the Parental Leave Policy for a Family and Medical Leave reason, listed under Section A of this Policy, the leave shall count against the 12 work week Family and Medical Leave entitlement. Similarly, if leave is taken under this Policy for a purpose allowed under the Parental Leave Policy, the leave shall count against the entitlement under the Parental Leave Policy.<P>


F. RECORDS AND CONFIDENTIALITY. Each campus shall maintain records of Family and Medical Leave in compliance with the FMLA, ADA and Fair Labor Standards Act as required by the FMLA. All employee information relating to Family and Medical Leave will be kept confidential and in a file separate from the usual personnel file.<P>


G. IMPLEMENTATION AND REVIEW. Each campus shall develop procedures to implement this Policy. Until information on Family And Medical Leave can be included within the Faculty and Unclassified Staff Handbooks, each campus shall make available these campus procedures and annually distribute to all faculty and staff information on the FMLA. This Policy shall be reviewed 12 months after the effective date.<P>
