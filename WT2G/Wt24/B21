<CENTER><B>LIFE INSURANCE CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
Life insurance helps provide financial security for you and your family. Each family's life insurance needs are different and your life insurance needs may change over time, based on your income, assets, and financial obligations. All permanent classified staff who are eligible for health insurance coverage are eligible for CU or State of Colorado Basic Term Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance. If your appointment is less than 50%, you are eligible for the State of Colorado and PERA plans.

<P>
Life Insurance choices at a glance:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;CU or State of Colorado Basic Term Life Insurance

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;CU Optional Term Life Insurance

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Personal Accident Insurance

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;PERA Prudential Life Insurance (PERA members only)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;PERA Rocky Mountain Life Insurance (PERA members only)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Basic Term Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment</FONT>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">(AD&amp;D) Insurance</FONT>

<P>
Depending on your choice of health insurance, the University or the State of Colorado provides you with Basic Term Life Insurance in the amount of $12,000, and Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) benefits in the amount of $12,000. This means that if your death is the result of an accident, your beneficiary would receive a death benefit of $12,000 from Basic Term Life Insurance and another $12,000 from AD&amp;D Insurance benefits. If you are terminally ill, the plans provide an accelerated benefit which lets you take a portion of your life insurance proceeds while you are living.

<P>
All active employees who are eligible for a CU or State of Colorado health plan receive this coverage at no charge. If you are a permanent Classified Staff member and have an appointment of 50% or greater, you may purchase additional amounts of Term Life insurance with the CU Optional Term Life Insurance plan.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">CU Optional Term Life Insurance Plan</FONT>

<P>
If you are eligible, you may choose Optional Term Life Insurance coverage for yourself, for your spouse and for your eligible children through Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">For You</FONT>

<P>
You may elect optional term life insurance and AD&D coverage in increments of $10,000 up to a maximum benefit of $500,000. If you elect coverage of more than $300,000, that amount cannot exceed three times your salary. You do not have to provide evidence of insurability for coverage up to $100,000 if you apply for coverage within 31 days of your eligible employment. If you elect coverage greater than $100,000 or apply for coverage after your initial eligibility period, you will be required to provide evidence of insurability.

<P>
For instance, upon employment John elected $150,000 in additional term life insurance coverage. To make this election, he will need to provide evidence of insurability for $50,000 in coverage ($150,000 - $100,000 = $50,000).

<P>
If you have elected coverage for yourself, you may elect up to an equal amount of coverage for your spouse. Evidence of insurability is required for coverage exceeding $100,000 or if you apply for coverage after your initial eligibility period.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">For Your Dependent Children </FONT>

<P>
If you have elected coverage for yourself, you can elect coverage for your dependent children. You have two choices for coverage for dependent children: $10,000 in coverage for each child covered ($1,000 for infants - 14 days to 6 months of age) or $5,000 in coverage for each child ($500 for infants - 14 days to 6 months of age).

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table5.gif">

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Enrollment, Separation from Employment, and Retirement</FONT>

<P>
You may enroll for up to $100,000 of coverage in the CU Optional Term Life plan as a new employee if you do so within 31 days of your benefits-eligible employment. Enrollment at any other time or for amounts exceeding the guaranteed issue amount requires completion of a Medical Disclosure Statement and its approval by the Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company. Coverage begins with the payroll deduction effective the month following the date of approval.

<P>
All optional term life insurance coverage terminates at the end of the last month for which a premium was deducted from your paycheck. The Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company can provide information about how you can continue your life insurance coverage on an individual basis. For contact information, see Important Addresses/Phone Numbers at the back of this booklet.

<P>
When you retire, you may elect $3,000 coverage or 25% of your pre-retirement coverage up to a maximum benefit of $12,500. Dependent life and the accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D) portion of the CU Term Life Insurance plan ends when you retire.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Beneficiary Designations</FONT>

<P>
You must designate a beneficiary for the CU Basic Life Insurance and the CU Optional Term Life Insurance you choose for yourself and your spouse. You are automatically the beneficiary for any insurance you purchase for your dependent children.

<P>
If you currently have a beneficiary designation on file and are not changing your life insurance coverage, you only need to file a new form if you wish to change beneficiaries. If you wish to make a life insurance coverage change during Open Enrollment, you will be mailed a Life Insurance Beneficiary Update Form.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Personal Accident Insurance </FONT>

<P>
Through the Prudential Life Insurance Company, the University offers you a Personal Accident Insurance plan that provides coverage for accidental death or loss of hands, feet or eyesight. This plan also includes a limited disability benefit. You must have an appointment with the University of 50% or greater to be eligible

<P>
for this plan. You may elect coverage for your spouse up to the amount elected for yourself, and you may cover your children as well, provided you have elected coverage for yourself.  

<P>
You elect the amount of coverage you want in multiples of $10,000. The maximum amount you may elect is $250,000 (for amounts over $100,000, you may not elect more than 10 times your salary).   

<P>
This plan has two parts:

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Accident benefit</FONT> </B>- If you should suffer a loss of life or limb as the result of an accident, the plan will pay a benefit based on the severity of the accident to you or your beneficiary. 

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Disability benefit </FONT></B>- If you are younger than age 60, the plan provides a benefit to you if you become totally disabled within 30 days of a covered accident. If you remain totally disabled one year after the accident, you will continue receiving benefits for up to 500 weeks.

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table6.gif">

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">PERA Term Life Insurance Plans</FONT>

<P>
As a PERA member, you have additional term life insurance plans available through the Prudential Life Insurance Company and the Rocky Mountain Life Insurance Company. To participate in either or both plans, you must be enrolled in the PERA retirement program. The premiums from these plans will be deducted from your pay on an after-tax basis.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">PERA Prudential Life Insurance</FONT>

<P>
For $9 per month, you receive term life insurance for yourself, your spouse and your dependents in an amount that decreases with your age. AD&amp;D coverage is included. The coverage amounts are listed below.

<P>
As a Classified Staff employee, if you have an appointment of 50% or greater, you are eligible to elect either the University of Colorado or the State of Colorado's health, dental and life insurance plans, as well as all other CU Benefit plans. If you have an appointment of less than a 50%, you are eligible for  CU-Flex and State of Colorado health, dental and life insurance plans.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Your Dependents</FONT>

You may enroll your dependents for certain coverages. Eligible dependents include your:

<P>

<CENTER><B>HOW YOUR CU BENEFITS WORK</B></CENTER>

<P>
The CU Benefits program is designed to provide choices in coverage types and coverage levels. The components that make up the CU Benefits program reflect information you provided in employee surveys and input from the faculty and staff representatives on 
the CU Benefits Oversight Committee. Now you can choose the benefit plan coverages that work best for you. Here's how.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Annual Open Enrollment</FONT>

<P>
Because your needs change from year to year, the University of Colorado gives you the opportunity to make new elections each year during the annual Open Enrollment Period. The benefits you choose during Open Enrollment will be in effect from January 1 thr
ough December 31, 1997. In the fall of 1997, you will have the opportunity to change your enrollment for 1998.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Personalized Enrollment Worksheet</FONT>

<P>
Enclosed you will find a personalized Enrollment Worksheet. Your Worksheet shows the benefits that are available to you, the price of each benefit, and the plans in which you are currently enrolled. It also has step-by-step instructions for selecting your
 1997 benefits coverage by calling the CU Benefits Line. Using your Worksheet along with this Enrollment Workbook will make your 1997 benefits enrollment fast and easy.

<CENTER><B>HEALTH PLAN CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
Each health plan offered through the CU Benefits program provides quality health care and prescription drug coverage for you and your eligible dependents. Depending on your needs, you may choose from five levels of coverage:  employee only, employee plus one, single parent with two or more children (only available through the CU benefits plan) family or split. If you choose to cover your dependents, you must enroll them in the same medical plan that you elect for yourself.

<P>
As you make your health plan decision, keep in mind that if you elect a CU health plan and want dental coverage, your health and dental coverage levels must be the same. For example, if you elect family coverage in a CU health plan, you will automatically receive family coverage in the CU dental plan if dental coverage is elected. The State of Colorado allows you to mix coverage levels (ie., you may elect employee only health coverage and family dental, etc.) or to waive health coverage and still enroll in dental.

<P>
Selecting a health plan that is right for you and your family is an important decision. To help you make your selection, we've included descriptions of the CU and State of Colorado health options in this Workbook.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">CU Health Plans: <I>Quality First</I></FONT>

<P>
The University offers you a choice of two CU Health Plans: CU Gold and CU Silver. Within each plan you have choices as to where and how you receive care. Both plans allow you to choose how you'll access your medical care each time you need treatment. How you access your medical care determines the level of benefits you'll receive. Of the two CU plans, CU Gold provides higher benefits and costs you less each month than the CU Silver plan. The CU Gold Plan has managed care features incorporated into the plan design which help to contain the costs of health care while assuring appropriate care for you and your family.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">CU Gold</FONT>

<P>
CU Gold is a point-of-service health plan where you decide, when you need medical care, whether or not to use the plan's managed care providers. If you use the managed care network and coordinate your care through your University Affiliates Network (UA Network) Personal Care Physician (PCP), you'll receive the plan's highest level of benefits. If you don't coordinate your care through your PCP, you'll still receive benefits, but at a lower level of coverage.

<P>
<B>Choosing a Personal Care Physician </B> When you first elect coverage in the CU Gold plan, you will need to select a UA Network Personal Care Physician (PCP) who will provide your routine and primary care and refer you to network specialists, as necessary.

<P>
Each family member can have a different PCP. For example, you can choose a pediatrician as the PCP for your children and an internist for yourself. If you are not completely satisfied with the PCP you've chosen, you can change your PCP up to four times each year.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">The UA Network</FONT></B>  CU Gold uses the University Affiliates Network (UA Network) as the PCP and specialty network. There are two directories enclosed with this Workbook:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;University Affiliates Network Personal Care Physician Directory

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;University Affiliates Specialist Directory

<P>
Refer to the directories for specific information on participating UA Network physicians, hospitals and other providers.

<P>
To become part of UA Network, each physician's background and credentials were carefully screened and are periodically re-evaluated. All UA Network providers are faculty at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. These physicians practice full-time at CU or in private practice and have been contracted through University Physicians, Inc. and University Hospital to serve the CU health plans. Because all UA Network physicians have faculty appointments through the University of Colorado, you can be assured that the doctors from which you'll choose have met the highest quality standards.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">CU Gold Benefits</FONT></B>  CU Gold includes two levels of benefits. What the plan pays depends on where you receive your care.

<P>
UA Network Care  When you receive care through your PCP, there is no annual deductible and no coinsurance amounts to pay. All you pay is an up front copayment.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;$10 for visits to the doctor

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;$100 per hospital stay - no limit on the number of days allowed

<P>
Another advantage to receiving your care from your PCP is that there are no claim forms to file.

<P>
Out-of-Network Care  Health care is a very personal issue and while the UA Network is comprehensive enough to provide just about any care you need, you or a family member may choose to see a physician who is not in the UA Network. An Out-of-Network care option is provided in CU Gold to accommodate those circumstances.

<P>
With Out-of-Network care, before benefits are payable you need to satisfy a $300 individual annual deductible. (The family annual deductible is $900.) The deductible and coinsurance also apply if you receive care from a UA Network doctor, but for whom you did not get a referral from your PCP. Once the deductible is met, CU Gold pays 70% of reasonable and customary charges. Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance expenses reach $3,000 ($9,000 for a family), CU Gold pays 100% of covered reasonable and customary charges for the rest of the calendar year. (Expenses that exceed reasonable and customary are your responsibility.)

<P>
The chart on p.8 provides an overview of how benefits are paid in CU Gold for UA Network and

<P>
Out-of-Network care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">CU Silver</FONT>

<P>
CU Silver is a preferred provider network health plan. You can receive medical care from any provider you choose, but when you receive care from a UA Network provider, you receive the highest benefits from the plan.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">A Choice of Networks</FONT></B>  In CU Silver there are two preferred provider networks: University Affiliates (UA) Network and Great-West Life (GWL) "One Health" PPO Network.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">UA Network Care</FONT></B>  When you receive care from a UA Network provider you receive the highest benefits available in CU Silver. You do not have to satisfy a deductible before benefits are paid and you pay only

<P>
a small copayment for most services. Certain benefits such as health screenings, risk assessments and routine physical exams are payable only when you use a UA Network provider.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">GWL "One Health" PPO Network Care</FONT></B>  The next highest level of benefits is provided through Great-West Life (GWL) PPO Network providers. Care you receive from a GWL PPO Network provider is reimbursed at 80% of covered charges, once you satisfy a $200 individual annual deductible ($600 for a family).

<P>
Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance expenses in any year reach $2,000 ($6,000 for a family), CU Silver pays 100% of covered expenses for the rest of the calendar year.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Out-of-Network Care</FONT></B>  In CU Silver you can receive care from an Out-of-Network provider and still receive benefits. Because Out-of-Network providers do not have any agreements with CU to hold down the cost of care, CU Silver pays the lowest reimbursements for Out-of-Network care. Benefits are payable at 60% after you satisfy a $400 annual individual deductible ($1,200 for a family). Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance costs reach $4,000 ($12,000 for a family), the plan pays 100% of covered reasonable and customary expenses for the rest of the calendar year. (Expenses that exceed reasonable and customary are your responsibility.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Prescription Drug Coverage</FONT>

<P>
When you enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver, your prescription drug benefits are provided through the PCS Prescription Drug Card Program. For your long-term prescription drug needs, both CU Gold and CU Silver include a Mail Order Program.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">The PCS Prescription Drug Card Program</FONT>

<P>
This program offers two levels of benefits: The "Quality First" Network and Out-of-Network. You will receive the highest level of benefits available through the program by using a "Quality First" Network Pharmacy. If you have your prescriptions filled at an Out-of-Network Pharmacy, you'll receive a slightly lower benefit level. A list of "Quality First" Network pharmacies is included in your Enrollment Packet.

<P>
Here are the benefits by plan:

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Mail Order Prescription Drug Program  </FONT>

<P>
If you take medication on an on-going basis, you can save money on these prescription drugs through the Mail Order Prescription Drug Program, which is administered through the CU School of Pharmacy. You can receive up to a 90-day supply of your prescription drug for one low copayment. You pay $6 or 20% of the cost, whichever is greater. You can be assured maximum savings by buying generic whenever possible.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Mental Health, Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency Treatment Coverage</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">UMHS (University Mental Health Services)</FONT>

<P>
This program is designed to evaluate and direct you to the appropriate treatment for mental health, alcoholism and chemical dependency problems. The program offers two levels of benefits: Network (UMHS) and Out-of-Network. When you receive care through UMHS directly, you receive the higher level of benefits for outpatient and inpatient care, without paying any deductibles. You pay only a small copayment when you receive care. UMHS coordinates all services and providers and monitors your progress.

<P>
Unless there is an emergency situation requiring immediate hospitalization, your first visit will be to University Mental Health Services where a mental health professional will evaluate your needs and, if necessary, refer you and/or your eligible family members for appropriate treatment. Your copayment will be $10 with CU Gold and $15 with CU Silver (maximum of two sessions).

<P>
<I>In case of an emergency, UMHS can be reached by calling (303) 315-4940 or (800) 349-4940 (any hour). For all other preauthorizations, UMHS offices should be called between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday <BR>
through Friday.</I>

<P>
If you are referred by UMHS for outpatient treatment, you will receive a specific referral from a mental health professional who will discuss options and costs. Referrals by UMHS for inpatient care will be based on the type of treatment required and the desired location. Copayments will vary depending on the facility used.

<P>
<I>In case you are unable to receive precertification because of an emergency inpatient admission, you must contact UMHS within 48 hours of admission.</I>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Out-of-Network</FONT>

<P>
When you select providers that are Out-of-Network, you are still required to call UMHS and have your care preauthorized - for outpatient care or preapproved - for inpatient care. Some services require meeting a separate plan deductible before receiving any benefits.

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">State of Colorado Health Plans</FONT>

<P>
The State of Colorado offers statewide and regional health plans. You may choose to enroll in any of the plans described in this section if you don't want to enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver.

<P>
The Premier and Healthy Paths will not be offered to employees in 1997.  Effective January 1, 1997, these two paths will merge into one.  The new Path is named the Combined Path.  Because claim costs in the Premier and Healthy Paths were greater than the premiums the State was collecting, and enrollment in both of these paths had steadily decreased over the last two years, significant changes had to be made, thus the consolidation into the Combined Path.

<P>
The new Combined Path--as well as the Basic and Exclusive Paths--offers the same exact network of doctors that existed in the Premier and Healthy Paths, and the Combined and Basic Paths provide both in- and out-of-network levels of coverage. The Exclusive Path has the same high level of benefits as an HMO with NO out-of-network coverage.  The coverage under the Basic and Exclusive Paths remains the same for 1997.  

<P>
Refer to the enclosed medical comparison chart for more details on the new Combined Path and other state plans.  

<P>
The State of Colorado health plans are all managed care plans. They use networks of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to deliver health care. The providers in the managed care network agree to accept negotiated fees for their services in return for the larger patient base that the networks provide. To obtain a provider directory, call the phone number shown on the chart.

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table2.gif">

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">How The Paths Work - Combined, Basic and Exclusive</FONT>

<P>
In each of the paths, you and each of your dependents choose a Primary Care Physician (PCP) - a doctor with the managed care network - who is your and your dependents' contact for medical care. In the majority of cases, your PCP is able to take care of your medical needs. If you require more specialized care, your PCP will make the referral arrangements for you to see a specialist within the managed care network. A woman may visit her network gynecologist for routine care twice a year without a referral. During the routine visit, if a problem is discovered which may require additional visits, tests or sugery, a PCP referral is required.

<P>
The Combined and Basic Paths offer you freedom of choice. When you need care, you can choose to use your in-network PCP and specialist referred by your PCP or any out-of-network providers. These paths cover your eligible expenses, although in-network benefits are greater than out-of-network benefits.

<P>
The Exclusive Path is similar to an HMO. You must select a network PCP and use the network specialists referred by your PCP. If you live in an area where the network is not available, you must commute to your network PCP and/or specialist to receive plan benefits. There are no out-of-network benefits except for emergency and as defined by the plan.

<P>
In all three paths, if you use network providers you won't have to deal with claim forms or other paperwork: your network provider will handle the claims for you. Certain services and procedures, including hospitalizations, require preauthorization. Call Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado state customer service for additional information. Under the Combined and Basic Paths, you may use out-of-network providers. However, you must get your out-of-network hospital stay preauthorized by calling Blue Cross Blue Shield of Colorado or you will have to pay an additional $300 noncompliance penalty per hospital admission.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Prescription Drug Card Plan</FONT>

<P>
A prescription drug card plan - through Great West - is part of each of the three medical paths. You are automatically enrolled in the prescription drug card plan when you enroll in one of the three paths.

<P>
When you present your prescription drug card at an in-network pharmacy you will pay a copayment for each prescription:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Generic Drugs&#009;$10 copayment

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Brand-name drugs&#009;$15 copayment

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Brand-name drug (where no generic exists)&#009;$10 copayment 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Maintenance drugs (generic)&#009;$20 copayment for a 90 day supply

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Maintenance drugs (brand-name)&#009;$30 copayment for a 90 day supply

<P>
If you buy a brand-name when a generic is available, you will pay the difference between the actual cost of the generic and the cost of the brand-name drug unless your physician indicates "medically necessary, dispense as written." If you use an out-of-network pharmacy, the plan will reimburse the cost of your prescription based on what the prescription would have cost at an in-network pharmacy, less the copayment.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">How HMO's Work</FONT>

<P>
You pay a copayment each time your receive certain services and the HMO pays the remaining cost for your treatment. To receive benefits from the HMO, your PCP must coordinate all your medical care (including referrals to specialists), and you must use the doctors, hospitals and other providers within the HMO network (otherwise you pay the full cost of your care).

<P>
You and each covered family member need to choose a PCP to coordinate your care. If you are covering dependents who live outside your immediate area, read the HMO literature to make sure your dependents can receive care from providers in their area.

<P>
Prescription drug coverage is included with each of the HMO plans available. Remember, you must reside within the HMO service area to be eligible to enroll.

<P>
For a summary of the three statewide medical paths and the HMO options for your area, please refer to the Medical Comparison Sheet enclosed in this Enrollment Packet.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">issues to consider</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;What are your and your family's anticipated health care needs for the next calendar year?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;How much can you afford to pay toward monthly premiums, deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have coverage through your spouse's medical and/or dental plan? If so, is it to your advantage &#009;&#009;to cover yourself and/or dependents through that plan?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Are you planning to establish a Health Care Reimbursement Account to reimburse yourself for out-of-&#009;&#009;pocket medical care expenses?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">how to enroll</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Open Enrollment</FONT>

<P>
Once you have made your health plan choice, refer to Step 2A on your Enrollment Worksheet to select health plan coverage. Circle the number of the health plan choice and level of coverage you want. Enter the monthly cost in the right hand column. Remember, if you are selecting coverage for someone in addition to yourself, to refer to Step 2B. And, if you select CU Gold, select a PCP for yourself and each family member covered. Call the CU Benefits Line and enroll in your selections. If you are dropping or adding a dependent, you will be sent a "Spouse and Dependent Update Form". Please complete the form and return to your campus Benefits Office.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">New Employees</FONT>

<P>
Complete and return the health insurance enrollment form available from your Campus Benefits Office within 31 days of your benefits-eligible appointment.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">No Medical Coverage</FONT>

<P>
You may waive coverage during Open Enrollment by calling the CU Benefits Line or, as a new employee, by signing a University of Colorado waiver form. Forms are available through your Campus Benefits Office.

<P>
If you fail to enroll within 31 days, you will be enrolled, by default, in CU Gold without dental -- employee only coverage.

<CENTER><B>CU-FLEX</B></CENTER>

<P>

CU-Flex provides three options for reducing your taxable salary (subject to IRS and plan limitations). You may choose all three or any combination of options. The three are:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Premium Only Plan

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Health Care Reimbursement Account

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Dependent Care Reimbursement Account

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Effect on PERA Retirement</FONT>

<P>
If you are a PERA participant, your PERA retirement annuity or disability retirement is based on the average of your three highest annual salary amounts. Since CU-Flex reduces your PERA contributions, the salary on which PERA calculates benefits is reduced. You may not want to participate in CU-Flex during your five highest earning years (typically your last five years of employment).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Tax considerations</FONT>

<P>
If you select the Premium Only Plan option, you cannot deduct your health and dental insurance premiums on your federal income tax forms. You should consult your financial planner, CPA, attorney, or the IRS for guidance on how the CU-Flex plan options would affect your personal tax status.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Tax-Savings Example</FONT>

<P>
CU-Flex allows you to pay for eligible insurance, health care, and dependent care expenses with pre-tax dollars. 

<P>
You could reduce taxes and increase take-home pay as illustrated below:

<P>

For detailed information, please contact your CPA, attorney, or the Internal Revenue Service. Estimate based on 1996 federal and state income tax rates and standard deduction.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Premium Only Plan</FONT>

<P>
To help you get the most from the coverage you select, many of your coverage choices can be paid for on a before-tax basis, through payroll deduction. When premiums are paid through the Premium Only Plan, the amount you contribute toward the cost of your benefits is deducted from your pay before taxes are taken out. This results in a lower taxable income, so you pay less in taxes. Your before-tax and after-tax benefit choices are shown below. To take advantage of this tax break, you must enroll for the CU-Flex Premium Plan (Step 9 on your Enrollment Form).

CU Benefits offers you the ability to pay for certain out-of-pocket health care and dependent care expenses with before-tax dollars. By spending before-tax dollars, you reduce your current taxable income and pay less in taxes for the year.

You may contribute up to $2,400 each calendar year to the Health Care Reimbursement Account to pay for certain out-of-pocket health care expenses for you or your eligible dependents. Payments are made in equal monthly deductions.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Eligible Expenses</FONT>

<P>
The following are some examples of eligible expenses that qualify for reimbursement from your Health Care Reimbursement Account. (Refer to Appendix A for a more detailed list.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Canes and crutches,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;hearing examinations and hearing aids,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;medical and dental deductibles, co-payment and coinsurance amounts

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;oral contraceptives,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;other unreimbursed qualifying medical or dental expenses,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;vision care expenses, including:  eye exams, prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;orthodontic expenses above dental plan limitations, and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;other health care expenses that are considered medical care under Section 213(d) of the IRS code.

<P>
Expenses reimbursed through the Health Care Reimbursement Account may not be claimed as a deduction on your federal income tax return.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Dependent Care Reimbursement Account</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Your Contributions </FONT>

<P>
You may contribute up to $5,000 each calendar year to the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account to pay for the cost of caring for your eligible dependents, as defined below, so that you (and your spouse, if you are married) can work. Payments are made in equal monthly payroll deductions.

<P>
If you are married, you may contribute up to the maximum amount only if your spouse also works, is a full-time student for at least five months of the calendar year or is disabled. If your spouse contributes to a dependent care account with his or her employer, the combined maximum contribution between the two <BR>
of you cannot exceed $5,000 in any calendar year. In addition, if you are married and file a separate income tax return from your spouse, the maximum amount you may contribute is $2,500 for the calendar year.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Eligible Dependents</FONT>

<P>
An eligible dependent is an individual who lives with you, relies on you for financial support, is claimed as<BR>
a dependent on your federal income tax return and is:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;a child under age 13; or

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;a spouse or dependent (including an elderly relative) who is physically or mentally disabled and cannot &#009;&#009;care for him or herself.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Eligible Expenses</FONT>

<P>
The following are some examples of eligible expenses that qualify for reimbursement from your Dependent Care Reimbursement Account.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;dependent care provided in your home. The caretaker cannot be claimed as a dependent on your federal<BR>
&#009;income tax return and cannot be one of your children under age 19;

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;dependent care provided outside your home, including licensed nursery schools, kindergartens, day &#009;&#009;camps (not overnight camp), legally approved day care centers for children and disabled adults (must &#009;&#009;provide day care for six or more individuals); and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;household services provided by a housekeeper or maid if they are necessary for the care and well-&#009;&#009;being of the dependent.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Important Rules You Should Know</FONT>

<P>
Because of the tax advantages Reimbursement Accounts provide, the federal government imposes strict rules and limitations on how you may use these accounts.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">No Changes</FONT>

<P>
Once you make your Reimbursement Account elections for a calendar year, you cannot change it until the next annual Open Enrollment. In other words, you cannot increase, decrease or cancel your contributions during the year unless you have a qualified change in your family status. The only exceptions are the following qualifying events:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Marriage or divorce

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Legal separation

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Birth or adoption of a child

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Change of legal custody

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Ineligibility of dependent

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Death of spouse

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Death of a child

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Change in spouse's employment status resulting in a loss of coverage or availability of new coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Change in the employee's or spouse's employment status from full-time to part-time or from part-time &#009;&#009;to full-time

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Leave of absence

<P>
Any change in your CU-Flex election must be consistent with the qualifying event.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Separate Accounts</FONT>

<P>
The Health Care Reimbursement Account and the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account are two separate accounts. You cannot use your health care contributions to reimburse yourself for dependent care expenses, and vice versa, even if you have excess contributions in one account and a shortage in the other.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Using Contributions</FONT>

<P>
You can use your Reimbursement Account to reimburse only those expenses you had in the calendar year for which you enroll. For example, a Reimbursement Account set up from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997 can be used to reimburse only those expenses you incur during those twelve months.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Unused Balances</FONT>

<P>
It's important that you carefully estimate the amount you are going to contribute to the Reimbursement Accounts before you enroll for the year. Review your health care and dependent care bills from previous years, and estimate any upcoming expenses.

<P>
Use It or Lose It! The IRS requires that any unused balance remaining in either account at the end of the year be forfeited.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">issues to consider</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;What will your deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses be for the health and dental plans you have &#009;&#009;selected?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have any qualifying dependent care expenses?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Is it more advantageous for you to take a federal tax credit or use the Dependent Care &#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;Reimbursement Account? (Expenses reimbursed through the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account &#009;&#009;are not eligible for the federal tax credit).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Any unused balance remaining in either account at the end of the year will be forfeited.

<CENTER><B>LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE</CENTER></B>

<P>
No one likes to think about it but if you or a family member became ill and needed home health care or nursing home care, how would those special needs be met? The University of Colorado's Long-Term Care Insurance plan through CNA provides long-term care (LTC) protection and peace of mind.

<P>
You can purchase LTC insurance as long as you work at least 20 hours each week. You may elect coverage for your spouse as long as you have elected coverage for yourself. Your parents, parents-in-law, grandparents and grandparents-in-law through the age of 79 are also eligible to apply for coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Long-Term Care Benefits</FONT>

<P>
The plan covers both nursing home facilities and community-based care in the United States. The plan offers two levels of benefits:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The moderate level pays $100/day of nursing home stay and $75/day for community-based care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The high level pays up to $135/day of nursing home stay and $101.25/day for community-based care.

<P>
The plan provides a lifetime maximum benefit of up to three years of nursing home care or six years of community-based care if used every day without interruption. The plan also provides a respite benefit to private residence caregivers who have been providing care for at least six months. The plan will pay for up to 14 days of long-term care so that the regular caregiver can be relieved of his or her duties temporarily.

<P>
The plan includes a six-month pre-existing condition limitation. This means that benefits will not be provided if medical attention or treatment leading to long-term care was received within the six months before coverage became effective.

<P>
Benefits begin when:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;you have been in covered service (in nursing home care) for 60 days or 15 days (in community-based &#009;&#009;care); and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;you have a qualified impairment (assistance is needed in at least two of the following activities: eating, &#009;&#009;dressing, bathing, toileting, general mobility and continence or you have a cognitive impairment (such &#009;&#009;as Alzheimer's disease).

<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">issues to consider</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have elderly parents or grandparents that may require constant care?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Would a serious injury or illness requiring constant care deplete your finances?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have coverage elsewhere?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Who would care for you in a long-term care situation?

<P>
Once you have made your long-term care insurance choice, refer to Step 7 on your Enrollment Worksheet.  Circle your election and enter the monthly cost in the right hand column. Call the CU Benefits Line. An enrollment form will be mailed to you. Before coverage begins, your application must be approved by the CNA Insurance Company.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">New Employees</FONT>

<P>
New employees may enroll on a guarenteed-issue basis within their first 30 days of employment. Simply complete and return the Long-Term Care Insurance Form which is available from your Campus Benefits office.

<P>
Notice to Covered Employees and Family Members About COBRA Continuation Coverage Under Group Health Plans

<P>
Dear Employee and Spouse:

<P>
This is a very important notice: Please make sure that all members of your family read it carefully.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
A federal law known as "COBRA"* requires that group health plans offer "covered employees" and their families the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage ("continuation coverage") in certain instances ("qualifying events") where coverage under the Plan would otherwise end. To receive this continuation coverage, the covered employee, spouse or dependent must pay the monthly premiums directly to the COBRA Administrator. This notice is intended to inform you of your rights and obligations regarding COBRA continuation coverage. You should take the time to read this notice carefully. The term "covered employees" will include any individual who is or was provided coverage because of performance of services for one or more persons maintaining the Plan, including covered employees, partners, independent contractors and other self-employed individuals.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Eighteen-Month Continuation</FONT>

<P>
If you are a covered employee, spouse or dependent covered under the Plan and your group health coverage terminates due to any of the following reasons, called qualifying events, then you will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 18 months after the qualifying event occurs:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;A reduction in the covered employee's hours of employment

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Termination of a covered employee's employment (for reasons<BR>
<SUP>&#009;other than gross misconduct)</SUP>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The covered employee's retirement

<P>
If you are a covered employee, spouse or dependent and disabled at the time or within 60 days of a qualifying event involving termination of employment or a reduction in hours, the 18-month continuation period may be extended an additional 11 months. The disabled individual must give the COBRA Administrator notice of the Social Security determination of disability within 60 days of such determination and before the end of the initial 18-month period. The individual is also responsible for notifying the COBRA Administrator within 30 days of a Social Security final determination that the disability no longer exists.

<P>
If the covered employee does not elect continuation coverage, the covered employee's spouse and each of the covered employee's eligible dependents will have a separate right to elect it. <I>Therefore, it is important that the covered employee, spouse and all dependents read this notice.</I>

<P>
<I>*Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.</I>

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Thirty-Six-Month Continuation</FONT>

<P>
If you are the spouse or dependent child of a covered employee and you lose group health coverage for one of the following reasons (also qualifying events), you will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 36 months after the qualifying event occurs:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The death of the covered employee

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Divorce or legal separation from the covered employee

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare during an <BR>
<SUP>&#009;18-month COBRA continuation period</SUP>

<P>
A dependent child of a covered employee who loses group health coverage under the Plan because the dependent ceases to be a "dependent child" as defined under the Plan will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 36 months after the qualifying event occurs.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Multiple Qualifying Events</FONT>

<P>
An 18-month period of continuation coverage may be extended to a period of up to 36 months for a covered employee's spouse or dependent child if a second qualifying event occurs within the first 18-month period. For example, if a covered employee's spouse is on continuation coverage for 18 months due to the termination of the covered employee's employment, and during the 18-month period the former covered employee dies, the spouse will be eligible to maintain his or her continuation coverage for up to 36 months from the date of the first qualifying event. In no event will the COBRA continuation coverage extend beyond 36 months from the date of the first qualifying event, and it may end before the 18- or 36-month period expires, as explained later in this notice.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">What Health Coverage May Be Continued?</FONT>

<P>
You are eligible to continue only those medical/dental and health flexible spending account benefits for which you were covered at termination. If you were covered under medical plus other health benefits, you may elect to continue either medical benefits only or the full package of medical/dental and health flexible spending account benefits. You will have the opportunity to change health plan coverages in the same manner as covered employees.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">How Much Will the Benefits Cost?</FONT>

<P>
Any person who elects to continue coverage under the Plan must pay the full cost of that coverage (including both the share you now pay, if any, and the share the employer now pays), plus any additional administrative amounts allowed by law.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Termination of Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
Under the law, continuation coverage may be terminated before the end of the maximum period of coverage for any of the following reasons:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The Plan is terminated (in which case you may have the opportunity for<BR>
&#009;coverage under other group health plans sponsored by the employer).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Your premium for COBRA continuation coverage is not paid on time.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Coverage is obtained under another employer-funded group health plan, <BR>
&#009;as an employee, spouse or dependent of an employee. In the event<BR>
&#009;another employer-funded group health plan has a pre-existing condition<BR>
&#009;clause or limitation, continuation coverage may be continued until the<BR>
&#009;18-month period has been exhausted or the pre-existing condition clause <BR>
&#009;has been satisfied.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The individual becomes entitled to Medicare, other than as an End-Stage <BR>
&#009;Renal Disease (ESRD) beneficiary.

<P>
At the end of the continuation coverage period, you will be allowed to convert to an individual insurance policy if that is provided under the Plan at that time. You should note that the conversion option, if any, will not apply if your continuation coverage terminates before the end of the applicable continuation coverage period.

<P>
If you do not elect continuation coverage, your group health coverage will end and the Plan will not pay claims for services provided on and after the date your coverage terminates. If you do not elect continuation coverage, you can still apply for an individual conversion policy. Contact your campus Benefits Office for assistance.

<P>
<I>Note: Continuation coverage is not the same as conversion coverage. Conversion coverage provides you with an individual policy of health insurance handled directly between you and the insurance company, provided you apply for conversion coverage within the applicable time limits. Unlike continuation coverage, conversion coverage does not guarantee coverage identical to your group health plan; and your premium will be paid directly to the insurance company at individual rates.</I>

<P>
If your coverage will be terminated due to retirement and you do not elect continuation coverage, you may be eligible for other retiree coverage provided under the Plan.

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Procedures to Elect Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;In the case of death of the covered employee, termination, reduction in &#009;hours or entitlement to &#009;&#009;&#009;Medicare, which causes your eligibility to terminate, you or your dependent will receive information &#009;&#009;from the Plan concerning the continuation of coverage election provisions, including the self-payment &#009;&#009;rates.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;In the case of divorce or a dependent child who ceases to qualify as a dependent, the covered employee, &#009;&#009;spouse or dependent child must notify the COBRA Administrator within 60 days of the event. If notice &#009;&#009;is not received within 60 days of the event, your dependents will not be eligible for continuation cover&#009;&#009;age. Loss of dependent child status occurs at the end of the calendar year in which the child <BR>
&#009;attains age 23.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;When the covered employee, spouse or dependent is disabled at the time or within 60 days of a qualify-&#009;&#009;ing event involving termination or reduction of hours, the covered employee, spouse or dependent child &#009;&#009;must notify Compusys, Inc. within 60 days of the Social Security determination of disability &#009;&#009;&#009;and before the end of the initial 18-month period.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;When the COBRA Administrator is notified that a qualifying event has occurred, you will be sent an &#009;&#009;election form and other information regarding continuation coverage. You will have at least 60 days &#009;&#009;from the date your coverage terminates under the Plan or, if later, 60 days from the date of the notice &#009;&#009;advising you of your election rights to make your decision. You do not have to show that you are insur-&#009;&#009;able to obtain continuation coverage. 

<P>
If you have questions, please feel free to contact your campus Benefits Office.

<CENTER><B>RETIREMENT PLANNING</B></CENTER>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA)</FONT>

<P>
Classified staff employees are covered by the Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA) plan. PERA deductions are 8% of employee salary with a University contribution of 11.6%.

<P>
PERA is a defined benefit retirement plan. Your retirement benefit is based upon years of service, your age at retirement, and your Highest Average Salary (HAS) or, for certain members, an account balance valuation at retirement age. Your HAS is the monthly average of the three highest salaries earned in 12 consecutive month periods. A month of service credit is granted whenever salary reported to PERA is equal to or greater than 80 times the federal minimum wage ($4.75 x 80 = $380 in 1997). You also have disability income coverage after 5 years of service credit and a death benefit to your survivors after 1 year of service credit.

<P>
Your PERA deduction is tax-deferred from federal and state income taxes. Your taxable income is reduced by the amount of your PERA contribution. Taxes are payable when you retire or withdraw your PERA member account.

<P>
If you leave University employment before retirement, you may request a refund of your PERA member contributions. A refund includes member contributions and 6.8% compounded interest plus a 25% matching amount (before retirement age) or a 50% matching amount (at retirement age). A refund is typically processed within 45 days after receipt of a properly completed refund request.

<P>
Under PERA, you qualify for a service retirement if you meet the following requirements:

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">  Minimum Service Credit&#009;Minimum Age</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#3E539F">&#009;</FONT>

<P><PRE>
35 years		Any age
30 years		55
20 years		60
5 years			65
</PRE>
<P>
Your monthly lifetime benefit is 2.5% of your HAS for each year of service credit through 20 years, and 1.5% of your HAS for each year over 20 years to a maximum benefit of 100%.

<P>
A reduced-service retirement is available as early as age 50 with 25 years of service credit. For certain members, PERA will use an alternative account balance valuation calculation which will provide a higher monthly benefit amount. The plan also allows a monthly lifetime benefit to be paid to another person after a retiree's death.

<P>
PERA members are eligible to purchase service credit for previous employment experience which is not <BR>
vested in a retirement plan.

<P>
Employees on PERA hired after March 1986 are also subject to Medicare tax (a federal employment tax of 1.45% of covered wages).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Tax-Deferred Investment Programs</FONT>

<P>
As a University employee, you are eligible to participate in several tax-deferred investment programs. There are three major advantages to participation:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;You have the opportunity to invest money for your retirement, in addition to your <BR>
&#009;regular retirement plan.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;You pay no income taxes on your investment or the interest earned until you begin <BR>
&#009;withdrawing money from the investment program (usually after retirement).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;You reduce your current taxable income.

<P>
You may choose from the following funds:

If the University does not havea TIN for a 1099 reportable payment, the University is obligatedto withhold 20% of the payment for tax purposes.  The documentused to collect this information is a W-9.  This form includesname and address, type of business (i.e., corporation, sole proprietor,partnership, etc.) and disclosure and differentiation betweena personal TIN (i.e., social security number) and a business TIN(federal employer identification number).  While not legally requiredto use the W-9 form, the University must have proof that the TINused by the University was provided by the payee.  The W-9 formeffectively serves this purpose.<BR><P>If the University fails to withhold the 20% for a 1099 reportablepayment for which there is no valid TIN, the University is liablefor the amount that should have been retained as well as a $100fine plus interest.<BR><BR><P><U><B>STATEMENT OF POLICY<BR></B></U><P>To ensure that the University is able to comply with this Federalrequirement and to avoid penalty payments, the following proceduresapply:<BR><P>1. When a vendor record is established in the Purchasing/AccountsPayable system and no TIN has been provided, the originating officewill send a W-9 to the vendor and will be responsible for enteringthe TIN into the system when available.<BR><P>2. If initial W-9 information is not available upon receipt ofan invoice requesting a 1099 reportable payment for services received,and there is no indication of corporate status (i.e., Inc.) inthe documentation, 20% of the payment must be withheld for taxpurposes.<BR><P>3. W-9 information must be permanently maintained at each campusin a central location for reference and audit purposes.<BR><P><U><B>IMPLEMENTATION<BR><P><P></B></U><P>It is the responsibility of each campus to develop policies andprocedures to ensure compliance with this Federal regulation. Any financial penalties which accrue as a result of failure tocomply will be the responsibility of the campus originating thevendor record.<BR><P><P><P><P><P><CENTER><P><P><A HREF="http://WWW.CUSYS.EDU/Inside_CU/Sys_Admin/Policies/">Back to Policies page</A><BR><BR><A HREF="mailto:claudia.cardozo@colorado.edu"><IMG SRC="../../../pics/common/opendoor.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH="36" HEIGHT="48"><BR>Comments</A><P><IMG SRC="../../../pics/common/i-bar.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH="284" HEIGHT="20" USEMAP="#i-bar"><MAP NAME="i-bar"><AREA SHAPE="rect" HREF="http://www.cusys.edu/Search/index.html" COORDS="0,0,94,20"><AREA SHAPE="rect" HREF="http://www.cusys.edu/Help/index.html" COORDS="95,0,189,20"><AREA SHAPE="rect" HREF="http://www.cusys.edu/index.html" COORDS="190,0,284,20"></MAP><P> <FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="../">System Administration</A> | <A HREF="../../../Search/">Search</A> | <A HREF="../../../Help?">Help</A> | <A HREF="../../../">Home</A></CENTER><P>Copyright &copy; Board of Regents, University of Colorado<BR></BODY></HTML>

<CENTER><B>WHEN AND HOW TO ENROLL AND MAKE PLAN CHANGES</B></CENTER>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Open Enrollment (Annual)</FONT>

<P>
Enrolling is easy!  After you complete your Enrollment Worksheet, simply call the CU Benefits Line from any touch-tone phone.  The CU Benefits Line lets you select your benefits at your convenience - seven days a week - during the annual Open Enrollment Period.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Before You Enroll</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Review the Enrollment Workbook. For each benefit option, determine which choice is right for you &#009;&#009;and your family in 1997.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Once you have decided on a particular coverage choice, find the appropriate step on the Enrollment &#009;&#009;Worksheet. (For reference, your 1996 elections are shown in boldface print in the left hand column).  &#009;&#009;Circle the number next to your choice. This number corresponds to the numbered buttons on your

<P>
&#009;telephone, i.e., * on the Enrollment Worksheet correspond to * on your telephone keypad.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Write the cost of your election in the column labeled "Monthly Cost."

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Call the CU Benefits Line.  You will be asked for your Personal Identification Number (PIN) which is &#009;&#009;printed to the left of your address on the Enrollment Worksheet. Enter your 1997 benefit elections.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;When you confirm your elections at the end of the call, you will be enrolled for your 1997 benefits!

<P>
&#009;If you don't confirm your choices or you hang up before you confirm them, your elections will not be &#009;&#009;processed. Your benefit elections are effective January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997. Once &#009;&#009;Open Enrollment ends, you cannot change your elections until the next annual Open Enrollment, &#009;&#009;unless you have a qualifying event which changes your family status.

<P>
You will receive a printed Confirmation Statement listing your benefits elections. If your Statement shows the coverage you want, file it with your other important papers. If your Statement is incorrect or you wish to make a change, you must call the CU Benefits Line again to change your elections. You may call the CU Benefits Line as often as you want through the end of Open Enrollment.

<P>
Please do not wait until the end of Open Enrollment to call. Although there are many phone lines available, there is the chance that you may get a busy signal if you call during the last few days of your enrollment period.

<P>
&#009;You must call the CU Benefits Line by the date indicated on your Enrollment Worksheet. DO NOT &#009;&#009;RETURN YOUR PERSONALIZED ENROLLMENT WORKSHEET.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">if you don't call...</FONT>

<P>
by the deadline shown on your Enrollment Worksheet, your current coverage will continue.

<P>
<B>Exceptions: 1) You must re-enroll in the Reimbursement Accounts if you wish to participate for 1997. <BR>
2) If you are enrolled in the State of Colorado Premier or Healthy Path for 1996, you must select a new health plan for 1997.</B>

<P>
Use the following diagram to enroll for your 1997 benefits during Open Enrollment.

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table12.gif">

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">NOTE: </FONT>If you and your dependents (if applicable) are currently enrolled in a University or State of Colorado Health plan, you may enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver during Open Enrollment and no pre-existing condition limitation will apply.

<P>
If you and your dependents (if applicable) are not currently enrolled in a University or State of Colorado Health Plan, pre-existing condition limitations will apply when enrolling in CU Gold or CU Silver. Pre-existing condition limitations do not apply to State of Colorado health plans.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">New Employees</FONT>

<P>
Your Campus Benefits Office will provide the necessary enrollment forms. Remember, you must enroll within 31 days of becoming eligible for benefits, or you must wait for the next annual Open Enrollment to select most plans.

<P>
If you fail to enroll in a timely manner, you will default to CU Gold without dental, employee coverage.  If you wish to waive health insurance coverage, you must complete a University of Colorado waiver form.

<P>
If you have questions, contact your Campus Benefits Office.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Loss of Health/Dental Coverage at Another Employer</FONT>

<P>
If you and/or your dependents have been covered by non-University health/dental insurance under a spouse's policy and if the coverage is no longer available, the employee and dependents may enroll in a CU plan within 31 days of the following qualifying events:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Death of spouse

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Separation from employment

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Divorce or legal separation

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Loss of eligibility with other employer

<P>
If the loss of health/dental insurance is for any other reason, the employee and/or dependents must wait until the next Open Enrollment to enroll in a CU plan.

<P>
However, eligible employees will be allowed to enroll in CU Gold, CU Silver, and CU Optional Term Life insurance outside of Open Enrollment, even if they do not meet the above qualifying events, by completing a Medical Disclosure Statement for themselves and eligible dependents. If the employee and dependents are accepted by Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company, coverage will be provided subject to any pre-existing condition limitations.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Adding Dependents to Health/Dental Plans During the Plan Year</FONT>

<P>
Dependents may be enrolled within 31 days of eligibility, which includes the following qualifying events:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Marriage

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Adoption (No pre-existing condition limitations apply to dependent.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Birth (No pre-existing condition limitations apply to dependent. For the first 31 days<BR>
&#009;from the date of birth, the newborn child is covered subject to coordination of benefits <BR>
&#009;provisions. However, coverage ends after 31 days if the newborn child is not enrolled <BR>
&#009;and the appropriate premium has not been applied.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Child returning home (Employee has financial responsibility for child.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Court decree specifying dependent coverage

<P>
It is your responsibility to notify your campus Benefits Office when your dependents have a change in eligibility status. Dependents who are not enrolled during the initial 31 days of eligibility may be enrolled during Open Enrollment. Eligible dependents may be allowed to enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver even if they do not meet one of the above qualifying events and if you are not enrolled in the CU Flex P.O.P. (requires completion of a Medical Disclosure Statement). If the dependents are accepted by Great-West Life, coverage is subject to the pre-existing condition limitation.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Loss of Health/Dental Eligibility for Dependents</FONT>

<P>
A dependent is covered through the calendar year in which he or she turns 23. After that date, or when the child is no longer financially dependent on you, the child is no longer eligible for dependent coverage. It is your responsibility to contact your campus Benefits Office at least 1 month before the dependent becomes ineligible.

<P>
Dependents age 23 or older who are mentally or physically handicapped may be eligible for continued coverage. Contact your campus Benefits Office for additional information.

<P>
Dependents who are no longer eligible for health/dental coverage may extend their CU coverage through COBRA (see Separation from CU Employment and Continuation of Health Coverage [COBRA], page 47), at additional premium cost.

(See the list of qualifying events on page 28.)

<P>
The IRS has created guidelines for dependent care accounts:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The amount excluded from taxation is limited to $5,000 ($2,500 for a married <BR>
&#009;person filing separately and $2,500 if each spouse has an account). The amount <BR>
&#009;excluded cannot exceed the taxable income of an unmarried employee or the <BR>
&#009;income earned by either the employee or the employee's spouse, whichever is less.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The expenses must be for the care of an eligible dependent and necessary so that<BR>
&#009;you (and your spouse, if you are married) can work.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;A dependent is defined as anyone you claim on your income tax return. In <BR>
&#009;addition, to qualify for dependent care expenses, your dependent must be under <BR>
&#009;age 13 or, if older, physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;Payment cannot be made for care provided by someone claimed as a dependent <BR>
&#009;on your income tax return (e.g., husband, wife, or child). If care is provided to a <BR>
&#009;dependent by a day-care center, the center must comply with all state and local <BR>
&#009;laws. Any expenses claimed through this account cannot also be claimed as a tax <BR>
&#009;credit on your income tax return.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;The guidelines prohibit a family with only one working spouse from participating,<BR>
&#009;unless the nonworking spouse is a full-time student or is unable to care for <BR>
&#009;himself/herself, in which case up to $400 per month for two or more dependents,<BR>
&#009;or $200 for one dependent, can be considered income for day-care reimbursement <BR>
&#009;purposes. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">*</FONT>&#009;A full-time student is defined as someone attending school on a full-time basis <BR>
&#009;(full-time status as defined by the institution) for at least five months per calendar <BR>
&#009;year (not necessarily five consecutive months). A student attending only at night<BR>
&#009;does not necessarily qualify as full time; however, a full-time student can attend <BR>
&#009;some night classes.

<P>
<I>The above guidelines are for general reference only. Please see your financial planner, CPA, attorney, or the IRS for guidance if you are considering a dependent care account.</I>

<P>
Health Care and Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts are separate and cannot be mixed for reimbursement purposes. In other words, you cannot be reimbursed for dependent care expenses from your Health Care Reimbursement Account, or vice versa.

<P>
Each year during Open Enrollment, you choose the amount you want deducted from your paycheck and deposited into your Dependent Care Reimbursement Account. The University deducts this money before taxes are calculated.

<P>
Before you choose the amount you want deducted, it is important that you consider your benefit needs and carefully estimate expenses for the year. Any amount you deposit to your Dependent Care Reimbursement Account that is not used for eligible expenses is forfeited at the end of the plan year. It is advisable to be conservative when estimating your expenses.

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Separation from Employment </FONT>

<P>
Upon separation (termination) from employment (including retirement), the following applies to your CU-Flex options:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Premium Only Plan (P.O.P.)</FONT>

<P>
Your P.O.P. election ends as of your last paycheck (date of separation).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Health Care Reimbursement Account</FONT>

<P>
You may only submit claims for expenses incurred before the date of separation, unless you elect continuation of health benefits coverage (COBRA).

<P>
This account is held open through March 31, following the year in which you terminate, die, retire, become totally disabled, are laid off, take a leave of absence, or are no longer eligible for University of Colorado or State of Colorado health/dental and life insurance plans. 

<P>
While your account remains open, you or your beneficiary may file a claim for eligible expenses incurred prior to termination of participation in the plan. Refer to the Continuation of Health Coverage Option (COBRA) if you wish to participate in the plan after employment has ended (see below). 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Dependent Care Reimbursement Account</FONT>

<P>
If you have a remaining balance in your Dependent Care Reimbursement Account upon termination, this account is held open through March 31 of the following year. Claims may be submitted for eligible expenses incurred prior to your date of termination during the plan year in which you terminate your dependent care account.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Continuation of Benefits Coverage (COBRA)</FONT>

<P>
If you or your covered dependents experience a qualifying event under COBRA, you have the right to continue to participate for the remainder of the plan year in which the qualifying event occurs. You have access to the amounts in your Health Care Reimbursement Account for expenses incurred after the qualifying event date only as long as you continue to make the required monthly contribution. After termination of employment or participation due to a qualifying event, your contribution is made with after-tax dollars. This selection must be made in writing at time of the qualifying event by contacting your campus Benefits Office.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">4.&#009;Filing Claims for Reimbursement</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Reimbursement of Health and Dependent Care Expenses </FONT>

<P>
Information on how to file health care and dependent care reimbursement claims and the rules governing the filing of claims are found in your Summary Plan Description.

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts</FONT>

<P>
The amount of pre-tax dollars you deposit in your account builds up over the course of the year. As you incur expenses, you can claim reimbursement from your account. You can only be reimbursed for expenses up to the current amount in your account. For example, if you submit an eligible expense for $1,200 in January and you are allocating $100 per month to your account, you are reimbursed $100 per month automatically. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#3E539F">For All Reimbursement Accounts</FONT>

<P>
Eligible expenses incurred between January 1 and December 31 are eligible for reimbursement from funds allocated for that year, as long as you are a participant in the plan. The date the service is rendered is the incurred date (not the date you are billed for the service). Your account remains open through March 31 of the following year to allow claims for eligible expenses incurred during the prior year to be processed.

<P>
When you receive reimbursement checks, a new claim form is automatically included. If you need more claim forms, please contact your campus Benefits Office or CompuSys.

This Workbook was designed to help you understand the University of Colorado's benefits program. If you have any questions or need additional information, please contact your Campus Benefits Office.

<P>
Every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information in this Workbook. However, in cases of a conflict between this material and the actual Plan documents, the legal documents will prevail. Although the University of Colorado expects to continue this program indefinitely, it reserves the right to change, modify or terminate it in the future.

<P>
In addition, our benefit programs are administered in accordance with the Equal Employment Opportunity policy which states that the University of Colorado will continue to recruit, train, hire, promote and other-wise deal with all applicants and employees regardless of actual or perceived race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, marital status, alienage or citizenship status or actual status as a Vietnam era veteran or disabled veteran; and to provide reasonable accommodations for disabled workers. The policy also assures employees of freedom from sexual harassment in the workplace.

<CENTER><B>MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PLAN CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
As a Medicare-eligible retired faculty member, CU Retirement Plan retiree, Officer of the University and/or surviving spouse, you are eligible to choose one of two plans: CU Medicare Supplement (administered by Great-West Life Assurance) or the Kaiser Permanente Medicare Plus plan.

<P>
The plans are not available to classified staff, unclassified staff and professional exempt retirees with PERA retirement.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">CU Medicare Supplement Plan</FONT>

<P>
This plan provides supplemental benefits to the services and care that are covered under Medicare. Medicare pays benefits first before this plan provides any benefits. The CU Medicare Supplement covers items like Medicare deductibles and certain services that are not covered under Medicare. The chart on page 14 illustrates some of the services covered under this plan.

<P>
If you are not a new retiree and are enrolling for the first time, the plan includes a three-month pre-existing condition limitation. This means that benefits will not be provided if medical attention or treatment for that condition was received within the three months before coverage became effective. This limitation is waived if you are transferring from another CU health care plan into the CU Medicare Supplement plan.

<P>
When you elect this plan, you will first file any claim for benefits with Medicare (except for outpatient prescription drugs). Then, you will follow these guidelines:

<P>
Services Provided Within The United States &#173; Once your claim has been processed with Medicare and they have paid the appropriate benefits, you will need to forward the Medicare Explanation of 

<P>
Benefits form to Great-West Life for processing. Any additional covered amounts will then be paid directly to you by Great-West Life. 

<P>
Out-of-Country Claims &#173; Generally, Medicare does not cover any service you receive outside of the United States. However, the CU Medicare Supplement plan does provide coverage in these circumstances. Please contact your campus Benefits Office for assistance.

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table2.gif">

<P>
<I>
These benefits are subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the contracts issued and applicable state laws. Note: Medicare benefits are subject to change. This chart is based on 1996 Medicare rates.
</I>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Kaiser Permanente Medicare Plus Plan</FONT>

<P>
This plan is available to faculty retirees who live within a Kaiser service area, which includes the Denver/ Boulder area (not available in the Colorado Springs area). It is a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) which has facilities throughout the United States. Here's how it works.

<P>
You pay a copayment each time you receive certain services and the HMO pays the remaining cost for your treatment. To receive benefits from the HMO, your Personal Care Physician (PCP) must coordinate all your medical care (including referrals to specialists), and you must use the doctors, hospitals and other providers within the HMO network (otherwise you pay the full cost of your care).

<P>
You and each covered family member need to choose a PCP to coordinate care. If you are covering dependents who live outside your immediate area or have a second home in another area, read the HMO literature to make sure care can be received in these other areas. An emergency care provision is included for services provided where a Kaiser facility is not available.

<P>
When you enroll for this coverage, all you pay is the copayment amount when you receive service. There are no Medicare or other claim forms to complete or file.

There are no pre-existing condition limitations with the Kaiser Permanente Medicare Plus plan. Remember, when you select this plan, your PCP directs your medical care and must be consulted before seeking treatment. Before selecting this plan, you may want to visit the facilities, meet a physician and check the office hours and convenience of office location.  &#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Open Enrollment</FONT>

<P>
Once you have made your health plan choice, refer to Step 1A on your Enrollment Worksheet to select health plan coverage. Circle the number of the health plan choice and level of coverage you want. Enter the monthly cost in the right hand column. Remember, if you are selecting coverage for someone in addition to yourself, to refer to Step 1B. And, if you select coverage from CU Gold or CU Silver, select a PCP for yourself and each family member covered.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">No Medical Coverage</FONT>

<P>
You may waive coverage during Open Enrollment by calling the CU Benefits Line or, as a new retiree, by signing a University of Colorado waiver form.  Forms are available through your Campus Benefits Office.

<CENTER><B>LIFE INSURANCE CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
Life insurance helps provide financial security for you and your family. Each family's life insurance needs are different and your life insurance needs may change over time, based on your income, assets, and financial obligations. All faculty, unclassified staff and professional exempt employees who are eligible for health insurance coverage are automatically covered by the Basic Term Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance Plan. Because each family's needs are different, the University offers a number of additional life insurance choices:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;CU Optional Term Life Insurance

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Personal Accident Insurance

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;PERA Prudential Life Insurance (PERA members only)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;PERA Rocky Mountain Life Insurance (PERA members only)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Basic Term Life and Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D) Insurance</FONT>

<P>
The University provides you with Basic Term Life Insurance in the amount of $50,000, and Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) benefits in the amount of $50,000. This means that if your death is the result of an accident, your beneficiary would receive a death benefit of $50,000 from Basic Term Life Insurance and another $50,000 from AD&amp;D Insurance benefits. If you are terminally ill, the plan provides an accelerated death benefit which lets you take a portion of your life insurance proceeds while you are living.

<P>
All active employees who are eligible for a CU health plan receive this coverage at no charge. If eligible, you may purchase additional amounts of Term Life insurance with the CU Optional Term Life Insurance plan.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">CU Optional Term Life Insurance Plan</FONT>

<P>
If you are eligible, you may choose Optional Term Life Insurance coverage for yourself, for your spouse and for your eligible children through Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">For You</FONT>

<P>
You may elect optional term life insurance and AD&amp;D coverage in increments of $10,000 up to a maximum benefit of $500,000. If you elect coverage of more than $300,000, that amount cannot exceed three times your salary. You do not have to provide evidence of insurability for coverage up to $100,000 if you apply for coverage within 31 days of your eligible employment. If you elect coverage greater than $100,000 or apply for coverage after your initial eligibility period, you will be required to provide evidence of <BR>
insurability.

<P>
For instance, upon employment John elected $150,000 in additional term life insurance coverage. <BR>
To make this election, he will need to provide evidence of insurability for $50,000 in coverage <BR>
($150,000 - $100,000 = $50,000).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">For Your Spouse</FONT>

<P>
If you have elected coverage for yourself, you may elect up to an equal amount of coverage for your spouse. Evidence of insurability is required for coverage exceeding $100,000 or if you apply for coverage after your initial eligibility period.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">For Your Dependent Children </FONT>

<P>
If you have elected coverage for yourself, you can elect coverage for your dependent children. You have two choices for coverage for dependent children: $10,000 in coverage for each child covered ($1,000 for infants - 14 days to 6 months of age) or $5,000 in coverage for each child ($500 for infants - 14 days to 6 months of age).

<P>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Enrollment, Separation from Employment, and Retirement</FONT>

<P>
You may enroll for up to $100,000 of coverage in the CU Optional Term Life plan as a new employee if you do so within 31 days of your benefits-eligible employment. Enrollment at any other time or for amounts exceeding the guaranteed issue amount requires completion of a Medical Disclosure Statement and its approval by the Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company. Coverage begins with the payroll deduction effective the month following the date of approval.

<P>
All optional term life insurance coverage terminates at the end of the last month for which a premium was deducted from your paycheck. The Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company can provide information about how you can continue your life insurance coverage on an individual basis. For contact information, see Important Addresses/Phone Numbers at the back of this booklet.

<P>
When you retire, you may elect $3,000 coverage or 25% of your pre-retirement coverage up to a maximum benefit of $12,500. Dependent life and the accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D) portion of the CU Term Life Insurance plan ends when you retire.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Beneficiary Designations</FONT>

<P>
You must designate a beneficiary for the CU Basic Life Insurance and the CU Optional Term Life Insurance you choose for yourself and your spouse. You are automatically the beneficiary for any insurance you purchase for your dependent children.

<P>
If you currently have a beneficiary designation on file and are not changing your life insurance coverage, you only need to file a new form if you wish to change beneficiaries. If you wish to make a life insurance coverage change during Open Enrollment, you will be mailed a Life Insurance Beneficiary Update Form.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Personal Accident Insurance </FONT>

<P>
Through the Prudential Life Insurance Company, the University offers you a Personal Accident Insurance plan that provides coverage for accidental death or loss of hands, feet or eyesight. This plan also includes a limited disability benefit. You must have an appointment with the University of 50% or greater to be eligible

<P>
for this plan. You may elect coverage for your spouse up to the amount elected for yourself, and you may cover your children as well, provided you have elected coverage for yourself.  

<P>
You elect the amount of coverage you want in multiples of $10,000. The maximum amount you may elect is $250,000 (for amounts over $100,000, you may not elect more than 10 times your salary).   

<P>
This plan has two parts:

<P>
<B>Accident benefit </B>- If you should suffer a loss of life or limb as the result of an accident, the plan will pay a benefit based on the severity of the accident to you or your beneficiary. 

<P>
<B>Disability benefit </B>- If you are younger than age 60, the plan provides a benefit to you if you become totally disabled within 30 days of a covered accident. If you remain totally disabled one year after the accident, you will continue receiving benefits for up to 500 weeks.

<CENTER><B>MAKING YOUR CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
With CU Benefits you make the benefit choices which are right for you and your family. As you make your decisions, be sure to carefully evaluate your needs now and in the coming year. Since each of us has different needs, the benefits you choose will probably be different from those your co-workers choose. For example, if you are single, you may decide that Basic Life Insurance Plan coverage is the right choice for you. Your co-worker who is married with two children may elect a higher level of Optional Life Insurance Plan coverage and may elect to cover his or her spouse and dependent children.

<CENTER><B>LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE</B></CENTER>

<P>
No one likes to think about it but if you or a family member became ill and needed home health care or nursing home care, how would those special needs be met? The University of Colorado's Long-Term Care Insurance plan through CNA provides long-term care (LTC) protection and peace of mind.

<P>
If you are age 79 or younger, you can purchase LTC insurance. You may elect coverage for your spouse as long as you have elected coverage for yourself. Your parents, parents-in-law, grandparents and grandparents-in-law through the age of 79 are also eligible to apply for coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Long-Term Care Benefits</FONT>

<P>
The plan covers both nursing home facilities and community-based care in the United States.  The plan offers two levels of benefits:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;The moderate level pays $100/day of nursing home stay and $75/day for community-based care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;The high level pays up to $135/day of nursing home stay and $101.25/day for community-based care.

<P>
The plan provides a lifetime maximum benefit, of up to three years of nursing home care or six years of community-based care if used every day without interruption. The plan also provides a respite benefit to private residence caregivers who have been providing care for at least six months. The plan will pay for up to 14 days of long-term care so that the regular caregiver can be relieved of his or her duties temporarily.

<P>
The plan includes a six-month pre-existing condition limitation.  This means that benefits will not be provided if medical attention or treatment leading to long-term care was received within the six months before coverage became effective.

<P>
Benefits begin when:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;you have been in covered service (in nursing home care) for 60 days or 15 days (in community-based &#009;&#009;care); and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;you have a qualified impairment (assistance is needed in at least two of the following activities: eating, &#009;&#009;dressing, bathing, toileting, general mobility and continence or you have a cognitive impairment (such &#009;&#009;as Alzheimer's disease).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">issues to consider</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have elderly parents or grandparents that may require constant care?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Would a serious injury or illness requiring constant care deplete your finances?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have coverage elsewhere?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Who would care for you in a long-term care situation?

<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Open Enrollment</FONT>

<P>
Once you have made your long-term care insurance choice, refer to Step 3 on your Enrollment Worksheet.  For those not eligible for life insurance, long-term care insurance is Step 2 on your Enrollment Worksheet.  Circle your election and enter the monthly cost in the right hand column. An enrollment form will be mailed to you. Before coverage begins, your application must be approved by the CNA Insurance Company.

The purpose of this policy statement is to set forth guidelines for the use of acting or interim appointments for administrative positions.  Administrative positions include officer positions, unclassified administrative positions, and all other administrative appointments including department chairs and associate and assistant deans.  Classified staff positions are covered by the Rules of the State Personnel system.<P><B>STATEMENT OF POLICIES</B><P>1.	All standard appointments to administrative positions will be made in accordance with search procedures specified in the Laws of the Regents, University policies, and/or the campus affirmative action plan.<P>2.	An acting or interim appointment may be used to fill an administrative position on a temporary basis if it is determined by the administrator's hiring authority that a vacancy in the position will result in a disruption of normal University or campus activities during the period of the search.  For the purposes of this policy, the terms "acting" or "interim" are used interchangeably.<P>3.	All acting appointments to administrative positions must be approved by the Chancellor, the President and the Board of Regents.<P>4.	Acting appointments will not normally be filled by persons outside the University.<P>5.	The duration of an acting appointment must be specified by the hiring authority.  The duration may be time-specific or until a standard appointment is made.  Usually, standard appointments to vacant positions should be made as soon as possible given the circumstances of the vacancy and in the best interests of the University.  Extensions of time-specific acting appointments must be approved by the President and the Board of Regents.<P>6.	When a person accepts an acting appointment, one of the following options may be exercised with respect to his/her former position depending on the nature of the administrative position:<P>	A.	the person may retain the former position and assume further responsibilities of the acting position;<P>	B.	the hiring authority for the former position may agree not to make a standard appointment to that position while the employee is in the acting position; or<P>	C.	the person may resign from the former position.<P>	The option to be exercised will be specified in writing and will be agreed to in writing by the person accepting the acting appointment, the hiring authority for the position, and the hiring authority for the former position.<P>7.	The person appointed to an acting position will not be prohibited, as a condition of the acting appointment, from being a candidate for the permanent position.<P>8.	The salary of the person appointed to an acting administrative position will be recommended by his/her hiring authority consistent with market conditions, education and experience of the individual, and comparable positions, and will be subject to the regular approval process.<P>9.	If a person in an acting position is not selected for the standard appointment:<P>	A. 	he/she may return to the prior position in accord with 6.B. above and in compliance with the laws of the State of Colorado*; or<P>	B. 	 if the person elected to resign from the prior position (6.C. above), the University will have no obligation for future employment of the individual.<P>10.	If an acting appointment is converted into a standard appointment as a result of search procedures, the appointment and salary will be handled as in any new appointment and will be approved by the Chancellor, the President and the Board of Regents.<P>11.	Classified staff members who accept an acting administrative position will be covered by the Rules of the State Personnel System. <P>12.	Benefits to be accrued during the person's tenure in an acting position (i.e., vacation, sick leave, perquisites) will be determined in advance of the person accepting the acting position and will be specified in writing.<P><P>*The laws of the State of Colorado, specifically C.R.S. 24-19-101, et seq. require that unclassified employees be subject to termination at any time during the term of the appointment and that these employees be deemed to be employees-at-will.

This Committee received testimonyand recommendations from faculty, staff, and administrators andreviewed the selection processes of selected institutions.  Thecommittee's recommendations were adopted by the Board of Regentson December 17, 1992.<BR><P>The Board also resolved that pertinent sections of the Laws ofthe Regents, 1990, and Administrative Policy be revised in accordancewith the recommendations adopted in December 1992.  Revised sectionsof the Laws were approved May 20, 1993.  To respond to the sameresolution, this policy updates and revises previous administrativepolicy.   <BR><P><U><B>DEFINITIONS<BR></B></U><P><U><I>Prospect</I></U>:  As used in this policy, <I>prospect</I>refers to any individual nominated or applying for a position,whether the person has agreed to be considered or not.<BR><P><U><I>Candidate</I></U>:  A <I>prospect</I> becomes a <I>candidate</I>only when he/she has agreed to visit the University for a formalinterview. <BR><P><U><I>Supervisory Authority</I> </U>:  The officer to whom theselected candidate will report.  In the case of a search committeefor President, the supervisory authority is the Board of Regents.<BR><P><U><B>STATEMENT OF POLICY<BR></B></U><P>   Leadership is crucial to the future of the University.  Effectiveprocesses for attracting prospective University leaders are essentialto the strength and future of the University. <BR><P>   Members of the search committees play a critical role in thesuccess of each of the University's campuses as well as the system. A search committee member takes on a great responsibility notonly as a constituency representative but also as a representativeof all members of the University community.  It is extremely importantthat distinguished  members of the University community serveon search committees, that they consent to serve, and that theirefforts be committed to the objectives of the search.<BR><P>   The search process shall be completed in accordance with affirmativeaction and non-discrimination policies. <BR><P>   The search committee procedure shall focus on attracting andselecting prospects rather than eliminating them.  The reviewof internal prospects shall be ensured.<BR><P>   All searches shall be conducted in a timely and professionalmanner that respects the rights to confidentiality of prospectsand candidates.<BR><P>   The Office of the Vice President for Administration is chargedwith the responsibility for ensuring oversight and implementationof this policy.<BR><BR><P><U><B>STATEMENT OF PROCEDURES<BR></B></U><P>  I. <U>Search Committee Mandated</U><P> <P>  The search committee process, as provided in this policy, ismandated when vacancies occur in the positions of President, VicePresidents, Chancellors, Vice Chancellors, and Deans of the Collegesand Schools.<P><I>  Note:  The selection of persons to serve as Associate orAssistant Vice Presidents, Associate or Assistant Deans, and Associateor Assistant Vice Chancellors, is a matter of administrative determinationsince these administrators serve primarily at the pleasure ofthe Vice President, Dean, or Vice Chancellor. <BR></I><P><B> </B>II.<B> </B><U>Search Committee Composition<BR></U><P>  Membership requirements for search committees are set forthin Attachment A of this policy.  With regard to all search committeesunder this policy, the following procedures apply:<BR><P> A. The Campus<B> </B>Affirmative Action Officer will serve exofficio as a member of the search committee.<BR><P> B. In the selection of search committee members, the supervisoryauthority may appoint a committee member whether nominated ornot.<BR><P><B> </B>III.<B> </B><U>Search Authorization<BR></U><P> The search committee should be constituted and the search processcommenced as quickly as is reasonably possible after it becomesknown that an administrative vacancy will occur.  The Office ofthe Vice President for Administration is charged with administrativeresponsibility for ensuring that administrative vacancies arefilled in accordance with Regent policy.  A search authorizationwill be prepared by the supervisory authority and will include:<BR><P> A. the charge to the search committee, including affirmativeaction requirements and considerations of timing;<BR><P> B. a position description that details (1) minimum qualificationsfor the position, (2) compensation information including any perquisitesof the position and the recent compensation history, (3) positionresponsibilities, and (4) discussion of any special criteria andissues regarding the position.<BR><P> A copy of the search authorization will accompany letters ofappointment to members of the search committee. <BR><P><B> </B>IV<B>. </B><U>Search Committee Chair<BR></U><P> The supervisory authority may appoint the search committee chairor may request the committee to select its own chair.  The chairwill inform prospects that the committee's procedures consistof a selection process rather than an elimination process.  Thechair also will keep prospects advised of the committee's progress. In the case of a search committee for President, the search committeechair will be a member of the Board of Regents.<BR><P><B> </B>V<B>. </B><U>Search Committee Process<BR></U><P> A. Recruitment plan/timeline:  The supervisory authority andsearch committee shall agree on a recruitment plan and a targetdate for completing the search.  The recruitment plan shall includea review of whether institutional priorities and affirmative actionrequirements are best served by a state, regional, or nationalsearch.  (See section VII on use of professional consultants.)<BR><P> B. Search committee budget:  The supervisory authority, withadvice of the search committee, will develop a search budget. Proposed budgets will be transmitted to the Vice President forAdministration for review and approval.<BR><P> C. Preferred Qualities:  The supervisory authority, in consultationwith the search committee, will determine the most important qualitiesand skills possessed by the person chosen for the position.<BR><P> D Review of Internal Prospects:  The search committee will promptlyreview internal nominations and applications.  For campus positions,the supervisory authority will determine whether internal prospectswill be limited to the particular campus or whether internal prospectswill be considered University-wide.  For system positions, internalprospects will be considered University-wide.<BR><P>  If the supervisory authority, with the consultation and adviceof the search committee, identifies qualified internal prospects,interviews with appropriate groups and individuals, as describedbelow in section F, <I>Interviews and Candidate Selection</I>,will take place.  The supervisory authority may select an internalcandidate to present to the Board of Regents for appointment.<P>  <P>  This review of internal prospects shall not impede affirmativeaction requirements.  The supervisory authority will work withthe Campus Affirmative Action Officer to ensure that effectiverecruitment mechanisms for women and minority candidates existand that the search committee is provided information relevantto the identification of women and minority prospects.<I> <BR></I><P> E. Review of External Prospects:<B> </B> If the supervisory authoritydoes not select an internal candidate to present to the Boardof Regents, an appropriate outside search, consistent with thecommittee's recruitment plan, should be pursued.  The absenceof an internal appointment will not disqualify any internal prospectin the remaining search.<BR><P> <P> F. Interviews and Candidate Selection:  After consideration ofthe prospect pool, and with the advice received from the searchcommittee, the supervisory authority shall determine the orderin which the recommended prospects will be interviewed.  The supervisoryauthority shall also have the prerogative to interview a prospectwho has not been recommended by the search committee.  <BR><P> 1) Interviews:  To encourage focused interviews regarding thecandidates' experience, views, and accomplishments, each systemwidecandidate shall be interviewed at a central location by appropriateconstituencies (faculty, staff, students, and alumni if appropriate). A candidate may visit all or some campuses if he or she chooses.<BR><P><B> </B>2)<B> </B>Home Campus Visits:  With the  candidate's<I></I>consent, representative(s) of the search committee may visitthe candidate's<I> </I>home campus.  Presidential and Chancellorcandidates<I> </I>may wish to reject such visits especially ifthey are to include arranged interview sessions with colleagues. Prior to arranging a home campus visit, the chair of the searchcommittee will confirm with the supervisory authority that thecost of such visit will be within the committee's budget limitations.<BR><P> 3) Selection:  If the first candidate interviewed is acceptable,and if negotiations are successfully concluded, he or she willbe selected by the supervisory authority to be presented to theBoard of Regents for appointment.  If the first candidate is notselected, a second prospect will be invited for interviews.  Iftwo or more prospects appear equally qualified, they may be invitedfor interviews before an offer is made.  The supervisory authorityshall be solely responsible for discussions with the candidateconcerning conditions and perquisites of employment in accordancewith applicable administrative policies. <BR><P> VI.<B> </B><U>Confidentiality and Release of Candidate Information<BR></U><P> A. Prior to a visit, the supervisory authority may make publicthe vita and other appropriate information on the candidate withthe permission of each candidate.  <BR><P> B. The search committee chairperson will ensure the confidentialityof the committee proceedings.<BR><P> C. The supervisory authority will designate a sole spokespersonregarding committee activities and the status of the search process.<BR><P> VII.<B> </B><U>Professional Consultants<BR></U><P> A. A professional consulting firm may be employed for a specificpurpose or purposes with the approval of the supervisory authority. In no event will a professional consultant be used as a substitutefor a required search committee.<BR><P> B. The Vice President for Administration will have responsibilityfor ensuring that University search committees are provided withinformation regarding the use of professional consultants or searchfirms.  The Vice President will assist a search committee in identifyingqualified consultants or firms, in defining the responsibilitiesof the consultant or firm, and in negotiating contractual arrangements.<BR><P> VIII.<B> </B><U>Administrative Support<BR></U><P> The supervisory authority will provide the search committee withadequate resources and assistance to carry out the committee'sresponsibilities. <BR><P> IX.<B> </B><U>Central Repository of Search Information<BR></U><P> Final search committee records and reports will be kept in thePresident's Office and, consistent with the University's AdministrativePolicy Statement, &quot;Treatment of Personnel Files for Purposesof the Open Records Act&quot; (pages IV-103 to IV-107), shouldbe designated as personnel files.

<CENTER><B>LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE</B></CENTER>

<P>
No one likes to think about it but if you or a family member became ill and needed home health care or nursing home care, how would those special needs be met? The University of Colorado's Long-Term Care Insurance plan through CNA provides long-term care (LTC) protection and peace of mind.

<P>
You can purchase LTC insurance as long as you work at least 20 hours each week. You may elect coverage for your spouse as long as you have elected coverage for yourself. Your parents, parents-in-law, grandparents and grandparents-in-law through the age of 79 are also eligible to apply for coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Long-Term Care Benefits</FONT>

<P>
The plan covers both nursing home facilities and community-based care in the United States. The plan offers two levels of benefits:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The moderate level pays $100/day of nursing home stay and $75/day for community-based care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The high level pays up to $135/day of nursing home stay and $101.25/day for community-based care.

<P>
The plan provides a lifetime maximum benefit of up to three years of nursing home care or six years of community-based care if used every day without interruption. The plan also provides a respite benefit to private residence caregivers who have been providing care for at least six months. The plan will pay for up to 14 days of long-term care so that the regular caregiver can be relieved of his or her duties temporarily.

<P>
The plan includes a six-month pre-existing condition limitation. This means that benefits will not be provided if medical attention or treatment leading to long-term care was received within the six months before coverage became effective.

<P>
Benefits begin when:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;you have been in covered service (in nursing home care) for 60 days or 15 days (in community-based &#009;&#009;care); and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;you have a qualified impairment (assistance is needed in at least two of the following activities: eating, &#009;&#009;dressing, bathing, toileting, general mobility and continence or you have a cognitive impairment (such &#009;&#009;as Alzheimer's disease).

<P>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">issues to consider</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have elderly parents or grandparents that may require constant care?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Would a serious injury or illness requiring constant care deplete your finances?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have coverage elsewhere?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Who would care for you in a long-term care situation?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">how to enroll</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Open Enrollment</FONT>

<P>
Once you have made your long-term care insurance choice, refer to Step 7 on your Enrollment Worksheet.  Circle your election and enter the monthly cost in the right hand column. Call the CU Benefits Line. An enrollment form will be mailed to you. Before coverage begins, your application must be approved by the CNA Insurance Company.

<CENTER><B>CU-FLEX</B></CENTER>

<P>
CU-Flex provides three options for reducing your taxable salary (subject to IRS and plan limitations). You may choose all three or any combination of options. The three are:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*&#009;</FONT>Premium Only Plan

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Health Care Reimbursement Account

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Dependent Care Reimbursement Account

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Effect on PERA Retirement</FONT>

<P>
If you are a PERA participant, your PERA retirement annuity or disability retirement is based on the average of your three highest annual salary amounts. Since CU-Flex reduces your PERA contributions, the salary on which PERA calculates benefits is reduced. You may not want to participate in CU-Flex during your five highest earning years (typically your last five years of employment).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">A Word About Social Security</FONT>

<P>
Paying your share of the cost of benefits with before-tax dollars reduces the salary on which your and your University's annual contributions to Social Security are calculated. That means that the amount paid to Social Security could be reduced, which may result in a small reduction to the Social Security benefit you receive at retirement. None of your other salary-related benefits are affected by this.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Tax considerations</FONT>

<P>
If you select the Premium Only Plan option, you cannot deduct your health and dental insurance premiums on your federal income tax forms. You should consult your financial planner, CPA, attorney, or the IRS for guidance on how the CU-Flex plan options would affect your personal tax status.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">1. Tax-Savings Example</FONT>

<P>
CU-Flex allows you to pay for eligible insurance, health care, and dependent care expenses with pre-tax dollars. 

<P>
You could reduce taxes and increase take-home pay as illustrated below:

<BR>
(Example assuming W-4 status of Married and claiming four allowances)

(Example assuming W-4 status of Single and claiming two allowances)
<BR>
<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table10.gif">

<P>

For detailed information, please contact your CPA, attorney, or the Internal Revenue Service. Estimate based on 1996 federal and state income tax rates and standard deduction.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Premium Only Plan</FONT>

<P>
To help you get the most from the coverage you select, many of your coverage choices can be paid for on a before-tax basis, through payroll deduction. When premiums are paid through the Premium Only Plan, the amount you contribute toward the cost of your benefits is deducted from your pay before taxes are taken out. This results in a lower taxable income, so you pay less in taxes. Your before-tax and after-tax benefit choices are shown below. To take advantage of this tax break, you must enroll for the CU-Flex Premium Plan (Step 9 on your Enrollment Form).

<P>
CU Benefits offers you the ability to pay for certain out-of-pocket health care and dependent care expenses with before-tax dollars. By spending before-tax dollars, you reduce your current taxable income and pay less in taxes for the year.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Health Care Reimbursement Account</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Your Contributions </FONT>

<P>
You may contribute up to $2,400 each calendar year to the Health Care Reimbursement Account to pay for certain out-of-pocket health care expenses for you or your eligible dependents. Payments are made in equal monthly deductions.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Eligible Expenses</FONT>

<P>
The following are some examples of eligible expenses that qualify for reimbursement from your Health Care Reimbursement Account. (Refer to Appendix A for a more detailed list.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*&#009;</FONT>Canes and crutches,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;hearing examinations and hearing aids,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;medical and dental deductibles, co-payment and coinsurance amounts

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;oral contraceptives,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;other unreimbursed qualifying medical or dental expenses,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;vision care expenses, including:  eye exams, prescription eyeglasses, contact lenses,

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;orthodontic expenses above dental plan limitations, and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;any other health care expenses that are considered medical care under Section 213(d) of the IRS code.

<P>
Expenses reimbursed through the Health Care Reimbursement Account may not be claimed as a deduction on your federal income tax return.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Dependent Care Reimbursement Account</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Your Contributions </FONT>

<P>
You may contribute up to $5,000 each calendar year to the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account to pay for the cost of caring for your eligible dependents, as defined below, so that you (and your spouse, if you are married) can work. Payments are made in equal monthly payroll deductions.

<P>
If you are married, you may contribute up to the maximum amount only if your spouse also works, is a full-time student for at least five months of the calendar year or is disabled. If your spouse contributes to a dependent care account with his or her employer, the combined maximum contribution between the two <BR>
of you cannot exceed $5,000 in any calendar year. In addition, if you are married and file a separate income tax return from your spouse, the maximum amount you may contribute is $2,500 for the calendar year.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Eligible Dependents</FONT>

<P>
An eligible dependent is an individual who lives with you, relies on you for financial support, is claimed as<BR>
a dependent on your federal income tax return and is:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;a child under age 13; or

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;a spouse or dependent (including an elderly relative) who is physically or mentally disabled and cannot &#009;&#009;care for him or herself.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Eligible Expenses</FONT>

<P>
The following are some examples of eligible expenses that qualify for reimbursement from your Dependent Care Reimbursement Account.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;dependent care provided in your home. The caretaker cannot be claimed as a dependent on your federal<BR>
&#009;income tax return and cannot be one of your children under age 19;

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;dependent care provided outside your home, including licensed nursery schools, kindergartens, day &#009;&#009;camps (not overnight camp), legally approved day care centers for children and disabled adults (must &#009;&#009;provide day care for six or more individuals); and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;household services provided by a housekeeper or maid if they are necessary for the care and well-&#009;&#009;being of the dependent.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Important Rules You Should Know</FONT>

<P>
Because of the tax advantages Reimbursement Accounts provide, the federal government imposes strict rules and limitations on how you may use these accounts.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">No Changes</FONT>

<P>
Once you make your Reimbursement Account elections for a calendar year, you cannot change it until the next annual Open Enrollment. In other words, you cannot increase, decrease or cancel your contributions during the year unless you have a qualified change in your family status. The only exceptions are the following qualifying events:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Marriage or divorce

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Legal separation

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Birth or adoption of a child

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Change of legal custody

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Ineligibility of dependent

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Death of spouse

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Death of a child

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Change in spouse's employment status resulting in a loss of coverage or availability of new coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Change in the employee's or spouse's employment status from full-time to part-time or from part-time &#009;&#009;to full-time

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Leave of absence

<P>
Any change in your CU-Flex election must be consistent with the qualifying event.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Separate Accounts</FONT>

<P>
The Health Care Reimbursement Account and the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account are two separate accounts. You cannot use your health care contributions to reimburse yourself for dependent care expenses, and vice versa, even if you have excess contributions in one account and a shortage in the other.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Using Contributions</FONT>

<P>
You can use your Reimbursement Account to reimburse only those expenses you had in the calendar year for which you enroll. For example, a Reimbursement Account set up from January 1, 1997 to December 31, 1997 can be used to reimburse only those expenses you incur during those twelve months.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Unused Balances</FONT>

<P>
It's important that you carefully estimate the amount you are going to contribute to the Reimbursement Accounts before you enroll for the year. Review your health care and dependent care bills from previous years, and estimate any upcoming expenses.

<P>
Use It or Lose It! The IRS requires that any unused balance remaining in either account at the end of the year be forfeited.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">issues to consider</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;What will your deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses be for the health and dental plans you have &#009;&#009;selected?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Do you have any qualifying dependent care expenses?

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Is it more advantageous for you to take a federal tax credit or use the Dependent Care &#009;&#009;&#009;&#009;Reimbursement Account? (Expenses reimbursed through the Dependent Care Reimbursement Account &#009;&#009;are not eligible for the federal tax credit.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Any unused balance remaining in either account at the end of the year will be forfeited.

<CENTER><B>HEALTH PLAN CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
As a faculty, unclassified staff, or professional exempt employee of the University, you are eligible to choose one of four health plans (if available in your area): CU Gold or CU Silver (administered by Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company), CU HMO Colorado, or CU Kaiser Permanente. Each health plan offered through the CU Benefits program provides quality health care and prescription drug coverage for you and your eligible dependents. Depending on your needs, you may choose from five levels of coverage:  employee only, employee plus one, single parent with two or more children, family or split. If you choose to cover your dependents, you must enroll them in the same medical plan that you elect for yourself.

<P>
As you make your health plan decision, keep in mind that if you want dental coverage, your health and dental coverage levels must be the same. For example, if you elect family coverage in a CU health plan, you will automatically receive family coverage in the CU dental plan if dental coverage is elected. 

<P>

<P>
&#009;Kaiser Permanente (outside Colorado Springs)

<P>
&#009;HMO Colorado (Colorado Springs, only unless currently enrolled)

<P>
&#009;No coverage

<P>
Selecting a health plan that is right for you and your family is an important decision. To help you make your selection, we've included descriptions of the CU health options in this Workbook.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">CU Health Plans: <I>Quality First</I></FONT>

<P>
The University offers you a choice of two CU Health Plans: CU Gold and CU Silver. Within each plan you have choices as to where and how you receive care. Both plans allow you to choose how you'll access your medical care each time you need treatment. How you access your medical care determines the level of benefits you'll receive. Of the two CU plans, CU Gold provides higher benefits and costs you less each month than the CU Silver plan. The CU Gold Plan has managed care features incorporated into the plan design which help to contain the costs of health care while assuring appropriate care for you and your family.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">CU Gold</FONT>

<P>
CU Gold is a point-of-service health plan where you decide, when you need medical care, whether or not to use the plan's managed care providers. If you use the managed care network and coordinate your care through your University Affiliates Network (UA Network) Personal Care Physician (PCP), you'll receive the plan's highest level of benefits. If you don't coordinate your care through your PCP, you'll still receive benefits, but at a lower level of coverage.

<P>
<B>Choosing a Personal Care Physician </B> When you first elect coverage in the CU Gold plan, you will need to select a UA Network Personal Care Physician (PCP) who will provide your routine and primary care and refer you to network specialists, as necessary.

<P>
Each family member can have a different PCP. For example, you can choose a pediatrician as the PCP for your children and an internist for yourself. If you are not completely satisfied with the PCP you've chosen, you can change your PCP up to four times each year.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#729A5B">The UA Network</FONT></B>  CU Gold uses the University Affiliates Network (UA Network) as the PCP and specialty network. There are two directories enclosed with this Workbook:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;University Affiliates Network Personal Care Physician Directory

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;University Affiliates Specialist Directory

<P>
Refer to the directories for specific information on participating UA Network physicians, hospitals and other providers.

<P>
To become part of UA Network, each physician's background and credentials were carefully screened and are periodically re-evaluated. All UA Network providers are faculty at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. These physicians practice full-time at CU or in private practice and have been contracted through University Physicians, Inc. and University Hospital to serve the CU health plans. Because all UA Network physicians have faculty appointments through the University of Colorado, you can be assured that the doctors from which you'll choose have met the highest quality standards.

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#729A5B">CU Gold Benefits</FONT></B>  CU Gold includes two levels of benefits. What the plan pays depends on where you receive your care.

<P>
UA Network Care  When you receive care through your PCP, there is no annual deductible and no coinsurance amounts to pay. All you pay is an up front copayment.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;$10 for visits to the doctor

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;$100 per hospital stay - no limit on the number of days allowed

<P>
Another advantage to receiving your care from your PCP is that there are no claim forms to file.

<P>
Out-of-Network Care  Health care is a very personal issue and while the UA Network is comprehensive enough to provide just about any care you need, you or a family member may choose to see a physician who is not in the UA Network. An Out-of-Network care option is provided in CU Gold to accommodate those circumstances.

<P>
With Out-of-Network care, before benefits are payable you need to satisfy a $300 individual annual deductible. (The family annual deductible is $900.) The deductible and coinsurance also apply if you receive care from a UA Network doctor, but for whom you did not get a referral from your PCP. Once the deductible is met, CU Gold pays 70% of reasonable and customary charges. Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance expenses reach $3,000 ($9,000 for a family), CU Gold pays 100% of covered reasonable and customary charges for the rest of the calendar year. (Expenses that exceed reasonable and customary are your responsibility.)

<P>
The chart on p.8 provides an overview of how benefits are paid in CU Gold for UA Network and

<P>
Out-of-Network care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">CU Silver</FONT>

<P>
CU Silver is a preferred provider network health plan. You can receive medical care from any provider you choose, but when you receive care from a UA Network provider, you receive the highest benefits from the plan.

<P>
<B>A Choice of Networks</B>  In CU Silver there are two preferred provider networks: University Affiliates (UA) Network and Great-West Life (GWL) "One Health" PPO Network.

<P>
<B>UA Network Care</B>  When you receive care from a UA Network provider you receive the highest benefits available in CU Silver. You do not have to satisfy a deductible before benefits are paid and you pay only

<P>
a small copayment for most services. Certain benefits such as health screenings, risk assessments and routine physical exams are payable only when you use a UA Network provider.

<P>
<B>GWL "One Health" PPO Network Care</B>  The next highest level of benefits is provided through Great-West Life (GWL) PPO Network providers. Care you receive from a GWL PPO Network provider is reimbursed at 80% of covered charges, once you satisfy a $200 individual annual deductible ($600 for a family).

<P>
Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance expenses in any year reach $2,000 ($6,000 for a family), CU Silver pays 100% of covered expenses for the rest of the calendar year.

<P>
<B>Out-of-Network Care</B>  In CU Silver you can receive care from an Out-of-Network provider and still receive benefits. Because Out-of-Network providers do not have any agreements with CU to hold down the cost of care, CU Silver pays the lowest reimbursements for Out-of-Network care. Benefits are payable at 60% after you satisfy a $400 annual individual deductible ($1,200 for a family). Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance costs reach $4,000 ($12,000 for a family), the plan pays 100% of covered reasonable and customary expenses for the rest of the calendar year. (Expenses that exceed reasonable and customary are your responsibility.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Prescription Drug Coverage</FONT>

<P>
When you enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver, your prescription drug benefits are provided through the PCS Prescription Drug Card Program. For your long-term prescription drug needs, both CU Gold and CU Silver include a Mail Order Program.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">The PCS Prescription Drug Card Program</FONT>

<P>
This program offers two levels of benefits: The "Quality First" Network and Out-of-Network. You will receive the highest level of benefits available through the program by using a "Quality First" Network Pharmacy. If you have your prescriptions filled at an Out-of-Network Pharmacy, you'll receive a slightly lower benefit level. A list of "Quality First" Network pharmacies is included in your Enrollment Packet.

<P>
Here are the benefits by plan:

<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Mail Order Prescription Drug Program  </FONT>

<P>
If you take medication on an on-going basis, you can save money on these prescription drugs through the Mail Order Prescription Drug Program, which is administered through the CU School of Pharmacy. You can receive up to a 90-day supply of your prescription drug for one low copayment. You pay $6 or 20% of the cost, whichever is greater. You can be assured maximum savings by buying generic whenever possible.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Mental Health, Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency Treatment Coverage</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">UMHS (University Mental Health Services)</FONT>

<P>
This program is designed to evaluate and direct you to the appropriate treatment for mental health, alcoholism and chemical dependency problems. The program offers two levels of benefits: Network (UMHS) and Out-of-Network. When you receive care through UMHS directly, you receive the higher level of benefits for outpatient and inpatient care, without paying any deductibles. You pay only a small copayment when you receive care. UMHS coordinates all services and providers and monitors your progress.

<P>
Unless there is an emergency situation requiring immediate hospitalization, your first visit will be to University Mental Health Services where a mental health professional will evaluate your needs and, if necessary, refer you and/or your eligible family members for appropriate treatment. Your copayment will be $10 with CU Gold and $15 with CU Silver (maximum of two sessions).

<P>
<I>In case of an emergency, UMHS can be reached by calling (303) 315-4940 or (800) 349-4940 (any hour). For all other preauthorizations, UMHS offices should be called between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday <BR>
through Friday.</I>

<P>
If you are referred by UMHS for outpatient treatment, you will receive a specific referral from a mental health professional who will discuss options and costs. Referrals by UMHS for inpatient care will be based on the type of treatment required and the desired location. Copayments will vary depending on the facility used.

<P>
<I>In case you are unable to receive precertification because of an emergency inpatient admission, you must contact UMHS within 48 hours of admission.</I>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Out-of-Network</FONT>

<P>
When you select providers that are Out-of-Network, you are still required to call UMHS and have your care preauthorized - for outpatient care or preapproved - for inpatient care. Some services require meeting a separate plan deductible before receiving any benefits.

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table1.gif">

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Health Option</FONT>

<P>
The University also offers HMO health plan coverage. The HMO you are eligible to elect depends on where you live. You may select coverage through Kaiser Permanente provided you don't live in Colorado Springs. For those living in Colorado Springs, you may elect HMO Colorado coverage.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">How HMO's Work</FONT>

<P>
You pay a copayment each time your receive certain services and the HMO pays the remaining cost for your treatment. To receive benefits from the HMO, your PCP must coordinate all your medical care (including referrals to specialists), and you must use the doctors, hospitals and other providers within the HMO network (otherwise you pay the full cost of your care).

<P>
You and each covered family member need to choose a PCP to coordinate your care. If you are covering dependents who live outside your immediate area, read the HMO literature to make sure your dependents can receive care from providers in their area.

<P>
Prescription drug coverage is included with each of the HMO plans available. Remember, you must reside within the HMO service area to be eligible to enroll.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">CU Term Life Insurance</FONT>

<P>
Life insurance helps provide financial security for you and your family. If you were enrolled as an employee in the CU Term Life Insurance plans, you may continue coverage at a reduced level when you retire. You must make this conversion within 30 days of your retirement date. You will not be able to enroll at a later date.

<P>
When you retire, you can elect $3,000 in coverage or 25% of the amount of your preretirement coverage, up to a maximum benefit of $12,500. The accidental death and dismemberment (AD&amp;D) portion of the CU Term Life Insurance plan ends when you retire.  An accelerated benefit is available. This coverage is provided through Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company.  

<P>
Depending on your years of service to the University, you may be eligible for a maximum contribution

<P>
of up to $2 per month from the University to help you pay for the cost of your retiree life insurance coverage. The monthly rates for every $1,000 of coverage are as follows:

<CENTER><B>HEALTH PLAN CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
Each health plan offered through the CU Benefits program provides quality health care and prescription drug coverage for you and your eligible dependents. Depending on your needs, you may choose from three levels of coverage:  retiree only, retiree plus one or family. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">your health plan choices at-a-glance</FONT>

<P>

<P>
&#009;No coverage

<P>
Selecting a health plan that is right for you and your family is an important decision. To help you make your selection, we've included descriptions of the CU health options and a brief description of the HMO options in this Workbook.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">CU Health Plans: Quality First</FONT>

<P>
The University offers you a choice of two CU Health Plans: CU Gold and CU Silver. Within each plan you have choices as to where and how you receive care. Both plans allow you to choose how you'll access your medical care each time you need treatment. How you access your medical care determines the level of benefits you'll receive. Of the two CU plans, CU Gold provides higher benefits and costs you less each month than the CU Silver plan. The CU Gold Plan has managed care features incorporated into the plan design which help to contain the costs of health care while assuring appropriate care for you and your family.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">CU Gold</FONT>

<P>
CU Gold is a point-of-service health plan where you decide when you need medical care whether or not to use the plan's managed care providers. If you use the managed care network and coordinate your care through your University Affiliates Network (UA Network) Personal Care Physician (PCP), you'll receive the plan's highest level of benefits. If you don't coordinate your care through your PCP, you'll still receive benefits, but at a lower level of coverage.

<P>
Choosing a Personal Care Physician  When you first elect coverage in the CU Gold plan, you will need to select a UA Network Personal Care Physician (PCP) who will provide your routine and primary care and refer you to network specialists, as necessary.

<P>
Each family member can have a different PCP. For example, you can choose a pediatrician as the PCP for your children and an internist for yourself. If you are not completely satisfied with the PCP you've chosen, you can change your PCP up to four times each year.

<P>
The UA Network  CU Gold uses the University Affiliates Network (UA Network) as the PCP and specialty network. There are two directories enclosed with this Workbook:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;University Affiliates Network Personal Care Physician Directory, and

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;University Affiliates Specialist Directory

<P>
Refer to these directories for specific information on participating UA Network physicians, hospitals and other providers.

<P>
To become part of UA Network, each physician's background and credentials were carefully screened and are periodically re-evaluated. All UA Network providers are faculty at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. These physicians practice at CU or in private practice and have been contracted through University Physicians, Inc. and University Hospital to serve the CU health plans. Because all UA Network physicians have faculty appointments through the University of Colorado, you can be assured that the doctors from which you'll choose have met the highest standards.

<P>
CU Gold Benefits  CU Gold includes two levels of benefits. What the plan pays depends on where you receive your care.

<P>
UA Network Care  When you receive care through your PCP, there is no annual deductible and no coinsurance amounts to pay. All you pay is an up front copayment.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;$10 for visits to the doctor

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;$100 per hospital stay &#173; no limit on the number of days allowed

<P>
Another advantage to receiving your care from your PCP is that there are no claim forms to file.

<P>
Out-of-Network Care  Health care is a very personal issue and while the UA Network is comprehensive enough to provide just about any care you need, sometimes you or a family member may choose to see

<P>
a physician who is not in the UA Network. An Out-of-Network care option is provided in CU Gold to accommodate those circumstances.

<P>
With Out-of-Network care, before benefits are payable you need to satisfy a $300 individual annual deductible. (The family annual deductible is $900.)  The deductible and coinsurance also apply if you receive care from a UA Network doctor, but for whom you did not get a referral from your PCP. Once the deductible is met, CU Gold pays 70% of reasonable and customary charges. Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance expenses reach $3,000 ($9,000 for a family), CU Gold pays 100% of covered reasonable and customary charges for the rest of the calendar year. (Expenses that exceed reasonable and customary are your responsibility.)

<P>
The chart on p.9 provides an overview of how benefits are paid in CU Gold for UA Network and<BR>
Out-of-Network care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">CU Silver</FONT>

<P>
CU Silver is a preferred provider network health plan. You can receive medical care from any provider you choose, but when you receive care from a UA Network provider, you  receive the highest benefits from the plan.  

<P>
A Choice of Networks  In CU Silver there are two preferred provider networks: University Affiliates (UA) Network and Great-West Life (GWL) "One Health" PPO Network.  

<P>
UA Network  When you receive care from a UA Network provider you receive the highest benefits available in CU Silver. You do not have to satisfy a deductible before benefits are paid and you pay only a small copayment for most services. Certain benefits, such as health screenings, risk assessments and routine physical exams are payable only when you use a UA Network provider.

<P>
GWL <B>"One Health" </B>PPO Network Care  The next highest level of benefits is provided through Great-West Life (GWL) PPO Network providers. Care you receive from a GWL PPO Network provider is reimbursed at 80% of covered charges, once you satisfy a $200 individual annual deductible ($600 for a family).

<P>
Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance expenses in any year reach $2,000 ($6,000 for a family), CU Silver pays 100% of covered expenses for the rest of the calendar year.

<P>
Out-of-Network Care  In CU Silver you can receive care from an Out-of-Network provider and still receive benefits. Because Out-of-Network providers do not have any agreements with CU to hold down the cost of care, CU Silver pays the lowest reimbursements for Out-of-Network care. Benefits are payable at 60% after you satisfy a $400 annual individual deductible ($1,200 for a family). Once you have met the deductible and your out-of-pocket coinsurance costs reach $4,000 ($12,000 for a family), the plan pays 100% of covered reasonable and customary expenses for the rest of the calendar year. (Expenses that exceed reasonable and customary are your responsibility.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Prescription Drug Coverage</FONT>

<P>
When you enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver, your prescription drug benefits are provided through the PCS Prescription Drug Card Program. For your long-term prescription drug needs, both CU Gold and CU Silver include a Mail Order Program.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">The PCS Prescription Drug Card Program</FONT>

<P>
This Program offers two levels of benefits: the "Quality First" Network and Out-of-Network. You will receive the highest level of benefits available through the program by using a "Quality First" Network Pharmacy. If you have your prescriptions filled at an Out-of-Network Pharmacy, you'll receive a slightly lower benefit level. A list of "Quality First" Network pharmacies is included in your Enrollment Packet.

<P>
Here's how the Program pays benefits by plan:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Mail Order Prescription Drug Program.  </FONT>

<P>
If you take medication on an on-going basis, you can save money on these prescription drugs through the Mail Order Prescription Drug Program which is administered through the CU School of Pharmacy. You can receive up to a 90-day supply of your prescription drug for one low copayment. The copayment is $6 or 20%, whichever is greater.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Mental Health, Alcoholism and Chemical Dependency Treatment Coverage</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">UMHS (University Mental Health Services)</FONT>

<P>
This program is designed to evaluate and direct you to receive the appropriate treatment for mental health, alcoholism and chemical dependency problems. The program offers two levels of benefits: Network (UMHS) and Out-of-Network. When you receive care through UMHS directly, you receive the highest level of benefits for outpatient and inpatient care, without paying any deductibles. You pay only a small copayment when you receive care. UMHS coordinates all services and providers and monitors your progress.

<P>
Unless there is an emergency situation requiring immediate hospitalization, your first visit will be to University Mental Health Services where a mental health professional will evaluate your needs and, if necessary, refer you and/or your eligible family members for appropriate treatment. Your copayment will be $10 with CU Gold and $15 with CU Silver (maximum of two sessions).

<P>
In case of an emergency, UMHS can be reached by calling (303) 315-4940 or 1-800-349-4940 (any hour). For all other preauthorizations, UMHS offices should be called between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.

<P>
If you are referred by UMHS for outpatient treatment, you will receive a specific referral from a mental health professional who will discuss options and costs. Referrals by UMHS for inpatient care will be based on the type of treatment required and the desired location. Copayments will vary depending on the provider used.

<P>
In case you are unable to receive precertification because of an emergency inpatient admission, you must contact UMHS within 48 hours of admissions.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Out-of-Network</FONT>

<P>
When you select providers that are Out-of-Network, you are still required to call UMHS and have your care preauthorized &#173; for outpatient care or preapproved &#173; for inpatient care. Some services require meeting a separate plan deductible before receiving any benefits.

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table1.gif">

<P>

<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) Health Plan Options</FONT>

<P>
The University offers two HMO options to faculty, classified staff, unclassified staff and professional exempt retirees. If you don't want to enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver, you may select coverage through HMO Colorado or Kaiser Permanente (not available to those in the Colorado Springs area).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">How HMO's Work</FONT>

<P>
To receive benefits from the HMO, your PCP must coordinate all your medical care (including referrals to specialists), and you must use the doctors, hospitals and other providers within the HMO network (otherwise you pay the full cost of your care). You pay a copayment each time you receive covered services and the HMO pays the remaining cost for your treatment. Remember, you must reside within the HMO service area to be eligible to enroll.

<P>
You and each covered family member need to choose a PCP to coordinate your care. If you are covering dependents who live outside your immediate area or have a second home in another area, read the HMO literature to make sure your dependents can receive care from providers in their area.  

<P>
Prescription drug coverage is included with each of the HMO plans available.  

<P>
For a summary of the HMO option for your area, please refer to the Medical Comparison Sheet enclosed in this Enrollment Packet. For a list of Kaiser Permanente facility locations, call (303)344-7500. For a list of HMO Colorado providers, call HMO Colorado at 1-800-533-5643.

<CENTER><B>DENTAL CHOICES</B></CENTER>

<P>
Dental coverage is included with CU Silver, Kaiser Permanente and HMO Colorado and is optional with CU Gold. If you waive medical coverage, you are not eligible for the CU dental plan.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">dental choices at-a-glance:</FONT>

<P>
*&#009;CU Dental Plan

<P>
*&#009;No coverage

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">CU Dental Plan</FONT>

<P>
Delta Dental Plan of Colorado administers the CU dental plan. When you need dental care, you decide who to see and where to receive dental treatment. Your choices are:

<P>
*&#009;Delta Preferred Option (DPO)

<P>
*&#009;Delta Participating Dentists

<P>
*&#009;Nonparticipating Dentist

<P>
Of the three options available, Delta Preferred Option (DPO) provides the highest level of benefits. You always have the option of selecting a dentist who is a Nonparticipating dentist, but the cost of care will be greater to you.   

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Delta Preferred Option (DPO)</FONT>

<P>
Under the DPO approach, you use a DPO provider at the time of service and qualify for the highest level of benefits under the plan. The plan pays 100% of preventive and diagnostic care with no deductible. After an annual $25 per member deductible, the plan then pays a percentage of other covered services. The comparison chart on p.11 shows the coverage and plan payments. In brief, the advantages of using a DPO dentist are:

<P>
*&#009;You receive the highest benefit available for all services.

<P>
*&#009;The dentist will file claims for you.

<P>
*&#009;Because the DPO dentists have agreed in advance to a schedule of benefits payments, you will have &#009;&#009;no excess out-of-pocket expense. You pay only the deductible and/or coinsurance applicable to the &#009;&#009;service received.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Delta Participating Dentists</FONT>

<P>
If you use a Delta Participating dentist, you will receive the standard level of benefits. The Plan pays 100% of preventive and diagnostic care with no deductible. Other covered services require a $50 per member annual deductible before benefits are paid. The percentage paid depends on the treatment and is shown on the comparison chart on p.11.

<P>
In brief, the advantages of using a Participating dentist are:

<P>
*&#009;The dentist will file claims for you.

<P>
*&#009;Because the dentist accepts Delta's reasonable and customary fee level, you will have no excess, out-of-&#009;&#009;pocket expense. You pay only the deductible and/or coinsurance applicable to the service received.


<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Nonparticipating Dentist</FONT>

<P>
If you select a nonparticipating dentist (one who is neither a Participating member of Delta Dental Plan nor a DPO dentist), you will receive the standard level of benefits which is based on Delta's reasonable and customary fee schedule. The plan pays 100% of preventive and diagnostic care with no deductible. 

<P>
Because Delta's reasonable and customary amounts are lower than what a non-DPO, Nonparticipating dentist may charge, your out-of-pocket costs may be greater than if you used a DPO or Delta Participating dentist. This is because you will be responsible for paying any amount above reasonable and customary amounts. In addition, you have to file your own claims.

<P>
See the comparison chart below for the payment percentages.

This chart shows the difference in benefits payable when you see a Delta Preferred Option (DPO) dentist, a Delta Participating dentist and a Nonparticipating dentist.

<CENTER><B>DISABILITY PLANS</CENTER></B>

<P>
Because the financial impact of a disability can be significant, the University makes available disability coverages designed to coordinate with sick leave, retirement and Workers' Compensation. Short-term disability is optional and provides a benefit if you are disabled or ill for an extended period of time (up to six months). Long-term disability coverage is provided at no cost to eligible employees.  

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Short-Term Disability</FONT>

<P>
The University provides you with sick leave benefits. However, it is possible that your illness may last longer than the amount of sick leave you have available. If you are a Faculty, an Unclassified Staff or Professional Exempt employee and have an appointment with the University of 50% or greater, you are eligible to elect this coverage. Proof of insurability is required if you elect this coverage.

<P>
Short-term disability (STD) insurance begins on the 31st day of your disability or after all of your sick leave is exhausted, whichever is later. You select the coverage level you want based on your annual income, up to a weekly maximum benefit of $850. Benefits are paid until the end of your disability or until the end of the 26th week of your disability, whichever occurs first. The maximum benefit you receive (after the 31-day waiting period) is for 22 weeks. You will not pay federal or state income tax on any benefits you receive from this plan.

<P>
This chart illustrates the amount of your STD benefit and the monthly costs to receive that level of coverage:

Once you have made your STD choice, refer to Step 8 on your enrollment Worksheet. Circle your election and enter the monthly cost in the right hand column. After you input your selection through the CU Benefits Line, an enrollment form will be mailed to you. Before coverage begins, your application must be approved by the Standard Insurance Company.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">New Employees</FONT>

<P>
Complete and return the STD insurance enrollment form available from your Campus Benefits Office. Before coverage begins, your application must be approved by Standard Insurance Company.


<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Long-Term Disability</FONT>

<P>
Long-term disability (LTD) insurance guarantees your future income if you should become permanently disabled. This plan is insured by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) and is provided by the University at no cost to you. There is a one-year waiting period from the date of retirement plan eligibility to enroll in this plan.  

<P>
Your LTD benefit is 60% of salary, not to exceed $5,500 per month, less income from other sources, such as Workers' Compensation.  

<P>
If you become disabled and qualify for coverage, benefits are payable as of the first of the month following 180 days (six months) of continuous disability. If you become disabled and are age 62 or younger, benefits are payable until you reach age 65. The monthly benefit you receive also includes a contribution to an individual Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association - College Retirement Equity Fund (TIAA-CREF) retirement annuity. The contribution is 14% of salary.

<P>
You should know that any benefits you receive from this plan are considered taxable income. Upon receipt of LTD benefits, your employment with the University ends and you are placed on retirement status.

<P>
Your LTD coverage ends when you end your appointment with the University but a conversion policy is available. Additional information is available in the TIAA-LTD plan certificate available from your Campus Benefits Office. Enrollment in the LTD plan is automatic and there is no cost to you. There is no election to make to receive coverage.

<P>
NOTE: PERA members are covered under the University's LTD plan only through the fifth year of PERA membership. Upon completion of the fifth year of membership and vesting under PERA, your LTD coverage is provided through PERA. Refer to your PERA membership materials for a description of disability coverage.

<P>
Notice to Covered Retirees and Family Members About COBRA Continuation Coverage Under Group Health Plans

<P>
Dear Retiree and Spouse:

<P>
This is a very important notice: Please make sure that all members of your family read it carefully.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
A federal law known as "COBRA"* requires that group health plans offer "covered retirees" and their families the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage ("continuation coverage") in certain instances ("qualifying events") where coverage under the Plan would otherwise end. To receive this continuation coverage, the covered retiree, spouse or dependent must pay the monthly premiums directly to the COBRA Administrator. This notice is intended to inform you of your rights and obligations regarding COBRA continuation coverage. You should take the time to read this notice carefully. The term "covered retirees" will include any individual who is or was provided coverage because of performance of services for one or more persons maintaining the Plan, including covered retirees, partners, independent contractors and other self-employed individuals.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Eighteen-Month Continuation</FONT>

<P>
If you are a covered retiree, spouse or dependent covered under the Plan and your group health coverage terminates due to any of the following reasons, called qualifying events, then you will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 18 months after the qualifying event occurs:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;A reduction in the covered retiree's hours of employment

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Termination of a covered retiree's employment (for reasons<BR>
<SUP>&#009;other than gross misconduct)</SUP>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;The covered retiree's retirement

<P>
If you are a covered retiree, spouse or dependent and disabled at the time or within 60 days of a qualifying event involving termination of employment or a reduction in hours, the 18-month continuation period may be extended an additional 11 months. The disabled individual must give the COBRA Administrator notice of the Social Security determination of disability within 60 days of such determination and before the end of the initial 18-month period. The individual is also responsible for notifying the COBRA Administrator within 30 days of a Social Security final determination that the disability no longer exists.

<P>
If the covered retiree does not elect continuation coverage, the covered retiree's spouse and each of the covered retiree's eligible dependents will have a separate right to elect it. <I>Therefore, it is important that the covered retiree, spouse and all dependents read this notice.</I>

<P>
<I>*Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.</I>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Thirty-Six-Month Continuation</FONT>

<P>
If you are the spouse or dependent child of a covered retiree and you lose group health coverage for one of the following reasons (also qualifying events), you will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 36 months after the qualifying event occurs:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;The death of the covered retiree

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Divorce or legal separation from the covered retiree

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;The covered retiree becomes entitled to Medicare during an <BR>
<SUP>&#009;18-month COBRA continuation period</SUP>

<P>
A dependent child of a covered retiree who loses group health coverage under the Plan because the dependent ceases to be a "dependent child" as defined under the Plan will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 36 months after the qualifying event occurs.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Multiple Qualifying Events</FONT>

<P>
An 18-month period of continuation coverage may be extended to a period of up to 36 months for a covered retiree's spouse or dependent child if a second qualifying event occurs within the first 18-month period. For example, if a covered retiree's spouse is on continuation coverage for 18 months due to the termination of the covered retiree's employment, and during the 18-month period the former covered retiree dies, the spouse will be eligible to maintain his or her continuation coverage for up to 36 months from the date of the first qualifying event. In no event will the COBRA continuation coverage extend beyond 36 months from the date of the first qualifying event, and it may end before the 18- or 36-month period expires, as explained later in this notice.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">What Health Coverage May Be Continued?</FONT>

<P>
You are eligible to continue only those medical/dental and health flexible spending account benefits for which you were covered at termination. You will have the opportunity to change health plan coverages in the same manner as covered employees.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">How Much Will the Benefits Cost?</FONT>

<P>
Any person who elects to continue coverage under the Plan must pay the full cost of that coverage (including both the share you now pay, if any, and the share the employer now pays), plus any additional administrative amounts allowed by law.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Termination of Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
Under the law, continuation coverage may be terminated before the end of the maximum period of coverage for any of the following reasons:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;The Plan is terminated (in which case you may have the opportunity for<BR>
&#009;coverage under other group health plans sponsored by the employer).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Your premium for COBRA continuation coverage is not paid on time.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Coverage is obtained under another employer-funded group health plan, <BR>
&#009;as a retiree, spouse or dependent of a retiree. In the event<BR>
&#009;another employer-funded group health plan has a pre-existing condition<BR>
&#009;clause or limitation, continuation coverage may be continued until the<BR>
&#009;18-month period has been exhausted or the pre-existing condition clause <BR>
&#009;has been satisfied.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;The individual becomes entitled to Medicare, other than as an End-Stage <BR>
&#009;Renal Disease (ESRD) beneficiary.

<P>
At the end of the continuation coverage period, you will be allowed to convert to an individual insurance policy if that is provided under the Plan at that time. You should note that the conversion option, if any, will not apply if your continuation coverage terminates before the end of the applicable continuation coverage period.

<P>
If you do not elect continuation coverage, your group health coverage will end and the Plan will not pay claims for services provided on and after the date your coverage terminates. If you do not elect continuation coverage, you can still apply for an individual conversion policy. Contact your campus Benefits Office for assistance.

<P>
<I>Note: Continuation coverage is not the same as conversion coverage. Conversion coverage provides you with an individual policy of health insurance handled directly between you and the insurance company, provided you apply for conversion coverage within the applicable time limits. Unlike continuation coverage, conversion coverage does not guarantee coverage identical to your group health plan; and your premium will be paid directly to the insurance company at individual rates.</I>

<P>
If your coverage will be terminated due to retirement and you do not elect continuation coverage, you may be eligible for other retiree coverage provided under the Plan.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Procedures to Elect Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;In the case of death of the covered employee, termination, reduction in &#009;hours or entitlement to &#009;&#009;&#009;Medicare, which causes your eligibility to terminate, you or your dependent will receive information &#009;&#009;from the Plan concerning the continuation of coverage election provisions, including the self-payment &#009;&#009;rates.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;In the case of divorce or a dependent child who ceases to qualify as a dependent, the covered employee, &#009;&#009;spouse or dependent child must notify the COBRA Administrator within 60 days of the event. If notice &#009;&#009;is not received within 60 days of the event, your dependents will not be eligible for continuation cover&#009;&#009;age. Loss of dependent child status occurs at the end of the calendar year in which the child <BR>
&#009;attains age 23.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;When the covered employee, spouse or dependent is disabled at the time or within 60 days of a qualify-&#009;&#009;ing event involving termination or reduction of hours, the covered employee, spouse or dependent child &#009;&#009;must notify CompuSys, Inc. within 60 days of the Social Security determination of disability &#009;&#009;&#009;and before the end of the initial 18-month period.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;When the COBRA Administrator is notified that a qualifying event has occurred, you will be sent an &#009;&#009;election form and other information regarding continuation coverage. You will have at least 60 days &#009;&#009;from the date your coverage terminates under the Plan or, if later, 60 days from the date of the notice &#009;&#009;advising you of your election rights to make your decision. You do not have to show that you are insur-&#009;&#009;able to obtain continuation coverage. 

<P>
If you have questions, please feel free to contact your campus Benefits Office.

<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Retirement or Separation from Employment </FONT>

<P>
The <I>CU Retirement Plan booklet</I> and the Faculty Handbook (Section VII) outline the eligibility requirements for retirement from the University. Numerous pay-out options are available from the various companies, including fixed annuities, full or partial lump-sum cash withdrawals, fixed period pay-outs, and minimum distributions.

<P>
These same options are available for employees age 55 or older who separate from University employment. Contact the companies' information numbers or your campus Benefits Office for additional information.

<P>
Academic faculty hired prior to September 1, 1991, may also be eligible for the University's supplemental annuity program at retirement. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Social Security</FONT>

<P>
The benefits you derive from Social Security are determined by a formula that includes quarters of participation, age, and contributions. Social Security provides retirement income and disability coverage, plus 

<P>
retiree health coverage through Medicare. Contact the Social Security Administration for additional information.

<P>
There are two deductions for wages subject to Social Security:

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table11.gif">

<P>
Together, these deductions equal 7.65%, the current total Social Security deduction. The University matches these deductions.

<P>
The employee/employer contribution percentage and annual Social Security income deduction ceilings are subject to change each January.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA)</FONT>

<P>
Unclassified staff and professional exempt employees hired before September 1991 are covered by the Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA) plan. PERA deductions are 8% of employee salary with a University contribution of 11.6%.

<P>
PERA is a defined benefit retirement plan. Your retirement benefit is based upon years of service, your age at retirement, and your Highest Average Salary (HAS) or, for certain members, an account balance valuation at retirement age. Your HAS is the monthly average of the three highest salaries earned in 12 consecutive month periods. A month of service credit is granted whenever salary reported to PERA is equal to or greater than 80 times the federal minimum wage ($4.75 x 80 = $380 in 1997). You also have disability income coverage after 5 years of service credit and a death benefit to your survivors after 1 year of service credit.

<P>
Your PERA deduction is tax-deferred from federal and state income taxes. Your taxable income is reduced by the amount of your PERA contribution. Taxes are payable when you retire or withdraw your PERA member account.

<P>
If you leave University employment before retirement, you may request a refund of your PERA member contributions. A refund includes member contributions and 6.8% compounded interest plus a 25% matching amount (before retirement age) or a 50% matching amount (at retirement age). A refund is typically processed within 45 days after receipt of a properly completed refund request.

<P>
Under PERA, you qualify for a service retirement if you meet the following requirements:

<P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Minimum Service Credit&#009;&#009;Minimum Age</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#729A5B">&#009;</FONT>

<P><PRE>
35 years		Any age
30 years		55
20 years		60
5 years			65
</PRE>
<P>
Your monthly lifetime benefit is 2.5% of your HAS for each year of service credit through 20 years, and 1.5% of your HAS for each year over 20 years to a maximum benefit of 100%.

<P>
A reduced-service retirement is available as early as age 50 with 25 years of service credit. For certain members, PERA will use an alternative account balance valuation calculation which will provide a higher monthly benefit amount. The plan also allows a monthly lifetime benefit to be paid to another person after a retiree's death.

<P>
PERA members are eligible to purchase service credit for previous employment experience which is not <BR>
vested in a retirement plan.

<P>
Employees on PERA hired after March 1986 are also subject to Medicare tax (a federal employment tax of 1.45% of covered wages).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Tax-Deferred Investment Programs</FONT>

<P>
As a University employee, you are eligible to participate in several tax-deferred investment programs. There are three major advantages to participation:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;You have the opportunity to invest money for your retirement, in addition to your <BR>
&#009;regular retirement plan.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;You pay no income taxes on your investment or the interest earned until you begin <BR>
&#009;withdrawing money from the investment program (usually after retirement).

<CENTER><B>ENROLLING FOR CU BENEFITS</B></CENTER>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Open Enrollment</FONT>

<P>
Enrolling is easy!  After you complete your Enrollment Worksheet, simply call the CU Benefits Line from any touch-tone phone during the days and times indicated on your personalized Enrollment Worksheet.  The CU Benefits Line lets you select your benefits at your convenience &#173; seven days a week &#173; during the annual Open Enrollment Period.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">Before You Enroll</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Review the Enrollment Workbook.  For each benefit option determine which choice is right for you &#009;&#009;and your family in 1997.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Once you have decided on a particular coverage choice, find the appropriate step on the Enrollment &#009;&#009;Worksheet. (For reference, your 1996 elections are shown in boldface print in the left hand column).  &#009;&#009;Circle the number next to your choice.  This number corresponds to the numbered buttons on your &#009;&#009;telephone, ie., * on the Enrollment Worksheet correspond to * on your telephone keypad.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Write the cost of your election in the column labeled "Monthly Cost."

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;Call the CU Benefits Line.  You will be asked for your Personal Identification Number (PIN) which is &#009;&#009;printed to the left of your address on the Enrollment Worksheet.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">*</FONT>&#009;When you confirm your elections at the end of the call, you will be enrolled for your 1997 benefits!<BR>
&#009;If you don't confirm your choices or you hang up before you confirm them, your elections will not<BR>
&#009;be processed. Your benefit elections are effective January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997. Once &#009;&#009;Open Enrollment ends, you cannot change your elections until the next annual Open Enrollment, unless &#009;you have a qualifying event which changes your family status.

<P>
You will receive a printed Confirmation Statement listing your benefits elections. If your Statement shows the coverage you want, file it with your other important papers. If your Statement is incorrect, or you wish to make a change, you must call the CU Benefits Line again to change your elections. You may call the CU Benefits Line as often as you want through the end of Open Enrollment.

<P>
Please do not wait until the end of Open Enrollment to call. Although there are many phone lines available, there is the chance that you may get a busy signal if you call during the last few days of your enrollment period.

<P>
To make a benefits change you must call the CU Benefits Line by the date indicated on your Enrollment Worksheet. DO NOT RETURN YOUR PERSONALIZED ENROLLMENT WORKSHEET.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#D65C6E">if you don't call...</FONT>

<P>
by the deadline shown on your Enrollment Worksheet your coverage will continue as is for 1997.

The policy is derivedfrom the statutes noted below and outlines specific responsibilitiesfor individuals involved in a fiscal misconduct situation.<BR><P>The State Controller granted the University an administrativehardship exemption from the State Fiscal Rule requiring the reportingof losses in excess of $100 to the State Division of Accountsand Control.  The hardship exemption raises the required reportinglevel to $10,000 due to the University's policy and internal processesfor handling fiscal misconduct.<BR><BR><P><U><B>REFERENCES</B></U> <BR><P>The following references cite the legal basis from which thispolicy was developed:<BR><P>  Retaliation Prohibited C.R.S. 24-50.5-103<P>  Embezzlement of Public Property C.R.S. 18-8-407<P>  Duty to Report a Crime C.R.S. 18-8-115<P>  Department of Administration C.R.S. 24-30-202 (13)<P>  Criminal Code--Theft C.R.S. 18-4-401<P>  Criminal Code--Official Misconduct C.R.S. 18-4-404<P>  Reporting Suspected or Actual Theft or Embezzlement--State FiscalRules Chapter 3, Section 26.00<BR><BR><P><U><B>DEFINITIONS<BR></B></U><P><U>Fiscal Misconduct</U> - Examples include circumstances of embezzlement;defalcation; misappropriation of goods, services, or resources;diversion of assets; conflict of interest situations that resultin financial loss; and violation of University fiscal policiesand procedures for personal gain.  Some of these terms are technicallegal terms and the references noted above should be reviewedif clarification is required.<BR><P><U>Suspected Fiscal Misconduct</U> - A reasonable belief or actualknowledge that fiscal misconduct has or is occurring.  Failureto show an actual diversion of assets or loss shall not be consideredunreasonable.<BR><BR><P><U><B>STATEMENT OF POLICY <BR></B></U><P>1. Any employee or student associated with the University whoknows of or suspects fiscal misconduct must promptly notify eitherone's immediate supervisor or one of the following investigativeunits:  the Department of Internal Audit, Office of UniversityCounsel, the appropriate campus police department, and/or theappropriate campus Human Resources or Personnel department.  Thisduty to report by an individual or supervisor is in compliancewith State law and State Fiscal Rules.  State employees have &quot;whistleblower&quot; protection from State law when they are in compliancewith the requirements set forth in statute.<BR><P>2. Because of the often unique and complex nature of fiscal misconduct,which investigative unit to contact first may be a function ofthe situation.  The Department of Internal Audit and Office ofUniversity Counsel are more often the preferred primary contactsbecause these units have more flexibility in the manner in whichthey conduct a review or investigation where there is some doubtabout what actually occurred.  In any case, the notified investigativeunit shall contact the other units to establish the necessaryteam to progress with the review or investigation.<BR><P>3. All affected departments and/or individuals shall cooperatefully with the investigative team to identify whether or not actualor suspected fiscal misconduct has occurred.  <P>4. The investigative team shall keep University campus officialsapprised of on-going investigations as appropriate.  Given thenature of some of these investigations, there are times when thescope of the problem must be determined before notification ispossible.<BR><P>5. Loss reporting will follow standard University processes foreach investigative unit (for example, all Internal Audit reportsare submitted to the Board of Regents).  The University Controller/Assistant Vice President will report all instances of actual lossgreater than $10,000 to the State Division of Accounts and Control. The report will state the circumstances and corrective actiontaken.<BR><BR><P><U><B>PROCEDURES AND RESPONSIBILITIES<BR></B></U><P>The following sections outline the basic responsibilities of thoseunits or individuals involved with an incident of actual or suspectedfiscal misconduct.<BR><P>1.

Common steps may include changes in staff assignments,obtaining keys, removing systems access, stopping long-distancetelephone access, and reassigning signature and approval authority;<BR><P>e. Not confronting or accusing the individual suspected of fiscalmisconduct and not making any arrangements for resolution of thematter without consultation with the appropriate personnel officer,the Department of Internal Audit, and/or legal counsel as notedin (b) above;<BR><P>f. Using discretion and not discussing the circumstances withpersons not involved in the incident or with persons without anessential need-to-know.  Supervisors can and should be informedif first cleared by the investigative team;<BR><P>g. At the completion of any investigation, implementing changesin policy and procedures for improved internal controls to preventreoccurrence.<BR><P>2. The University Department of Internal Audit is responsiblefor:<BR><P>a.

You may change or cancel your participation during the plan year only upon a qualifying event. (See the list of qualifying events on page 25.)


<P>
The IRS has created guidelines for dependent care accounts:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The amount excluded from taxation is limited to $5,000 ($2,500 for a married <BR>
&#009;person filing separately and $2,500 if each spouse has an account). The amount <BR>
&#009;excluded cannot exceed the taxable income of an unmarried employee or the <BR>
&#009;income earned by either the employee or the employee's spouse, whichever is less.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The expenses must be for the care of an eligible dependent and necessary so that<BR>
&#009;you (and your spouse, if you are married) can work.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;A dependent is defined as anyone you claim on your income tax return. In <BR>
&#009;addition, to qualify for dependent care expenses, your dependent must be under <BR>
&#009;age 13 or, if older, physically or mentally incapable of self-care.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Payment cannot be made for care provided by someone claimed as a dependent <BR>
&#009;on your income tax return (e.g., husband, wife, or child). If care is provided to a <BR>
&#009;dependent by a day-care center, the center must comply with all state and local <BR>
&#009;laws. Any expenses claimed through this account cannot also be claimed as a tax <BR>
&#009;credit on your income tax return.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The guidelines prohibit a family with only one working spouse from participating,<BR>
&#009;unless the nonworking spouse is a full-time student or is unable to care for <BR>
&#009;himself/herself, in which case up to $400 per month for two or more dependents,<BR>
&#009;or $200 for one dependent, can be considered income for day-care reimbursement <BR>
&#009;purposes. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;A full-time student is defined as someone attending school on a full-time basis <BR>
&#009;(full-time status as defined by the institution) for at least five months per calendar <BR>
&#009;year (not necessarily five consecutive months). A student attending only at night<BR>
&#009;does not necessarily qualify as full time; however, a full-time student can attend <BR>
&#009;some night classes.

<P>
<I>The above guidelines are for general reference only. Please see your financial planner, CPA, attorney, or the IRS for guidance if you are considering a dependent care account.</I>

<P>
Health Care and Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts are separate and cannot be mixed for reimbursement purposes. In other words, you cannot be reimbursed for dependent care expenses from your Health Care Reimbursement Account, or vice versa.

<P>
Each year during Open Enrollment, you choose the amount you want deducted from your paycheck and deposited into your Dependent Care Reimbursement Account. The University deducts this money before taxes are calculated.

<P>
Before you choose the amount you want deducted, it is important that you consider your benefit needs and carefully estimate expenses for the year. Any amount you deposit to your Dependent Care Reimbursement Account that is not used for eligible expenses is forfeited at the end of the plan year. It is advisable to be conservative when estimating your expenses.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Premium Only Plan (P.O.P.)</FONT>

<P>
Your P.O.P. election ends as of your last paycheck (date of separation).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Health Care Reimbursement Account</FONT>

<P>
You may only submit claims for expenses incurred before the date of separation, unless you elect continuation of health benefits coverage (COBRA).

<P>
This account is held open through March 31, following the year in which you terminate, die, retire, become totally disabled, are laid off, take a leave of absence, or are no longer eligible for University of Colorado or State of Colorado health/dental and life insurance plans. 

<P>
While your account remains open, you or your beneficiary may file a claim for eligible expenses incurred prior to termination of participation in the plan. Refer to the Continuation of Health Coverage Option (COBRA) if you wish to participate in the plan after employment has ended (see below). 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Dependent Care Reimbursement Account</FONT>

If you or your covered dependents experience a qualifying event under COBRA, you have the right to continue to participate for the remainder of the plan year in which the qualifying event occurs. You have access to the amounts in your Health Care Reimbursement Account for expenses incurred after the qualifying event date only as long as you continue to make the required monthly contribution. After termination of employment or participation due to a qualifying event, your contribution is made with after-tax dollars. This selection must be made in writing at time of the qualifying event by contacting your campus Benefits Office.

<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Dependent Care Reimbursement Accounts</FONT>

<P>
The amount of pre-tax dollars you deposit in your account builds up over the course of the year. As you incur expenses, you can claim reimbursement from your account. You can only be reimbursed for expenses up to the current amount in your account. For example, if you submit an eligible expense for $1,200 in January and you are allocating $100 per month to your account, you are reimbursed $100 per month automatically. 

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">For All Reimbursement Accounts</FONT>

<P>
Eligible expenses incurred between January 1 and December 31 are eligible for reimbursement from funds allocated for that year, as long as you are a participant in the plan. The date the service is rendered is the incurred date (not the date you are billed for the service). Your account remains open through March 31 of the following year to allow claims for eligible expenses incurred during the prior year to be processed.

<P>
When you receive reimbursement checks, a new claim form is automatically included. If you need more claim forms, please contact your campus Benefits Office or CompuSys.

<CENTER><B>WHEN AND HOW TO ENROLL AND MAKE PLAN CHANGES</B></CENTER>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Open Enrollment (Annual)</FONT>

<P>
Enrolling is easy!  After you complete your Enrollment Worksheet, simply call the CU Benefits Line from any touch-tone phone.  The CU Benefits Line lets you select your benefits at your convenience - seven days a week - during the annual Open Enrollment Period.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Before You Enroll</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Review the Enrollment Workbook. For each benefit option, determine which choice is right for you &#009;&#009;and your family in 1997.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Once you have decided on a particular coverage choice, find the appropriate step on the Enrollment &#009;&#009;Worksheet. (For reference, your 1996 elections are shown in boldface print in the left hand column).  &#009;&#009;Circle the number next to your choice. This number corresponds to the numbered buttons on your

<P>
&#009;telephone, i.e., * on the Enrollment Worksheet correspond to * on your telephone keypad.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Write the cost of your election in the column labeled "Monthly Cost."

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Call the CU Benefits Line.  You will be asked for your Personal Identification Number (PIN) which is &#009;&#009;printed to the left of your address on the Enrollment Worksheet. Enter your 1997 benefit elections.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;When you confirm your elections at the end of the call, you will be enrolled for your 1997 benefits!

<P>
&#009;If you don't confirm your choices or you hang up before you confirm them, your elections will not be &#009;&#009;processed. Your benefit elections are effective January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997. Once &#009;&#009;Open Enrollment ends, you cannot change your elections until the next annual Open Enrollment, &#009;&#009;unless you have a qualifying event which changes your family status.

<P>
You will receive a printed Confirmation Statement listing your benefits elections. If your Statement shows the coverage you want, file it with your other important papers. If your Statement is incorrect or you wish to make a change, you must call the CU Benefits Line again to change your elections. You may call the CU Benefits Line as often as you want through the end of Open Enrollment.

<P>
Please do not wait until the end of Open Enrollment to call. Although there are many phone lines available, there is the chance that you may get a busy signal if you call during the last few days of your enrollment period.

<P>
&#009;You must call the CU Benefits Line by the date indicated on your Enrollment Worksheet. DO NOT &#009;&#009;RETURN YOUR PERSONALIZED ENROLLMENT WORKSHEET.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">if you don't call...</FONT>

<P>
by the deadline shown on your Enrollment Worksheet, your current coverage will continue.

<P>
<B>Exception: You must re-enroll in the Reimbursement Accounts if you wish to participate for 1997.</B>

<P>
Use the following diagram to enroll for your 1997 benefits during Open Enrollment.

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table12.gif">

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">NOTE: </FONT>If you and your dependents (if applicable) are currently enrolled in a University Health plan, you may enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver during Open Enrollment and no pre-exisiting condition limitation <BR>
will apply.

<P>
If you and/or your dependents (if applicable) are not currently enrolled in a University Health Plan, pre-existing condition limitations will apply when enrolling in CU Gold or CU Silver. Pre-existing condition limitations do not apply to CU HMO Colorado or CU Kaiser plans.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">New Employees</FONT>

<P>
Your Campus Benefits Office will provide the necessary enrollment forms. Remember, you must enroll within 30 days of becoming eligible for benefits, or you must wait for the next annual Open Enrollment to select most plans.

<P>
If you fail to enroll in a timely manner, you will default to CU Gold without dental, employee coverage.  If you wish to waive health insurance coverage, you must complete a University of Colorado waiver form.

<P>
If you have questions, contact your Campus Benefits Office.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Loss of Health/Dental Coverage at Another Employer</FONT>

<P>
If you and/or your dependents have been covered by non-University health/dental insurance under a spouse's policy and if the coverage is no longer available, the employee and dependents may enroll in a CU plan within 31 days of the following qualifying events:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Death of spouse

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Separation from employment

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Divorce or legal separation

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Loss of eligibility with other employer

<P>
If the loss of health/dental insurance is for any other reason, the employee and/or dependents must wait until the next Open Enrollment to enroll in a CU plan.

<P>
However, eligible employees will be allowed to enroll in CU Gold, CU Silver, and CU Optional Term Life insurance outside of Open Enrollment, even if they do not meet the above qualifying events, by completing a Medical Disclosure Statement for themselves and eligible dependents. If the employee and dependents are accepted by Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company, coverage will be provided subject to any pre-existing condition limitations.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Adding Dependents to Health/Dental Plans During the Plan Year</FONT>

<P>
Dependents may be enrolled within 31 days of eligibility, which includes the following qualifying events:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Marriage

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Adoption (No pre-existing condition limitations apply to dependent.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Birth (No pre-existing condition limitations apply to dependent. For the first 31 days<BR>
&#009;from the date of birth, the newborn child is covered subject to coordination of benefits <BR>
&#009;provisions. However, coverage ends after 31 days if the newborn child is not enrolled <BR>
&#009;and the appropriate premium has not been applied.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Child returning home (Employee has financial responsibility for child.)

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Court decree specifying dependent coverage

<P>
It is your responsibility to notify your campus Benefits Office when your dependents have a change in eligibility status. Dependents who are not enrolled during the initial 31 days of eligibility may be enrolled during Open Enrollment. Eligible dependents may be allowed to enroll in CU Gold or CU Silver even if they do not meet one of the above qualifying events and if you are not enrolled in the CU Flex P.O.P. (requires completion of a Medical Disclosure Statement). If the dependents are accepted by Great-West Life, coverage is subject to the pre-existing condition limitation.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Loss of Health/Dental Eligibility for Dependents</FONT>

<P>
A dependent is covered through the calendar year in which he or she turns 23. After that date, or when the child is no longer financially dependent on you, the child is no longer eligible for dependent coverage. It is your responsibility to contact your campus Benefits Office at least 1 month before the dependent becomes ineligible.

<P>
Dependents age 23 or older who are mentally or physically handicapped may be eligible for continued coverage. Contact your campus Benefits Office for additional information.

<P>
Dependents who are no longer eligible for health/dental coverage may extend their CU coverage through COBRA (see Separation from CU Employment and Continuation of Health Coverage [COBRA], page 49), at additional premium cost.

<P>
Notice to Covered Employees and Family Members About COBRA Continuation Coverage Under Group Health Plans

<P>
Dear Employee and Spouse:

<P>
This is a very important notice: Please make sure that all members of your family read it carefully.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
A federal law known as "COBRA"* requires that group health plans offer "covered employees" and their families the opportunity for a temporary extension of health coverage ("continuation coverage") in certain instances ("qualifying events") where coverage under the Plan would otherwise end. To receive this continuation coverage, the covered employee, spouse or dependent must pay the monthly premiums directly to the COBRA Administrator. This notice is intended to inform you of your rights and obligations regarding COBRA continuation coverage. You should take the time to read this notice carefully. The term "covered employees" will include any individual who is or was provided coverage because of performance of services for one or more persons maintaining the Plan, including covered employees, partners, independent contractors and other self-employed individuals.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Eighteen-Month Continuation</FONT>

<P>
If you are a covered employee, spouse or dependent covered under the Plan and your group health coverage terminates due to any of the following reasons, called qualifying events, then you will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 18 months after the qualifying event occurs:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;A reduction in the covered employee's hours of employment

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Termination of a covered employee's employment (for reasons<BR>
<SUP>&#009;other than gross misconduct)</SUP>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The covered employee's retirement

<P>
If you are a covered employee, spouse or dependent and disabled at the time or within 60 days of a qualifying event involving termination of employment or a reduction in hours, the 18-month continuation period may be extended an additional 11 months. The disabled individual must give the COBRA Administrator notice of the Social Security determination of disability within 60 days of such determination and before the end of the initial 18-month period. The individual is also responsible for notifying the COBRA Administrator within 30 days of a Social Security final determination that the disability no longer exists.

<P>
If the covered employee does not elect continuation coverage, the covered employee's spouse and each of the covered employee's eligible dependents will have a separate right to elect it. <I>Therefore, it is important that the covered employee, spouse and all dependents read this notice.</I>

<P>
<I>*Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986.</I>


<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Thirty-Six-Month Continuation</FONT>

<P>
If you are the spouse or dependent child of a covered employee and you lose group health coverage for one of the following reasons (also qualifying events), you will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 36 months after the qualifying event occurs:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The death of the covered employee

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Divorce or legal separation from the covered employee

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare during an <BR>
<SUP>&#009;18-month COBRA continuation period</SUP>

<P>
A dependent child of a covered employee who loses group health coverage under the Plan because the dependent ceases to be a "dependent child" as defined under the Plan will have the right to elect continuation coverage for a maximum of 36 months after the qualifying event occurs.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Multiple Qualifying Events</FONT>

<P>
An 18-month period of continuation coverage may be extended to a period of up to 36 months for a covered employee's spouse or dependent child if a second qualifying event occurs within the first 18-month period. For example, if a covered employee's spouse is on continuation coverage for 18 months due to the termination of the covered employee's employment, and during the 18-month period the former covered employee dies, the spouse will be eligible to maintain his or her continuation coverage for up to 36 months from the date of the first qualifying event. In no event will the COBRA continuation coverage extend beyond 36 months from the date of the first qualifying event, and it may end before the 18- or 36-month period expires, as explained later in this notice.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">What Health Coverage May Be Continued?</FONT>

<P>
You are eligible to continue only those medical/dental and health flexible spending account benefits for which you were covered at termination. If you were covered under medical plus other health benefits, you may elect to continue either medical benefits only or the full package of medical/dental and health flexible spending account benefits. You will have the opportunity to change health plan coverages in the same manner as covered employees.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">How Much Will the Benefits Cost?</FONT>

<P>
Any person who elects to continue coverage under the Plan must pay the full cost of that coverage (including both the share you now pay, if any, and the share the employer now pays), plus any additional administrative amounts allowed by law.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Termination of Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
Under the law, continuation coverage may be terminated before the end of the maximum period of coverage for any of the following reasons:

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The Plan is terminated (in which case you may have the opportunity for<BR>
&#009;coverage under other group health plans sponsored by the employer).

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Your premium for COBRA continuation coverage is not paid on time.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;Coverage is obtained under another employer-funded group health plan, <BR>
&#009;as an employee, spouse or dependent of an employee. In the event<BR>
&#009;another employer-funded group health plan has a pre-existing condition<BR>
&#009;clause or limitation, continuation coverage may be continued until the<BR>
&#009;18-month period has been exhausted or the pre-existing condition clause <BR>
&#009;has been satisfied.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;The individual becomes entitled to Medicare, other than as an End-Stage <BR>
&#009;Renal Disease (ESRD) beneficiary.

<P>
At the end of the continuation coverage period, you will be allowed to convert to an individual insurance policy if that is provided under the Plan at that time. You should note that the conversion option, if any, will not apply if your continuation coverage terminates before the end of the applicable continuation coverage period.

<P>
If you do not elect continuation coverage, your group health coverage will end and the Plan will not pay claims for services provided on and after the date your coverage terminates. If you do not elect continuation coverage, you can still apply for an individual conversion policy. Contact your campus Benefits Office for assistance.

<P>
<I>Note: Continuation coverage is not the same as conversion coverage. Conversion coverage provides you with an individual policy of health insurance handled directly between you and the insurance company, provided you apply for conversion coverage within the applicable time limits. Unlike continuation coverage, conversion coverage does not guarantee coverage identical to your group health plan; and your premium will be paid directly to the insurance company at individual rates.</I>

<P>
If your coverage will be terminated due to retirement and you do not elect continuation coverage, you may be eligible for other retiree coverage provided under the Plan.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">Procedures to Elect Continuation Coverage</FONT>

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;In the case of death of the covered employee, termination, reduction in &#009;hours or entitlement to &#009;&#009;&#009;Medicare, which causes your eligibility to &#009;terminate, you or your dependent will receive information &#009;&#009;from the Plan concerning the continuation of coverage election provisions, including the self-payment &#009;&#009;rates.

<P>
<FONT COLOR="#729A5B">*</FONT>&#009;In the case of divorce or a dependent child who ceases to qualify as a dependent, the covered employee, &#009;&#009;spouse or dependent child must notify the COBRA Administrator within 60 days of the event. If notice &#009;&#009;is not received within 60 days of the event, your dependents will not be eligible for continuation cover&#009;&#009;age. Loss of dependent child status occurs at the end of the calendar year in which the child <BR>

<P>
Regular faculty and University administrators appointed prior to September 1, 1991, who are eligible for or participating in the University's Qualified Retirement Plan (TIAA-CREF Plan), and who will become eligible for and/or will participate in the CU Retirement Plan beginning January 1, 1993, should read this section in order to understand their rights of participation in the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan, as compared with the options available with the new CU Retirement Plan.

<P>
The University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan was designed in cooperation with the faculty and adopted by the Board of Regents in July 1962. Through the years, the program has been changed and expanded, but the initial objective of the program remains the same. The program guarantees eligible participants a combined retirement annuity of not less than 50% of their final average salary. The supplemental plan is defined in the Internal Revenue Service Code Section as an "Unfunded Defined Benefit Plan." Awards from the plan do not reduce earnings from Social Security.

<P>
Not all participants who are eligible for the Supplemental Annuity Plan receive annuity payments from the plan. Indeed, annuity payments from the supplemental plan have not been awarded to an eligible participant since the early 1980s. For almost all retirees, TIAA-CREF contributions and Social Security retirement income have exceeded 50% of final average salary ceiling. Therefore, supplemental payments from the program have not been necessary. For example, the average retirement income from TIAA-CREF and Social Security for 1991 was 70% of final average salary.

<P>
Those eligible participants who choose to invest retirement funds with the two new fund sponsors (Fidelity Investments and/or The Vanguard Group) or who wish to elect payment methods at retirement other than the annuity will not be eligible to participate in the Supplemental Annuity Plan. 

<P>
You may contact your campus Benefits Office to determine if you are eligible to receive a calculation for the University Faculty Supplemental Retirement Plan prior to retirement under the following rules for eligibility.

<P>
1.&#009;You must be eligible for normal retirement. For normal retirement, as  defined by the University of Colorado, you must meet the combination of age and service requirements described in the table below.

<P>
<PRE>Normal Retirement Table

Age at Retirement	Minimum Years of Service

68			20
67			22

<P>

Exceptions

<P>
*&#009;A participant electing retirement at age 60 or above who has fewer than the minimum number of years of service specified for normal retirement at the specified age shall receive a calculation for the supplement determined from an average salary prorated on the basis of the specified minimum years of service at that age.

<P>
*&#009;A participant who has retired due to a total disability at any age after twenty years of service shall be eligible for a calculation for the supplemental plan as determined by years of service without reference to age at retirement.

<P>
2.&#009;You must hold an appointment of regular faculty, University officer, or University Professional Exempt. Research faculty appointments are not eligible for the benefit. 

<P>
3.&#009;Years of service are determined from the date of the first regular full-time (100%) appointment in the job title of regular faculty (excluding research appointments), University officer, or University Professional Exempt. The job title must be eligible for participation in the University's Qualified Retirement Plan (TIAA-CREF Plan) and as of January 1, 1993, the CU Retirement Plan.

<P>
4.&#009;To remain eligible for a calculation of the supplemental plan, you must continue all retirement plan investments (contributions) and retirement accumulations within TIAA-CREF offered funds.

<P>
5.&#009;To receive a payment from the supplemental plan, you must elect a lifetime annuity from TIAA-CREF as the payment method at retirement. The annuity may be coupled with a 10% Retirement Transition Benefit (10% in cash) only.

<P>
The following rules apply to the calculation of the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan.

<P>
1.&#009;A participant meeting the eligibility rules for the supplemental plan must apply to his or her campus Benefit Office for a calculation of the supplemental plan by July 1 of the year preceding the participant's elected normal retirement date.

<P>
2.&#009;The calculation will always be based on the amount that would be received by the participant choosing a single life annuity from TIAA-CREF. This does not imply that the participant must choose a single life annuity as the annuity payment method from TIAA-CREF at retirement, but it means that the participant must supply to the campus Benefits Office an estimate supplied by TIAA-CREF based on the date of retirement for a single life annuity.

<P>
3.&#009;The calculation will incorporate earnings received from Social Security. The participant must supply estimated Social Security earnings, which are available from Social Security offices. Participants retiring prior to age 62 will receive a calculation of the supplemental plan based on an estimate of Social Security payments available at age 62. Participants retiring at age 62, or thereafter, shall receive a calculation of the supplemental plan based on actual Social Security payment received at retirement. Social Security offices can supply the actual amounts prior to the selected date of retirement.

<P>
4.&#009;The calculation of the supplemental benefit will be based on the total amount from TIAA-CREF and Social Security disregarding a qualified domestic relations court order. If a supplemental benefit is awarded to a participant and if the domestic relations order requires a distribution to others, the University of Colorado will comply, but the calculation of the supplemental benefit will be based on the total amount the participant would have received without the issuance of the court order.

<P>
5.&#009;Retirement benefits derived from service at other institutions with institutional contributory retirement plans will also be included in the determination of supplemental benefit. These include governmental agencies (including the armed forces), corporations and other groups and associations. The participant must supply the appropriate documents stipulating the amounts to be received by the participant at retirement. 

<P>
6.&#009;Voluntary contributions to University Tax Sheltered Annuities are not included in the calculation for the supplemental plan.

<P>
7.&#009;The "final average salary" is calculated from the five years of highest compensation in the last ten years of service before normal retirement. An additional 1.67% of the five-year average will be included for each year of service exceeding thirty years, up to thirty-five years of service. For years of service exceeding thirty-five, a flat 10% of the five-year average will be added.

<P>
8.&#009;For participants eligible for the supplemental plan and in continuous service with the University (without a break in service) before July 1, 1946, the supplemental benefit calculation will be increased by an amount equal to 50% of those Social Security benefits available at retirement or age 62. This amount will be included in the calculation determining final average salary before the final calculation determining a benefit award from the supplemental plan.

<P>
9.&#009;Annual compensation will be considered to be the academic year (nine- month) salary plus 14% of the five-year total for the summer months regardless of whether the eligible participant was compensated during the summer. Individuals eligible for the supplemental plan appointed to continuous twelve-month compensation will have the calculation based on fiscal year salary (twelve-months) without the additional 14% for summer months.

<P>
If eligibility is established and the calculation rules are satisfied, the participant will receive a calculation of the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan by a campus Benefits Office representative, which will be used to determine if a supplemental payment is warranted. The calculation will be done as follows:

<P>
1.&#009;The highest five years of the last ten years of compensation will be determined by the Benefits Office from official payroll records. The five-year salaries will be totaled.

<P>
2.&#009;If the salaries are academic salaries, 14% of the five-year total will be added to determine the five-year gross.

<P>
3.&#009;The five-year gross will be averaged. The calculation determines the five-year average.

<P>
4.&#009;Since the supplemental plan guarantees 50% of final average salary, the five-year average will be multiplied by 50%.

<P>
5.&#009;If the participant has over thirty years of continuous service with the University, 1.67% of the five-year average for each year up to five years will be added to the 50% of average calculation. If the participant has six or more years over thirty years of service a full 10% of the five-year average will be added to the 50% of average (or 60% of average). The supplemental plan calculation cannot exceed 60% of final average salary.

<P>
6.&#009;For participants hired prior to July 1, 1946, one-half of the Social Security amount will be added to the five-year average.

<P>
7.&#009;Once the 50%, or combinations up to 60%, of final average salary is determined, this figure is divided by twelve months to determine the average monthly salary.

<P>
8.&#009;The Benefits Office representative will then determine the monthly income the participant will receive from the information supplied by the participant. This information includes an official statement from TIAA-CREF estimating the participant's income from a single life annuity option on the date of retirement, an official statement from Social Security estimating the participant's income on the date of retirement, and other official documents from outside institution sources of estimating retirement income the participant might receive on the date of retirement. The monthly incomes from each of these sources are totaled to determine total monthly retirement income.

<P>
9.&#009;If the total monthly retirement income matches or exceeds the calculation for the final average monthly salary, no award from the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan is paid to the participant.

<P>
If the total monthly retirement income is less than the calculation for the final average monthly salary, the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan will be awarded in an amount of the difference between the calculated total monthly retirement income and the final average monthly salary. As an example, if the participant receives a total monthly retirement income from all sources (TIAA-CREF, Social Security, other) of $1,500 per month and the participant's final average monthly salary calculation is $1,800 per month, the participant will receive an award from the supplemental plan of $300 per month.

<P>
For those participants receiving awards from the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan, the following rules will govern the awards.

<P>
1.&#009;The calculation to determine an award is, in part, based on the amount a participant would receive from a TIAA-CREF single life annuity. For a married participant, a single life annuity from TIAA-CREF is rarely the preferred method of payment. Federal law requires spousal consent for a waiver of right to survivor benefits. Therefore, married participants normally choose lifetime annuities from TIAA-CREF that offer varying percentages of survivor benefits. Monthly retirement income from TIAA-CREF lifetime annuities offering survivor benefits is reduced due to the likelihood of payments being extended for longer periods of time.

<P>
The payment awarded from the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan will correspond to the percentage reduction between TIAA/CREF's single life annuity and the actual survivor benefit annuity chosen by the participant and spouse. Consequently, payments from the supplemental plan will continue upon the death of the retiree or spouse, depending on the conditions of the TIAA-CREF lifetime annuity chosen.

<P>
2.&#009;Participants retiring prior to age 60 with at least thirty years of service and receiving awards from the supplement plan will have payments deferred until age 60.

<P>
3.&#009;Each July, the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan payments are increased by a percentage equal to the calendar year Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, Denver and Boulder area.

<H3>
Release and Waiver
</H3>
<P>
Eligible participants for the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan who elect to have all or some portion of their monthly retirement contributions or retirement accumulation with TIAA-CREF directed to Fidelity Investments funds or The Vanguard Group funds, or who elect payment methods at retirement outside of the lifetime annuity, must sign a Release and Waiver form relinquishing all rights to the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan. The Release and Waiver form must be signed by the participant (and spouse, if married) and notarized.

<P>
Release and Waiver forms are included in the back pocket of this booklet and are available at your campus Benefits Office.

<P>
If you were a participant in the University of Colorado Qualified Retirement Plan prior to January 1, 1993, and wish to continue your retirement investments with the funding vehicles offered by TIAA-CREF in the University of Colorado Retirement Plan, no enrollment or transfer forms are required. Your contributions to retirement will continue to be forwarded to TIAA-CREF for your retirement.

<P>
If you are a new employee eligible for enrollment in the CU Retirement Plan or are a participant in the University Qualified Retirement Plan and wish to redirect your retirement contributions or transfer your retirement fund accumulation from TIAA-CREF to funding vehicles offered by Fidelity Investments and/or Vanguard, please contact your campus Benefits Office for the appropriate forms. 

<P>
Once completed, the proper forms must be received by your campus Benefits or Payroll Office (determined by your campus) within the deadline for the end-of-the-month payroll processing. This deadline is approximately the tenth of each month. Please check with your campus Benefits or Payroll Office for the date the forms must be received.

<P>
The University cannot be held responsible for any earnings lost due to participants not following procedures or missing deadlines. The correction of errors requires time, which may equate to a loss of earnings on retirement funds. It is important to follow enrollment procedures and deadlines.

<P>
For new employees eligible to participate in the CU Retirement Plan (see <I>Section A</I>), enrollment is mandatory. The participant has thirty days from the date of eligibility to enroll in the plan. If the required forms for enrollment are not received before the deadlines established for payroll processing, the funds will be deposited in a University non-interest-earning account until the proper forms are filed. 

<P>
If the University (campus Benefits or Payroll Office) receives all the proper forms before the end-of-the-month payroll deadlines, it is the University's responsibility to mail your Application/Enrollment to the fund sponsor(s) and to direct your retirement contribution funds to the fund sponsor(s) of your choice in the correct amounts on the end-of-the-month payroll date.

<P>
If the fund sponsors receive the proper forms and retirement funds from the University, it is the fund sponsors' responsibility to post the funds in the amounts directed by you to your accounts within one business day of receiving the funds. 

<P>
As a participant in the CU Retirement Plan, you may initiate changes of  monthly retirement contributions among fund sponsors or transfer retirement accumualtions internally among the funding vehicles of a fund sponsor. You may also transfer retirement accumulations externally among fund sponsors. 

<P>
1.&#009;Retirement Contribution Allocation/Changes

<P>
To initiate a change in the percent of retirement contribution directed to any of the three fund sponsors of Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, and The Vanguard Group, you must complete a University Retirement Plan Contribution/Allocation Change form. A change may be initiated once each month within payroll processing deadlines. 

<P>
2.&#009;Internal Transfers Among the Funding Vehicles <BR>
of a Single Fund Sponsor

<P>
Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, and The Vanguard Group will allow transfers, by telephone or in writing, among any of the six University Retirement Plan-approved funding vehicles offered by the fund sponsor. Transfers to non-approved retirement funding vehicles will not be allowed. 

<P>
You must have enrolled in at least one retirement funding vehicle offered by the funding sponsor in order to initiate internal transfers. You will not be required to complete a new Application/Enrollment form before initiating an internal transfer to another funding vehicle offered by the fund sponsor. You may be required to complete a form after the internal transfer is initiated. 

<P>
Request for internal transfers can be confirmed by the fund sponsors and initiated within one business day. You may transfer all or portions of accumulations within a funding vehicle offered by the fund sponsor to any other approved funding vehicle offered by the same fund sponsor. Please contact the fund sponsor for information on how to initiate an internal transfer.

<P>
3.&#009;External Transfers Among Fund Sponsors

<P>
Participants may initiate external transfers of some or all of the retirement funds accumulated in a funding vehicle of a fund sponsor to another fund sponsor's funding vehicle. The procedures for initiating external transfers among fund sponsors vary depending on which of the three approved fund sponsors are involved. 

<P>
Transfer from TIAA-CREF to Fidelity Investments <BR>
and/or The Vanguard Group

<P>
A transfer of retirement funds from TIAA-CREF to Fidelity Investments and/or The Vanguard Group requires approval by the University. The University must confirm that the campus Benefits Office has received from the participant a Release and Waiver form for the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan (See Section D). An external transfer will not be allowed without a Release and Waiver form completed and on file with the campus Benefits Office.

<P>
To initiate an external transfer from TIAA-CREF to another fund sponsor, you must contact both TIAA-CREF and the fund sponsor receiving the transferred funds. Each will provide you with information on how to initiate the external transfer. External transfer forms for CREF Accounts are available from your campus Benefits Office. External transfer forms for TIAA are available from TIAA-CREF only.

<P>
Once the proper forms are completed and verified by TIAA-CREF and Fidelity Investments and/or The Vanguard Group, the fund sponsors will initiate the external transfer. You are not allowed by the CU Retirement Plan to take active receipt of your retirement funds. The funds will be transferred by mail or wire transfer between the fund sponsors.

<P>
Transfer from Fidelity Investments and/or The Vanguard Group

<P>
Initiating a transfer from Fidelity Investments to TIAA-CREF and/or The Vanguard Group or from The Vanguard Group to Fidelity Investments and/or TIAA-CREF does require University approval. Please contact the fund sponsors involved in the transfer and follow all instructions to initiate the transfer. External transfer forms are available from your campus Benefits Office. Participants are not allowed to transfer retirement funds to other fund sponsors or funding vehicles not authorized by the CU Retirement Plan.

<P>
Restrictions

<P>
Transfer privileges are allowed by the CU Retirement Plan within the limits provided by the University for changes to direct retirement contributions (once per month) and the rules governing internal and external transfers established by the University and each of the fund sponsors.

<P>
If a participant is perceived to be initiating constant transfers among funding vehicles or among fund sponsors, thereby abusing transfer privileges, the University Retirement Plan administrator has the authority to restrict the participant's transfer privileges.

<I>Exception: A new employee appointed to a job title described above who was recruited from a previous employer (not the University of Colorado or a state of Colorado employer) and who participated in the previous employer's institutional retirement plan
 will be deemed to have satisfied the year of service requirement for participation in the CU Retirement Plan. Upon request and presentation of documentation of participation by the employee, participation may begin on the first day of the month following
 employment.</I>

<P>
4.&#009;PERA Participants

<P>
A new employee meeting the conditions described for immediate participation in the CU Retirement Plan or for participation after one year of service who was recruited from a state of Colorado employer (outside of the University of Colorado) and who partic
ipated in the Public Employees' Retirement Association (PERA) with the previous employer will be required to make an irrevocable election upon appointment with the University of Colorado to remain a participant in PERA or begin immediate participation in 
the CU Retirement Plan. Participation in both retirement plans is not an option. 

<P>
Employees meeting the conditions of eligibility for the CU Retirement Plan who choose by irrevocable election to remain in the Public Employees' Retirement Association or by state of Colorado statute must remain a participant in PERA are, by state of Colo
rado statute, not eligible for contributions towards Social Security or Medicare. (PERA members employed on or after April 1, 1986 are covered by Medicare.)

<P>
An employee meeting the conditions described for immediate participation or participation after one year of service who was recruited and then promoted, reclassified, or transferred to the job title from a previous job title internal to the University of 
Colorado and the previous job title required participation in PERA, must continue participation in PERA. State Statute 24-51-310 states generally that if an employee is a member of PERA and maintains an employee/employer relationship with the University o
f Colorado, regardless of job title change, his or her membership in PERA remains mandatory. State Statute 24-51-405 describes the conditions of a separation from service (severing the employee --employer relationship) and receipt of a refund from PERA (a
pproximately ninety days from receipt of a request for refund).

<P>
5.&#009;Ineligible Employees

<P>
Employees in the following groups, categories, and job titles are not eligible for participation in the CU Retirement Plan by University of Colorado Board of Regent Law, state of Colorado statutes, or federal Internal Revenue Service Section Code. Employe
es in these categories should contact their campus Benefits Office for information regarding retirement benefits.

<P>
<I>Classified.</I> An employee whose appointment, defined in State of Colorado statute, is under the authority and rules of the State Department of Personnel as a "classified staff" job title.

<P>
<I>Temporary.</I> An employee whose appointment to a job title under the authority of the University of Colorado Board of Regents is temporary. A temporary appointment may not exceed continuous service in a job title for more than twelve months (one year)
, or nine months for academic-year appointments. See Break-in-Service Rule below.

<P>
<I>Less than 50% time.</I> An employee whose appointment to a job title under the authority of the University of Colorado Board of Regents is part-time. A part-time appointment is defined as an appointment requiring less than 50% time and effort.

<P>
<I>Non-resident visa.</I> An employee whose appointment to a job title under the authority of the University of Colorado Board of Regents is holding a temporary (F-J or J-1) non-resident visa.

<P>
<I>A leased employee.</I> An employee who does not have an employer -- employee relationship with the University. 

<P>
<I>A student.</I> An employee whose appointment to a job title under the authority of the University of Colorado Board of Regents is conditional upon his or her status as a student at the University.

<P>
6.&#009;Sabbaticals and Leaves of Absence

<P>
University-approved sabbaticals and leaves of absence will not terminate participation in the CU Retirement Plan. If you receive any amount of compensation (salary) from the University of Colorado during a sabbatical or leave of absence, contributions to 
the CU Retirement Plan will be based only on the University of Colorado compensation (salary) received. If the sabbatical or leave of absence is without compensation (salary) from the University of Colorado, participation and, therefore, contributions to 
the CU Retirement Plan are deemed suspended and will resume once the sabbatical or leave of absence is complete.

<P>
7.&#009;Break-in-Service Rule

<P>
The break-in-service rule is important for reasons of eligibility for participation in the CU Retirement Plan. A break in service is defined as a period of severance of employment for at least six consecutive months. 

<P>
Conditions not constituting a break in service are defined in University personnel rules as not severing the employer/employee relationship. Examples of no break in service include sabbaticals, approved leaves of absences, maternity/paternity leaves, sick
 leaves, and vacations.

<P>
Contact your campus Benefits Office for an explanation of how a break in service may affect your participation in the CU Retirement Plan. 

<P>
Participation in the CU Retirement Plan will terminate upon any of the following conditions:

<P>
*&#009;You retire from the University of Colorado.

<P>
*&#009;You separate from employment with the University of Colorado.

<P>
*&#009;You are transferred or reclassified, for any reason, to a job title defined as ineligible for participation in the CU Retirement Plan.

<P>
*&#009;The CU Retirement Plan is terminated.

<P>
For information on the definitions of retirement and separations from service, see <I>Section C.</I>

<H3>
Vesting Rights and Rules
</H3>
<P>
As an eligible participant, you possess "vesting rights," or ownership rights, to the contributions directed to fund sponsors and fund accumulations for retirement. The CU Retirement Plan allows you immediate "vesting," or ownership, of all contributions,
 the accumulations of funds, and earnings.

<P>
The immediate vesting privileges do not, however, allow participants or former participants to use or invest the funds beyond the scope of the CU Retirement Plan rules prior to distribution. The rules governing distribution of retirement funds are in <I>S
ection A</I>, page 11.

<P>
The contributions to the CU Retirement Plan, Social Security, and 
Medicare are described below for the 1996-97 plan year. 
Contribution amounts and taxable wage bases are subject to change each 
plan year. Please contact your campus Benefits Office f
or further information. Plan contributions are calculated as a percent of eligible compensation.

4.&#009;Contribution Limitations

<P>
The CU Retirement Plan was designed in accordance with Internal Revenue Service Code Section rules under 401(a) of the Code for Defined Contribution (Money Purchase) Governmental Retirement Plans.

<P>
The CU Retirement Plan is a qualified retirement plan, and as such, the 
Internal Revenue Service Code Section 415 sets limitations on the amount 
of contributions the University may allocate to each participant's 
account(s). For 1997, the amount of contribution (both participant and 
employer) is limited to the lesser of $30,000 or 25% of compensation 
(salary). 

<P>
In general terms, if you earn less than $150,000 (subject to change) in 
compensation (salary) you will not exceed the limit in contributions to 
the plan. By law, when your compensation (salary) exceeds $150,000, 
contributions to your retirement plan will be suspended for earnings 
above this limit until the new plan year begins on July 1 of each year. 
The participant's contribution will revert to earned compensation 
(salary). The University's contribution, by law, is suspended until the 
new plan year and c annot be included in earned compensation (salary).

<P>
1.&#009;Eligibility Rules for Distribution of Funds

<P>
You must meet one of following conditions to receive disbursement of retirement funds from the CU Retirement Plan:

<P>
1.&#009;You must be retired or separated from employment with the University and, if electing any payment option other than a lifetime annuity from TIAA-CREF, you must be age 55 or older. (For the purpose of definition, "retirement" and "separation from e
mployment" are synonymous and denote a severance of the employer/employee relationship.)

<P>
2.&#009;You are totally disabled at any age, receiving Long-Term Disability benefits, and have separated from service with the University.

<P>
If you meet one of the conditions described above, your active participation in the CU Retirement Plan is deemed terminated. At that time, you must elect a payment option for receiving retirement funds within defined time limits.

<P>
If you have separated from employment with the University and choose to elect a payment option other than a lifetime annuity, but at termination did not satisfy the age 55 condition, you may continue to manage your retirement fund accumulation as specifie
d in <I>Section C</I>. Once you attain age 55 and both conditions for disbursement of retirement funds are satisfied, commencement of payment must occur within the defined time limits.

<P>
2.&#009;Eligibility Rules for Additional Benefits and Privileges 

<P>
If you are a participant in the CU Retirement Plan and you meet the University requirements for normal retirement set forth in the following table, you will be eligible for awards of continuing privileges and benefits.

 of service requirements. 

<P>
3.&#009;Early Retirement

<P>
The University of Colorado offers options for early retirement, which afford some of the privileges awarded full retirees. Privileges may include continued, although reduced, University contributions. The amount of the University contribution toward medic
al insurance coverages is prorated based on age and service requirements. (See Faculty Handbook.)

<P>
4.&#009;Repurchase

<P>

<P>
For participants whose oldest TIAA or CREF Retirement Annuity was issued on or before December 31, 1991:

<P>

*&#009;None of the TIAA or CREF Retirement Annuities owned by the participant request-<BR>
&#009;ing repurchase were issued more than five years prior to the time of repurchase. (This<BR>
&#009;five-year repurchase requirement is waived if the total value of all TIAA and CREF <BR>
&#009;Retirement Annuities owned is $2,000 or less), and

<P>
*&#009;The participant is neither employed by nor moving to an institution having a TIAA-<BR>
&#009;CREF funded retirement plan in which he or she will be eligible to participate. <BR>
&#009;(Employment includes sabbaticals and leaves of absence.) 

<P>
If all the conditions described above are met for repurchase, you may apply to the fund sponsor(s), upon University approval, for a lump-sum payment of your retirement funds. The payment will be subject to all conditions of federal and state taxation and 
penalties explained on page 14 for lump-sum distributions and active receipt of retirement funds. Please contact your campus Benefits Office or fund sponsor(s) for further information.

<P>
5.&#009;Payment Options at Retirement

<P>
The CU Retirement Plan provides you with a variety of payment methods for receiving retirement funds at retirement. Upon attaining eligibility for a distribution, you must elect an option or a combination of options and begin receiving retirement funds wi
thin defined time limits.

<P>
The payment options offered are briefly described below. You are encouraged to contact each fund sponsor for detailed information on payment options before retirement. You and your spouse (if you are married) are responsible for electing payment option(s)
.

<P>
Eligible participants receiving a calculation and award from the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan must elect an annuity from TIAA-CREF as their only payment option at retirement. (See <I>TIAA-CREF</I> <I>Lifetime Annuity Options</I>
.) Participants choosing to waive their rights to the University Faculty Supplemental Annuity Retirement Plan may elect other available payment methods. Please see <I>Section D </I>for more information on the supplemental plan.

<P>
TIAA-CREF Lifetime Annuity Options

<P>
TIAA-CREF is the only fund sponsor in the CU Retirement Plan that offers you a choice of annuities at retirement. Annuities are designed to provide you with retirement payments in the form of income that cannot be outlived. The amount of income received i
s based on the amount of your accumulated retirement funds at retirement and your actuarial determined life expectancy. The annuities offered by TIAA-CREF are listed below.

<P>
*&#009;Single Life Annuity

<P>
*&#009;Single Life Annuity with a ten-, fifteen-, or twenty-year guarantee

<P>
*&#009;Joint and Full Survivor Annuity

If you elect an annuity option at retirement, you may also receive a Retirement Transition Benefit option. The TIAA-CREF Retirement Transition Benefit allows 10% of your retirement accumulations in TIAA-CREF to be received in cash at retirement.

<P>
For detailed information on TIAA-CREF lifetime annuity options, written estimates of annuity income at retirement, information on the Retirement Transition Benefit, and election forms, contact TIAA-CREF.

<P>
Other Insurance Company Annuities

<P>
If you wish to receive retirement funds in the form of a lifetime annuity, apart from TIAA-CREF's offered options, you may request a listing of other insurance companies' annuities and pricing from Fidelity Investments. Fidelity Investments does not offer
 lifetime annuities but offers this information service to participants seeking annuities. Please contact Fidelity Investments for more information.

<P>
Fixed-Period Payments 

<P>
TIAA-CREF offers you the ability to receive retirement accumulations from CREF funding vehicles over fixed periods from five to thirty years. At the end of the selected period all benefits will end. If you die during the period selected, payments will con
tinue in the same amounts to a beneficiary for the remainder of the time period. Current tax laws require that the period chosen not exceed your life expectancy or the joint life expectancy of the participant and beneficiary. Contact TIAA-CREF for informa
tion regarding fixed-period payments.

<P>
Minimum Distribution Options

<P>
Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, and The Vanguard Group offer you the ability to receive retirement accumulations from funding vehicles through the minimum distribution option. This option is designed to distribute the minimum income required by IRS regul
ations from funding vehicles while conserving the maximum amount on a tax-deferred basis. For further information and rules governing the minimum distribution option, contact the fund sponsor(s).

<P>
Cash Withdrawals or Lump-Sum Distributions

<P>
Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, and The Vanguard Group offer you the ability to receive your retirement accumulations in a partial or single lump-sum payment. (TIAA cash withdrawals are made over a ten-year period in approximately equal installments.) 

<P>
Payment is distributed in the form of cash (check) or fund shares, or is rolled over into an IRA account with Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF and/or The Vanguard Group.

<P>
If you elect to roll over your retirement fund accumulations with Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, and/or The Vanguard Group, you may receive payments at your discretion or participate in the fund sponsor(s) installment payment programs. Installment payme
nts may be taken on a periodic basis (monthly, quarterly, or annually) and paid by check or by electronic funds transfer directly to your bank.

<P>
Payment distributed in the form of cash (check) may be rolled over to other investment companies or IRA accounts. Many offer installment payment programs similar to those of the fund sponsor(s).

<P>
<I>Caution is advised if you elect a cash withdrawal or lump-sum distribution. </I>Active receipt of retirement accumulation by you may cause taxation on the full amount of retirement funds in the year received if not rolled over within sixty days. In add
ition, beginning January 1, 1993, 20% of retirement funds rolled over by active receipt will be subject to withholding by the IRS for taxes. Please contact Fidelity Investments, TIAA-CREF, and/or The Vanguard Group for more information on their cash withd
rawal options.

<P>
Interest Payment Retirement Option (IPRO)

<P>
TIAA-CREF offers you the ability to receive interest payments from your TIAA accumulations at retirement. This option may be attractive to those participants choosing to maintain the full accumulation amount in TIAA while receiving income of interest othe
rwise credited to TIAA accumulations. Please contact TIAA-CREF for information about IPRO.

<P>
6.&#009;Commencement Rules

<P>
You must elect a payment method for the distribution of retirement funds from the CU Retirement Plan by:

<P>
April 1 of the calendar year after which you reach age 70-1/2, or

<P>
April 1 of the calendar year after which you elect retirement, or 

<P>
April 1 of the calendar year after which you separate from service with the University <BR>
and reach age 55.

<P>
7.&#009;Distribution upon Death of a Participant

<P>
Death of a Participant prior to Electing Retirement

<P>
In the event you die prior to eligibility for retirement, the full current value of your accumulated retirement funds is payable to the beneficiary or beneficiaries named by you under any of the payment options described above. Distribution must commence 
on or before December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year during which death occurred. 

<P>
Beneficiaries should contact the fund sponsor(s) holding the deceased participant's accumulated retirement funds for information on the procedures for fund distribution.

<P>
Death of a Participant after Electing Retirement

<P>
In the event that you die after electing retirement but prior to the election of a distribution or payment option, the guidelines above apply.

<P>
In the event that you die after electing retirement and a payment option, the rules governing the elected payment option will prevail. Beneficiaries should contact the fund sponsor(s) or other institutions holding the retirement accumulations of the decea
sed for information regarding procedures for disbursing or continuing benefit payments.

The University encourages you to become thoroughly knowledgeable about the funding vehicles offered before investing in any of them. Information is available from the fund sponsors, and various books, newspapers, and magazines.

<P>
1.&#009;Fund Objectives

<P>
The following is a brief description of the objectives of several general types of funds. 

<P>
<I>Guaranteed Annuity.</I> This type of fund usually guarantees principal and a specified interest rate, with the opportunity for additional growth through dividends. Investment strategies are considered conservative. Portfolios may contain fixed rates of return from commercial mortgage loans, direct loans, and real estate coupled with publicly traded bonds for income and capital gain. These funds are considered very low risk. 

<P>
<I>Money Market Funds.</I> These funds are used for stability of principal investment, liquidity, and short-term yields. They are generally stable investments with very low risk.

<P>
<I>Fixed-Income Funds.</I> These funds are usually comprised of interest-paying bonds or other debt instruments issued by corporations, banks, and governmental agencies. Risk ranges from funds offering the most highly rated government obligations and corporate paper to higher-yielding bonds of less quality or some mixture of bonds. Some fund portfolios in this category may include high-grade stocks as a portion of investments.

<P>
<I>Growth and Income Funds.</I> These funds may include stocks for both appreciation and dividends paid, as well as bonds. The fund may include large capitalization stocks to convertibles and smaller capitalization stocks. These funds are sometimes called "all-weather funds" or "balanced funds." Many times these funds are used for a conservative portion of a retirement investment portfolio due to the nature of the their mix in conserving income plus capital appreciation.

<P>
<I>Growth Funds.</I> These funds are typically managed to achieve capital appreciation. Depending on management strategy with regard to grade of stocks and speculation, risk can vary from average to above average. These funds generally pay little or no dividends due to the reinvestment of all earnings to support future expansion by growth-oriented companies. Funds in this category may include foreign investments or some mixture of stocks and bonds in U.S. and foreign firms. 

<P>
2.&#009;Management Strategies

<P>
How a fund or account is managed to achieve returns on investments may be determined by the fund sponsor, the fund managers for individual funding vehicles, a market index, or some combination of these factors. You are encouraged to become familiar with the management strategy of each fund chosen for investment. 

<P>
General examples of management strategies are given below.

<P>
<I>Indexing.</I> Some funds are managed to follow market indexes such as the Standard and Poors Composite Index of 500 Stocks (the "S &amp; P 500"). An index is a statistical composite designed to represent the overall market or some specialized portion of the market. There are numerous indexes covering money markets, bonds, and domestic and foreign stock. 

<P>
<I>Passive Management.</I> Passive management is an investment strategy with restricted parameters with regard to the amount and/or type (grade) of stocks, bonds, money markets, or cash the fund may hold to achieve a return. As an example, a company's strategy for a particular fund may require the fund manager to hold a certain portion of high-grade government bonds, allowing them to increase or decrease in volume within a given percentage. The fund manager may be given the choice of which high-grade bonds to purchase for the fund's portfolio but may not be allowed to purchase bonds outside of the fund's parameters.

<P>
<I>Active Management.</I> Active management is an investment strategy allowing the fund manager to invest in <I>any</I> amount or type (grade) of stocks, bonds, or money markets, or to hold cash in order to reach the objective of the fund. The fund manager may be given broad parameters and the ability to move large areas of the fund's portfolio in and out of different markets.

<P>
A fund's strategy may incorporate any combination of these three strategies. The CU Retirement Plan was designed to offer a selection of funds with different management strategies. You should become knowledgeable about these strategies and how you would like to see your own retirement investment managed. Since retirement investments are long term, your comfort with the management of those funds is important.

<P>
Risk

<P>
Risk, as defined for this booklet, is a statistical measure assigned to a funding vehicle by various analytical rating firms or market observers that indicates the potential for gain or loss of return on investments.

<P>
There are a number of arithmetic measures of risk. Most of the statistical methods measure the volatility or risk of stock (equity) funds, since these funds tend to gain or lose returns relatively quickly as compared to bonds or money markets. However, risk measures can be found for each instrument used for investments.

<P>
The risk associated with certain specific funding vehicles, based on various risk measures, is represented in the following chart. (You should obtain more information about each fund before investing.) 

<P>

<IMG ALT="" SRC="./table1.gif">

<P>
The following is a brief description of each funding vehicle offered in the CU Retirement Plan. For additional information, contact the fund sponsor. 

<P>
1.&#009;Fidelity Investments

<P>
Fidelity Retirement Money Market Portfolio (FRMMP)

<P>
A money market fund that seeks as a high level of current income, consistent with the preservation of capital and liquidity. It invests in high- quality U.S. dollar-denominated money market instruments of U.S. and foreign issuers. This fund is a conservative, relatively low-risk investment. While the portfolio seeks to maintain a $1 share price, there is no assurance that it will be able to do so. The portfolio is not insured or guaranteed by the U.S. government.

<P>
Mortgage Securities Fund

<P>
A fixed-income fund with at least 65% of total assets in mortgage-related securities of all kinds. Its objective is high current income, but the risk is the prepayment rate (the rate at which mortgages are refinanced) inverse to the interest rate; as interest rates fall, prepayment rates accelerate.

<P>
Intermediate Bond Fund

<P>
A fixed-income fund with an objective of high current income that invests in high-and upper-to-medium grade bonds with an average maturity of between three and ten years. It is less volatile than a longer-term, higher-yielding fixed-income fund.

<P>
Puritan Fund

<P>
A growth and income (balanced) fund with high current income as its first objective and capital appreciation as its secondary objective. Its broadly diversified portfolio of high-yielding stocks and bonds offers above-average yields, which may also have growth potential. Share prices will fluctuate with changes in both the stock and bond markets.

<P>
Overseas Fund

<P>
A growth fund that seeks long-term growth of capital by investing primarily in foreign securities, including common stock and securities convertible into common stock, as well as debt instruments. Normally, at least 65% of the fund's total assets will be invested in securities of issuers from at least three different countries outside of North America. Share price and return will vary. It is important to remember that foreign investments pose both greater risk and greater potential reward than U.S. investments. 

<P>
Magellan Fund

<P>
A growth fund that is broadly diversified, with investments in both well-known and lesser-known companies. The fund invests in companies with strong earnings but also considers value and cyclical stocks. The risk is reduced through diversification across over 700 holdings, but as with any stock fund, share price and return will fluctuate.

<P>
2.&#009;TIAA and CREF Investments

<P>
TIAA Traditional Annuity

<P>
An annuity account that guarantees principal and a specified interest rate, with the opportunity for additional growth through dividends. TIAA accumulations can never decrease. They will increase by at least the guaranteed rate, but the total rate may fluctuate from one year to another.

<P>
CREF Money Market Account

<P>
A money market account that seeks high current income and capital preservation by investing in highly liquid instruments, with returns that closely parallel changes in interest rates.

<P>
CREF Bond Market Account

<P>
A fixed-income account that seeks favorable long-term returns through high current income and capital preservation. The account invests in bonds representing many different companies and government agencies. 

<P>
CREF Social Choice Account

<P>
A growth and income (balanced) account investing in companies that meet specific criteria for social responsibility, with investments in stocks, bonds, and money market securities.

<P>
CREF Stock Account

<P>
A growth account seeking favorable long-term returns through capital appreciation. The account invests primarily in domestic stocks and some international stocks.

<P>
CREF Global Equities Account

<P>
A growth account actively managed seeking favorable long-term rates of return through capital appreciation and investment income. The account invests in foreign and domestic stocks distributed in percentages approximating the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (MSCI).

<P>
3.&#009;The Vanguard Group 

<P>
Vanguard Money Market Reserves -- Prime Portfolio

<P>
A money market fund investing in high-quality certificates of deposit, banker's acceptances, commercial paper, and U.S. government securities.

<P>
Vanguard Fixed Income Securities Fund -- Investment Grade Corporate Portfolio

<P>
A fixed-income fund investing in a diversified portfolio of high-quality (investment-grade) corporate bonds.

<P>
Vanguard STAR Fund

<P>
A growth and income (balanced) fund seeking growth of capital and income through a strategically diversified investment approach that uses a combination of nine Vanguard funds and portfolios.

<P>
Windsor Fund&#009;

<P>
A growth and income fund seeking long-term growth of capital and income by investing primarily in common stocks.

<P>
Vanguard Index Trust -- Total Stock Market Portfolio

<P>
A growth (indexed) fund seeking to match the investment performance of the Wilshire 5000 Index, an index consisting of all regularly and publicly traded U.S. stocks.

<P>
Vanguard World Fund -- International Growth Portfolio

<P>
A growth fund investing in non-U.S. equity securities selected on the basis of appreciation potential. The portfolio tends to be widely diversified geographically and in market capitalization.

<P>
As a participant in the CU Retirement Plan, you are responsible for the investment of your retirement funds. In an effort to help you achieve your retirement goals, information has been provided in the back pocket of this booklet to introduce you to the general principles of retirement investments. The University encourages you to read the information provided and to use it as a guideline for investments.

<P>
Information on asset allocation for retirement, on creating diversified portfolios for retirement, on advantages of long-term vs. short-term investments, and on general rules, hints, and ideas for retirement investments, in addition to information on each of the funding vehicles and prospects, may be obtained from each fund sponsor.

<P>
Throughout the year, your campus Benefits Office will schedule various informational events designed to introduce interested participants to fund sponsor representatives and provide retirement plan information. Occasional seminars on investment strategies of retirement planning, presented by fund sponsors, will also be scheduled. For more information on special events, contact your campus Benefits Office.

				t Duke University, the Graduate School serves as the intellectual 
				and academic core of the institution. It is the place where we strive to 
				achieve the fullest realization of our fundamental missions:

 				<center>
 				<img src="images/1.gif" width=13 height=13 border=0 alt="1">
 				</center>
 				To educate the next generation of teachers,  scholars, researchers, 
 				and professional leaders.

 				<center>
 				<img src="images/2.gif" width=13 height=13 border=0 alt="1">
 				</center>
 				To develop the fields of knowledge and research within which these 
 				leaders will work.

  				<center>
 				<img src="images/3.gif" width=13 height=13 border=0 alt="1">
 				</center>
 				To ensure that our student body, its educational programs, and the 
  				scholarship of its faculty and students are of the highest 
  				intellectual quality and an appropriate level of diversity.

  				<center>
 				<img src="images/4.gif" width=13 height=13 border=0 alt="1">
 				</center>
 				To develop from all possible sources such funding as is necessary 
  				to support its student body equitably and adequately.



  				<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=10 width=0 height=0 border=0  alt=" "><br>
				Duke's Graduate School is also uniquely positioned as the natural 
				catalyst for progressive change and innovation across the institution.  
				Over fifty graduate programs actively contribute to and draw from 
				every other unit of the university -- from the undergraduate programs 
				in Trinity College and in Engineering, to the professional Schools 
				of Business, Divinity, Engineering, the Environment, Law, and Medicine.

				We welcome you to explore our programs and our School.

				facilities for physics, botany, zoology, chemistry, 
				psychology, sociology, engineering, and biochemistry, 
				and well-equipped laboratories in the various departments 
				of medical science. They have been built entirely, or

				The Office of Graduate Student Affairs and Minority Programs (OGSAMP) 
				serves as an information resource center dedicated to 
				enhancing the quality of graduate student life and fostering 
				a sense of connection to the interdisciplinary scholarly 
				community.  Through interaction with students, faculty and 
				administrative offices, OGSAMP offers advocacy, referral, 
				programing, information and advising on a variety of issues 
				related to graduate student life including health, safety,
				disability, discrimination, diversity, harassment, social 
				awareness, community involvement, personal and professional 
				development.

				<img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 width=0 height=0 border=0  alt=" ">			
				In addition, OGSAMP coordinates, supplements and expands the 
				recruiting efforts of graduate departments and programs, 
				particularly in recruiting African-American students and 
				students in other underrepresented areas.   OGSAMP serves 
				as a primary source in helping <a href="minorityprog.htm">minority students</a> 
				identify external sources of funding; in providing 
				general counseling for minority students; and in developing 
				programs to enhance minority participation in graduate 
				education, as well as promoting an academic and social 
				environment where minority scholars can flourish.

				annually allocated awards funds, instruction, endowed fellowships, 
				foundations and other private support, as well as federal 
				research and training grants.

			 	mentioned in this section should so indicate on the 
				application form for admission and award; no special 
				application is required. Currently enrolled students who 
				wish to apply for university awards for advanced students

                                        esteemed scholars. To this end, an optimum doctoral program within the Graduate
                                        School will have an enrollment ranging between twenty-five and one hundred students,
                                        admitting ten to thirty new students each year and awarding three to ten Ph.D. degrees
                                        a year.

		<!-- DESCRIPTIVE TEXT FOR THE GENERAL AREA IS HERE-->
		Located in the lush and rolling piedmont region near the geographic center of
		the state of North Carolina, Durham is an eminently liveable town with most of the
		amenities you might expect to find in a much larger, urban environment.
		Durham's population today is approximately 147,000 and it is one of the three city 
		hubs in what is known as 
		"The Triangle," a metropolitan area of just under one million.

		The Graduate School offices are located on Duke's West Campus in the Allen Building. See the map below 
		for precise location. The Allen Building is highlighted in red. As a reference for location,
		use the Chapel, which is denoted by an icon on the map. The chapel is a dominant feature of the 
		Duke campus. If you can find the chapel, you have found the graduate school offices.

				The Office of Graduate Student Affairs and Minority Programs (OGSAMP) 
				serves as an information resource center dedicated to 
				enhancing the quality of graduate student life and fostering 
				a sense of connection to the interdisciplinary scholarly 
				community.  Through interaction with students, faculty and 
				administrative offices, OGSAMP offers advocacy, referral, 
				programing, information and advising on a variety of issues 
				related to graduate student life including health, safety,
				disability, discrimination, diversity, harassment, social 
				awareness, community involvement, personal and professional 
				development.

				<img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 width=0 height=0 border=0  alt=" ">			
				In addition, OGSAMP coordinates, supplements and expands the 
				recruiting efforts of graduate departments and programs, 
				particularly in recruiting African-American students and 
				students in other underrepresented areas.   OGSAMP serves 
				as a primary source in helping <a href="minorityprog.htm">minority students</a> 
				identify external sources of funding; in providing 
				general counseling for minority students; and in developing 
				programs to enhance minority participation in graduate 
				education, as well as promoting an academic and social 
				environment where minority scholars can flourish.

				to address issues of concern to graduate students and their families.

		<!-- DESCRIPTIVE TEXT FOR THE GENERAL AREA IS HERE-->
		Located in the lush and rolling piedmont region near the geographic center of
		the state of North Carolina, Durham is an eminently liveable town with most of the
		amenities you might expect to find in a much larger, urban environment.
		Durham's population today is approximately 147,000 and it is one of the three city 
		hubs in what is known as 
		"The Triangle," a metropolitan area of just under one million.

		The Graduate School offices are located on Duke's West Campus in the Allen Building. See the map below 
		for precise location. The Allen Building is highlighted in red. As a reference for location,
		use the Chapel, which is denoted by an icon on the map. The chapel is a dominant feature of the 
		Duke campus. If you can find the chapel, you have found the graduate school offices.

                                        he Duke ideal is a small number of superior students working closely together with 
                                        esteemed scholars. To this end, an optimum doctoral program within the Graduate
                                        School will have an enrollment ranging between twenty-five and one hundred students,
                                        admitting ten to thirty new students each year and awarding three to ten Ph.D. degrees
                                        a year.

		uke University has made a strong commitment to increasing 
		the diversity of its student body and faculty by means of 
		a long-term financial commitment to recruitment and retention 
		programs and competitive financial aid packages for minority students.  
		Duke has programs in place to significantly increase the number 
		of minority faculty in all departments.  In addition, the Minority 
		Affairs Committee, a permanent subcommittee of the Executive 
		Committee of the Graduate Faculty, deals specifically with 
		minority access issues in the Graduate School.

		The Duke Endowment is a competitive award offered by the Graduate School 
		to new matriculants to Ph.D. programs. Applicants are nominated by the department 
		and selected by a faculty committee and the Dean of the Graduate School.  The 
		Fellowship covers tuition, registration, health fees, and provides a stipend of $11,000 for 
		the calendar year.  The Presidential Fellowship is the Duke Endowment with the added 
		benefit of $500 towards books. The fellowships provide funding for four years .  
		Service in the form of a research or teaching assistantship may be required, especially 
		in the third or fourth year.  Fellows are eligible to compete for dissertation support in the fifth year.

		collaborative effort between Duke and approximately 25 historically black 
		colleges and universities.  The Consortium provides partial fellowship support 
		for students from participating institutions and is supplemented by University funds.

		<a name=gem><b>The National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc. (GEM)</b></a><br>
		The National Consortium for Graduate Degrees for Minorities in Engineering and Science, Inc., (GEM), 
		a non-profit corporation, was formed to encourage minority students to seriously consider 
		advanced study in engineering and the natural sciences.   The GEM Fellowship includes a 
		summer internship component which is designed to give the fellows practical experience in 
		their chosen fields at the research laboratories of GEM employer members.  Candidates for 
		participation in these programs are selected from the following under represented groups: 
		American Indians, African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Puerto Ricans.  Funding for 
		GEM Fellows is dependent on admission and a financial award from a member university.  
		The deadline for fellowship application is December 1.  Application information is available in 
		the Graduate School Office of Student Affairs and Minority Programs.

		The National Physical Science Consortium offers a graduate fellowship program for 
		women and minorities in the physical sciences.  The fellowship includes funding, paid 
		summer employment and technical experience with leading national employers, mentors 
		on campus and at the worksite, opportunities to present research cameos at national 
		meetings, and networking opportunities with scientists from major research laboratories 
		and universities.  Candidates for the fellowship must be U.S. citizens; Black, Hispanic, 
		American Indian and/or female; have an undergraduate academic standing as a senior 
		with at least a 3.0 GPA; be eligible to pursue graduate study at a participating NSC

		<a name=recruit><b>Recruiting</b></a><br>
		OGSAMP coordinates, supplements, and expands the recruiting efforts of graduate 
		departments and programs.  OGSAMP staff visit numerous locations around the 
		country to actively seek out talented minority students.  Please feel free to contact 
		us here at Duke and arrange to <a href= /scripts/dbml.exe?template=/riapps/calendar/customer/dukegs/main.dbm&view=recruiting>meet a representative from Duke</a> when we are in 
		your area. 

		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=5 border=0 alt=" "><br>

		<a name=bridges><b>Building Bridges to Graduate Education</b></a><br>
		The symposia were initiated as a university-wide effort to address the issue of 
		institutional support for students and faculty of color on a broad scale.  In the past, 
		national scholars and administrators have been invited to Dukes campus to discuss 
		such issues as the experiences of black students on predominantly white campuses, 
		minority access and achievements in higher education, enhancing minority presence 
		in graduate education, and preparing future minority faculty.  Since 1993, the 
		symposia have taken a more hands-on approach.  Faculty representatives from 
		Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) meet with Duke faculty in 
		the graduate departments.  Similarly, Duke faculty representatives have made 
		reciprocal visits to HBCU campuses.
		
		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
		<img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
		The goal of this annual program is to "Build Bridges" by initiating a focused and 
		candid dialogue on the relationship between undergraduate and graduate curricula, 
		departmental graduate school requirements, departmental student admissions 
		procedures, financial support, and creating supportive environments.  Our hope is 
		that these collaborations will foster ongoing liaisons -- faculty to faculty, school to 
		school, and faculty to student.

		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=5 border=0 alt=" "><br>

		<a name=color><b>Graduate Student of Color Monthly Meetings</b></a><br>
		Once a month, OGSAMP arranges an informal gathering of Graduate Students of Color.  
		These gatherings usually take place in the Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture.  
		Students decide themes and discussion topics, and are encouraged to participate in 
		the planning process.  The first meeting of the Fall, 1996 semester will be 6:30 - 8:00 pm 
		on September 5.  Please check the <a href= /scripts/dbml.exe?template=/riapps/calendar/customer/dukegs/main.dbm&view=ogsamp>OGSAMP calendar</a> for other upcoming events. 
		
		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=5 border=0 alt=" "><br>

		<a name=mail><b>Graduate Student of Color Mailing List</b></a><br>
		OGSAMP maintains a mailing list for all Graduate Students of Color, who are 
		automatically subscribed to the list.  To unsubscribe or report problems on the 
		list, please send a message to ogsamp@duke.edu.

		 To fully experience the Graduate School's website, you will need to view it
		with either <b>Netscape Navigator</b> and <b>Microsoft Internet Explorer.</b> We
		recommend Netscape 3.0.

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=3><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		It's easy to download a new browser. Both Netscape and Microsoft provide clear,
		well-written instructions. We encourage you to use the latest versions.  Simply
		click on an icon at the bottom of this page to download.

		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		<b>AOL users:</b> Don't use AOL's browser. Even version 3.0
		 is not nearly as good as
		Netscape 3.0 or Internet Explorer 3.0. Follow
		directions from the Internet Connection area to
		download and use Netscape or Explorer.

		It's not enough to have the best browser. You must learn to use it efficiently if
		you wish to get the most out of your surfing experience.  We have gathered
		several key tips to help you.



		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=6><br>


		<font size=+2>What Do You Prefer?</font><br>
		The most important thing to do with your browser is to change the <b>General Preferences.</b>
		This is a menu sub-item under the <b>Options</b> menu in Netscape. Through 
		the preferences, you can radically change your web viewing for the better.

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=2><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		From the <b>Options</b> menu, select <b>General Preferences,</b> then click 
		on the <b>Appearance</b> tab. You should change the following items:
		
		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=2><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		In the <b>Toolbars</b> area, check <b>Text</b> as your preferred way of 
		displaying the toolbar. This will increase the real viewing
		area of your browser.

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=2><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		In the Link Styles area, <i>uncheck</i> <b>Links are Underlined.</b> You'll
		probably find that links look much better without the underline feature.


		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=10><br>	
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>	
		Click <b>Okay</b>, and notice the differences.
		


		<!-- NO DIRECTIONS NEEDED -->

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=15><br>
		<font size=+2>No Directions Needed</font><br>

		If you want to expand the actual viewing area of your browser even more, here's a neat tip:
		Under the <b>Options</b> menu, click to remove the check before <b>Show Directory Buttons</b>.
		This will remove the second bar of buttons from your Netscape window. These buttons include <b>Net Search</b>
		and <b>Net Directory</b>. Don't worry that they are gone; you can still access these features easily by 
		pulling down the <b>Directory</b> menu.  You'll gain a great deal of viewing area. If you have a small monitor,
		you'll love the difference.



		<!-- COLOR ME BLUE -->

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=11><br>
		<font size=+2>Color Me Blue</font><br>

		For some curious reason, the powers that be in the Internet arena have
		dictated that the default color for all links is bright blue, while the default
		color for visited links is purple.  The blue and purple live on a neutral grey background.

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=5><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		You don't have to stand for that!

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=5><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		You can change these colors, and thus soothe your eyes when viewing most websites.
		Simply go back to the <b>Options</b> menu, choose <b>General Preferences,</b> and click the <b>Color</b> tab. 
		Check the <b>Custom</b> box and then click <b>Choose Color.</b> Set your <b>Link Color</B> to red,
		<B>Followed Links </B>color to blue, <B>Text Color </B>to black and <B>Background Color</B> to white.

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=2><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		<i>Do not</i> choose the <b>Always Use My Colors</b> option. This way, when sites have preset 
		colors, you can see them. When they do not, you'll see your very pleasant white background
		with more sensible colors.

		


		<!-- REMEMBER WHEN -->
		
		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=12><br>
		<font size=+2>Remember When...</font><br>

		By adjusting how Netscape interacts with your computer,
		 you can effectively speed up the downloading of graphics.
		Once again, go to the <B>Options</B> menu. This time however, choose
		<B>Network Preferences.</B> Go to the <B>Cache</B> area. In this area you have two 
		boxes to fill, a <B>Memory Cache </B>and a <B>Disk Cache</B>. The memory cache is related to how
		much RAM your computer has. If you have at least 8 megabytes of memory, set your
             		memory cache to 4,000 kilobytes.

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=1><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		Netscape caches an image once it is loaded onto your screen. 
        That is, once you load an image, Netscape "keeps" it for later on.  A large 
        disk cache setting allows more graphics to be cached. This makes the 
        pages on a given site load even faster.  Therefore, give your browser a large 
		disk cache. The larger your disk cache, the faster your browser 
		will function. It should be at least 20,000 kilobytes. 
		



		<!-- THE WIDE OPEN SPACES -->

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=12><br>
		<font size=+2>The Wide Open Spaces...</font><br>

		Don't be timid with your screen space. Increase the size of Netscape's window
		to fill the area of your monitor. This website is tailored to small monitors that display
		few colors, but if you've got the real estate, use it! Drag your window to increase the size or, in
		Windows, simply maximize your Netscape window.

		<br><img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " vspace=1><br>
		<img src="/duke/images/cleardot.gif" alt=" " hspace=5>
		Better yet, you should increase your <B>screen resolution</B>. This is the best way to squeeze more viewing
		area from your monitor.  In Windows, access the Display icon in Control Panel and increase resolution to 
		to 800 X 600. If you are unable to make a change in resolution due to the limitations of your
		monitor, you will not have any choices to click. On the Macintosh, simply access the Control Panels via the 
		Apple Menu and go to the Monitors Control Panel.
		You'll probably never go back to 640 X 480 again!

		The William R. Perkins Library, the main library of the university, houses books, journals, and online resources supporting the humanities and social sciences, as well as a large collection of United States federal and state documents, and public documents of many European and Latin American countries. The library is a depository for U.S., North Carolina, and European documents. An international focus is evident throughout the library collections, reflecting the global strengths of area programs at the university. Included are extensive research collections from and about South Asia, Latin America, Africa, Europe, Russia, and Poland, as well as the countrys largest collection of Canadiana.  The East Asian Collection offers resources in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean on a variety of topics, predominantly history, politics, literature, and language. The newspaper collection includes many eighteenth-century titles; strong holdings of nineteenth-century New England papers;  and antebellum and Civil War papers of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, and Georgia; as well as many European and Latin American papers.

		The Divinity School Library contains a collection of more than 295,000 volumes in the field of religion and related disciplines. Although an integral part of the universitys twelve-unit library system, the Divnity School Library has its own separate facilities in the Divinity School building. Its book collection is operated on the open stack system, and its reading rooms provide study facilities for students, space for the special reference collection in religion, and for the more than 600 religious periodicals to which the library currently subscribes.
		
		<img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=2 alt=" " border=0><br>
		<img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 alt=" " border=0>
		Staffed by a librarian and a reference librarian trained in both theology and library administration, by a supporting  staff of three persons, and by a number of student assistants, the Divinity School offers a variety of reference services to assist the student in selecting and locating materials. The staff, in cooperation with the faculty, maintains a book and periodical collection to support basic course work as well as advanced research in all major fields of religious studies.
		

		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=4 alt=" " border=0><br>

In addition to the faculties and students in the Schools of Medicine, Allied Health, and Medical Center graduate departments, the library serves the professional and technical staffs of Duke Hospital as well as other health professionals throughout North Carolina. Over 270,000 volumes are available; approximately 3,000 journal subscriptions are currently maintained, in addition to extensive back files of older materials. Professional reference librarians are available for assistance in the use of library resources, and arrangements may be made for individual or group tours, instruction, or specialized seminars.
		The History of Medicine Collections, including the Josiah C. Trent Collection, consist of rare books and manuscripts and a supporting group of histories, biographies, bibliographies, pictures, and ephemeral materials. The rare books are available to all, but are restricted to library use. Most modern books may be borrowed. The History of Medicine Collections also include the Duke Authors Collection, which preserves an archival copy of each book published by a member of the Duke medical faculty. The Frank Engel Memorial Collection consists of a small group of books for leisure reading in nonmedical subjects, supplemented by several newspapers and popular magazines. A reserve collection of heavily used books and journals is maintained in the Medical Sciences Branch Library located in the Nanaline Duke Building and covers the fields of biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, and physiology.

		 The School of Law Library, with over 450,000 volumes, serves both the university and the local legal community. It features comprehensive coverage of basic Anglo-American primary source materials, including nearly all reported decisions of federal and state courts, as well as current and retrospective collections of federal and state codes and session laws. Digests, legal encyclopedias, and other indexing devices provide access to the primary documents. A large section of the library collection is devoted to treatises on all phases of law, as well as history, economics, government, and other social and behavioral sciences relevant to legal research. The treatises are organized in the Library of Congress classification system and are accessible through a public catalog. Special treatise collections are maintained in several subject areas, including the George C. Christie collection in jurisprudence and the Floyd S. Riddick collection of autographed senatorial material. The library is a selective depository for United States government publications, with concentration on congressional and administrative law materials. The library receives the records and briefs from the United States Supreme Court, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the North Carolina Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. In addition to its Anglo-American holdings, the library holds substantial research collections in foreign and international law. The foreign law collection is extensive in coverage, with concentrations in European law and business law materials. The international law collection is strong in primary source and treatise material on both private and public international law topics. Undergraduate and graduate students whose course of study requires access to legal literature may use the library. However, access to the library may be restricted during certain times because of accreditation standards.

		<b>The Circulation/Reserves Department</b><br>
		The Circulation/Reserves Department houses the required reading materials placed on reserve for most graduate and undergraduate courses. The department is phasing in campus online access to reserve readings.

		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=4 alt=" " border=0><br>
		<b>Connected resources</b><br>
		The libraries at Duke, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and North Carolina State University are connected by a computer network. Members of the Duke community can easily and quickly determine what books and other library materials are held by UNC and NCSU. Through a reciprocal borrowing agreement, faculty and students at Duke may borrow materials from both of these libraries.
		
		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=4 alt=" " border=0><br>
		<b>Reference librarians</b><br>
		Reference librarians are on duty in Perkins Library for most of the hours the library is open. Their primary responsibility is to assist patrons in making the most effective use of library collections and facilities. In addition to answering specific questions, the reference librarians also help patrons access information by identifying and explaining the use of library sources and by giving formal and informal instruction to groups of students, faculty, or staff. Professional reference service is available to students in all other campus libraries.
		
		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=4 alt=" " border=0><br>
		<b>Tours</b><br>
		Tours of the Perkins Library are given frequently during Orientation Week and upon request throughout the year. Information about other campus libraries may be obtained from the staff in each of the libraries. The library has both facsimile and copying services. The rules with regard to copyright and a schedule of fees for reproduction services are available in the library at the point of service.
		

		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=4 alt=" " border=0><br>
		<b>University Archives</b><br>
		The Duke University Archives, the official archival agency of the university, collects, preserves, and administers the records of the university having continuing administrative or historical value. The institutional archives, which also include published material, photographs, papers of student groups and faculty, and selected memorabilia, are available for research under controlled conditions in 341 Perkins Library.

		he Center for International Studies is one of the major coordinating 
		units in the university which stimulate dialogue and research on global 
		issues. The center sponsors a number of faculty committees that focus on 
		major regions of the world and on major analytical themes which are 
		transnational in nature. The undergraduate major in Comparative Area 
		Studies provides teaching assistantships for graduate students in the 
		humanities and social sciences. The center also administers a graduate 
		fellowship program for research overseas. For more information contact 
		Dr. Josefina C. Tiryakian, Senior Coordinator of Programs, Center for 
		International Studies, Duke University, Box 90404, Durham, North 
		Carolina 27708-0404.


		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=5 alt=" " border=0><br>
		The Center for Mathematics and Computation in Life Sciences and 
		Medicine was established in 1986 to meet the growing need for 
		quantitative methods in the understanding of complex biological 
		and medical systems. Many important research problems, both basic 
		and applied, now require the collaboration of experimental biologists, 
		mathematicians, and computer scientists. The purpose of the center 
		is to facilitate such collaborations between researchers in different 
		departments and institutions, as well as between academic and industrial 
		laboratories. Address inquiries to Professor Michael Reed, Department
		of Mathematics, Duke University, Box 90320, Durham, North Carolina 27708-0320.


		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=5 alt=" " border=0><br>
		The Medical Historian Training Program is conducted under the auspices 
		of the School of Medicine and the Graduate School. The M.D.-Ph.D. program 
		is intended for those students who know that their major career effort 
		will be in teaching and other scholarly activities in the history of 
		medicine (not necessarily to the total exclusion of clinical medicine). 
		The M.D.-A.M., on the other hand, is appropriate for those who are 
		undecided, but who wish to acquire a firm foundation for future study. 
		Applicants must meet the requirements for admission to the School of 
		Medicine and the Graduate School in the Department of History. 
		Inquiries should be addressed to Dr. Peter English, Director, Medical 
		Historian Training Program, Box 3675 Duke University Medical Center, 
		Durham, North Carolina 27710.

		<a href="http://www.env.duke.edu/research-centers/wetlnd.html">The Wetland Center</a> 
		facilitates and conducts interdisciplinary research focused on wetland 
		ecosystems. Current research is directed toward the management or 
		reconstruction of wetlands to sustain ecological functions while 
		allowing compatible development on adjacent land; valuation of wetlands 
		in both economic and ecological terms; the delineation of wetland 
		boundaries; and the effectiveness of different wetland types in 
		processing and storing nutrients. For further information, write to 
		Dr. Curtis J. Richardson, Nicholas School of the Environment, Duke

		The Center for Research on Women is a collaborative effort between 
		Duke University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
		The center promotes women's studies scholarship and research throughout 
		North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. The center's principal 
		focus is to explore the interacting dynamics of gender, race, and 
		class, with a particular emphasis on the American South. The 
		center offers a limited number of opportunities for graduate 
		student internships. For more information contact Project Director

                <b>Interruption of Program and Withdrawal <br>from the Graduate School.</b> <br>
		Students are expected to meet academic requirements and financial obligations, as specified
               	in the Bulletin, in order to remain in good standing. Certain nonacademic rules and
                regulations must be observed also. Failure to meet these requirements may result in summary
                dismissal by the appropriate officer of the university.

                                The university reserves the right, and matriculation by the student is a concession to this right, to
                                request the withdrawal of any student whose academic performance at any time is not satisfactory
                                to the university. A student who wishes for any reason to withdraw from the Graduate School
                                during the fall, spring, or summer session must notify in writing both the director of graduate
                                studies in the major department and the dean of the Graduate School prior to the date of the
                                expected withdrawal and no later than the published last day of classes for that semester or
                                summer session. If students wish to withdraw from courses in the summer session, they must
                                consult both the director of graduate studies in the major department and the director of the
                                Summer Session. For refunds upon withdrawal, see the Bulletin chapter on  'Financial Information.' A student who, after successfully completing one semester of graduate study, must withdraw before completion of a graduate program may, with the approval of the major department, request the dean to issue a certificate of graduate study.

                                <b>Leave of Absence. </b> <br>
                               A leave of absence for a period of time no longer
                                than one calendar year may be granted because of medical necessity, full-time employment,
                                receipt of an external award, or other acceptable reasons. 
                                <a href="/duke/forms/loa.doc"><b>A request for a leave of absence</b></a>
                                should be originated by the student, endorsed by the student's major professor 
                                and director of graduate studies, and submitted to the dean of the Graduate 
                                School for consideration prior to the beginning of the semester for which the 
                                leave is requested. A student is eligible to request a leave of absence only after 
                                having completed at least one semester at Duke. Time limitations which pertain 
                                to the various degrees and the completion of  courses on which a grade of I 
                                (incomplete) was earned are not waived.

                                <b>Graduate Credit Earned before <br>
                                the A.B. Degree Is Granted.</b> <br>
                                Ordinarily no credit will be allowed
                                for graduate courses taken before a student has been awarded the A.B. or B.S. degree. However,
                                an undergraduate student at Duke University, who at the beginning of the final semester lacks no
                                more than three courses in order to fulfill the requirements of the bachelor's degree, may apply for
                                admission to the Graduate School for that final semester. If the student meets the requirements for
                                admission, permission may be obtained from the dean of the Graduate School to enroll for
                                graduate courses to bring the total program to no more than four courses. (Only one semester of
                                full-time tuition credit for the Ph.D. program will be granted to nondegree students.) In addition
                                to undergraduate registration, the student must register in and pay tuition for those courses to the
                                Graduate School at the beginning of the semester in which graduate credit is to be earned in order
                                for the courses to be credited toward a graduate degree program.

                                <b>Transfer of Graduate Credits.</b><br>
                                 For master's programs, the transfer of graduate credit does not
                                reduce the required minimum registration of 30 units for a master's degree at Duke. For Ph.D.
                                students, one semester of full-time tuition credit may be given if the student has completed a
                                graduate degree at another institution. No credit will be given to those students who wish to
                                receive a master's degree en route to the Ph.D. Up to one semester of tuition credit may be given
                                to students who have completed graduate course work at Duke as nondegree students. Financial
                                credit for the above programs will be given only after the student has completed one full-time
                                semester in a degree-granting graduate program. (For Ph.D. students, departments are free to
                                consider previous course work in determining further course requirements for the student
                                Academic credit is distinct from financial credit or registration requirements for the degree.)

		<b>Grades.</b><br>
	              Grades in the Graduate School are as follows: <i>E, G, S, F, and I. E</i> (excellent) is the
                                highest mark; <i>G</i> (good) and <i>S</i> (satisfactory) are the remaining passing marks; <i>F</i>
                                (failing) is an unsatisfactory grade; and <i>I</i> (incomplete) indicates that some portion of the
                                student's work is lacking, for an acceptable reason, at the time the grades are reported. For
                                students enrolled in the Graduate School, the instructor who gives an <i>I</i> for a course specifies
                                the date by which the student must make up the deficiency. If a course is not completed within
                                one calendar year from the date the course ended, the grade of <i>I</i> becomes permanent and may
                                not be removed from the student's record. The grade of <i>Z</i> indicates satisfactory progress at
                                the end of the first semester of a two-semester course. For unclassified graduate students enrolled
                                in the  summer session, a temporary <i>I</i> for a course may be assigned after the student has
                                submitted a written request. If the request is approved by the instructor of the course, then the
                                student must satisfactorily complete the work prior to the last day of classes of the subsequent
                                summer term. A grade of <i>F</i> in a major course normally occasions withdrawal from a degree
                                program not later than the end of the ensuing semester or term; a grade of <i>F</i> in any other
                                course occasions at least academic probation.

                                <b>Reciprocal or Interinstitutional <br>
                                Agreements with Neighboring Universities.</b><br>
                                 Under a plan of cooperation between Duke University and the University of North
                                Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina Central University in Durham, and North Carolina State
                                University at Raleigh, full-time students properly enrolled in the Graduate School of Duke
                                University during the regular academic year, and paying full tuition to this institution, may be
                                admitted to a maximum of two courses per semester at one of the other institutions in the
                                cooperative plan. Under the same arrangement, students in the graduate schools in the
                                neighboring institutions may be admitted to course work at Duke University. Credit so earned is
                                not defined as transfer credit. To take advantage of this arrangement during either summer session
                                term, the student registers for 3 units of credit at the home institution and 3 units of credit at the
                                other institution, for a total of 6 units. All interinstitutional registrations involving extra-fee
                                courses or special fees required of all students will be made at the expense of the student and will

                                The formal requirements for the MA and MS are as follows:
                                1) A minimum of 30 units of credit registration, at least
                                24 of which must be graded. (Some programs require more
                                graded units.),  2)Continuous registration, 3)a master's exam,
                                and 4)many departments have further requirements, such as a
                                thesis or dissertation.

                                The Graduate School requires no foreign
                                language for the master's degree. Certain departments, however, do have language requirements
                                and these must be satisfied before the master's examination can be taken.

                                Students must present acceptable grades for a minimum of 24 units of graded course work 
                                (Some programs will require more course work). Consult <a href="/scripts/dbml.dll?template=/duke/programs/programs.dbm">department</a> for requirements on major

                                Individual departments decide whether the M.A./M.S. program may be completed by submission
                                of an approved thesis or by other academic exercises.
                                The thesis should demonstrate the student's ability
                                to collect, arrange, interpret, and report pertinent material on a research problem. The thesis must
                                be written in an acceptable style and should exhibit the student's competence in scholarly
                                procedures. Requirements of form are set forth in the <a href="/duke/forms/thesis.doc"><b>Duke University Guide for the Preparation
                                of Theses and Dissertations</b></a>, copies of which are available in the Graduate School office.
                                The thesis must be submitted in an approved form to the Graduate School on or before April 15
                                for a May degree, ten days before the final day of the second summer term for a  September
                                degree, ten days before the final day of the fall semester for a December degree, and at least one
                                week before the scheduled date of the final examination. The copies of the thesis will be
                                distributed by the student to the several members of the examining committee. Two copies for the
                                library and one copy for the adviser will be bound upon payment of the university binding fee of
                                $25.

                                The committee will conduct the examination and certify the student's success or failure by signing
                                the card provided by the Graduate School office. This card indicates completion of all
                                requirements for the degree. If a thesis is presented, the committee members also sign all copies of
                                the thesis, and the candidate then returns the original and first two copies to 013 Perkins Library.

                                the Graduate School office no later than April 15. Candidates desiring to have their degrees
                                conferred on September 1 must have completed all requirements, including the recording of
                                transfer of credit, by the final day of the Duke University summer session. Candidates completing
                                degree requirements after that date and during the fall will have their degrees conferred on

                                The formal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are as
                                follows: (1) payment of 6 semesters of full-time tuition (or five if transfer credit has been
                                approved), (2) major and related courses, (3) foreign language(s) in many departments, (4) a
                                supervisory committee for the student's program of study, (5) Continuous registration.

                                The Graduate School has no foreign language
                                requirement for the Ph.D. Some departments require two languages; other departments have no
                                foreign language requirements. For specific departmental requirements, see the Bulletin chapter on 
                                "Courses of Instruction'' or contact the appropriate director of graduate studies.

                                As early in a student's
                                course of study as is practicable and not later than two months before the preliminary
                                examination, the director of graduate studies in the major department will <a href="/duke/forms/cmttee.doc"><b>nominate for the
                                approval of the dean a supervising committee</b></a> consisting of at least four members, with one
                                member designated as chair. This committee should include at least three graduate faculty
                                members of the major department and, usually, at least one from outside the department. For
                                programs in which approval has been granted for related work from a clearly differentiated
                                division within the department, one member of the committee may be chosen from that division.
                                This committee, with all members participating, will determine a program of study and administer
                                the preliminary examination.

                                The minimum residence requirement is one academic year of
                                full-time registration at Duke (that is, two consecutive semesters of full-time tuition).

                                Ordinarily a student registered for full-time study should
                                pass the preliminary examination by the end of the third year. A student who has not passed the
                                examination by this time must file with the dean of the Graduate School a statement, approved by
                                the director of graduate studies in the major department, explaining the delay and setting a date
                                for the examination. Except under unusual circumstances, extension will not be granted beyond
                                the middle of the fourth year.

                                The doctoral dissertation should be submitted and accepted within two calendar years after the
                                preliminary examination is passed. Should the dissertation not be submitted and accepted within
                                four years after the examination, the candidate may, with the approval of the committee and the
                                director of graduate studies, petition the dean of the Graduate School for an extension of up to
                                one year. If this extension is granted and the dissertation is not submitted and accepted by the new
                                deadline, the student may be dropped from candidacy. The student must then pass a second
                                preliminary examination to be reinstated as a candidate for the degree. In such cases, the time
                                limit for submitting the dissertation will be determined by the dean of the Graduate School and the
                                candidate's committee.

                                Ordinarily, credit is not allowed for graduate courses (including transfers) or foreign language
                                examinations that are more than six years old at the date of the preliminary examination. Similarly,
                                credit will not be allowed for a preliminary examination that is five years old at the date of the
                                final examination. In cases of exceptional merit, however, the dean of the Graduate School may
                                extend these limits. Should the five-year limits be exceeded, the student's department must submit
                                to the dean specific requirements for revalidating credits.

                                <b>Preliminary Examination</b> <br>
                                A student is not accepted as a candidate for the
                                Ph.D. degree until the  preliminary examination has been passed. The examination ordinarily
                                covers both the major field and related work, although some departments cover such field
                                expertise in a separate qualifying examination. Please consult the Bulletin chapter on  'Courses of
                                Instruction' for individual department procedures. In the summer a preliminary examination may
                                be scheduled only between the opening and closing dates of the summer session.
                                Successful completion of the preliminary examination requires at least three affirmative votes and
                                no more than one negative vote. The sole exception to this policy is that a negative vote cast by
                                the chair of the examining committee will mean a failure on the examination. A student who fails
                                the preliminary examination may apply, with the consent of the full supervisory committee and the
                                dean of the Graduate School, for the privilege of a second examination to be taken no earlier than
                                three months after the date of the first. Successful completion of the second examination requires
                                the affirmative vote of all committee members. Failure on the second examination will render a
                                student ineligible to continue a program for the Ph.D. degree at Duke University.

                                <b>The Dissertation</b> <br>
                                The dissertation is expected to be a mature and
                                competent piece of writing, embodying the results of significant and original research. 
                                One month before the dissertation is presented and no later than February 1 preceding the May
                                commencement, July 1 for a September degree, and November 1 for a December degree, the
                                student must file with the dean of the Graduate School, on the official form, a declaration of
                                <a href="/duke/forms/intent.doc"><b>intention to receive degree.</b></a> This form should indicate the approved title of the dissertation and be
                                signed by  both the director of graduate studies of the student's major department and the
                                professor who directs the dissertation.

                                The basic requirements for preparing the dissertation (type of paper, form, and binding) are
                                prescribed in the <a href="/duke/forms/thesis.doc"><b>Guide for the Preparation of Theses and Dissertations.</b></a>
                                The dissertation must be completed to the satisfaction of the professor who directs the
                                dissertation, members of the student's advisory committee, and the dean of the Graduate School.
                                A copy of the dissertation must be submitted to the dean of the Graduate School on or before
                                April 1 preceding the May commencement, ten days before the end of the Duke summer session
                                for a September degree, or ten days before the end of the fall semester for a December degree.
                                The dissertation must be submitted to the Graduate School office at least seven days before the
                                scheduled date of the student's examination.

                                The final examination is administered by at least four
                                members of the <a href="/duke/forms/cmttee.doc"><b>supervising committee.</b></a> The final oral examination shall be primarily on the
                                dissertation; however, questions may be asked in the candidate's major field. Except in unusual
                                circumstances approved by the dean, a final examination will not be scheduled when the university
                                is not in session.

                                Successful completion of the final examination requires at least three affirmative votes and no
                                more than one negative vote. The sole exception to this policy is that a negative vote cast by the
                                chair of the examining committee will mean a failure on the examination. A student who fails the
                                final examination may be allowed to take it a second time, but no earlier than six months from the
                                date of the first examination. Permission to take the second examination must be obtained from
                                the professor who directed the dissertation and from the dean of the Graduate School. Failure to
                                pass the second examination renders the student ineligible to continue work for the Ph.D. degree
                                at Duke University.

                                After passing the examination, candidates
                                return the original and the first two copies of the dissertation, properly signed to 013 Perkins
                                Library. At this time they sign the microfilming agreement and present proof of payment of
                                binding, microfilming, and, if applicable, copyright fees.

                                 Graduation exercises are held once a year, in May, when degrees are conferred on and diplomas
                                are issued to those students who have completed requirements by the end of the spring.
                                Those who complete degree requirements by the end of the fall or by the end of a summer term
                                receive diplomas dated December 30 or September 1, respectively. There is a delay in the mailing
                                of September and December diplomas because diplomas cannot be issued until they are approved
                                by the Academic Council and the Board of Trustees.

                                Duke University expects and will require of all its students cooperation in developing and
                                maintaining high standards of scholarship and conduct.
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Students are expected to meet academic requirements and financial obligations, as specified
                                elsewhere in this bulletin, in order to remain in good standing. Certain nonacademic rules and
                                regulations must also be observed. Failure to meet these requirements may result in summary
                                dismissal by the appropriate officer of the university.
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                The university wishes to emphasize its policy that all students are subject to the rules and
                                regulations of the university currently in effect or which, from time to time, are put into effect by
                                the appropriate authorities of the  university. Students, in accepting admission, indicate their
                                willingness to subscribe to and be governed by these rules and regulations and acknowledge the
                                right of the university to take such disciplinary action, including suspension and/or expulsion, as
                                may be deemed appropriate for failure to abide by such rules and regulations or for conduct
                                deemed unsatisfactory or detrimental to the university.
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>

                                Duke University, as a community of scholars, strongly relies upon the standard of academic
                                integrity. Plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty represent a corruption of this
                                integrity and, as such, cannot be tolerated. Ignorance of what constitutes
                                academic dishonesty is no excuse for actions which violate the integrity of the community. In a
                                community which builds on the notion of academic integrity, the threat of academic dishonesty
                                represents an intolerable risk. Students unsure about the university definition of plagiarism may
                                wish to consult the Bulletin of Duke University: Information and Regulations (especially the
                                chapter on  'Academic Honesty'').

                                Duke University is committed to protecting the academic freedom and
                                freedom of expression of all members of the university community. This policy against harassment
                                shall be applied in a manner that protects the academic freedom and freedom of expression of all
                                parties to a complaint. Academic freedom and freedom of expression include but are not limited
                                to the expression of ideas, however controversial, in the classroom, residence hall, and, in keeping
                                with different responsibilities, in workplaces elsewhere in the university community.

		1. Harassment is the creation of a hostile or intimidating environment, in which
                                verbal or physical conduct, because of its severity and/or persistence, is likely to interfere
                                significantly with an individual's work or education, or affect adversely an individual's living
                                conditions.

                                2. Sexual coercion is a form of harassment with specific distinguishing
                                characteristics. It consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other
                                verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:

                                Harassment must be distinguished from behavior which, even though
                                unpleasant or disconcerting, is appropriate to the carrying out of certain instructional, advisory, or
                                supervisory responsibilities.

                                employment responsibilities), the university will use the definition of sexual harassment found in
                                the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Guidelines:
                                "conduct of a sexual nature . . .when such conduct has the purpose or effect
                                of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating,

		Against the Complainant: It is a violation of Duke's Harassment Policy to
                                retaliate against a complainant for filing a charge of harassment. A complaint of retaliation may be
                                pursued using the steps followed for a complaint of harassment. When necessary, the appropriate
                                dean or other university officer may monitor student grading or faculty/staff reappointment,
                                tenure, promotion, merit review, or other decisions to ensure that prohibited retaliation does not
                                occur.

		Against the respondent: Lodging a complaint of harassment is not proof of
                                prohibited conduct. A complaint shall not be taken into account during reappointment, tenure,
                                promotion, merit, or other evaluation or review until a final determination has been made that the

                                prohibited retaliation.

		This harassment policy and the procedures for resolution of claims of
                                harassment are only part of Duke University's effort to prevent harassment in our community. In

		<b>Student Grievance Procedures.</b><br>
		 It is the responsibility of the director of
                                graduate studies to inform each graduate student of the appropriate channels of appeal. In normal
                                circumstances, the director of graduate studies is the first to hear a complaint. If the complaint
                                cannot be resolved satisfactorily at this level, the student may address, in turn, the department
                                chair, the associate dean of the Graduate School, the dean of the Graduate School, the provost,
                                and as a last resort, the president of the university.

                                A student, by accepting admission to the Graduate School of Duke
                                University, thereby indicates  willingness to subscribe to and be governed by the rules and
                                regulations of the University as currently are in effect or, from time to time, are put into effect by
                                the appropriate authorities of the University, and indicates willingness to accept disciplinary
                                action, if behavior is deemed to be in violation of those rules or in some way unacceptable or
                                detrimental to the University. However, a student's position of responsibility to the authorities and
                                the regulations of the University in no way alters or modifies responsibilities in relation to civil

                                and one Associate or Assistant Dean appointed by the Dean of the Graduate School. The Board
                                shall elect one of its members as Chairman. The Board shall have at its service a recording

                                <b>Preliminary Procedures.</b><br>
                                 If a student requests a hearing by the Judicial
                                Board it must be done in writing, allowing its Chairman at least seventy-two hours to convene the
                                Board. In addition, the Chairman shall not convene the Board until seventy-two hours after being
                                asked  to convene the Board. It is the responsibility of the Chairman of the Judicial Board fully to
                                inform its members concerning the case and the reasons the case has been referred to the Board;
                                and to prepare a written summary of this information for the Board, the Dean, and the student.

                                <b>Procedural Safeguards for the Hearing.</b><br>
                                The Accused has the right to
                                challenge any member of the Judicial Board on grounds of prejudice. If the Board decides to
                                excuse one or more of its members for reasons given by the Accused, it shall consult with the
                                Dean about the need for replacements. The Accused may choose an Adviser to assist in the
                                defense. The Accused may also produce witnesses (including no more than two character
                                witnesses), introduce documents, and offer testimony. A person having direct knowledge relevant
                                to a case being heard by the Board is a material witness. The Judicial Board may request the
                                appearance of material witnesses. The Board shall also request, upon written request of the
                                Complainant or the Accused, the appearance of material witnesses. Witnesses shall be notified of
                                the time, place, and purpose of their appearance. The Accused has the right to examine the
                                written statement of any witness relevant to the case at least seventy-two hours before the
                                hearing. The Accused has the right to be faced with any witness who has given a statement
                                relevant to the case at the hearing if the witness's attendance can be secured.

                                The hearing will be conducted in private unless the Accused requests an open
                                hearing. If any objection is raised to conducting an open hearing in any particular case, the
                                Judicial Board shall decide the issue by majority vote. If the decision is made not to hold an open
                                hearing, the Accused shall be informed in writing of the reasons for the decision.

                                submitted into evidence, and the testimony of witnesses at the hearing in reaching its decisions.

                                 The hearing of any case shall begin with a
                                reading of the charge by the Chairman in the presence of the Accused. The Accused shall then
                                plead guilty or not guilty or move to terminate or postpone the hearing. The Accused may qualify
                                a plea, admitting guilt in part and denying it in part. The Accused may not be questioned for more
                                than one hour without recess.

                               At any time during the hearing, the Accused or the Judicial Board may move to
                                terminate or to postpone the hearing or to qualify the plea or to modify its charge.

                                have the power to impose the following penalties: expulsion, dismissal from the University with
                                the recommendation that the person never be readmitted; suspension, dismissal from the
                                University and from participation in all University activities for a specified period of time, after
                                which the student may apply for readmission; disciplinary probation, placing the student on a
                                probationary status for a specified period of time, during which conviction for violation of any
                                regulation may result in more serious disciplinary action; restitution, payment for all, or a portion
                                of property damage caused during the commission of an offense. Restitution may be imposed by
                                itself or in addition to any of the other penalties. The Judgment shall consist of a finding of guilty
                                or not guilty of the charge and, when the Accused is found guilty, a statement of the punishment
                                assessed. On all questions, including the verdict and the finding of guilty or not guilty, the Board
                                shall be governed by a majority vote. The Judicial Board may decide to rehear a case in which
                                significant new evidence can be introduced. In addition, the defendant may request an appeal.

                                lthough many students will receive financial assistance for their graduate education, 
                                students are responsible for ensuring that they have the means to support themselves, 
                                and the ability to pay tuition and fees due the university. Below is a summary of 
                                expected costs for 1996-1997.

                                This fee is distinct from health insurance, and does not provide major medical coverage.

                                Auditors are permitted on a space available basis with the consent of the instructor. Students registered full time during fall and spring may audit courses without charge. Audit fees are $160 per course for other students.

                                Students should contact the University Parking Services Office (717 Broad Street) regarding parking fees (919-684-7275).

                                The Office of the Bursar will issue invoices to registered students for tuition, fees, and other charges approximately four to six weeks prior to the beginning of classes each semester. The total amount due on the invoice is payable by the invoice late payment date which is normally one week prior to the beginning of classes.  As part of the admission agreement to Duke University, a student is required to pay all invoices as presented.  An individual will be in default if the total amount is not paid in full by the due date. A student in default will not be allowed to receive a transcript of academic records, have academic credits certified, go on leave of absence, or receive a diploma at graduation. In addition, an individual in default may be subject to withdrawal from school and have the account referred to a collection agency. If an account is referred to a collection agency, the individual will be responsible for all applicable collection and/or court costs.
                                Inquire at the Bursars Office, (919) 684-3541, for information on the following:

                                The university thus grants reductions in tuition to eligible employees enrolling

                                         The actual in-depth review of your file is conducted in the department by an admissions committee, usually headed by the Director of Graduate Studies.  All applications are reviewed competitively.  Attention is given to every aspect of an application, with an attempt made to evaluate past achievement as well as scholarly potential.  Academic records, letters of evaluation, GRE scores, as well as your own statement of goals and objectives, are all taken into consideration in the review process.

                                Applicants are understandably concerned about Duke's standards for admission with regard to grades and GRE scores.  Duke does not have an absolute cut-off point for either of these, although it may be useful for you to ask the department of your interest to give you averages (and ranges) for grades and scores for applicants admitted in recent years.  These numbers do vary from department to department; on a school-wide basis, however, the average GRE score in each section (verbal, quantitative, analytical) is usually well above 600, and the undergraduate grade point average is usually well above a "B."   You should keep in mind that, depending upon the department, any one of the three sections of the GRE may be weighted more heavily than the others.  What is most important to understand is that all applications are considered competitively, and the quality of the application pool for a given term will significantly determine your chances of being offered admission.
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Remember that grades and GREs are only two factors taken into consideration in the review for admission, however.  Letters of evaluation and your own statements are equally important.  While your concern obviously is to have evaluators who will make complimentary remarks, remember that the Graduate School is interested in evaluators who are in the best position to assess your true potential as a graduate student, particularly those who are in a relevant field of study.  Take care, too, with your personal essay, question 24 on the application form.   Be as specific as possible about your research interests and qualifications.  If you have particular reasons for choosing Duke, be sure to indicate these.

                                The Graduate School has a policy of limited enrollment;  in recent years approximately one in four applicants has been offered admission, with the expectation that a third of those offered will actually matriculate.  However, in some departments the competition for new student slots is quite keen, and the ratio of applicants to offers of admission can be thirty-five to one, or even higher.  In 1995, out of a total enrollment of 2,270 and an application pool of 6,677, new students numbered 558.

                                <b>Notification of Decision:</b><br>
                               Once your file is sent to the department, it is entirely up to their reviewing schedule as to when decisions are made.  The earliest decisions may be made in January, with the review process continuing into February, March, and April (particularly for those on alternate-for-admission lists). 
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                When a decision to accept or reject has been reached, the department returns the file to the Graduate Admissions Office for final approval.  The letter of notification is sent from the Graduate School and is signed by the Dean.  Admission to the Graduate School is offered only by the Dean. 
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                 <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Every candidate who completes an application will receive, at the earliest possible time, notification of the decision reached on the application. Questions about the timetable for decisions may be addressed directly to your department.  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                If you are offered admission, the letter of admission will include an acceptance form.  The process of admission is not complete until you have returned the acceptance form to the Graduate Admissions Office.  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                In general, and unless otherwise indicated, we expect to hear back from you by April 15, or within 15 days of your receipt of the admission letter, whichever is later.

		eadlines should represent to you the endpoint in the application process  (i.e., the final completion of your file) rather than the beginning of that process.  The timely completion of your application is your responsibility, and it is most important -- incomplete applications cannot be considered.

                                        To ensure that our Admissions Office will have adequate time to assemble all items submitted on your behalf, you should send the application at least two weeks before the stated deadline.

Complete applications postmarked by December 31 and received within 14 days are guaranteed a review; others are not guaranteed consideration.

                                        All students seeking fall admission should meet the December 31 deadline, since it is likely that enrollment in many departments will be filled soon after this date.  Late applications may be considered for admission only if all spaces have not been filled, and for financial aid only if funds are still available.

                                        Departments vary in their willingness to consider late applications.  Some departments [for example, English, Physical Therapy, Psychology (clinical program)] adhere strictly to the stated deadline and will not look at those that arrive late. Other departments will continue to review applications until all spaces have been filled.

                                        You should read carefully all the information on deadlines in this booklet.  In every case, the earlier you get materials to the Graduate School, the better your chances for full consideration.

                                        Final Cut-Off Date for Processing New Applications - July 15 is the date after which no new applications will be processed.  However, very few departments actually continue to review applications this late.  For all practical purposes, February 1 should be considered a final date (assuming your department is still reviewing new files at this point).  Note that all financial aid funds have usually been committed well before the summer.

See the departmental descriptions under "Courses of Study."

                                        If you wish to begin graduate work during the summer, check first with your department concerning available courses or research work, as well as funding possibilities.  Some departments have summer offerings and others do not.  You should submit your application according to the fall deadline schedule, since your file will be reviewed along with others who plan to begin in late August.    
                                        
                                        <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>

                                        In addition to your application to the Graduate School, you must also apply to the Summer Session at least 30 days in advance of each Summer Session.  For Summer Session registration forms and catalogue, write to the Director of the Summer Session, Duke University, Box 90059, Durham, North Carolina 27708-0059 USA.  Telephone (919) 684-2621.

                                <b>APPLICATION FEE</b><br>
                                
                                Each application must be accompanied by a nonrefundable application fee in a check drawn on a U.S. bank or money order (not cash).  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                No application is processed without the application fee, and no fee waivers are available through the Graduate School.
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                The fee is sixty-five U.S. dollars (U.S. $65). However, for those applications postmarked and completed by December 1, the fee is reduced to U.S. $50.  Any application postmarked after December 1 must be accompanied by the $65 fee or it will not be processed.   
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                An applicant whose check is returned for insufficient funds will be charged an additional fee of $10.    
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>

                                NOTE TO FOREIGN APPLICANTS:   The application fee is required of all applicants, including foreign students.  We recognize that some foreign students may have difficulty with currency exchange, but please note that no fee waivers are available through the Graduate School, regardless of circumstances.  Payment of the fee cannot be deferred until time of enrollment. The application can be processed ONLY when the application fee has been received.  The check must be payable through a U.S. bank, which must be noted on the front of the check; we can also accept an international money order. Sometimes an applicant will ask a U.S. friend or relative to submit the fee on his/her behalf; however, be sure that the applicant's name and department are clearly indicated on the front of the check.  No application will be processed without this fee.  If you submit your application without a check, we regret that it will not be possible to give you a timely reply from the Graduate School Office.

                                <b>LETTERS OF EVALUATION</b><br>
                                Three letters are required, and forms are provided, both in the printed application packet and within the electronic application.  Evaluations should be written by persons best qualified to testify to your capacity for graduate work.  It is always our preference to have academic references representing your major field, though we recognize that there are situations where this may not be possible.  In such circumstances, we encourage students to seek out those persons who can comment on qualities which will be relevant to academic pursuits, particularly research.   
  
                                
                                
                                 <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=7 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <b>TRANSCRIPTS</b><br>
                                
				We require one copy of the official, confidential transcript from each institution (undergraduate or graduate) which you have attended.  Essential to the review of your application will be transcripts from any institution where you earned (or will earn) a degree, studied for one year or more, or took classes that relate to your current application for graduate study (for example, prerequisite courses). 
                                
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Transcripts should be in confidential, signed-across-the-seal envelopes provided to you by the registrar at each institution.  It is critical that the transcripts be in confidential envelopes. Personal copies of your records, or copies which have passed through your hands and are therefore not confidential, are not acceptable and will not be regarded as official.  If your school will not provide you directly with a confidential copy of your transcript, then it will be necessary to have them send an official copy to us directly.  However, you may still send us an unofficial copy, for temporary use only.  

                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                We must also receive certification of degrees received, including the date the degree was awarded; this information may be included on the final transcript or on the diploma.    
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                NOTE TO FOREIGN APPLICANTS:   The academic records which we refer to as transcripts should provide a listing, year-by-year, of all courses taken and the grade or marks received for each one.  It is helpful to have the grading scale of the institution and the student's rank in class included when such information is available. Do not submit secondary school records.    
Transcripts must bear an official signature in ink of the appropriate official of your institution(s), such as the registrar or recorder of records, and must bear the institutional seal.  If your college or university will not provide original official academic documents, exact copies that have been verified as "Certified True Copies" by the appropriate institutional official of each institution which you have attended should be sent.  Uncertified photocopies are not acceptable.  
To be considered, all documents not in English must be accompanied by official English translations.  These translations must bear an original ink signature and seal in order to be acceptable.

                                <b>GRE SCORES</b><br>
                                The Graduate School requires all applicants to provide GRE (Graduate Record Examination) General Test scores.  (Applicants to Business Administration may provide GMAT scores in lieu of the GRE.)  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                The scores must not be more than five years old, and an official copy must be sent to the Graduate School directly from the Educational Testing Service.  Personal copies are not acceptable, nor are "attested" or notarized copies.  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Some departments require the GRE Subject Test as well;  see the departmental descriptions in the section,  "Courses of Study."   
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                If you are applying for fall admission and award, you must be sure to take the GRE in time for official scores to reach us by the deadline  (the October test, for paper-based administration of the GRE). 

                               For further information on the GRE and registration forms, please contact the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 6000, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6000 USA.  E-mail to <gre-info@ets.org> or visit the GRE Web Site at <A HREF="http://www.gre.org">http://www.gre.org</A>.

                                NOTE TO FOREIGN APPLICANTS:   We  realize that the GRE scores of foreign students, particularly those whose native language is not English, may be affected by language and cultural differences.  This is taken into consideration when such students' applications are evaluated.  The scores are nevertheless required and must come directly from the Educational Testing Service.

                                <b>ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS</b><br>
                                Individual departments may set individual requirements.  These are outlined in the departmental descriptions in "Courses of Study," or they may be given in materials sent to you directly by the department.

                                 If your department requires a writing sample, send it directly to the department and not to the Graduate Admissions Office.

                                (FOR FOREIGN APPLICANTS)</b><br>
                                The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), administered through the Educational Testing Service, Box 6155, Princeton, New Jersey 08541-6155 USA 
(e-mail to <a href="mailto:toefl@ets.org">toefl@ets.org</a>) 
or at a center in your native country, is required of any student whose native language is not English, regardless of whether or not you have attended another U.S. institution. 
 
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
				Your score must not be more than two years old, and an official copy must be sent to the Graduate School directly from ETS.  Personal copies are not acceptable.

                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                It is the policy of the Graduate School to admit only those students with a score of 550 or higher on the TOEFL.  In many departments a higher TOEFL score is required if the applicant is to succeed in the competition for limited new student openings.  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>

                                Much of your success in graduate study in the United States will rest on your ability to understand, read, write, and speak English.  If English is not your native language, evidence of proficiency in its use will be decisive in the review for admission.  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                NOTE:   All international students whose native language is not English must enroll in and pass two sections of English 200 (one section in oral communication; one section in written communication) during their initial year at Duke, unless formally waived from this requirement by the Graduate School upon certification of competency in English.  Competency will be determined by an oral proficiency interview and a written examination conducted at the beginning of the term of matriculation.

                                <b>VISA ELIGIBILITY FORMS <br>
                                (FOR FOREIGN APPLICANTS)</b><br>
                                In order to study in the United States, international students must obtain the appropriate visa.  Students attending Duke University will receive one of the following types of visas:
                                

		<br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                1.   F-1 Student Visa, with an I-20 Certificate of            Eligibility issued by Duke University.
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                2.   J-1 Exchange-Visitor Student Visa, with an IAP-66              Certificate of Eligibility issued by Duke                    University (or a sponsoring agency).  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Before Duke can issue the I-20 or the IAP-66, U.S. immigration law requires that the university must have documented evidence that a student has adequate financial resources to cover the expenses of studying here.  (Additional funds must be verified if a student plans to bring a spouse or children.)   
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                The Certificate of Financial Responsibility is the form which Duke uses to meet this requirement, and a copy is included with the application materials.  Note that the figure stated on the Certificate of Financial Responsibility is an estimate only of expenses for the year beginning with the Fall 1997 term.  Figures are subject to change and may be confirmed by January 1997.   
  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                If you are being awarded any financial aid from Duke, we will use this information in filling out the I-20 or the IAP-66.  Please note, however, that financial aid from Duke, if offered, may or may not cover the minimum amount required before a visa eligibility form can be issued.  Each student must assume responsibility for the amount needed beyond what Duke may award.  Permission for off-campus work is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain from immigration officials.  Students should not count on this resource to supplement their incomes.   
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                The I-20 or the IAP-66 is issued only after a student has been offered admission, has returned the acceptance form, and has provided verification of the necessary funds.  (Foreign transfer students currently attending U.S. institutions must also provide a Transfer Eligibility Form, which is included with the application materials.)  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Only one visa eligibility form will be issued per student.  Any unused forms must be returned to the Graduate Admissions Office.

                                         The actual in-depth review of your file is conducted in the department by an admissions committee, usually headed by the Director of Graduate Studies.  All applications are reviewed competitively.  Attention is given to every aspect of an application, with an attempt made to evaluate past achievement as well as scholarly potential.  Academic records, letters of evaluation, GRE scores, as well as your own statement of goals and objectives, are all taken into consideration in the review process.

                                Applicants are understandably concerned about Duke's standards for admission with regard to grades and GRE scores.  Duke does not have an absolute cut-off point for either of these, although it may be useful for you to ask the department of your interest to give you averages (and ranges) for grades and scores for applicants admitted in recent years.  These numbers do vary from department to department; on a school-wide basis, however, the average GRE score in each section (verbal, quantitative, analytical) is usually well above 600, and the undergraduate grade point average is usually well above a "B."   You should keep in mind that, depending upon the department, any one of the three sections of the GRE may be weighted more heavily than the others.  What is most important to understand is that all applications are considered competitively, and the quality of the application pool for a given term will significantly determine your chances of being offered admission.
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Remember that grades and GREs are only two factors taken into consideration in the review for admission, however.  Letters of evaluation and your own statements are equally important.  While your concern obviously is to have evaluators who will make complimentary remarks, remember that the Graduate School is interested in evaluators who are in the best position to assess your true potential as a graduate student, particularly those who are in a relevant field of study.  Take care, too, with your personal essay, question 24 on the application form.   Be as specific as possible about your research interests and qualifications.  If you have particular reasons for choosing Duke, be sure to indicate these.

                                The Graduate School has a policy of limited enrollment;  in recent years approximately one in four applicants has been offered admission, with the expectation that a third of those offered will actually matriculate.  However, in some departments the competition for new student slots is quite keen, and the ratio of applicants to offers of admission can be thirty-five to one, or even higher.  In 1995, out of a total enrollment of 2,270 and an application pool of 6,677, new students numbered 558. 
                                
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=6 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <b>Notification of Decision:</b><br>
                               Once your file is sent to the department, it is entirely up to their reviewing schedule as to when decisions are made.  The earliest decisions may be made in January, with the review process continuing into February, March, and April (particularly for those on alternate-for-admission lists). 
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                When a decision to accept or reject has been reached, the department returns the file to the Graduate Admissions Office for final approval.  The letter of notification is sent from the Graduate School and is signed by the Dean.  Admission to the Graduate School is offered only by the Dean. 
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                 <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                Every candidate who completes an application will receive, at the earliest possible time, notification of the decision reached on the application. Questions about the timetable for decisions may be addressed directly to your department.  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                If you are offered admission, the letter of admission will include an acceptance form.  The process of admission is not complete until you have returned the acceptance form to the Graduate Admissions Office.  
                                
                                <br><img src="images/cleardot.gif" vspace=1 border=0 alt=" "><br>
                                <img src="images/cleardot.gif" hspace=5 border=0 alt=" ">
                                In general, and unless otherwise indicated, we expect to hear back from you by April 15, or within 15 days of your receipt of the admission letter, whichever is later.

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Agency for Instructional Technology</H2>

<P>The Agency for Instructional Technology is a nonprofit U.S.-Canadian education agency, founded in 1962, whose mission is to foster learning for pre-K through adult students.  AIT develops, acquires, and distributes quality technology-based instructional resources and services; and it provides leadership to the educational technology policy community.  AIT is the headquarters of TECHNOS Press, home of the annual AIT Distinguished Fellows Program and publisher of <I>TECHNOS: Quarterly for Education and Technology</I>.</P>

<P>AIT products include video programming, interactive videodiscs, computer software, CD-ROMs, and supporting print.  AIT materials, which comprise 40% of all broadcast video classroom programming in the U.S. and Canada, are used on six continents, reaching nearly 34 million students in North American classrooms each year.  AIT services include workshops and <B>AIT.Net</B>, an online interactive service for educators.</P>

<P>Since 1970, the Agency has cooperatively produced more than  39 curriculum packages through the consortium process it pioneered.  Major project funding comes from state provincial, and local departments of education, federal and private institutions, corporate sponsors, and other partners.</P>

<P>These linked resources are provided to educators utilizing AIT products, for the purpose of increasing their understanding of the product and how it may be implemented in the classroom.  In these pages, you will find information on the product itself, descriptions of program modules/segments, additional program-related resources, and discussion forums.</P>

<P>It is our hope that the discussion forums will serve as a vehicle for communication amongst educators; not simply on implementation strategies for AIT products, but on all aspects of education and technology.  A separate discussion forum exists for each program, and is accessible anytime, worldwide.</P>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>TECHNOS Press Profile</H1>
<HR>

<UL>
<LI><H3>TECHNOS: Quarterly for Education & Technology</H3>
<P>
The premiere in 1992 and subsequent success of the Agency's journal, <B>TECHNOS Quarterly</B> signalled the launch of TECHNOS Press. <B>TECHNOS</B> is a forum for the discussion of ideas about the use of technology in education, with a focus on reform. It is a "think piece" for decision makers, and its international audiences are change agents and leaders in education from all walks of life. <B>TECHNOS</B> has been awarded five EdPress Distinguished Achievement Awards for Excellence in Educational Publishing. TECHNOS Press publications are intended to be an extension of the leadership effort begun with the publication of <B>TECHNOS Quarterly</B>.
</P>
<LI><H3>Report on Proceedings of 1994 Copyright Conference</H3>
<P>
The second TECHNOS Press publication is AIT's <CITE>What's Fair? A Report on the Proceedings of the National Conference on Educational Fair Access and the New Media</CITE>, published in fall 1994. This publication is the result of the Agency's cosponsorship of the Conference at American University in Washington, D.C., in June 1994. This national conference, having to do with copyright issues surrounding the use of new, digitized multimedia materials in education, is the first in what will be a series of leadership initiatives that will focus attention on timely, critical topics. As those conferences are held, proceedings documents will be published under the auspices of TECHNOS Press.
</P>
<LI><H3>Changing the Face of Education:<BR>
Agency for Instructional Technology Corporate Profile</H3>
<P>
AIT's first-ever annual report outlines the Agency's activities and provides financial statements for Fiscal Years 1993 and 1994. It was awarded an EdPress Distinguished Achievement Award and a Certificate of Merit from the Printing Industries of America, Inc., in 1995.
</P>
<LI><H3>AIT Distinguished Fellows Program, TECHNOS Press Books, and The Monographs</H3>
<P>
The fourth TECHNOS Press publication is <CITE>FINAL EXAM: A Study of the Perpetual Scrutiny of American Education</CITE>, by the first AIT Distinguished Fellow, Gerald W. Bracey, Ph.D. Bracey is a noted educational researcher, consultant, and author. The publication of <CITE>FINAL EXAM</CITE> officially marks the establishment of TECHNOS Press, with the AIT Distinguished Fellows Program as its foundation. Our second AIT Distinguished Fellow is Indiana University economist Morton J. Marcus, whose TECHNOS Press book about the economics of public education will be published in fall 1996.</P>
<P>
The AIT Distinguished Fellows Program taps professionals of high stature whose integrity and reputation for solid research and concise, informative, and compelling writing have been well established. Each Fellow will have earned a Ph.D. or Ed.D., or will have accrued experience and recognition in his or her field comparable to the terminal degree. Each will be an acknowledged expert who has published extensively in his or her field.</P>
<P>
The AIT Distinguished Fellows Program is intended to provide substantive, thought-provoking, and challenging contributions to the field that will reflect positively on the Agency. The Fellows will write on policy- and issue-oriented topics and will provide articles for <B>TECHNOS Quarterly</B>. In some cases, the Fellows will participate in AIT-sponsored conferences, seminars, or on-line Forums.</P>
<P>
In short, the establishment of the AIT Distinguished Fellows Program signals another step toward the role of articulate, visible leadership that the Agency embarked upon with the publication of <B>TECHNOS Quarterly</B>.</P>
<P>
A series of TECHNOS Press Monographs began in 1995 with the publication of <CITE>Setting Standards in the Age of Knowledge: A Framework for Establishing and Using Educational Standards</CITE> by Yesha Y. Sivan, Ed.D. Each year, one Monograph on a related topic will be published in conjunction with the book by our Distinguished Fellow. The second Monograph, scheduled for fall 1996 publication, will be written by Rebecca Adamson, founder and president of First Nations Development Institute. Adamson's topic is economics from an indigenous perspective.
</P>
<LI><H3>AIT.Net News and AIT.Net On-line Service</H3>
<P>
In November 1995, a newsletter for AIT's customers, primarily teachers in K&#150;12 settings, was published in conjunction with the inauguration of the Agency's new on-line service. AIT.Net News. currently disseminated in both paper and electronic versions, will become electronic only in the Fall of 1996. Teachers are invited to participate in on-line discussions and to assist in developing and evaluating AIT instructional products. In turn, we will provide specific training and utilization information and feedback from the electronic conversations through the newsletter. In keeping with the Agency's mission of providing leadership to the education community, the on-line service will do two things: Give teachers information they need, and utilize the most current technology available to share it.

<IMG SRC="/ait/board/sullivan.gif" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<P><IMG SRC="/profile/drop_t.gif" ALIGN=LEFT>o our Customers and Colleagues:
<BR><BR>
Any organization surviving and growing today changes so rapidly that it recreates itself in a very short time.  No sooner does it become clear what the organization is, than it evolves and becomes something else.  So as you consider this portrait of AIT, please keep in mind that it is an historical view, albeit one with a perspective on the future as well.  AIT is moving on.</P>

<P>The picture reflected here is that of an active organization looking to become even more active.  We are constantly examining opportunities for developing  materials, offering  services, and distributing  information.  With <I>TECHNOS Quarterly</I> and the first books from TECHNOS Press, we are now an influential publisher of educational thought.  We conduct dozens of professional development activities each year, reaching many hundreds of educators.</P>

<P>We strive to be an organization that leads as well as serves.  We promote specific philosophies of education, such as contextual learning, cross curricular instruction and school to career programs.  We are users of technology as well as developers, supporters, and promoters of technology and we believe in the power of technology to improve education and life.</P>

<P>Many people  help in our activity:  teachers, administrators, and students who have realized the value of quality instructional services and materials; partners in development; members of our Board of Directors and advisory panels to our various functions and explorations; and those who engage us in the dialogue that leads to our many and varied activities.  Most of all, we value our employees and agents who strive for improvement in every area and willingly accept the dizzying pace of change.</P>

<P>Yes.  AIT will be moving ahead.</P>

<P>I hope, as you read this piece of recent history, that you will find in it some suggestion for a way to cooperate with us to build better educational opportunities for everyone.</P>

<H2>Applied Communication</H2>
Technical Preparation & Communication Skills for Grades 9-12, Adult<P>

Teach communication skills required for success in today's workplace. Combine academic studies with hands-on practice of job-related	communication skills. Apply reading, writing, listening, speaking, and problem solving to on-the-job situations in five major occupational areas: agriculture, business/marketing, health occupations, home economics, and technical/trade/industrial.<P>

<B>Applied Communication</B> modules each consist of 10 activity-oriented lessons that can be infused into existing courses or used to form the core of a year-long course taught by English/communication, business, or vocational educators. This competency-based curriculum correlates with vocational education and language arts curricula on the high school and post-secondary levels, as well as in adult retraining programs.<P>

<B>Applied Communication</B> was developed by a consortium of state and provincial agencies organized and managed by AIT (1988).  <B>Modules 16 & 17</B> were developed by a consortium of state and provincial agencies organized and managed by AIT (1993).<P>

<H2>Dorothy Rich's Families & Schools: Teaming for Success</H2>

Professional Development, Parental Involvement, and Teaching Techniques for Preservice/Inservice Educators and Parents<P>

<B>Meet New Title I Parental Involvement Guidelines for All Grade Levels</B><P>

Learn how to create and maintain strong partnerships that connect schools, homes, and communities. Examine the purposes and goals of family-school partnerships. Identify practical strategies for improving parental involvement programs and develop an action plan for your school.  This comprehensive professional development workshop resource is designed to help all members of the education team build new connections for improving student achievement. Introduce current issues in educational change that focus on new legislative mandates for parental involvement. Build increased understanding about the role of the family and community in the education of children. Analyze how successful programs operate, what they should accomplish, and how business and community leaders are involved.  <B>Dorothy Rich's Families & Schools: Teaming for Success</B> video program and workshop facilitator's guide provide a framework for conducting two professional development workshops.<P>	

<B>Video Program</B><BR>
<B>Part 1: The Vision</B><BR>
The first segment provides background on the issues of partnerships, examines how societal changes have influenced education, and analyzes how the federal government is reacting to those changes.<P>

<B>Part 2: Taking Action</B><BR>
The second segment explores the challenges, mandates, and opportunities for making the connections necessary for improving schools. It reviews recent federal legislation that calls for increased parental involvement in education and visits three model schools to learn the secrets of their success that can be applied in your classrooms and schools.<P>

<B>Facilitator's Guide</B><BR>
The facilitator's guide contains detailed workshop plans, a set of workshop objectives, focus questions for discussion prior to viewing the video program, suggested follow-up activities, reproducible handout masters, and a workshop evaluation form.<P> 

<B>Implementation Resource</B><BR>
The resource book, "Boost Family Involvement: How to Make Your Program Succeed under the New Title I Guidelines," provides an overview of Title I guidelines, strategies for developing the parental involvement components of your Title I proposal, suggestions for reaching "hard-to-reach" and low-literacy families, and examples of parental involvement programs that work. (Published by AIT, ERIC/EDINFO Press, and The Family Learning Center &copy; 1995.)<P>

<B>Dorothy Rich's Families & Schools: Teaming for Success</B> was produced by AIT and Phi Delta Kappa (1995).<P>

<H2>Every Child Can Succeed</H2>

Educational Reform for Preservice/Inservice Eduators, Adults<P>

Stimulate school improvement and restructuring efforts at the local, district, and state levels. Discover how, all across the United States and Canada, schools are effectively improving and restructuring to ensure that every child does succeed. Demonstrate how the enthusiasm and success of these schools can be transferred into ideas that will work for administrators, teachers, parents, and policymakers in their own schools.<P>

* Administrators will see, using the Demonstration Component, how the barriers and obstacles that prevent students from succeeding in school can and must be overcome. The Successful Schools Component introduces administrative leaders who have turned their schools around and examines the strategies they used in accomplishing their missions. In the Essential Elements Component, administrators will focus on how to implement these proven elements into their own school improvement efforts.<P>

* Educators will use the Essential Elements Component to identify, assess, and implement elements that are essential to the operation of schools in which all students succeed. The Successful School Component will take educators inside these schools to see how their colleagues are taking definite steps toward a common goal--helping all students learn and achieve.<P>

* Parents, policymakers, and other community members will find the Demonstration Component motivating and encouraging as they begin school improvement and reform.<P>

Define the factors that put students at risk of school failure and develop strategies for dealing with them. Observe schools thriving despite overwhelming odds to discover what they are doing right. Analyze the elements--common to these schools--essential for real school progress everywhere.<P>

<B>Every Child Can Succeed</B> was developed through the resources of a consortium of state agencies organized and managed by AIT (1993).<P>

<H2>The Road to School-to-Work: A Map for Implementation</H2>

Professional Development, Vocational Education, and School-to-Work Transition for Preservice/Inservice Educators<P>

The school-to-work transition--whether identified as tech prep, vocational education, or applied academics--is the process of moving students from high school into postsecondary education and/or the workplace with the goal of preparing them for high-skill, high-wage occupations. Meet the challenges of developing this type of comprehensive education and training system in your schools and community with this professional development video and print resource. <B>The Road to School-to-Work: A Map for Implementation</B> will inspire and empower educators and local community representatives to begin planning and implementing programs that will genuinely improve students' educational and work lives after high school. <B>The Road to School-to-Work</B> consists of a video program, School Implementation Resource workbook, and workshop facilitator's guide, all organized around the following six topics:
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>An Introduction to the School-to-Work Transition
<LI>The Leadership Model for Planning and Implementing Change for the School-to-Work Transition
<LI>Developing an Applied and Integrated Curriculum
<LI>Implementing Classroom-Based Developmental Career Guidance and Creating Articulation between K-12 and Postsecondary Education
<LI>Developing Work-Based Learning Opportunities and Building Partnerships with Business, Industry, Labor, Parents, and the Community
<LI>Meeting Professional Development Needs and Creating a Plan for Action
</UL><P> 

<B>Video Program</B><BR>
The video program is divided into six segments, each focusing on one of the six topics listed above. The video program will take you inside successful programs to see what they look like, to see how they function, and to listen to key individuals and groups discuss their experiences during the planning and implementation process.<P>

<B>School Implementation Resource*</B><BR>
Designed for segment-by-segment use in conjunction with the video program, this resource includes the background information, resource lists, work team activities, implementation guidelines, and sample forms needed to create and implement a local plan of action.<P>  
<B>*</B>Because the School Implementation Resource contains material each member of your team will use throughout the planning and implementation process, it is recommended that you provide one School Implementation Resource for each workshop participant.<P>

<B>Facilitator's Guide</B><BR>
This guide includes detailed outlines, agendas, and suggestions for conducting three separate workshops and strategic planning sessions. It provides facilitators with introductions to the video program and the School Implementation Resource, overhead masters, reproducible handout masters, and workshop evaluation forms.<P>

<B>The Road to School-to-Work</B> was produced by AIT and the Center on Education and Work, University of Wisconsin-Madison (1995).<P>

The functions and needs of governing are not mere abstract principles &#151; in myriad ways, government is how we all interconnect. The relationship between government and individuals is not one of hierarchy &#151; citizens shape and reflects our governmental system.</P>

<H2>Animals and Us</H2>

Life Science and Animal Studies for Primary<P>

The animal kingdom is an intriguing and fascinating place. Young children want to learn about animals, both common domestic pets and exotic wild creatures, and <B>Animals and Us</B> will more than satisfy their craving for information, while teaching them respect and appreciation for the multifarious forms of life on planet Earth.<P>

Follow your instincts--pursue knowledge about the animals that share the world with us.<P>

<B>Animals and Us</B>, a series of short subjects filmed in Africa, can sharpen children's powers of observation, description, and classification, while increasing their sensitivity to and appreciation of the animal kingdom. These brief programs introduce youngsters to a wide variety of domestic and exotic animals, from dogs and 
cats to penguins and rhinoceroses. Informative and fun, the series documents fascinating aspects of animal behavior and reveals how various creatures relate to humans and the environment. These programs will help K-3 teachers
<UL>
<LI>provide a panoramic picture of the animal kingdom
<LI>classify different kinds of animals and compare major characteristics, such as size, speed, strength, and feeding habits
<LI>emphasize the environmental needs of wild animals, especially those 	whose habitat is imperilled by an encroaching civilization
</UL><P>

Have a roaring, frolicking, splashing good time with <B>Animals and Us</B>.<P>

<B>Animals and Us</B> is informative yet fun for young children to watch. Students will discover the habitats in which various wild and domestic animals live, and they will learn interesting facts by visiting the animals in zoos, farms, and natural surroundings.<P>

<B>Animals and Us</B> includes 39 five-minute programs, which can be used across a number of disciplines. They can serve as catalysts for research projects in the life sciences and animal studies, and they make excellent story starters for activities in the language arts; or they can be used as transitions between intensive lessons. The programs are part of the well-known "Kideo" concept, which is produced by Safritel of Johannesburg, South Africa, and distributed by AIT.

European Artists<HR>

<B>Impressionism</B><BR>
Edouard Manet, the Father of Modern Art, inspired other nineteenth-century artists to emphasize the spontaneity of their talent and technique over lofty subject matter. Manet's followers, the Impressionists, tried to render the impression of light on the surfaces of objects, mixing paint with the eye--not the brush. Four impressionist masters are presented: Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Cassatt. Post-Impressionism is explored through the works of Seurat and Toulouse-Lautrec.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-001</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>The Fauves</B><BR>
Reveal how Post-Impressionists van Gogh and Gauguin used color to express emotions, memories, moods, and fantasies, rather than representing objects as they appear in nature. Study how Van Gogh's complementary colors and Gauguin's arbitrary use of color freed other artists to assign any color to any object. Through the works of Matisse, Derain, Vlaminck, and Dufy, viewers see how the Fauves, or "Wild Beasts," brought new life through color to French painting by using harsh, arbitrary color, violent distortion, and broad brush work.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-002</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Expressionism</B><BR>
Adopting eerie compositions, forms, and colors associated with cold weather, isolation, political unrest, and the struggle to make a living, Northern artists communicated their feelings and emotions over a realistic rendering of subject matter. Their feelings regarding these circumstances are seen through works by the Norwegian Munch; the Russians Kandinsky and Jawlensky; and the Germans Kirchner, Marc, and Beckmann.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-003</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Cubism</B><BR>
C&eacute;zanne's paintings, with their architectural and geometrical qualities, inspired Picasso, Braque, and Gris to create a new art capable of interpreting the new ideas of the century. Selections from these artists' works illustrate some characteristics of Cubism: multiple and mixed perspectives, emphasis on multi-dimensions, abstraction, and monochromatic palettes. The works of Delaunay, L&eacute;ger, Duchamp, and Mondrian demonstrate the breadth of the movement and illustrate how it reflected the upheavals of the twentieth century.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-004</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Surrealism</B><BR>
Seeking to reveal the inner reality behind outward appearances, the Surrealist movement drew heavily on dreams and Freudian and Jungian theories of the unconscious, the irrational, and fantasy. The lush fantasy paintings of Rousseau show the beginnings of fantasy and inner and other reality in Surrealist paintings. Through the works of the Spaniards Dali and Mir&oacute;, "Surrealism" demonstrates how the Surrealists developed original and often highly personal vocabularies of imagery. The variety of styles and concerns of the Surrealists are illustrated through the provocative canvases of Magritte, de Chirico, and Chagall.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-005</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Modern Mavericks</B><BR>
Many European artists are overlooked because they do not fall under specific categories, or because they belong to peculiar or brief movements. "Modern Mavericks" examines six such Europeans through artistic style and influence: Klimt's unique decorative Expressionist figure paintings and portraits; Paul Klee's gift of innovation and his role in every major twentieth-century art movement; and selected early paintings of Rouault depict the hideousness of his early works and more compassionate, religious spirit of his later ones; Balla's Futurist paintings; Modigliani's elegant portraits; and Kokoschka's expressionistic city portraits.<BR>

<BR>
American Artists<HR>

<B>American Landscapes</B><BR>
The painters featured in this program did more than just capture a scene with paint, they revealed new insights about America, and about the character of its people. Featuring seascapes, skyscapes, and cityscapes from Maine to Manhattan to New Mexico, "American Landscapes" shows examples of how Cubism influenced Stella's vertical abstract paintings, how Precisionists Demuth and Sheeler illustrated America's new industrial landscape, the more abstract and organic aspects of the landscape in the paintings of O'Keeffe and Dove, and Marin's expressionistic images.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-007</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Realism</B><BR>
In American art, Realism is an effort by painters to depict--by region and through actual rather than ideal scenes--the American struggle after the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing depression. "Realism" features Hopper's stark, brooding inner-city paintings, Shahn's artistic commentary on political and social injustices, Levine's social satires, Pippin's striking interiors, and Avery's unique abstract landscapes. The works of Wyeth, Wood, and Hart Benton show their unique and separate, yet related visions of rural American life--a new regional realism.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-008</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Abstract Expressionism</B><BR>
This American art movement of the 1940s and 1950s manifested the creative feelings, frustrations, and struggles of painters through gestures and motion. The early movement's preoccupation with automatic writing, motion, and chaos are demonstrated in the bold gestural paintings of Kline, de Kooning, and Gottlieb, and focus on Pollock's technique of spattering and dribbling. The importance of color as a powerful emotive element that can stand on its own is demonstrated through works by Rothko, Frankenthaler, and Louis. The precise, hard, and immaculate shaped canvases of Frank Stella suggest a reaction to the emotional outbursts of Abstract Expressionism.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#297-009</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Pop</B><BR>
Adopting their imagery from popular culture and commercial art, Pop artists used techniques of commercial illustration to satirize the superficiality of American people, pastimes, pleasures, and products of the 1960s. Lichtenstein's comic book images, Warhol's famous faces, Rosenquist's day-glo canvases, Thiebaud's paintings of cakes and pies, Oldenburg's burger sculptures, and Indiana's work with letters, words, numbers, and signs illustrate Pop's spirit and typical subject matter.<BR>

<B>Ash Can Plus</B><BR>
Ash Can painters and photographers drew upon urban life in Philadelphia, New York, and Boston for subject matter. Working primarily as reporters, illustrators, and teachers, they recorded commonplace subjects and rowdy scenes, capturing the vitality of the city. Students see examples of how Bellows, Luks, Sloan, and Marsh transferred these city scenes from their notes and sketches onto their canvases, and how Stieglitz captured his city scenes in photographs.<BR>

<B>Cosmopolitans: Looking Toward Europe</B><BR>
Expatriates Sargent and Whistler epitomized, to Europeans, the sophisticated American Society painters abroad while Homer, Eakins, Henri, and Prendergast traveled in Europe, but came home to apply the techniques they had learned. "Cosmopolitans" shows how these artists expressed the new American spirit on canvas through scenes that were mostly American in character and in subject matter.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-002</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Colonials: Realistic and Romantic</B><BR>
Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century American painters provided a running commentary on American history through works portraying the look and life of America and Americans. "Colonials" illustrates the homespun realism of Copley, the dramatic poses of expatriate West, the romantic panoramas and portraits of native Americans by Catlin, the genre paintings of Bingham, the landscapes of Bierstadt and Church, and the "mindscapes" of Ryder.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-003</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>English Painting</B><BR>
From 1730 to 1850, English painting came into its own. Native painters replaced foreign ones, and began to influence other European artists. Viewers see examples of Hogarth's witty  satires, Reynolds's and Gainsborough's society portraits, Constable's and Turner's land and seascapes, and the Pre-Raphaelite Rossetti's medieval scenes featuring femmes fatales with pouting lips and smoldering eyes.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-004</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Spain</B><BR>
Politics and religion, particularly the Inquisition, played important roles in shaping early Spanish styles in art. From El Greco's Mannerist style and Vel&aacute;squez's Baroque style to Goya's portraits and Gaud&iacute;'s Surrealistic architecture, Spanish art continues to dazzle and haunt us with some of the world's greatest masterpieces.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-005</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>German Painting</B><BR>
Early German artists rendered intense emotion and precise portrait through superb handling of line. The Reformation led to a shift from religious subjects to portraiture. "German Painting" demonstrates Gr&uuml;newald's depictions of the life of Christ, D&uuml;rer's line drawings and paintings, and Cranach the Elder's and Holbein the Younger's historical portraits.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-006</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Seventeenth Century Dutch Masters</B><BR>
Seventeenth-century Dutch painters presented Holland's bustling streets, lively interiors, landscapes, and citizens in masterpieces that mirrored their society. Thriving, newly formed Holland is portrayed in Rembrandt's perfect portraits bathed in light from the left, Hals's feasting characters, de Hooch's courtyards and interiors, Ruisdael's landscapes of Haarlem, and Vermeer's women dreamily drifting through their chores.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-007</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Flemish Painting</B><BR>
Early Flemish paintings grew out of illuminated Gothic manuscripts. In portraying interiors and furnishings, towns, rivers, trees, and flowers, van Eyck, Van der Weyden, Bruegel the Elder, and Memling developed a technique of painting on wood panels with oil, creating an enamel-like smoothness and an impression of light reflected from deep within. In later Flemish works, the character of Baroque painting was embodied in the dramatic masterpieces of Rubens.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-008</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Italian Renaissance Painting</B><BR>
From the late fifteenth century to the mid-sixteenth century, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo Buonarotti, and Raphael Sanzio painted portraits and religious pictures that are acknowledged as world masterpieces. "Italian Renaissance Painting" illustrates how their enormous artistic talent and individual characteristics--Leonardo's contemporary spirit, Michelangelo's powerful Christianity, and Raphael's sweet charm--shaped the destiny of Western art.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-009</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Mannerism: Italy</B><BR>
Mannerism in sixteenth-century Italian painting was a rejection of Renaissance style in favor of something new, political and economic crises, and Michelangelo's changing vision. The distorted, feverish, tense, contorted, magnificent style called Mannerism is best represented by Pontormo's tormented, eerie religious paintings, Parmigianino's elongated limbs, Bronzino's elegant and haughty portraits, Tintoretto's swirling cyclones, and Michelangelo's powerful "Last Judgement."<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-010</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Italian Architecture</B><BR>
Italian Renaissance, Mannerist, and Baroque styles strongly influenced architecture throughout the world. "Italian Architecture" examines the calm, symmetrical buildings of Renaissance architects Brunelleschi, Alberti and Bramante; the elegant, tension-filled Mannerist works of Giulio Romano, Palladio, and Michelangelo; and the Baroque churches of Bernini and Longhena.<BR>
<TABLE><TR><TD>#313-011</TD><TD>15-minute video program</TD><TD>$125</TD></TR></TABLE><P>

<B>Ch&acirc;teaux of the Loire</B><BR>
Sixteenth-century ch&acirc;teaux of the Loire Valley in France were Gothic in style, but additions made to them reflect the strong influences of Italian Renaissance, Mannerist, and Baroque architecture. Featured Ch&acirc;teaux: Amboise, Azay-le-Rideau, Blois, Chambord, Chenonceau, and Cheverny.<BR>

<B>French Rococo Painters of Court and Courtiers</B><BR>
French Rococo paintings are representative of the frivolous, fairy-tale existence of the nobility during the eighteenth century. Take viewers from the reign of Louis XIV, when France controlled every aspect of life, to the Regency of Louis XV, when the nobility shielded themselves from the poverty of the people. The works of Watteau, Boucher, Fragonard, Chardin, and Vig&eacute;e-LeBrun illustrate the fragile, delicate, playful style and trivial themes and characters of Rococo painting.<BR>

<B>Fire and Ice: The Romantic-Classic Debate</B><BR>
Nineteenth-century Neoclassical art redirected the course of French painting. Works by David and Ingr&eacute;s expressed France's moral and psychological revolution against the crown. When rigid Neoclassical rules seemed to strangle imagination, Romantic painting emerged. Emphasizing imagination and emotion, paintings by Gericault and Delacroix demonstrate the Romantics' struggle to restore the humanity, passion, and drama of art after Napoleon's fall at Waterloo.<BR>

<B>The Triumph of Popular Realism in Nineteenth-Century France</B><BR>
By 1840, French painters were no longer concerned with depicting the court and courtiers of the successive reigns of kings, the Napoleonic era, or Neoclassicism. Realist painters were guided by real world landscapes, objects, and people, and usually painted outdoors. Works of Corot, Daumier, Millet, Bonheur, and Courbet illustrate the desire of Realists to interpret the visual world as precisely as possible.<BR>

<B>North Italian Painters: Color and Chiaroscuro</B><BR>
Italian painters from Venice and her satellites (Verona, Bergamo, and Cadore) are renowned for their common ability to render magnificent color and chiaroscuro (shading from dark to light). "North Italian Painters" features works by five brilliant artists: Titian, Veronese, Tiepolo, Canaletto, and Caravaggio.<BR>

<B>British Cathedrals and Country Houses</B><BR>
See how, especially in America, British architecture has greatly influenced world architecture. From only two trips to Italy in the 1590s, Inigo Jones revolutionized British architecture by introducing a Renaissance style. "British Cathedrals and Country Houses" takes viewers on a brief tour through seven architecturally significant buildings from the age of Jones and Sir Christopher Wren, to Vanbrugh, Burlington and Kent, Adam, and Nash.<BR>

<B>New Methods and Materials: Twentieth-Century American Sculpture</B><BR>
American sculpture of the 1940s, '50s, and '60s is intriguing for its capricious and imaginative use of material. "New Methods and Materials" shows examples of Calder's witty stabiles and mobiles, Smith's heroic totems, Chamberlain's crushed auto parts, Nevelson's structured walls, Hunt's hybrid steel forms, Edmonson's naive carvings, and Christo's wrapped objects.<BR>

<B>American Architecture: In Search of a National Integrity</B><BR>
American architecture continues to be a summation of its foreign influences in combination with its own inventions and designs. Through selected examples, viewers see representative buildings in the U.S.A. by five prominent architects: Jefferson, Richardson, Sullivan, Wright, and Van der Rohe.<BR>

<B>The African-American Experience in Painting</B><BR>
The works of six African-American painters reflect their heritage, traditions, and role in American culture through works exemplifying the struggles of all African-Americans. Viewers are introduced to Johnson's liberal, naive portraits of the "well-to-do" citizens of Baltimore, expatriates Duncanson's landscapes and Tanner's extraordinary religious paintings, Lee-Smith's portrayals of the urban plight of his people, Lawrence's depictions of working-class people competing for jobs, and Bearden's famous collages.<BR>

<B>South of the Border</B><BR>
Illustrate the role of politics in twentieth-century Latin-American art. The appeal of Communism to early twentieth-century Mexican painters and muralists (Kahlo, Orozco, Rivera, and Siqueiros) is reflected in the portraits, traditions, and struggles glorifying their people. Tamayo, an outspoken anti-communist, preferred to associate with the surrealists and cubists rather than other Mexican painters. Today, Latin-American artists continue to produce politically motivated works: Columbian Botero's political cartoons and Paris-born Venezuelan Marisol's satirical sculptures.<BR>

<BODY>

<H2>Bioscope</H2>

Ecology and Life Sciences for Intermediate and Junior High<P>

"There's only so much food to go around," says the narrator. How each living thing on earth behaves affects the chances of survival for all the others, and for their species.<P>

Concepts such as the web of life, adaptation, the food chain, life cycles, and interdependence come alive for students in grades four through seven as <B>Bioscope</B> features locations from the Amazon to the Arctic and living beings from algae to great whales.<P>

The series also explores students' own place in the biosphere -- as food consumers, animal lovers, or future life scientists or technologists. "Think" time and open-ended questions encourage viewers to consider solutions to environmental problems.<P>

<B>Bioscope</B> was produced by Mississippi Authority for Educational Television, with partial funding from AIT (1980).<P>

<H3>Programs</H3> 

1. <B>Bioscope: The Life Sciences</B> - Simple organisms perform all life functions in one cell; more complex ones need many specialized cells. All living beings depend on other living beings. What we know about them comes from discoveries by life scientists such as Harvey, Hooke, Fleming, Linnaeus, Priestley, Carver, Carson, Drew, and Watson.  Scientists of today build on their work. (14:17)<P>

2. <B>Cell</B> - Cells, the smallest of all living things, have many parts and perform many intricate functions. The cell membrane speeds food and oxygen into the cell and wastes out; the nucleus with its chromosomes containing DNA directs all cell functions. Protists are single-celled organisms like amoebae, paramecia, and algae. Humans begin as one cell, which divides into many to form tissues that combine to make up our body systems. (14:45)<P>

3. <B>The World of Living Things</B> - This program samples some of the remarkable features of living organisms. Animal wonders include the dazzling life cycle of the jellyfish, the jet propulsion of the octopus, a sea otter cracking shellfish with a stone while floating on its back, army ants overrunning a grasshopper, and the Komodo dragon -- the world's largest lizard. In the world of plants we see seeds develop and flowers open, plants that defend themselves, giant redwoods, and the carnivorous Venus's-flytrap. (14:48)<P>

4. <B>Where Plants and Animals Live</B> - Frozen tundra; coniferous, deciduous, and tropical rain forests; grasslands; and deserts are all biomes and all startlingly different. Temperature, sunlight, rainfall, and the soil greatly influence the types and abundance of plant and animal life in each biome. Life forms hibernate, migrate, or adapt in response to changing conditions within their own biome. (14:39)<P>

5. <B>Adaptation</B> - Life can exist almost anywhere because it adapts, changing habits, home, or body structure and function. In extreme conditions adaptations are extreme. Mountain plants that stay warm by growing in clumps, the ptarmigan whose plumage hides it by changing color, the Gila monster whose fat tail stores food -- all survive to reproduce their kind. (14:36)<P>

6. <B>The Natural Balance</B> - Plants are producers, making their own food from soil nutrients and the sun's energy. Animals are consumers. Some eat plants; others eat other animals. In the natural balance, there must be more of those who are eaten than of those who eat them and more plants than animals. The food chain makes a complete cycle when dead animals decompose and provide nutrients for plants. Weather, overpopulation of one kind of animal, lack of food, and human interference can upset the natural balance. (14:46)<P>

7. <B>Endangered Species</B> - Most plants and animals can't survive sudden changes in their habitats. Whole species may die out. Leveling forests, building highways, polluting water and air, and spraying pesticides are all ways in which humans have altered habitats. When one organism is affected so are others, including humans. (14:46)<P>

8. <B>Frontiers in the Biosphere</B> - Recent technological breakthroughs have greatly improved our lives. Lasers, databanks, brain scanners, high frequency sound waves, and artificial body parts enable doctors to treat many previously incurable ailments. Future advances in science and technology will solve many problems. Some day a colony may exist independently in space, an earth satellite may help prevent hunger, and we may make full use of the energy in the ocean. (14:40)<P>

<H2>Bush Babies</H2>

Science and Language Arts for Pre-K to Third Grade<P>

<B>Bush Babies</B> . . . A big series about little animals<P>

<B>Bush Babies</B> . . . Come in all shapes and sizes<P>

<B>Journey into the wild world of baby animals while helping children learn about nature</B><P>

Young children have a natural curiosity about animals, especially baby animals, and <B>Bush Babies</B> makes the study of animals come to life in ways that children will love and remember. This series presents life in the South African desert through the eyes of baby animals. In each of 24 episodes, a different animal tells its own story. Skillful narration, which is faithful to the character of each animal, draws pre-K-3 viewers into the programs and teaches them about the animals' life and eating habits, as well as the rules the baby animals must learn. These programs will help teachers
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>explain why animals behave certain ways, what it's like to live in the wild, and where they can expect to find food
<LI>supplement various curricula--language arts, for story starters; natural science, with lessons on animal behavior and habitat; and health, with discussions of feelings and coping skills
<LI>enhance children's sensitivity and foster their appreciation of nature
</UL><P>

<B>Bush Babies</B> explores the animal kingdom in ways no picture in a book can match. A baby rhino says he doesn't like being teased about his tiny horn. A young giraffe says she always stays close to her mother to be safe from predators. Such characterizations provide teachers with material that may influence children's own behavior at the same time it entertains them.  Each of the 24 programs is 10 minutes long and can be used to supplement other courses.<P>

Part of the acclaimed "Kideo" concept, <B>Bush Babies</B> is produced by Safritel of Johannesburg, South Africa, and distributed by AIT. &copy; 1995<P>

<B>Bush Babies</B> is available now for broadcast use.  For more information please call AIT's Broadcast Services Department at (800) 457-4509, extension 235 or 236.

<TITLE>Common Issues #338</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Common Issues in World Regions</H2>

Geography, Social Studies, and Current Events for Junior High and High School<P>

Cultivate students' appreciation for the global community and prepare them to function in an ever-shrinking world with this revealing series. Eight paired case studies illustrate how common issues affect target-age youths and their families in the U.S./Canada and Western Europe. Students improve their comparative skills and understanding of others' cultures as they explore the commonalities and differences in lifestyle, environment, economy, and other aspects of young peoples' lives in both regions.<P>

The programs may be shown interchangeably as they fit the Western European unit in junior high school world geography and social studies courses. Each program addresses a fundamental geographic theme, making it useful for developing the geographic dimension of high school current events, cultures, international studies, and world history courses.<P>

<B>Common Issues in World Regions</B> is the result of a unique international coproduction involving 15 Northern American and Western European agencies. It is distributed to classrooms in the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe in order to strengthen what students in those regions learn about each other.<P>

<B>Common Issues</B> is now available in Canada and Europe.  Co-produced by six Northern American agencies managed by AIT and nine Western European agencies managed by Centre National de Documentation Pedagogique (1991).<P>

<TITLE>Draw Along #267</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Draw Along</H2>

Visual Art for Primary<P>

Artist-teacher Paul Ringler knows what children like to draw and how to help them do it. <B>Draw Along</B> will capture the imagination of anyone who can hold a crayon.<P>

"You need not draw exactly as I draw," Mr. Ringler tells the children. "But I can give you ideas."<P>

And give them he does, from years of experience as a professional artist and teacher at the elementary, secondary, and college levels.<P>

<B>Draw Along</B> shows children in the primary grades clear, simple steps they can use to draw animals, birds, people, planes, cartoons, buildings, and more. There's plenty of time for young viewers to draw along.<P>

This series helps younger children express themselves artistically, develop visual acuity and the ability to see shapes in objects they wish to draw, and experiment with different techniques.<P>

The <B>Draw Along</B> teacher's guide illustrates the steps shown in the programs and suggests how teachers can encourage, rather than stifle, children's creativity.<P>

<B>Draw Along</B> was produced by AIT in association with Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (1986).<P>

<TITLE>Drawing with Paul Ringler #287</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Drawing with Paul Ringler</H2>

Visual Art for Intermediate, Junior High, and High School<P>

"It takes more skill to sign your name than to draw," says artist-teacher Paul Ringler. "You draw with your head not your hand." Where most people fall down, he says, is in not knowing procedures -- or in knowing too little about the subject they are drawing.<P>

This studio art series gives students from fifth grade through high school time-tested procedures they can apply to any kind of drawing. The teacher's guide reviews the instructional content in print and drawings and the "try it" suggestion with which each program ends. It correlates the programs with two widely mandated textbooks and lists additional resources for students and teachers.<P>

<A HREF="c267.html"><B>Draw Along</B></A>, Mr. Ringler's popular series for the primary grades, helps children draw specific objects. The emphasis in these programs for older students is on the drawing process.<P>

"Not laws," he says. "Art isn't that way. We make suggestions and show them options."<P>

<B>Drawing with Paul Ringler</B> was produced by AIT in association with Oklahoma Educational Television Authority (1988).<P>

Twenty years ago Meier became the principal of an elementary school in New York City, bringing to the job a vision of how to turn that school around. Her vision was based on collaboration. She wanted to create a school that was small enough, intimate enough, and accessible enough for children, families, and teachers to feel as if they all belonged to the same community and were going to explore it together. Out of that vision came Central Park East Elementary School, as well as a successful high school.</P>

<P>Discover why Deborah Meier argues that schools should view themselves as membership communities in which students, teachers, and parents work collaboratively to discuss ideas, argue purposes, and make judgments. Discuss the elements of Meier's vision and examine what has sustained it over the years. Learn what advice she offers teachers and administrators who want to obtain results like hers.</P>

Levin. Dr. Levin has devoted more than a decade to changing how at-risk students are treated in schools. His Accelerated Schools Project is transforming traditional schools, which are based on remediation, into schools about which one could say, &#147;<CITE>Those schools are for gifted and talented students. Those are schools where they really respect students' ability to learn and where they create very stimulating environments for learning to happen.</CITE>&#148;</P>

Since we abandoned what we were, we've gone down in the world's eyes and our society has degenerated to a point where everybody's aware of the fact that we're in a degenerate society now,</CITE>&#148; charges Robert L. Simonds. In 1981 a group of parents from the Newport/Mesa school district in California contacted Robert Simonds to complain that students had been ordered to cancel a concert by a Christian band, even though a rock band whose songs contained vulgar lyrics had been allowed to perform at the school that week. As a retired administrator, Dr. Simonds felt the problem could easily be solved by talking to the principal. When approached, the principal exploded: &#147;<CITE>Over my dead body will I allow anything Christian on my campus!</CITE>&#148; The superintendent was also unreceptive, saying that if he listened to every parent who complained, he would be interrupted 25 times a week. &#147;<CITE>If you want me to listen to you,</CITE>&#148; he added, &#147;<CITE>come back with 200 parents who agree with you.</CITE>&#148; The superintendent then walked away. That was the beginning the arrogant treatment Simonds received from local administrators   that led him to form Citizens for Excellence in Education (CEE), an organization of parents who advocate academic excellence and character education for America's children. The group, which has involved 250,000 parents in 50 states, has 1,650 active chapters.</P>

<P>Discover why Robert Simonds argues that the needs of traditional Christian families are not being met by public schools. Identify what Simonds and other traditional Christians propose is wrong with today's public schools, what they want from public schools, and how he proposes that public schools meet the needs of CEE members.

<TITLE>Empty Chairs #293</TITLE>
<BODY>


<H2>Empty Chairs</H2>

Life Skills and Suicide Prevention for Grades 9-12, Adult<P>

Illustrate that teenage suicides can be prevented if families and friends  	are able to recognize the warning signs and know what to do about  	them. Familiarize young people, parents, educators, and counselors with the warning signs of suicide and demonstrate how to assess the urgency of the situation.<P>

Every 90 minutes a teenager commits suicide. Nearly all of them signal their intentions. <B>Empty Chairs</B>, a play written and performed by a group of high school seniors, focuses on reactions by family and friends to the suicide of a teenage girl. People close to the victim recall her behavior and review the signs that should have warned them that something was very wrong. The victim herself explains how depressed she felt and apologizes for the grief she has caused. A brief question-and-answer session follows the videoplay with the young actors responding to questions typically asked by viewers.<P>

<B>Empty Chairs</B> was produced by CITY School Foundatin, Roanoke, Virgina (1988).<P>

</BODY>

<H2>Everybody's Schoolhouse</H2>

Staff Development for Regular and Sepcial Education Teachers, Parents and Caregivers<P>

<B>Meet the challenge of providing inclusionary education</B><P>

Every student deserves a good education, and no one should be left on the sidelines because of disabilities. Advances in assistive technology have made it more practicable than ever to include disabled students in standard classrooms; however, administrative support and staff planning are essential for such programs to succeed. <B>Everybody's Schoolhouse</B> provides creative solutions for implementing an inclusive and integrative approach from pre-K through secondary school. The series also highlights contemporary success stories and projects future trends. These illuminating programs will
<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>provide models of planning procedures for teachers, parents, and members of the community
<LI>examine expert practitioners' diverse viewpoints and practical applications  based on their principles of research
<LI>address curriculum adaptations and alternatives  for including disabled students in the life of the classroom, the school,  and the community<P>

<B>Everybody's Schoolhouse</B> consists of nine 15-minute staff-development programs. Because it stimulates discussion and involvement, the series is ideal for faculty meetings, in-service workshops, and parent/caregiver sessions. Facilitator and participant guides are available. The series was produced by the Division of Special Education, Maryland State Department of Education, through the facilities of Maryland Public Television &copy;1994<P>

There's room for everyone in <B>Everybody's Schoolhouse</B><P>

Historically, general educators and special educators have been isolated from one another; today, however, this traditional model is being superseded by one of cooperation and teamwork. Everyone who touches the life of the disabled student-the principal, the regular classroom teacher, the special education teacher, and all other service providers-must be included in planning and preparing for this student's inclusion. Continuous staff development is essential if the process is to succeed. <B>Everybody's Schoolhouse</B> is a highly effective tool for training teachers and other personnel to deal with the special challenges that inclusive education presents.<P>

<H3>Programs</H3>

<B>1. Introduction</B> - Provides an overview of inclusive education, including legal requirements. Emphasizes that inclusion prepares disabled students for meaningful lives that contribute to society. Shows that disabled students who are integrated with their non-disabled peers achieve higher levels of social, academic, and physical success and that the non-disabled students benefit as well. (13:35)<P>

<B>2. Planning and Staff Development</B> - Stresses the need for administrative support and staff planning for inclusionary programs to succeed. Introduces administrators who have led and supported inclusionary efforts. Presents nine elements needed to prepare for a plan of inclusion. Gives examples of training techniques used by effective programs. (14:40)<P>

<B>3. Looking at the Whole Student</B> - Examines the roles of family members and friends in the planning process for including disabled students. Presents the experiences of parents whose disabled children have been included in regular classrooms. Illustrates how the benefits of inclusion extend to the entire classroom by featuring young people who serve as peer ambassadors to disabled students. (14:09)<P>

<B>4. In the Classroom</B> - Focuses on curriculum adaptations and alternatives when students with disabilities are included in regular classrooms. Explores the benefits of team-teaching through the eyes of a special education instructor. Looks at some of the supplemental devices and services available for disabled students. (11:25)<P>

<B>5. Outside the Classroom</B> - Addresses ways that disabled students can be included in the broader life of the school and community. Reports how teachers have helped disabled students get involved in extracurricular activities through the peer-ambassador program. Demonstrates how a special education teacher developed he own on-site work program to prepare students for real jobs later. (11:36)<P>

<B>6. Moving Ahead with Success</B> - Celebrates several success stories and takes a look at where inclusionary education is headed in the future. (12:32)<P>
<A NAME=closer></A>
<B>Everybody's Schoolhouse: A Closer Look</B><BR>
Programs 7, 8, and 9 visit three Maryland schools-an elementary, a middle, and a high school-to get an in-depth view of teaching in an inclusive environment.<P>

<B>7. Elementary School</B> - Visit an elementary school where success is certainly important, but time is on the side of student and teacher. Special and general educators demonstrate how team teaching allows them to support one another and learn more about successful instructional techniques and strategies. The school's principal emphasizes the planning of accommodations. (15 :12)<P>

<B>8. Middle School</B> - See why middle schools must set inclusive goals at the total school level. Because students move from one class to another, all educators should be involved in the planning process. Many of the accommodations students with disabilities need to meet school performance standards also help other students succeed as well. (15:44)<P>

<B>9. High School</B> - Discover how high school students are expected to find their way in a very independent environment. School principals underscore the need for administrative support for inclusion and team teaching efforts. Because students are preparing for graduation and post-secondary education, assessment is presented as a very important part of a high school inclusion program. (15:08)<P>

<TITLE>Fins, Feathers & Fur #263</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Fins, Feathers & Fur</H2>
  
Communication Skills for Primary<P>

A pet shop for teaching writing? Sure. One of the main reasons second- and third-graders say they can't write is that they don't have anything to write about. These programs give them surefire "story starters."<P>

Captain Write, a retired sea captain who writes a weekly newspaper column about animals, runs the Fins, Feathers & Fur pet shop with his daughter Amy. Three children who make the friendly neighborhood shop their second home learn from the Captain and Amy about the writing process and about helping each other put their thoughts and feelings on paper.<P>

The series begins with concepts as simple as the connections between objects and words. Later, the children draft sentences and paragraphs, revise drafts, and write for specific purposes and readers.<P>

Most programs contain two "story starters" -- a montage of animals, people, or both and a surprise or unresolved ending.<P>

<B>Fin, Feathers, & Fur</B> was produced by WXXI, Rochester, New York, and AIT (1986).<P>

<H2>In Other Words</H2>

Communication Skills and Skills Essential to Learning for Junior High<P>

Clear thinking is at the heart of good communication. <B>In Other Words</B> blends language arts skills with problem-solving techniques to help students prepare effective written and spoken messages, listen attentively and present their thoughts clearly, organize their ideas, and evaluate their work.<P>

Divided into four process clusters, the programs show how language arts skills taught in the seventh and eighth grades are useful for the communication tasks that students encounter everyday in and out of school.<P>

After a humorous vignette introduces a communication skill, a seventh- or eighth-grader fails to use the skill to deal with a communication problem. Another student uses it correctly. In a nondramatic segment, an adult who uses the skill in his or her professional life talks about the skill's importance and demonstrates its use. Finally, the young person who had difficulties earlier applies the skill successfully.<P>

<B>In Other Words</B> is one of three series in Phase II of the Skills Essential to Learning Project (SEL II). Developed through the resources of a consortium of state and provincial education agencies. organized and managed by AIT. Produced under the management of AIT at KOCE, Huntington Beach, California, and KRMA, Denver, by The Thom Eberhardt Company, Newport Beach, California (1983).<P>

Getting Ready<HR>

1. <B>Consider Your Audience</B> - Mr. Harrison, the school principal, doesn't understand Darlene's proposal to reinstate noon dances because she hasn't considered his interests, knowledge, and expectations. When Darlene meets with Mr. Harrison again, she is well-prepared. (14:15)<P>

2. <B>Breaking Down a Topic</B> - Joyce and Scott collect too much information for their report on Mexico because they haven't decided which subtopics to cover. They realize that breaking down their report will focus it and make their work easier. (14:03)<P>

3. <B>Using People Sources</B> - Sally Ann asks Mrs. Dockstedder about working mothers' problems, but she hasn't planned the interview beforehand. She makes an appointment to interview Mrs. Dockstedder again, gets permission to use a tape recorder, and has prepared specific questions. (14:15)<P>

Organizing Ideas<HR>

4. <B>Organizing Your Message</B> - The staff of the "Weekly Bull Dog" can't decide on the best way to organize its upcoming issue. After thinking about the paper's purpose, the staff decides to arrange the paper by category. (13:53)<P>

5. <B>Would an Example Help?</B> - Ricky's first play confuses the cast because the language is inappropriate and the script isn't typed the usual way. He checks other scripts before rewriting his, and the cast understands what to do. (13:58)<P>

Giving Meaning to Messages<HR>

6. <B>Using the Word of Others</B> - Jeff has overused the words of others in a report on San Francisco, without quotation marks, footnotes, or a bibliography. The host explains that quotations should support, not replace, a writer's ideas and should be acknowledged. Jeff rewrites his paper in his own words, acknowledging his few well-chosen quotations. (13:46)<P>

7. <B>What's the Best Word?</B> - Mr. Harrison tells Rita the student body fund is low, but not "bankrupt" as she stated in her emotion-packed headline. Sally Ann suggests to Rita that "teetering" describes the student body fund accurately and with exactly the right connotation. (14:26)<P>

8. <B>How Can I Get People to Listen?</B> -  Joyce hands out rocks to interest the class in her science report, but Darlene loses their attention. Darlene includes imaginative visual aids in her revised report. (13:47)<P>

9. <B>Active Listening</B> - Mrs. Dockstedders message, passed from Joyce to Sally to Ricky to Mr. Harrison, is unintelligible. When Joyce, Sally, and Ricky pay attention, ask questions, and restate Mrs. Dockstedder's message, it gets through. (13:50)<P>

10. <B>Am I Getting Through?</B> - Rita doesn't revise her confusing directions because she doesn't notice Mrs. Dockstedder's reaction. When Jeff upsets Sally Ann with a comment about her feet, she monitors his reactions and revises her approach until she knows he understands how she feels. (13:42)<P>

11.  <B>Building on Your Work</B> - When Scott suggests that a second draft will improve Sally Ann's boa constrictor story, she thinks he wants her to start over. Her third draft is so good that Scott promises to print it. (14:28)<P>

<H2>It Figures</H2>

Problem Solving in Basic Mathematics for Grade 4<P>

Encourage students to apply mathematics skills, ideas, and problem-solving strategies to real-life problems. Fourth-grade students become effective problem solvers by understanding that the process of reaching a correct answer is as important as the answer itself.<P>

The <B>It Figures</B> video programs and teacher's guide develop mathematical skills, promote an understanding of mathematical ideas, and demonstrate mathematical problem-solving strategies. Instructional dramas and animated segments teach the importance of mathematics in everyday life and challenge students to consider how mathematics relates to them.<P>

<B>It Figures</B> was developed through the resources of a consortium of state and provincial education agencies organized and managed by AIT (1982). The computer component was developed as a cooperative project of Massachusetts Educational Television, Massachusetts Department of Education, and AIT (1986).<P>

<H2>John I. Goodlad:</H2>
<H3>New Schools, New Teachers</H3>

Educational Reform for Preservice/Inservice Educators<P>

Address the two issues at the heart of education in the '90s--School Reform and Teacher Preparation. Structure inservice workshop sessions and preservice college classes around the topics analyzed by John I. Goodlad in this two-part staff development program.<P>

A leader in school improvement, restructuring, and renewal, Professor Goodlad discusses his views on the direction reform must take and the goals education must achieve if we are to succeed as educators. Video footage from New Suncook Elementary School in Lovell, Maine (part of the National Network for Educational Renewal) illustrates the initiatives he would like to see in all schools. The facilitator's guide features workshop agendas, background information, and resource lists.<P>

<B>John I. Goodlad: New Schools, New Teachers</B> was produced by AIT and Phi Delta Kappa (1994).<P>

<TITLE>Just For Me #336</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Just for Me</H2>

<H2>Solo para Mi</H2> Spanish Language School Package Now Available.<P>

Abuse and Drug Prevention Education, Life Coping Skills for Grades 2-4, Adult<P>

Help students develop the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors necessary to prevent drug use and to support non-use in others. Focus on the important roles self-concept, decision making, and peer pressure play in developing the skills that promote positive and healthy choices.<P>

Prevention specialists believe that it is easier to prevent risky health behaviors than it is to change them once established. The longer negative choices can be delayed, the less likely it is that abuse will occur. Because students are making choices about personal health behaviors with long-term implications by the time they reach the intermediate grades, it is imperative that education to prevent drug use reach children before they start. <B>Just for Me</B> is designed as a coordinated approach between primary grade students, teachers, parents, and communities.<P>

<B>Just for Me</B> was produced by AIT and a consortium of U.S.-Canadian agencies, with funding from the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation through the BEST Foundation for a Drug-Free Tomorrow (1992).<P>

<TITLE>Managing the Disruptive Classroom #366</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Managing the  Disruptive Classroom:</H2>
<H3>Strategies for Educators</H3>

Teaching Techniques in Classroom Discipline for Preservice/Inservice Educators, Adults<P>

How are you dealing with disruptive behavior in the classroom? Is your current approach working as well as you would like it to work?<P>

Provide teachers, administrators, parents, and students with a proven set of strategies for managing classrooms and dealing with disruptive behavior. Founded on theories and principles developed by William Glasser and refined by Robert Wubbolding, reality therapy is an approach that can be effectively applied in any classroom. Reality therapy requires students to take responsibility for their actions by holding them accountable, accepting no excuses, and expecting them to control their own behavior.<P>

Disrespect, ignoring rules, open hostility, or violence: disruptive behavior is anything that interferes with the educational process or thte meeting of another person's needs. Professor Wubbolding identifies the increase of problems in today's classrooms as a direct result of students' inner needs not being met. Reality therapy provides very concrete tactics you can use to interact with students to meet their five basic human needs:
<UL>
<LI>(1) the need to belong or to be involved;
<LI>(2) the need for power, importance, or achievement;
<LI>(3) the need for fun or enjoyment;
<LI>(4) the need for freedom or the ability to make choices;
<LI>(5) the need for survival.
</UL><P>

Problem Solving in Basic Mathematics for Grade 5<P>

Build mathematical thinking skills and help fifth graders develop confidence in their ability to use mathematics in their everyday lives. Math Works utilizes a problem-solving approach where the goal is "answer seeking" rather than "answer giving." Students learn that solving problems involves applying mathematics to the real world.<P>

The Math Works video programs and teacher's guide will help students develop estimation skills, mental computation skills, problem-solving strategies, and applications to real-life problems. Students see mathematical applications in action and understand that mathematical skills help solve problems.<P>

<B>Math Works</B> was developed through the resources of a consortium of state and provincial education agencies, organized and managed by AIT, with initial development support provided by Exxon Education Foundation (1985).<P>

<TITLE>Music and Me #179</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Music and Me</H2>

Music for Primary and Intermediate<P>

<B>Music and Me</B> builds on third- and fourth- graders' exposure to contemporary music to develop their understanding and appreciation of musical instruments, concepts, and traditions.<P>

"<B>The Power to Choose</B> vividly demonstrates how  the use of violence is a choice to misuse power. Young men learn that violence cannot be rationalized  or justified, but is a choice to abuse their power.  Young women are shown that violence doesn't  express insecurity or love, but a desire to control."<P>

Parental Involvement<BR>
Dorothy Rich is founder  and President of the  Home and School  Institute and author of "Mega-Skills: How Families Can Help Children Succeed in School and Beyond." Rich argues that if we  are truly interested in  improving student  learning, parents must be involved in the education of their children in ways that complement the work of the schools.<BR>

Multiple Intelligences<BR>
David Lazear is the author of "Seven Ways of Knowing:  Teaching for Multiple  Intelligences" and specializes in staff training which translates educational research into  practical classroom  techniques and strategies. Lazear discusses how schools have traditionally valued verbal and mathematical abilities over those in other areas. He argues that if we want all children to succeed, we must teach for multiple intelligences, not just for "traditional" intelligences.<BR>

Conflict Resolution<BR>
Larry Dieringer is associate director of Educators for Social Responsibility, and  a national and international workshop leader, consultant, and university instructor. Dieringer  argues that an effective conflict resolution program can reduce classroom management problems and help students become skilled problem-solvers. He discusses how effective conflict resolution--by which solutions to problems are identified and implemented--both reduces the conflict and uses it as an opportunity for learning.<BR>

Reading Styles and Whole Language<BR>
Marie Carbo is the recognized leader in the  field of reading styles,  Director of the National  Reading Styles Institute, and author of "The Reading  Style Inventory." Carbo  argues that for all children  to read well, attention  must be given not only to  the instructional approach used to teach reading, but also to the characteristics of the learner. She explains how the emphasis has alternated between analytical methods (phonics) and global methods (whole language).<BR>

Alfie Kohn is a lecturer, workshop leader, former classroom teacher, and  author of "No Contest:  The Case Against Competition." Eric Schaps is president of the  Developmental Studies Center and director of its longitudinal study of children's prosocial  development. Kohn and Schaps argue for the creation of caring classroom communities that  emphasize prosocial values. They detail how teachers are oftentimes just as responsible for helping their students achieve social, moral, and behavioral goals as they are for raising their test scores.<BR>

<TITLE>Sex. Abuse Prev.: 5 Rules, Mentally Hand. #280</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Sexual Abuse Prevention: Five Safety Rules for Persons Who Are Mentally Handicapped</H2>

Abuse Prevention, Special Education, and Special Needs for Grades 5-12, Adult, Professional Development<P>

Reduce abuse and exploitation of persons with mental disabilities by educating them about sexual abuse, acquainting them with situations that have the potential for abuse, and equipping them with information and skills to protect themselves.<P>

Developmentally disabled young people have been taught to obey and respect adults and are often dependent on them for basic care. Their trusting nature, desire to be accepted, and lack of knowledge and self-esteem make them especially vulnerable to abuse.<P>

<B>Sexual Abuse Prevention: Five Safety Rules for Persons Who Are Mentally Handicapped</B> gives examples of "good touch" and "bad touch," identifies private body parts, distinguishes between public and private places and the kinds of activities that are socially acceptable in each, states rules for self-protection, and demonstrates ways for students to defend themselves against an abuser.<P>

The video program consists of five vignettes: two situations of inappropriate behavior in public places and three situations portraying the potential for sexual abuse where the victim gets away. Each short episode focuses on one of the five safety rules:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Your body belongs to you.
<LI>Keep your clothes on in public.
<LI>Say "No."
<LI>Get away.
<LI>Tell someone.
</UL>
The instructor's manual suggests how to present this sensitive subject and contains information to help design lessons and implement other follow-up activities.<P>

<B>Sexual Abuse Prevention: Five Safety Rules for Persons Who Are Mentally Handicapped</B> was produced by Planned Parenthood Association of Cincinnati, Inc. (1987).<P>

<TITLE>Sexual Abuse Prev., Child. w/ Physical Handicaps #342</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Sexual Abuse Prevention for Children with Physical Handicaps</H2>

Abuse Prevention and Special Education, Special Needs for Grades 5-12, Adult, Professional Development<P>

Educate children with disabilities about the concept of sexual abuse and demonstrate ways they can protect themselves against sexual exploitation and abuse. Introduce five safety rules for sexual abuse prevention:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Your body belongs to you.
<LI>Trust your feelings.
<LI>Say "No."
<LI>Get away.
<LI>Tell someone.
</UL><P>

Because of their dependence on others, sexual abuse of children with physical disabilities is much more common than most of us would imagine. Hosted by an adult with multiple sclerosis, the program consists of five vignettes portraying situations where the potential for sexual abuse exists and presents a variety of resolutions appropriate for a wide range of handicapping conditions. Students learn to identify body areas to distinguish between "good touch" and "bad touch," to identify inappropriate behavior, rules for self-protection, and ways to defend themselves against an abuser.<P>

<B>Sexual Abuse Prevention for Children with Physical Handicaps</B> is suitable for use in schools, day-care facilities, group residences, or family homes.<P>

<B>Sexual Abuse Prevention for Children with Physical Handicaps</B> was produced by Planned Parenthood Association of Cincinnati, Inc. (1991).<P>

<BODY>

<H2>Solve It</H2>

Problem Solving and Basic Mathematics for Grade 6<P>

Develop and promote practical problem-solving strategies. Make learning mathematics interesting and illustrate how mathematics apply to life outside the classroom.<P>

Sixth-grade students learn to develop estimates, infer results, predict outcomes, and recognize unreasonable answers. Reasoning skills are emphasized over computation, because knowing how to approach a problem is as important as finding the correct answer.<P>

The <B>Solve It</B> video programs and teacher's guide help students formulate key questions, analyze and conceptualize problems, define problems, discover patterns and similarities, experiment, suggest explanations, transfer skills and strategies to new situations, and draw on background knowledge in applying mathematics.<P>

<B>Solve It</B> was developed through the resources of a consortium of state, provincial, and local education agencies, organized and managed by AIT, with financial assistance from the National Science Foundation (1987).<P>

<H2>Stepping Stones: Pathways to Early Development</H2>

Developmental Stages for Early Childhood with Special Needs for Grades 9-12, Adult, Preservice Educators, Professionals<P>

Illustrate how parents and child development professionals can assist infants and toddlers in acquiring developmental skills. Observe both developmentally delayed and typically developing children to demonstrate that special needs children and their nonhandicapped peers have more similarities than differences.<P>

Focus on the sequence of skill acquisition rather than a strict timetable for child development. <B>Stepping Stones: Pathways to Early Development</B> features parents and caregivers in home settings explaining or nurturing a particular skill. Present concrete examples of lower-level, middle-level, and complex skills that demonstrate a child's usual stages of development.<P>

<B>Stepping Stones</B> complies with Public Law 99-457.<P>

<B>Stepping Stones: Pathways to Early Development</B> was produced by Tennessee Technological University in conjunction with WCTE, Cookeville, Tennessee; developed as part of the Educational Television Intervention Programs project with a grant from the U.S. Department of Education (1986).<P>

<TITLE>Storylords</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Storylords</H2>

Reading Comprehension, and Computer Skills for Grades 1-4<P>

Help students become more independent readers and reinforce the idea that reading must make sense. Internalizing a set of good reading habits, or strategies will help readers actively monitor their own comprehension and provide them with techniques to use whenever a segment of text fails to make sense. Students are directed to stop reading when they don't understand, to try figuring out where problems lie and how to solve them.<P>

The <B>Storylords</B> video programs, computer components and teacher's guides introduce strategies for improving reading comprehension--modeling why they make sense, and when they might prove effective--and teach students how to apply these strategies when they read.<P>

<B>Storylords</B> is part of the Primary Grades Reading Comprehension project developed by Wisconsin Public Television Network and funded in part by the U.S. Department of Education. It was produced by Wisconsin Public Television Network through the facilities of UW-Stout Teleproduction Center (video programs) and Micro-Computers for Education, Inc. (computer software) (1986).<P>

<TITLE>Teaching with Television #340</TITLE>
<BODY>

<H2>Teaching with Television</H2>

Staff Development, Teaching and Professional Development<P>

<B>Teaching with Television</B> helps convince school personnel and parent teacher groups of instructional television's value in the classroom. The three programs -- one for elementary schools, one for secondary schools, and one for media coordinators and administrators -- are also useful for training and refresher sessions with utilization professionals.<P>

Two programs portray typical classroom situations encountered by teachers, such as unmotivated, inattentive, or noisy students. The programs then show the teachers' decisions to try instructional television, their experiments with the medium, and the results. Through the scenarios, the series demonstrates how instructional television serves students and teachers by bringing lessons to life. In the third part of the series, a librarian convinces a principal and fellow teachers of television's power as an instructional tool.<P>

The series helps administrators and teachers to realize the usefulness of instructional television and to recognize that the medium fosters the learning process, not the passive viewing habits often developed through commercial TV.<P>

<B>Teaching with Television</B> was produced by KDTN, Dallas/Ft. Worth/Denton, with funding support from Southwestern Bell Foundation (1991).<P>

<H3>Programs</H3>

1. <B>Elementary</B> - An elementary science class turns into chaos through the actions of noisy and unmotivated students. At the suggestion of the school's instructional media coordinator, the dejected teacher decides to try instructional television as a way of demonstrating basic physics principles. Through color, music, and motion, the TV lesson captures the students' interest. The teacher reinforces the lesson with experiments and discussion. Result: Better student understanding of physics and a more confident teacher. Stresses selecting appropriate videos, preparing the lesson, using videos in discussion, and following viewing with activities. (15:49)<P>

2. <B>Secondary</B> - A teacher's lectures on the civil rights movement fall flat, failing to stimulate his students. The school's media center provides a documentary instructional TV program to bring the rights movement to life. When students see exciting, actual footage of heroes and events, they pay attention to the lesson and begin to comprehend the significance of the civil rights movement. Stresses selecting appropriate videos, preparing the lesson, using videos in discussion, and following viewing with activities. (17:56)<P>

3. <B>Librarian/Principal</B> - A school's instructional media coordinator convinces a busy principal that television is a powerful tool for the classroom when used intelligently. Result: The principal asks the librarian to speak about instructional TV at a teachers' meeting. A teacher tries the medium and reports excellent results. (19:43)<P>
