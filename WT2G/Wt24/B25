<h4><center>EU <a NAME="knew">knew</a> on June 1 mad cow disease could infect sheep</center></h4>

Brussels, July 24 (Reuter) - The European Commission has been aware since
early June of research evidence that mad cow disease can infect sheep,
European Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said on Wednesday.<p>

Fischler, under fire for causing alarm by drawing attention to the findings
on Monday, said the researcyh had been carried out in Britain and was
available in print on June 1.

"This research is one project which was in fact carried out in the United
Kingdom, and it was reported in the scientific literature on June 1,"
Fischler told a news conference after an EU accord on farm prices.<p>

"It was made available to us a few days later and referred to our scientific
and veterinary experts who discussed the conclusions to be drawn," he said.<p>

Fischler said he hed received their recommendation that some tissues from
sheep should be banned from the food chain four or five days ago and had
then gone public as quickly as possible.

"It depends what you want.  If you want to take decisions on scientific
evidence then first you have to ask the scientists what their opinion is,"
he said.

Fischler said on Monday he would ask EU veterinary officials to consider
banning nervous tissues and spleen from sheep and goats from the food chain
in light of the research.<p>

The announcement drew an angry reaction from Spanish farm minister Loyola de
Palacio who accused fischler on Tuesday of sowing unjustified alarm through
"dangerous generalisations".

Other ministers including Irish Farm Minister Ivan Yates who chaired the EU
farm price talks, stressed sheep meat was still safe to eat.<p>

Fischler told Wednesday's news conference his proposals on sheep tissue
should be seen as a precautionary step only.

"It is important to take precautionary measures to deal with any risk that
might occur," he said.

Fischler said on Monday that mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), can infect sheep and announced plans for a Europe-wide
ban on brains, spinal cords and spleens from sheep, goats and deer for human
consumption.<p>


European supermarkets attempted on Tuesday to calm fears that fresh
scientific evidence linking sheep organs to Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD),
the fatal human brain-wasting disorder, would spark a second meat crisis.

<a HREF="#Hogg">Hogg tightens up sheep slaughter to calm BSE fear</a> 


BY MICHAEL HORNSBY

AND ALICE THOMSON<br>The Times: Britain:July 25 1996<p>

 STRICTER controls on the slaughter of sheep were announced yesterday by the Government in an attempt to reassure consumers that British lamb is safe.


Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, told MPs he was proposing that the heads of all sheep and goats should be removed at slaughter and destroyed, as is already the case with cattle.

<p>

The minister said that this was a precautionary measure to protect the public against a "theoretical risk" that BSE might have passed to sheep and goats and be present as a new form of scrapie, a brain disease previously regarded as no risk to human beings.

<p>

Mr Hogg later announced a new compensation package to help beef and dairy farmers affected by the BSE crisis.

<p>

He told the Commons that he did not intend to stop eating lamb cutlets because they were "a splendid product". The Prime Minister said he, too, would continue to eat lamb chops. Despite the reassurance, sheep prices were about 15 per cent down on last week's level at more than 40 livestock markets across the country.

<p>

Mr Hogg said that the Government was consulting European Union partners on whether other offal from sheep, goat and deer should be removed from the animal and human food chain. It was also commissioning more research into the possible transmission of BSE to sheep.

<p>

"These steps are being taken out of an abundance of caution. There is no direct threat to human health. This is intended to reassure people, not concern them," Mr Hogg said. "With the exception of the consumption of brains, there is absolutely no reason for anybody to change their eating habit."

<p>

More than 95 per cent of the 19 million sheep slaughtered each year already have their heads removed at the abattoir and sheep brain is not eaten in Britain except by some Muslim communities. Sheep's head soup is a traditional dish in the Outer Hebrides.

<p>

There are 84,000 goats in Britain, mainly reared for milk and hair, but a small market for goat meat has developed. Ruth Goodwin, of the British Goat Society, said: "Heads are not usually eaten. But we have just begun to get goat meat off the ground and this suggestion that BSE might get into goats is the last thing we need."

<p>

Tory backbenchers accused the Government of creating a "mad sheep" scare for no good reason. Euro-sceptic MPs blamed Brussels for "unnecessary meddling", saying that the French, as the main eaters of sheep brain, were the only ones with reason to worry. Mr Hogg was backed by Gavin Strang, his Labour shadow, who said it was right to "err on the side of caution".

<p>

Mr Hogg released a scientific paper by the Government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee. It said there was a possibility that BSE had got into the sheep flock, perhaps via contaminated meat and bone meal in feed, and that the "potential risk to human beings from sheep could no longer be regarded as being as low as in the past".

<p>

The committee said that if BSE had got into sheep, then brain and spinal cord could "pose a potential risk to human health if eaten". BSE could also be present in the lymph nodes, spleen and intestine. The warning was based on laboratory experiments in which one out of six sheep fed BSE tissue had developed the disease.

<p>

The new compensation package announced by Mr Hogg would include &#163;29 million to beef farmers who were forced to sell cattle between March 20 and June 30 at a loss because of the slump in demand and prices. The minister also proposed reimbursing farmers for 90 per cent of the cost of replacing cattle they lose under the accelerated cull of dairy cattle, to start in the late autumn.

<p>

* Ian Lang, President of the Board of Trade, confirmed yesterday that the Government had asked National Power and PowerGen to experiment with using cattle remains as a fuel in electricity generating stations.<hr>

<h3><center>Scrapie <a NAME="Resistant">Resistant</a> Sheep?</center></h3>
Listserve DVM<br>
25 July 96<p>


"I have concerns when the terms resistance and susceptible are used without
any real knowledge of the pathogenesis of scrapie.  We know that there is an
influence of genotype on incubation period, yet do we know how the disease
really is transmitted? Are there subclinical infections? Are the sheep with
long incubation periods or the "resistant" sheep able to become infected,
spread the agent contaminating premises (if premises can be
contaminated,...the Iceland question) and/or infecting other sheep, yet
never showing sign of disease?  <p>

I have seen well cared for old ewes break
with scrapie over the age of 7.  In a normal range or farming program these
ewes would have been long dead.  Were they resistant? No. Were they long
incubation period ewes? Yes.  So the terms classifying which sheep are
resistant and which sheep are susceptible are premature and maybe
misleading, given our lack of facts concerning this disease."

<h3><center>Fischler on the <a NAME="rack">rack</a> over lamb and BSE</center> </h3>

Daily Telegraph Wednesday July 24 1996<br> 
 By Toby Helm, EU Correspondent, and Charles Clover <p>

FRANZ Fischler, the European Unions agriculture commissioner, launched a
damage limitation exercise yesterday with his officials in Brussels
saying he had never meant to imply that farm sheep could get BSE. 

The confusion over his statements on Monday raised further questions
about Mr Fischlers judgement as the BSE scare threatened to spread from
beef to lamb products. Mr Fischler has been severely criticised by
British farmers and government ministers since the BSE crisis broke in
March. <p>

First, he was accused of over-reacting by imposing a worldwide ban on UK
exports of beef and beef products. 

He came under attack again after he said that he would happily eat
British beef himself. 

Fearing that comments he made in Brussels on Monday could cause the lamb
market to collapse, a spokesman for Mr Fischler said yesterday that
there was "no evidence whatsoever" that normal farm sheep could contract
BSE. <p>

Mr Fischler had told agriculture ministers less than 24 hours earlier
that "experimental evidence" had been found that sheep could contract
BSE. Concerns spread when he said the findings raised "several
questions". 

He asked: "In particular, can we be sure that a case of so-called
scrapie is not in fact BSE in sheep?" But Gerry Kiely, the spokesman,
said: "There is no evidence whatsoever that sheep can get BSE under farm
conditions." <p>

Mr Kiely said there was nothing to suggest that mad cow disease could be
picked up by sheep through consumption of normal feed 

He pointed out that Mr Fischler had been referring to cases in which EU
scientists had carried out controlled tests under laboratory conditions. 

During the tests, <strong>sheep had been fed highly-infected feed</strong> which caused
them to contract BSE in their spleens and nervous tissues. Only <strong>one in
six had contracted the disease</strong>. <p>

Mr Kiely said there was nothing to suggest that mad cow disease could be
picked up by sheep through consumption of normal feed, even if it was
infected at normal levels. He said: "You cannot compare this with even
the normally-infected meat and bone meal sheep may be fed on the farm." 

Neither was there any suggestion that eating lamb or mutton was unsafe.
Mr Fischler regularly ate lamb and would continue to do so. <p>

Mr Kiely added: "There is no evidence whatsoever that scrapie presents
any risk to human health and no evidence that, under farm conditions,
there is any connection between scrapie and BSE." 

On Monday, Mr Fischler said he would propose to a meeting of the EUs
Standing Veterinary Committee on August 1 that sheep and goat offal be
banned in consumer products and animal feed as a precaution. <p>

Speaking in Brussels yesterday, Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister
also slapped down suggestions of a risk from lamb. He said: "I believe
lamb throughout Europe is wholly safe." 

He said the possibility of transmitting BSE to sheep had been achieved
"with fairly considerable difficulty". The confusion yesterday over
sheep and BSE was reminiscent of the chaos that reigned when the
worldwide ban on UK beef and beef products was first announced by
Brussels at the end of March. <p>

First, Mr Fischler announced that the ban had been agreed. Then,
following protests from fellow Commissioners, including Sir Leon Brittan
and Neil Kinnock that they had not been consulted, he claimed he had not
announced it. The ban was confirmed the next day. <hr>


<h3><center>Britain plans  new rules for  meat <a NAME="houses">houses</a></center></h3>
7.25.96 ... Associated Press<p>

LONDON -- Seeking to head off another food scare, Britain has proposed new slaughterhouse rules to stop the heads of slaughtered sheep and goats from entering the food chain.

But Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg said the risk of mad cow disease, scientifically known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, being transmitted to sheep and goats was merely theoretical.

<p>

''These steps are being taken out of abundance of caution. There is no direct threat to human health,'' Hogg told Parliament on Wednesday. ''With the exception of the consumption of brains, there is absolutely no reason for anybody to change their eating habits.''

<p>

European Union Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler announced plans Monday to ban most sheep and goat offal, including spinal cords, from consumer products and animal feed as a precaution.

The proposal will be debated Aug. 1 at a meeting of EU veterinarians.

<p>

In Britain, the ban on sheep's brains would affect mainly the Muslim community, London's Daily Telegraph reported.


Butchers also said spinal cord may be contained in some generally popular cuts, such as saddle and neck, although typically it is removed before sale. Under the EU plan removal would be compulsory.

<h3><center><a NAME="Huge">Huge</a> Calf Slaughter planned to boost prices</center></h3>


Daily Telegraph Wednesday July 24 1996<br> 
 By Toby Helm, EU Correspondent, and Charles Clover <p>

Mr Fischler also proposed yesterday that <b>600,000 newborn calves be
slaughtered</b> as part of a plan to limit the amount of beef coming on to
the market. The plan to kill calves at the age of 10 days would cost
around 80 million pounds in additional compensation to farmers. <p>

The Commission is worried that the amount of beef on the market at a
time when prices are still falling across Europe could soon cause a beef
mountain approaching the record levels of 1993. 

Because of changes in world trade rules, surplus beef cannot be sold on
cheaply in foreign markets. <hr>

<h3><center>The way is <a NAME="paved">paved</a> for mad cows to fuel Britain</center></h3>
Daily Telegraph ... Wednesday July 24 1996<br>
by ALICE MILES Political Staff <p>

MINISTERS today paved the way for a radical new solution to the problem
of a growing mountain of cattle carcasses, cow power. The Government
announced details of the changes in the regulations required to allow
electricity power stations to use the bodies of slaughtered cattle as
fuel. At the same time, it revealed <b>changes to the clean air rules</b> which
would be needed to enable the scheme to go ahead.<p>

 A number of power
stations have already been given the go-ahead to test whether the plan
is workable. The initial results have encouraged ministers to take the
next step. The scheme, which will require approval by Parliament in the
autumn, uses the rendered down meat and bone of cattle slaughtered
following the mad cow scare. The numbers are already running at more
than 15,000 a week, too much for the existing incinerators to cope with.
Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg and President of the Board of Trade
Ian Lang were keen to avoid the prospect of thousands of carcasses being
buried. <p>

Todays announcement, in a written Commons reply from Mr Lang, makes
clear that it has still not been finally proved that cow fuel is
feasible on a large scale. The fact, however, that the necessary
arrangements are being put in place was a clear signal that the
Government believes it can work. The decision raises the prospect of
Britains toasters and ovens being fuelled by beef carcasses. <p>

It came as
Mr Hogg, on another front, announced measures to reassure the public
that lamb is safe to eat, following an EU warning over research showing
that BSE could theoretically be transmitted to sheep. In a statement to
the Commons, Mr Hogg said scientists on the Governments Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory Committee had advised that the brains of sheep
over six months old should no longer be eaten. Ministry of Agriculture
sources stressed this was a "super-precautionary measure". <p>

The announcement came as John Major said he would continue to eat lamb
chops. "I am very fond of lamb chops and I shall be continuing to eat
them, and I hope you will," the Prime Minister told GMTV. "This isn't
British sheep, the EU announcement covers sheep right across the
European Union and is purely a precautionary announcement." The European
Commission is set to order its own safety measures after EU Agriculture
Commissioner Franz Fischler published research findings and asked EU
scientific and veterinary experts to study proposals to remove the
brains and nervous tissue of sheep from the human food chain. Most
butchers already remove the spinal cord, brain and spleen in sheep. 
<hr><h3><center>BSE <a NAME="Voluntary">Voluntary</a> Ban Having Little Effect on Producers</center></h3>


Agri-View, 5/23/96  by Joel McNair<p>

From "Texans still mad about their beef," 4/4/96 (Reuters):
     "Rendering company Darling International Inc. of Irving, Texas, for
example, saw its stock price drop briefly but said business was unaffected
after cattlemen approved a voluntary ban on feed that includes processed
animal byproducts, a company spokesman said."
:<p>
     "Livestock and veterinary groups don't appear to be drawing many
Wisconsin volunteers to the public relations war against bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE).<p>

     "Dairy industry officials say they've seen almost no change in dairy cow
rations since the British 'mad cow' scare of late March and early April.
Renderers report that any initial losses in ruminant protein sales due to the
publicity have since been recaptured. Indeed, meat-and-bone meal sales
volumes appear to have risen in recent weeks as dairy farmers cope with
rising soymeal prices....<p>

     "'The voluntary ban is not particularly realistic,' says Randy Shaver, a
dairy scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison....
     "Sales were cut in half during the first week of the hullabaloo, says
Mike Langenhorst, executive vice-president for Anamax, in Green Bay. The
losses were particularly great in the company's dairy business. But
Langenhorst says Anamax regained half those losses the following week, and
local sales of dairy feed are actually a bit higher than before the crisis.<p>

     "'Basically, we're sold out,' adds Ken Cross, district manager for
National By-Products, Inc., Berlin. 'Sales don't seem to have been
affected.'...
     "Meat-and-bone meal sales have been aided by rising soymeal prices and
farmers' skepticism of the BSE issue....
     "Scott Gunderson, Extension dairy agent in Manitowoc County...says he
isn't aware of anyone leaving the animal proteins because of the voluntary
ban.
     "Says Gunderson, 'Until (the ban) becomes mandatory, I don't see that
changing.'<p>

     "Shaver largely agrees with that view. At the normal price relationship,
he says, a dairy farmer substituting soymeal for meat-and-bone meal in a
typical ration spends about a nickel more per cow per day. ... For a 100-cow
herd, the difference works out to about $1,500 a year. While Shaver notes
that this won't cause the dairyman to lose his farm, it's enough to make a
dairyman reluctant to abandon the animal feed -- especially since he knows
his neighbors are probably using it.<p>

     "Shaver thus does not expect any major changes in feeding practices
until farmers get some sort of edict from the federal government. 'A lot of
people are waiting for the shoe to drop from the FDA,' he notes."<p>
 
 
Finally, with respect to a previous, DIFFERENT voluntary ban announced on
feeding of rendered SHEEP to cattle in 1991, here's part of an article titled
"CVM Recommends Restricting Use of Rendered Adult Sheep," from "Food Chemical
News," 3/15/93:<p>

     "The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine has
recommended that a regulation be drafted to restrict the use of rendered
adult sheep proteins in cattle feed....<p>

     "The CVM recommendation was made at the conclusion of 24 sheep rendering
facilities conducted by FDA inspectors in November and December, 1992. The
survey found that six of 15 renderers processing adult sheep are selling
rendered protein by-products to cattle feed producers, despite a voluntary
ban on such practices by the National Renderers Association and the Animal
Protein Producers Institute. But, despite the findings, the survey concluded
that the risk of a BSE outbreak in the U.S. remains very small."<p>

 CVM's conclusion is, of course, no surprise to anyone who has followed this
issue for more than 15 minutes. I wish some committee would produce a list of
synonyms to be used in future news releases, so we can at least see some
linguistic variety. Instead of saying the risk is "very small," why not say
it's "eensie-weensie"? How about "teeny-weenie" or "itty-bitty"? These
adjectives are as meaningful as "very small" or "vanishingly small," and they
have the additional virtue that they don't mislead the public into thinking
they refer to something that has been scientifically measured.</blockquote><HR>

<h3><center>The hidden scandals of the beef brotherhood</center></h3>
Translated: French business monthly, CAPITAL<br>
 July 1996 edition<br>
by Philippe Eliakim<p>

It isn't just Mad Cow Disease.  It's hormones, false labelling, subsidy fraud, illegal imports etc...... dive behind the scenes and look into the worrying world of beef.

<p>When a case is serious, Mr. C, a breeder, uses a small slaughterhouse, not far from the banks of the river Garonne. "They don't worry you with any questions there" he explains.  Pumped full of antibiotics, balding, and heavy-lidded, the cow culled in the incident he describes has had a raging fever for 48 hours.  A sorry state of affairs!  "<b>Pus spurted out everywhere when its belly was slit open</b>, we had to hold our noses because of the rotten stench" remembers Mr. C.  We didn't throw it out though.  It was washed and sold to a supermarket in the South West.  Mr. C got FF 5000 for his four-legged infection and still smiles at the memory. "Meat, you know, it's not for the faint hearted...."

<p>Indeed not.  But no reason to panick because the vast majority of carcases leaving slaughter-houses are in good condition. This incident does however serve to show that beyond Mad Cow Disease, the meat "trade" is definitely not above all suspicion.  Far from it.  Illegal hormone trade, disregard for sanitary rules, tax payer grants, money laundering of illegally gotten gains, subsidy fraud, political party funding... all play a part in the industry.  The Ministry of Agriculture asserts reassuringly "a goodly majority are honest in the trade".  But what of those who are not?  It is true the beef sector was largely corrupt in the past, but in recent years there has been a clean up. Nonetheless abuse is still widespread, yet to avoid sparking panick no one wants to talk about it.  The Mad Cow crisis demonstrates how sensitive the subject is.

<p>We have moved on to the Aveyron, close to Rodez.  The speaker, let us call him Marcel, is a breeder of crate veal-calves.  <b>Not much fun, veal crates</b>. During its short life of 6 months the poor beast is confined to a cage so narrow it cannot even turn around. "Terroir Charolais" stuffed full of steroids.

<p>Marcel fattens 150 of this kind of captive.  They belong to a big landowner, an "integrator", who entrusts them, together will a little brown vial of liquid into Marcel's care.  "They're to swallow around one cubic centimetre a day" the caretaker explains.  "That's the dose".  As for the rest, my instructions are not to get caught, to hide the bottle in the house, never in the stable and to keep my mouth shut.

<p><strong>What hormones are in the vial anyway</strong>? Clembuterol? a substance known to cause problems in humans. Dexamethosone? a corticosteroid which swells animal tissue so that when cooked, shrinks down to half its size.  Or could it be the fearsome DES, whose carcinogenic effect has long been known.  Perhaps it's all three in a cocktail?  Marcel hasn't a clue. "All I know is it's illegal and it fattens up the animals".

<p>Now our witness is far from being a marginal outsider.  There's many a Marcel to be found in France. "Without the extra weight (and therefore the extra profit) you get thanks to the hormones, they wouldn't survive" confirms a veterinarian.  And so it is that the Rodez slaughterhouse, like so many others, observes thousands of carcases go by for market, stuffed to the hilt with hormones, and it doesn't turn a hair.  Naturally enough, such places view the "trade" with indulgence.  <b>"There's too much at steak" explains a director</b> of the Confederation paysanne, second biggest agriculture union in France.

<p>Take this spectacular example.  <strong>In 1994 a bunch of wordly-wise inspectors discovered that beef marked "Terroir Charolais" one of France's most prestigious labels were gorged full of anabolics. </strong>"If the public had found out, years of efforts would have been ruined.  Instructions were given to drop the matter" recalls an government official from the Ministry of Finance. The struggle for probity seems a touch more earnest today.... Mad Cow oblige...... An "integrator" from Villefranche-de Rouergue got caught red-handed a few weeks ago. He faces a probable spell in gaol.  Others scandals are before the courts as of this writing.  But the clean-up will take time.

<p><strong>"You can still buy hormones at any livestock market"</strong> splutters Gilbert Mouthon, professor at the veterinary school of Maison Alfort.  "For a while the sales' reps touted discreet ensignia pinned to their jacket lapels." says Pascal Mainsant an Inra meat specialist (Institut national de recherche agronomique).  This mafia-owned network operates just like the drugs trade. Secret laboratories in Italy and Belgium, smugglers, dealers, webs of operators and informants and inevitably guns in belts.  A belgian veterinary inspector who got too close too close for comfort was assasinated in February last year.  Only a couple of months ago in May one of his colleagues suspected of involvement hanged himself.

<p>But let's put the hormones and the bellies full of pus behind us.  The very famous Viande Bovine Francaise (French Beef Meat) harbours other apetizing residues within its tissue. Antibiotics in particular, not only do the animals guzzle them down but it's legal.  Though increasingly specialists view the practice askance.  Nearly all animal feeds contain avoparcine in homeopathic doses to stimulate livestock growth. <b>"Strains of bacteria become anti-biotic resistant as a result"</b> explains Professor Nouet of the Piti» SalpetriÀre hospital. And allergic consumers are not even taken into account.  "We will have to curb these practices one day" admits Ren» Laporte, president of the federation of livestock traders, a group not well-known for self criticism.

<p>Likewise, one day, sanitary prevention methods will have to be applied.  In theory nothing should escape veterinarians.  Each and every head of beef has identification (see story below). Once a year the animal is checked for <strong>bruxellosis and leucosis, dangerous sicknesses to man.</strong> If a test is positive.....Off with its head! and just as for Mad Cow Disease the whole herd gets the chop. However, Vets can be forced to sign health certificates.

<p>The rule is unbending, its application remarkably pliable.   Thus it was that a breeder from the Limousin, with two cows which came down with bruxellosis saved the rest of his herd. "I just shouted alot, and in the end things worked out".   And a representative from the Confederation paysanne confirms this saying "You can negotiate anything."  Does it have to be spelled out? In the rural areas breeders and "horse traders" weigh heavily in the electoral system, and pressures from the trade can work wonders.  A few months ago the veterinarians' union (control body for France's herd) lashed out in revolt, their letter to the Minister of Agriculture was vitriolic, it said the orgnisation was fed up to the back teeth at having to sign virtual health certificates never setting eyes on the animals concerned.

<p>And now we're off to Rungis. Before dissappearing down Parisian digestive tracts, hundreds of carcasses hang suspended by the ankle waiting for 3 am and beyond when buyers will drift in.  Naturally, there is some good, even some excellent flesh to be found. And then there is some less appetizing...... <strong>meat which has outlived its sell-by date</strong>. "We all have stuff at the back of our refrigerators which we would'nt show the vets" admits one manager.  If it's frozen, no problems we just discreetly change the date and you give yourself an extra year's leeway.  But if the goods are 'fresh', no messing, you need to get rid of it fast and on the quiet.  "Normally we'd sell it to moslem butchers, or to large scale caterers" explains a meat worker.  "You know, staff canteens, hospitals.  They know the stuff will be cooked up the same day, so there's hardly any risk."

<p>Alternatively :<strong> if the meat is really off the dealers manage to flog it overseas.</strong> "We're not daft." Work it out right and a whole consignment of virtually rotten meat can earn more than the price of the choisest filet. Jacques, owner of one of the many import-export outfits on the market knows this better than anyone.  You get a amenable vet to stamp the meat, you take out rock solid insurance and you pack 'em off to Africa" he confides.  On arrival at customs the customer obviously  refuses the merchandise, but well, the insurance'll pay up no problems, 80% of the value of the stock.  If necessary Jacques gets one of the three well known corrupt brokers in on the deal.  Finally you send the stuff off to an animal food factory in Switzerland for about 15% of the price. Then just apply for your EU export subsidy which can be as high as 80% of the normal value.

<p>Nothing unusual about it, in the butchers' trade it is very easy to milk a carcase for profit.  It is essential to know that <strong>every year Brussels allocates billions of francs to support prices and prop up the sector</strong>. Thanks to a positive jungle of premiums, fiddling on a formidable scale has developed.  Lets not stop even stop to consider small scale cheating... manipulating, registering non-existant herds (a quite common practice in Corsica) cashing in on milk quota premiums; fixing calves' birthdates so as to pocket the bull beef premium (which only applies to males over 8 months) and all the other trivia which contribute towards a breeder's cash-flow and ensure he doesn't go without at the end of the month!  Export subsidy fraud on goods sold to non EU countries ("restits" as the system is called by those in the know) and surplus stocks (accumulated when for example over-production looms, which causes the EU to buy the surplus carcases and stores them in gigantic refrigerators) are of quite a different proportions. The can involve hundreds of millions of francs annually.  Phantom cargos, consignments reimported into the Community, substitution of goods (the rate of subsidies varies according to the cuts).....  Imagination demonstrated by crooks practising these methods appears to be unbounded.

<p>"There are those who replace filet with cheap cuts.  I prefer to slip fat into the carcases to gain weight" explains a practitioner.  Customs blocked a consignment of Italian meat which was made up entirely of wood chippings.  The price for uncovering such a trick? <strong>A CGT (union) representative in a meat paring outfit got sliced up in pieces with a meat chopper.</strong>  It happened a couple of years back.  The perpetrators were acting under management instructions!

<p>Such crimes were and remain common occurences.  "All the big firms in the business resort to such measures" insists a customs officer.  They do so without taking the slightest risk, as their shady practices are generally overlooked.  Why such indulgence?  "First, because other countries are doing likewise.  But also because governments have always viewed pillaging subsidies as a way of refurbishing business's coffers" explains a source at home amongst such circumstances from the Ministry of Agriculture. 

<p>There is another explanation.  For years such fraud went on with the connivance of the quasi-governmental  body dispensing the subsidies (Ofival), which was channelling party political funds, on the right as well as the left. Small fortunes were involved. <strong>"The companies wanting export quotas, or intervention stocks had to deposit a share of their subsidies"</strong> a high ranking official from the Ministry of Finance (Bercy) explains adding  "When ever such cases came to light we were under instructions to file it".    

<p>The litany of mischief in the meat trade goes on, there is labelling fraud (Rouergue veal from Poland!), there are endless lists of petty fiddles going on in the sector, (some slaughterhouses charge cheat clients by weighing in the hook as well as the meat!)  More worrying still is the appeareance of black sheep poping up in big establishments where one would not expect such practices.

<p>A few months ago, a certain well known hypermarket chain in the Paris area was selling French lamb at cut price rates.  It wasn't French lamb at all; it was old New Zealand mutton which had in its life served for years to produce sheep milk. The rate for such quality products are rock bottom.  The source to have revealed this incident knew well what he was talking about.  He it was who supplied the goods.  He too who, upon request from the hypermarket, stuck the false labels on all the packaged portions.  <b>The going rate for such counterfeit labour, 1 frank per kilo.</b>

<p>From stable to sales display, fraude and sanitary negligence pollutes the profession:

<p>Hormones: Some breeders continue to gorge their animals with these though it is totally ilegal.

<p>Antibiotics: Present in all animal feed.  Consequences to human health are little known

<p>European subsidies: To become elegible farmers falsify calf birth date

<p>False certificates: Crooked dealers procure and sell livestock without identification of origin

<p>Money laundering: A substantial part of transactions are in cash

<p>Health slip ups: Some crooked dealers specialise in passing off sick animals

<p>European subsidies: Illegal dealing valued to several hundred of millions of French Francs per year.

<p>Value Added Tax fraud: At the Italian border exporters "forget" to pay their taxes

<p>Clandestine imports: Hundreds of illegal live animals and carcases each month

<p>Shady health inspections: Some outfits let sick animals through

<p>Weighing sharp practices: Fat removed from animal carcases thereby reducing weight and sale value 

<p>False stamps: Value of sold carcases overvalued in the EU

<p>Work conditions: Standing in refrigerated temperatures from 5 in the morning, meat parers earn barely more than the basic minimum wage

<p>Trade in meat cuts: Meat destined for Public EU Storage (public intervention) are switched for worthless cuts

<p>Trade Union supression: Widespread in factories

<p>Illegal labour: At Rungis, operators and dealers commonly resort to workers not in possession of legal papers

<p>Relabelling: Some traders disguise the orgin of meat

<p>Under-the-counter-sales: Poor quality meat, beyond sell-by date is passed off by side-stepping veterinary inspection

<p>False labels: The fraud squad constantly bringing to light such cases

<p>False claims to customers: Some retailers pass off poor quality cuts for quality meat

<p>Abusive use of label "Viande Bovine Fran¡aise:" Butchers and supermarkets sometimes slap these on imported meat 

<p><b>At Clisson, dealers made police fraud-squad retreat:</b> <p>

<p>Fifty were called in on the job.  Bikers, drivers, weapons.  An aircraft was on hand for 

<p>scouting.  And to crown it all an whole brigade transported by helicopter.  It was in July 1995, the authorities gave it their everything they had.  The target? Clisson's livestock market in the Nantes region, one of the biggest in France.  And what were the customs and health inspectors after?  Everthing and nothing. They were hoping to catch illegal dealers.  Animals without health certificates.  Deals done without invoices.  "For a whole day we blocked all roads leading to the town, every truck coming in and leaving was searched", a customs officer recalls.  By nightfall the police besieged the market. A helicopter touched down on the precinct.  Inspectors leaped out of  police vehicles.  About twelve trucks had not dared to try to leave the town and were still waiting at the market to make their escape.  They were probably all  doing illegal trade.  Caught red handed?  Not really. "They closed ranks en masse and got to threatening"

<p>Then what? Then the customs police and veterinary inspectors got back into their cars and helicopters and left. The crooked dealing truckers calmly climbed into their trucks and took to the road.

<p><b>Is French beef meat ["Viande bovine francaise"]always French?</b>

<p>Is the new French meat label (VF), popping up in every  shop windows and focusing huge advertising budgets really any guarantee to the consumer?  If the head of the fraud squad (it picks up relatively few illegal cases) and the professional sector is to be believed yes it is. "Our control system is exemplary" the latter stress.  On closer inspection however some weakness in the system come to light.

<p>First stage : Animals born in France are ear-tagged and numbered with identification which is impossible to counterfeit. "It takes approximately 4 seconds to remove", smiles a vet.  And another four to replace it with another. <b>"In 1995, I imported and naturalised a hundred head of English veal"</b> confesses a breeder from the Cantal.  Stories like this abound in the countryside. 

<p>Second stage : Every head of cattle has ID papers (nicknamed "Daub") together with health documents.  Without this it impossible to guarantee an animal's place of origin.  In the Cher region at Sancoins, the going rate for a false "Daub" is between 10 and 12 FF.  Inspectors checking merchandise often come across rather exotic identification papers.  "We sometimes come across papers belonging to animals which have long since died" discloses a veterinary inspector.  Such techniques enable imported animals to be covered.  Each week cattle consignments from Poland or Rotterdam enter France illegally.  Spanish herds cross the Pyrennean mountain range to get into the country illegally.  "Everybody knows some of these beasts will naturalised" moans a director of a meat paring firm.  But underhand dealing doesn't stop at live animals.  Last year inspectors burst into a warehouse in the North of France. Workers were in the middle of putting false labels on the carcasses......

<p>Third stage : the shop display.  Theoretically butchers and supermarkets only use theVF label when they can guarantee the origin of the meat.  But in fact such indicators are used pretty liberally. "I could point to several butchers and restaurateurs in town who lie about the French origin of their meat" expostulates a slaughterhouse director for a northern city. "A retailer can buy half a French carcase and another half Polish then sell the lot under the VF ticket!" an expert confirms.  The Ministry of Agriculture know this full well.  In May he had to remind      some supermarkets of the real use intended for such labels.... "In the few weeks allocated it was not possible, in such a complex sector, to put an effective guarantee system in place" admits a wholesaler.  So the label does not give a 100% guaranty.  But it will have contributed to cleaning the business.

<p><strong>Working conditions --Strenuous shifts, difficult working hours, slipping salaries:</strong>

<p>With a targetted gesture the worker pierces the piece of beef, extracts a bone and tosses it into a metal gutter all this is done with the grace of an experienced basket ball player.  We are in a meat paring workshop part of the Reims Bigard slaughterhouse.  A pretty common trade in the area.  Here 300 beef cattle are transformed into steak.  It is just after twelve.  For almost seven hours, standing in this freezing hall (2C) surrounded by screaming of electric saws, our labourer debones endless slabs of carcas in this way.  No time for slacking though, there is a pace to keep up (one carcas every 3 minutes 45).  The boss is Patrice Monguillon, stop-watch in hand, he organises the division, the rules and the pace of the labour.  "The good ones keep up easily, the others have to make that much more effort" he explains.  Our deboner, paid a touch above the natioanal minimum wage, doesn't complain much.  In the adjoining hall a colleague is gutting the warm freshly slaughtered cattle.  There is that smell.  Bigard is no exception "the meat industry does unite among the toughest conditions" admits Pascal Fournet, the CGT agrifood Union representative adding "Work accidents are commonplace, hours tough and practices archaic"  At the Mur-de Bretagne slaughterhouse, a union delegate got the sack the same day he was nominated.  At Gad, the management drove a truck through picketing workers. At Quimperl» the Bigard outfit got fined for banning workers from stopping work to urinate.

French gourmands face lean times 
The Times: Britain: July 24 1996<BR>
BY BEN MACINTYRE<P>

 FRENCH butchers reported a sharp drop in the price of lamb yesterday after European officials announced plans to ban certain offal from sheep, goat and deer.


Three weeks ago, the French Government announced a ban on "all sales of the central nervous system of ruminants", including brains and spinal columns of cows, sheep and goats, after recommendations from scientists. The spleen, thymus (used in <I>ris de veau</I> or sweetbreads), intestines and tonsils are also banned from human consumption if the animal was born before July 1991.

<P>

The government bans deprived France of yet more culinary delicacies and added to the meat industry's economic nightmare. The Government urged that its precautionary measures be extended throughout the EU and the Agriculture Ministry yesterday commended the attitude of Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner.

<P>

<I>Le Monde</I> reported yester day that at Rungis food market outside Paris the price of lamb, which had climbed during the initial BSE crisis, had dropped by a third in the past few weeks.

<P>

With <I>cervelle d'agneau</I> (lamb's brains) joining the beloved national dish of <I>t&ecirc;te de veau</I> (calf's head) on the banned list, French gourmands with exotic tastes are facing increasingly lean times.

<P>

"Goats and sheep gone to pot," declared a headline in <I>France-Soir </I> yesterday. "Is this the end of roast kid?" The newspaper noted that recipes for sheep and goat offal can be found in any book of traditional French cuisine, adding: "The haggis, celebrated but hard to find in France, can also perhaps be considered a dish in danger &#173; even when one is tipsy from the tastiest whiskies."

<P>

"If in doubt, abstain," declared <I>France-Soir,</I> advice that could hardly be further removed from French gastronomic tradition and an indication of the deep effects of "mad cow" disease.

BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT, AND DIANA THORP <br>
 July 24 1996 .. The Times<p>
<i>Scare over sheep spines may mean ban on historic British speciality </i>:<p>

                THE Barnsley chop, one of Britain's most celebrated national dishes, may disappear from
                menus if the European Union's proposed ban on sheep offal goes ahead. 

                The inclusion of the spinal cord in the ban would affect traditional cuts which include the
                backbone, such as saddle of lamb, the Barnsley chop and rosettes, in all of which the spinal
                cord is left in place. <p>

                But Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said in Brussels yesterday that any ban on the
                spinal cord was likely to apply only to sheep over 12 months old. 

                Most British lambs are slaughtered at less than a year. None of the proposed restrictions
                would apply to lambs under six months old. <p>

                The Asda supermarket chain welcomed the proposed measures. "All our lamb is new-season
                and under six months old, so I understand it would not come under these regulations," a
                spokesman said. Asda and Marks & Spencer said that spinal cord was already removed from
                their lamb. 

                Diane McCrea, of the Consumers' Association, urged consumers to await the announcement
                of new government guidelines. "Lots of people have been turning to lamb from beef, but
                they should not panic and should wait to see what the recommendations are." <p>

                The proposed restrictions on the sale of sheep's brain and spleen should have little effect on
                sales in Britain, as there is little or no market for such items. Spleen is not eaten and
                brain has a tiny market, mostly among some Muslim communities, although the Ministry of
                Agriculture, Food and Fisheries urged people in the Outer Hebrides to stop making their
                traditional dish of sheep's head soup. <p>

                The broth, which involves boiling the sheep's head, has been prepared as a delicacy for
                centuries in the Western Isles and the recipe occurs in many local cookbooks. However,
                there have been no recorded cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the Outer Hebrides in the
                wake of the current BSE scare. <p>

                A spokesman from the Meat and Livestock Association said that 95 per cent of sheep's heads
                were destroyed in Britain because they had little economic value. All other cuts of lamb,
                including mince, haggis, shoulder, leg, breast and rack, would not be affected by such a ban.

                He said that few consumers today cooked the neck rings, usually used for stewing, or the
                saddle of lamb, which is rarely sold in shops and is used mainly by caterers for roasting. <p>

                The main casualty of a ban would be the double loin chop, or Barnsley chop. Richard North,
                of the Quality Meats Association, said that a ban on spinal cord would put an end to the
                Yorkshire speciality which is actually two chops joined by a piece of backbone. "It's the
                customers' favourite chop, and it's certainly my favourite," Dr North said. "But if the ban
                comes into operation, that'll be it; it'll go out the window." <p>

                Nick Pound, chef and joint owner of the Barnsley restaurant Armstrongs, said the loss of
                the Barnsley chop would mean the end of one of the country's few regional dishes and would
                be akin to the loss of the Cumberland sausage or Banbury cake. "It was named after the
                Prince Regent ate it at the King's Hotel in Barnsley and it has been popular ever since." 

                But he added that the dangers of contracting disease from spinal cord would be minimal, as a
                consumer would have to break down the spine of the chop to get to the spinal cord. <p>

                Moyra Fraser, cooking editor of Good Housekeeping, did not think a ban would cause panic.
                "Not many people in Britain eat lamb brains and, as long as chops have been well butchered
                and had the spinal column fully removed, there should be no cause for concern." <p>
<h3><center><a NAME="Historic">Historic</a> Cattle Market Succumbs</center></h3>

        A 136-year-old cattle market closed yesterday, the latest victim of the BSE crisis.
                Barry Hawkins, a livestock auctioneer, sold his last cattle from the market in King's Lynn,
                Norfolk, which had been established by his great-grandfather in 1860. 

                Mr Hawkins, 50, has seen the number of cows passing through his market fall from 80 to
                20 a day. "BSE has closed us down," he said. "It was a cock-up by the Government. <p>


                "The number of cattle we were selling dropped and so have the prices, by 30 per cent.
                There was no way we could continue. It has been a very hard decision." 

                Livestock breeders will now have to take their cattle to market in Norwich and Bury St
                Edmunds. <hr>

               <h3><center>New Zealand, <a NAME="Australia">Australia</a> scramble to squelch rumors</center></h3>
Australian officials said that the country had diligent systems in place to prevent scrapie,
                and <strong>allegations that Australian sheep were infected were ludicrous</strong>. 
______________

The New Zealand Government said yesterday that it was seeking more detail on European
                scientific evidence that BSE could be passed to sheep through feed derived from infected
                cattle remains, but officials doubted whether the link was new. 

                An Agriculture Ministry spokesman said: "We're not familiar with that research or the
                methodology used. It's always been known that scrapie and BSE are similar."<p>
 

               New Zealand has about 50 million sheep and exports more than 90 per cent of the lamb it
                processes each year, with Britain providing the largest market. It has an annual quota of
                225,000 tonnes for lamb, mutton and goat exports to the EU. <p>

                Stuart McDermott, manager of agricultural security at the ministry, said: "Excuse me if
                I'm underwhelmed, but the prevailing view is that BSE is scrapie that came from sheep into
                cattle through the practice of feeding cattle on meat and bone meal. I really don't see what is
                new." 

                He added that New Zealand had a <b>voluntary ban</b> on the feeding of meat and bone meal to
                ruminants.

                       July 24 1996       ... London Times ...                                          BY MICHAEL HORNSBY <p>

                 BRITAIN'S 90,000 sheep farmers were bracing themselves yesterday for a slump in
                 consumer demand after the disclosure that some sheep products are to be banned because of
                 fears that they may be infected with "mad cow" disease. 

                 Up to now the sheep industry, which earns farmers some £1.2 billion a year in domestic
                 sales and a further £280 million in exports, has been one of the beneficiaries of the beef
                 crisis as consumers have switched to other meats. <p>

                 The first signs of panic were reflected yesterday in falls of up to 20 per cent in sheep
                 prices at livestock markets, which knocked up to £8 off the price of a lamb. 

                 Prices fell to about 95p a kg compared with about 115p this time last week, wiping out
                 much of the gains lamb prices have made since the BSE crisis broke in March. Farmers
                 were hoping yesterday that consumers would not panic and would see the ban as a purely
                 precautionary measure against a theoretical risk. <p>

                 Ieuan Lewis, who keeps 500 breeding ewes near Llangollen, North Wales, said: "I hope
                 people are not going to overreact. Even if there is only a theoretical risk of spongiform
                 encephalopathy getting into sheep, I hope they will accept that it is better to be upfront and
                 take the necessary precautions." 

                 He added: "Recently our lamb prices have greatly improved on the back of the fall in the
                 beef trade. Last week I sold 51 lambs for 117p a kilogram. This time last year I was getting
                 less than 100p." <p>

                 The higher income from his sheep has helped to offset the loss Mr Lewis has been suffering
                 on his beef cattle. Cattle prices are about £100 an animal lower than a year ago and Mr
                 Lewis is running up big feed bills as he keeps cattle back on his farm in hope of market
                 improvement. 

                 Colin Maclean, director-general of the Meat and Livestock Commission, said: "About 95 per
                 cent of sheep carcasses already have their head removed at the abattoir and the spleen is not
                 used. So these measures should have virtually no impact on our industry. <p>

                 "Although there is no evidence of spongiform encephalopathy in sheep, and although scrapie
                 has been around in sheep for 250 years and never been found to present any hazard to
                 humans, it is always better to err on the side of caution." 

                 But Anthony Gibson, the National Farmers' Union's regional director for southwest England,
                 criticised Franz Fischler, the European Agriculture Commissioner, for proposing the ban.
                 "It is completely unjustified," he said. "Scrapie has been studied for centuries and there is
                 absolutely no evidence of any link to BSE." <p>

                 Marks & Spencer said there had been no change in the price of lamb since the BSE scare.
                 However, it has introduced a lamb special this week which has reduced the prices. 

                 Safeway said demand increased significantly after the BSE scare, but had now decreased and
                 stabilised at a level still higher than before BSE. <p>

                 Organic lamb has decreased in price since the BSE scare. Tim Finney, an organic meat
                 wholesaler from Swindon Butcher, said the price of lamb had gone down from £3.30 per kg
                 to £2.70. "If the lamb price collapses we will ignore it. It might even increase our price
                 because people appreciate we farm in a completely different way." <p>

<h3><center> <a NAME="Infected">Infected</a> feed may lead to new strain of scrapie</center></h3>
    July 24 1996 .. London Times .... Michael Hornsby<p>

                 THE move to ban certain lamb and goat products follows research showing that "mad cow"
                 disease could be transmitted artificially to sheep in laboratory tests). 

                 Scientists disagree about the significance of the finding, but accept that it may be better to
                 err on the side of caution in removing even the most theoretical health threat from eating
                 lamb. <p>

                 Scrapie Ç spongiform encephalopathy in sheep Ç has not hitherto caused humans any
                 apparent harm. The brain condition Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease affects one in a million
                 people, even in countries with no scrapie. 

                 What is worring scientists is that sheep might have acquired a new strain of scrapie from
                 eating meat and bone meal derived from cattle remains infected with BSE, reversing the
                 process by which cattle are thought to have contracted the disease. <p>

                 John Bourne, director of the Institute of Animal Health at Compton, Berkshire, said: "If
                 BSE has got into sheep, we cannot be absolutely 100 per cent sure that it will behave
                 identically to scrapie and pose no risk to humans." <p>

                 Research by the institute in 1993 found that BSE could be transmitted to sheep by feeding
                 them infected brain tissue from cattle or by injecting it into their brains. Infectivity was
                 detected in the brains and spleen. More recent work by the institute, published last month
                 in The Veterinary Record, discovered that spleen tissue from these artificially infected
                 sheep produce a pattern of disease when injected into laboratory mice that is similar to that
                 caused by BSE material from cattle. <p>

                 "It has to be emphasised that we have been unable so far to detect any sign of a new strain of
                 scrapie that might indicate that BSE has got into sheep in the field," Professor Bourne said.
                 "But it may be that we have not been looking hard enough." <p>

                 Scientists have transmitted BSE orally to goats and mice as well as to sheep. Pigs have been
                 infected, but only by injection into the brain. Chickens are resistant to infection either
                 orally or by inoculation. The Government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee
                 (SEAC) is recommending that sheep brain and spleen be excluded from the human food
                 chain. <p>

                 In practice, no lamb spleen is eaten and 95 per cent of carcasses have their heads removed
                 at the abattoir. In Britain, only some Muslims are thought to eat sheep's brains. Scientists
                 see no danger in muscle meat, or in liver and kidney. <p>

                 Some European scientists want spinal cord covered by the ban as well, at any rate in sheep
                 older than 12 months, though their British colleagues are not entirely convinced. Such a
                 ban could affect some traditional cuts in which the backbone remains attached. <p>

                 Britain has banned feeding meat and bone meal to sheep since July 1988. Although farmers
                 used to give breeding ewes meat and bone meal as a protein supplement, most lambs are fed
                 almost entirely on grass. Exposure to infected feed would thus have been much less than in
                 cattle. <p>


                 Francis Anthony, past president of the British Veterinary Association, said: "This seems to
                 be carrying the precautionary principle to ridiculous lengths. Sheep deliberately infected
                 with BSE do not itch and rub themselves against fence posts, as classical cases of scrapie. If
                 sheep were suffering from a new kind of scrapie, we would have noticed."

<center><h3>Europe tries to <a NAME="avert">avert</a> panic on 'mad sheep'</h3></center>

BY CHARLES BREMNER AND MICHAEL HORNSBY<br>
The Times: Britain:July 24 1996<p>

EUROPEAN officials were trying to smother a "mad sheep" crisis yesterday as livestock markets showed the first signs of panic and prices fell by up to 20 per cent.


With ministers insisting that sheep were most unlikely to contract BSE, the Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler came under attack for kindling the latest flare-up in the "mad cow" saga.

<p>

Loyola de Palacio, the Spanish Farm Minister, said that Herr Fischler's statement calling for a ban on some sheep and goat offal had achieved the opposite of his intention of reassuring consumers. "This has provoked unjustified and extremely serious fears," she said. And Ivan Yates, the Irish minister, appealed for a sense of proportion. "It is important to learn the lessons of the last six months with BSE. It is quite easy to strike a match and cause a forest fire with regard to BSE. It is more difficult to put it out."

<p>

The Commission decided to call for a ban on the use of brain, spinal cord and spleen from goats and sheep after scientists in France and Scotland found that some sheep contracted BSE after being fed infected brain tissue from cattle. The French researchers found that half a gramme of infected tissue was enough to transmit the disease in some cases. But there is no evidence that sheep on farms had ever been infected.

<p>

Brussels is acting partly under pressure from the French Government, whose advisers suspect that BSE is being under-reported and could be affecting a range of animals, including cats and mink. France has already banned consumption of brain tissue and has imposed strict rules on the production of animal-based feed.


Now the Commission wants to extend some of the restrictions across the EU, not so much to protect humans as to remove the risk of other animals contracting BSE.


Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, is expected to tell MPs today that Britain is willing to go along with that and yesterday he said there was no need for a lamb crisis "if people are sensible". The measures proposed would exclude from the food chain parts of the animal that were not eaten anyway. "I believe that lamb throughout Europe is wholly safe," he said.

<p>

The only cuts likely to be affected by a ban would be saddle of lamb, which includes the backbone, the Barnsley chop, which has a section of spine at its centre, and rosette of lamb from the neck. But even these could continue to be produced as usual, since removal of the spinal cord was likely to be required only if the animal was more than a year old &#173; and most lambs are slaughtered before that age.

Some meat industry and farmers' leaders agreed that the proposed ban was prudent, but even so, lamb prices at British markets fell from &#163;1.15 per kg last week to 95p.

<h3><center>New <a NAME="link">link</a> between mad cow disease and sheep</center></h3>

Nando.net aand Associated Press July 24, 1996<p>
LONDON  -- Findings that mad cow disease may be transmitted from cows to other animals are expected to prompt Britain to ban parts of sheep and goat offal from the human food chain.<p>


   Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg will announce the ban on the use of sheep and goat brains, spinal cords and spleens in the human food chain later this week, Independent Television News reported.

   Experiments at the Institute of Animal Health in Edinburgh showed that sheep and goats could catch bovine spongiform encephalopathy, known as mad cow disease.<p>

   European Union Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler announced plans Monday to introduce a similar ban Europe-wide amid fears of a link between sheep and BSE.

   EU farm ministers meeting in Brussels said the plan was only precautionary, designed to shore up consumer confidence in meat.

   Europe's meat crisis was sparked on March 20 when the British government reported an apparent link between mad cow disease, a fatal illness that destroys the brains of cattle, and its human equivalent, Creutzfeld Jakob Disease.

   About 10 people in Britain have died of the disease. One man died of it in France this year.<p>

   Scrapie, a disease similar to BSE, has been common in sheep for hundreds of years without harm to human health. The experiments carried out in Scotland showed that sheep who were fed or infected with BSE material caught BSE rather than than the more harmless scrapie. British meat industry spokesmen demanded more research before action was taken.<hr>



  
<h3><center>Scrapie <a NAME="Eradication">Eradication</a> Attempts</center></h3>

Listserve Item 24 July 1996<p>

What experiments of Foster et al do show is that experimentally, by
inoculation or orally, it is possible to infect sheep with BSE and it
appears as BSE, The strain-typing results show clearly that the
encephalopathy is BSE and _not_ scrapie and that the two are _not_ the
same.<p>

 
Turning to Robert's enquiry, compared with the very considerable
amount of public  and media comment on BSE in recent years, there has
been little public comment in the media -- or therefore among the
public -- about scrapie [either before 1987 or since] because scrapie
has never been perceived by the UK media, or the public or the
authorities or scientists as being a food safety issue.<p>
 
 It was, and is, an important issue of agricultural management and
economics, and over the years a great deal of research has been done
on scrapie, particularly in the UK Institute for Animal Health
[summaries of recent research may be accessed on their Web site at
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/institut/public/reports/1995/3wtse.htm>]<p>
 
Scrapie being endemic in the UK, its eradication is extremely
difficult, the more so because scrapie is subject to vertical and
horizontal transmission.  I understand that it was the latter
characteristics that defeated an attempted regulatory program in USA
in the 1950s (ref. Dr Randall Cutlip, Respiratory and Neurological
Disease Research Unit, Agricultural Research Service, USDA, answering
a question on scrapie at the IFT Special Forum on BSE, New Orleans, 23
June 1996).<p>
 
The approach to eradication is along the lines of trying to identify
genetic variation(s)  among sheep that are scrapie-resistant, and
selective use of rams that carry that trait, plus prudent importation
and husbandry.. If it can be done it will be a lengthy process,
probably a decade or more.<p>
 
An additional complication is that there appear to be different
strains of scrapie, influenced not only by the PrP sequence but by
other as yet unknown factors.<p>
 
Although the US experiments, at Ames, Iowa and Mission, Texas
inoculating cattle with scrapie and producing neurological disease
which, however, did not resemble BSE, may appear to undermine the
hypothesis that scrapie was the agent in the incriminated meal and
bonemeal that originally started the UK BSE epidemic, it may well be
that the original scrapie culprit was a particular scrapie strain not
used in the US experiments. I doubt if we shall ever know the truth or
otherwise of that hypothesis for certain, or at least until science
has learned more about scrapie strains and the factors involved.

 <h3><center>Lamb <a NAME="Eradication">chops</a> threatened by BSE ban</center></h3>

Lamb chops threatened by BSE ban
 
By Roger Highfield and Toby Helm<br> 
The Telegraph ...Tuesday July 23 1996<p>


THE BSE scare threatened to spread from beef to lamb products last night
after European officials disclosed that they were investigating reports
that the disease could be transmitted to sheep. <p>

Measures extending the ban on possibly infected meat and offal to sheep,
goats and deer are being drawn up by the European Union's agriculture
commissioner, Franz Fischler.Ministers, officials and experts were
trying to avert another food scare by insisting that the latest moves
were purely precautionary. But British veterinary experts said the new
measures would directly affect the way lamb chops were prepared by
butchers. <p>

There was growing concern in Whitehall that new measures could lead to a
slump in sales of lamb. Many consumers switched to other meat, such as
lamb, after the reports earlier this year of a possible link between a
new strain of CJD, the human version of BSE, and products such as
beefburgers. <p>

The British Veterinary Association said the proposed ban on sheep offal
and central nervous tissue was a <b>"ludicrous measure"</b> with no scientific
justification. It would entail removing the spinal cord attached to lamb
chops. The association was strongly supported by Prof Richard Lacey, an
expert on BSE, who strongly criticised Mr Fischler's comments and called
for his resignation. <p>

Prof Lacey, a microbiologist at Leeds University, was one of the first
scientists to give warning of the developing BSE crisis. Although he has
been critical of Government action to eradicate the disease in cattle,
<b>Lacey said Mr Fischler's claims were "completely wrong".</b> <p>

The new concern about sheep stems from research in France into the
disease scrapie - similar to BSE - which has been around for 200 years.
Prof Lacey maintained that BSE in cattle was a new disease, nothing to
do with scrapie.<b> Lacey said Mr Fischler seemed to be completely confused. </b>

'Can we be sure that a case of so-called scrapie is not in fact BSE in
sheep?' <p>

Earlier, Mr Fischler said he was seeking a ban on offal from sheep and
goats, as well as beef, in consumer products and animal feed following
"experimental evidence" that BSE could be transmitted to sheep. This
would include the spleens of sheep and goats as well as tissue from the
central nervous system. Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, will
make a Commons statement tomorrow setting out the opinion of the
Government's expert advisers. Mr Fischler said he would put the ban to
the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU within the next 10 days. <p>

Earlier, a report in the French daily Le Monde said that scientists had
warned the European Commission for the first time about the consumption
of offal from sheep and goats. The scientists were concerned with the
ease with which BSE could pass through the food chain from one species
to another. Significantly, experimentally infected sheep showed the
agent maintained all the hallmarks of BSE, and the disease also affected
the spleen as well as the spinal cord and brain. <p>

Mr Fischler said that the experimental evidence raised several
questions. "In particular can we be sure that a case of so-called
scrapie is not in fact BSE in sheep?" Bearing in mind the need to
protect humans from exposure to the BSE agent it was necessary to "err
on the side of caution". "We also need to act positively to restore
public confidence in beef and perhaps to avoid loss of confidence in
other meat," he said. <p>

But his comments risk severe damage to the market for lamb and sheep
products following the slump in consumption of beef across Europe. A
Ministry of Agriculture spokesman said the proposed ban was "a very
precautionary measure". "We are not particularly worried about this. We
in Britain remove 99 per cent of sheep's heads anyway and we don't eat
sheep's brains in this country." <p>

Francis Anthony, BSE adviser to the British Veterinary Association,
said: "We've been living with scrapie for more than 200 years and no
scientist has been able to make a connection between scrapie and man. It
may be possible to transmit BSE to sheep experimentally but there is no
evidence in the field that BSE causes damage to sheep. Otherwise we vets
would be seeing it."

<h3><center>Feed Ban <a NAME="Commentary">Commentary</a></center></h3>

Feed Ban Commentary
24 July 96<br>

British Correspondent<p>

<pre>Two articles from todays papers follow. Government and agriculture
sources are wading in reassuring consumers with two premises:

1)     That the problem is scrapie not bse

2)     That the new measures are purely precautionary
</pre>
However, the reality is probably rather different, another newspaper
article (sorry I cant get it online) states that British farmers
continued to use prohibited feed containing mammalian input for SEVEN
years after the stuff was banned for all ruminants. If true it must me
more likely than not that sheep now harbour BSE, and the UK is a major
exporter of sheep all over Europe. Apparently the Agriculture Minister
Hogg (on his own admission in a radio interview) has known of the
problem since April but has taken no action. <p>

All this confirms the widely held view that until the BSE<>CJD link was
made in March this year that government anti-BSE measures were for
cosmetic purposes and were not implemented. Another example is that
offals prohibited in 1988 were still entering animal and human food
chains until this year as the abbatoir regulations were simply not
enforced. It seems that the government thought that it was just scrapie,
that scrapie is known not to be a significant human problem, and that
therefore no substantive action was required.<p>

Mammalian based fertiliser is still manufactured and legal for certain
uses in the UK and mammalian based feed is still manufactured for fish
feed (despite being banned in France), nothing changes.

<blockquote>
<h3><center>National Ministers <a NAME="ordered">ordered</a> before Committee of Inquiry</center></h3>
Socialist Spokesman, European Parliament<br>
23 July 1996<p>

     Government ministers could be called before a European Parliament
committee of inquiry into mad cow disease, it was revealed in Brussels
today.

     It would be the first time an EU public inquiry summoned national
ministers to give evidence.<p>

     The European Parliament has set up a 19-member inquiry committee
to 'investigate alleged contraventions or maladministration in the
implementation of Community law in relation to BSE.'  

     The inquiry committee's first meeting is to be held on 3 September
in Brussels.  Spanish Socialist leader in the European Parliament Manuel
Medina is to prepare the inquiry report for the end of the year.<p>

     Said Mr Medina in Brussels today:  'In my opinion we should be
calling government ministers.  Most decisions have been made at
government level.  Under the principle of subsidiarity, governments have
the main responsibility for the health of the people.  The committee of
inquiry should therefore seek information from national governments.'<p>

     Mr Medina, an expert in international law, added:  'There is
nothing to prevent the committee of inquiry from calling a member of a
government.  It would be in the interests of governments concerned to
cooperate with the inquiry in order to demonstrate a commitment to
openness and transparency.<p>

     'If public health can be guaranteed, it is through transparency
that we expect public trust in the consumption of beef to be restored.'<p>
<pre>
     A five-page document setting out the committee's brief places
special emphasis on public health questions. 

     Three areas highlighted in the brief are:

     + TRANSPARENCY of the fight against mad cow disease through wide
              publication of research;
     + MONITORING of the beef export ban; and
     + ADOPTION of measures for protection of public health and
              restoration of smooth operation of the markets.</pre><hr></blockquote>

BY MICHAEL HORNSBY AND CHARLES BREMNER<BR>
 The Times: Britain:July 23 1996<P>

THE Government was last night poised to ban more animal products from the food chain amid fears that "mad cow" disease could be passed to sheep.



Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, is expected to announce this week that the brain, spinal cord and spleen of sheep and goats must not be used for human or animal consumption.

<P>

The move coincides with a decision by the European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler to call for an extension of Europe's anti-BSE restrictions to all ruminants. The idea was supported by farm ministers in Brussels yesterday after scientists reported that the agent which causes "mad cow" disease could be transmitted to sheep.

<P>

The ministers insisted that the action plan &#173; which will be considered by Community veterinary experts next week &#173; was purely precautionary. Ivan Yates, the Irish Farm Minister who chaired yesterday's meeting, said: "This time we need to be guided by the scientists, not the politicians. Let's wait until the vets have met before deciding anything. We have seen the consequences of BSE on beef, it would be a tragedy and a disaster to visit the same thing on lamb because it is not scientifically justified."

<P>

Pressure for the ban has come mainly from France, where sheep's brains are widely eaten and where the Government is introducing its own measures. The restrictions should not have much effect in Britain, however, although a spinal cord ban might change the way butchers prepare traditional cuts such as chops and saddle of lamb.


Concern has arisen because laboratory experiments have shown that it is possible to transmit BSE &#173; bovine spongiform encephalopathy &#173; to sheep and goats, although there is no evidence that this has happened to animals in the field.

<P>

Jeff Almond, professor of microbiology at Reading University and a member of the committee advising the Government on BSE, said: "The difficulty is that if BSE has passed to sheep, it would look very much like scrapie. We know that scrapie, which has been around for centuries, poses no risk to humans, but if BSE has got back into sheep, can we be sure that it is absolutely safe? There may be a slight risk and it is sensible to take precautions. Fortunately, very few people in this country eat sheep's brains, but some groups &#173; such as Muslims &#173; do."

<P>

Professor Almond said that it was possible that sheep could have acquired BSE by eating meat and bonemeal derived from infected cattle, reversing the process by which cattle are thought to have got the disease in the first place.


Although sheep were never fed as much meat and bonemeal as cattle, it was common to give them high-protein rations before lambing and during the winter. Professor Almond said: "Such feed has been banned since July 1988, but we believe scrapie can be passed from ewes to their lambs, and so if BSE has got into the sheep flock it, too, could be transmitted in this way."

<P>

Yesterday Herr Fischler emphasised the uncertainties when he told the farm ministers: "The true BSE and scrapie situation is not fully clear, since these diseases are difficult to diagnose and easily mistaken for other conditions. Can we be sure that a case of so-called scrapie is not in fact BSE in sheep?


"I therefore intend to propose to the standing veterinary committee that certain tissues from all ruminants will be excluded from all food and feed chains."

<P>

But Professor Richard Lacey of Leeds University, who has been one of the most outspoken prophets of the BSE crisis, said that Herr Fischler's claims were "completely wrong" and he should resign. He said: "Sheep scrapie doesn't cause BSE and although BSE may, under experimental conditions, cause disease in sheep, it does in almost every other animal and does not mean sheep are a health risk to humans."

<P>

However, Colin Maclean of the Meat and Livestock Commission said: "We must endorse what Franz Fischler has said, if only as a precaution. It is not going to cause a major issue, we hope, with consumers." And Ian Gardiner, policy director of the National Farmers' Union, said: "We hope that consumers will feel reassured and not over-react."

<H3><CENTER>Comprehensive <A NAME="Ruminant">Ruminant</A> Ban Coming</CENTER></H3>
BBC 22.00 news tonight Monday 22 July 96<P>

An EC ban on brain and spinal chord from *** ALL *** ruminants entering
the human food chain is likely in the next couple of weeks, the spleen
too from younger animals. France has already instituted such a ban. The
ban includes sheep, goats, and deer. Not too much additional scientific
information, more on the likely impact on the farming industry. Will
post more info when I find some articles.<P>

 British agricultural representative said that it was
precautionary measure with regard to animal health and was trying to
minimise consumer concerns. He referred to Scrapie not being a problem
in the UK but being more so in France (Britain has 40k+ cases a
year here per annum). Although France is regularly slagged off for secrecy over its
BSE problems, they do seem to be way out ahead on introducing
precautionary legislation.<P>

 As ruminants do not eat one another in their
natural state, and scrapie is not regarded as a major threat to human
health, scrapie seems a most unlikely reason for the ban. All 3 animals
mentioned are farmed (deer relatively recently in this country) and have
most likely been fed contaminated feed supplements, so BSE has probably
crossed from cattle into these species and they are threat to human
health. What about pigs and poultry then ...... ? <BR>

"I can't speak with authority for the regulations of other countries, but in
the United States you may NOT include anything but beef skeletal muscle
tissue in ground beef, sausages or anything else and label it "beef". If
brains are used, they must be labeled "beef brains". Similarly for any other
organ tissues. Not only must the ingredient appear in the ingredient list,
but an additional large subtitle to the product name must include "made with
variety meats" or some other acceptable synonym.<P>

 The only "offal" or
"variety" meats used with any frequency are:<P>
<ul><li> <strong>heart</strong> meat (not uncommon in
bologna, summer sausage and hard salami)
<li><strong>livers</strong> (pate, liverwurst,
braunschweiger),
<li><strong>lips</strong> (dried sausage snack sticks)
<li>tongue (smoke tongue
in delicatessins). </ul><P>

No major brands (Oscar Mayer, Hormel, Swift, Armour,
MacDonald's, Burger-King, Wendy's, etc.) use any non-skeletal meats in any
of their standard products (frankfurters, bologna, patties), because of
possible adverse label impact.<P>
 
<STRONG>In Canada, the rules are similar, but they allow "blood" to be labeled as
"beef".</STRONG><P>
 
Because of ethnic and religious barriers to the consumption of certain
species and body tissues, I would find it hard to believe that in the EU you
would not have to specifically identify "brains" on the product ingredient
statement.<P>
 
In my work with the meat industry, I have frequently polled consumers
informally to ask what they believed was used in the manufacture of common
<STRONG>processed meat</STRONG> products such as frankfurters, ground beef and pork sausage.
Invariably they assume ALL animal tissues are used (snouts, spleens, hearts,
kidneys, brains, tripe, etc.). They are surprised and skeptical when they
find this is not the case.<P>
 
On the other hand, comminuted  [= ground up into small particles] poultry products (franks and luncheon meats)
are mostly made from mechanically separated poultry, which if labeled
"chicken", <B>may contain skin, sex glands and kidneys</B> as well as muscle
tissue. Apparently consumers are used to "giblet gravy" and don't seem to
mind this.<P>

Agriculture Commissioner Fischler's
statement about the need to take precautionary measures and ban sheep and

<B>Quotes from key figures -- Agriculture
Council Meeting 7.24.96</B>. <P>
<pre>
Ivan Yates Irish Minister for Agriculture (Ireland chairs rotating EU
presidency till year end) says :

Lamb a safe product, 
Sheep and Goats do not have BSE

"I appeal to the Public to use their own common sense"

According to BBC Ivan Yates criticized the behaviour of the Commission in
its whole handling of the BSE saying "There is no denying that in the same
way as a forest fire is started with one match it can be extremely difficult
to put out. So the damage that can be done to producers ... the damage which
can be caused by putting about these half stories is having serious
repercussions......"

(Unusual for a Presidency to attack the Commission  in such
difficult situation.  Normally the presidency's role is to mediate and find
consensus between member states and Institutions when in trouble.)
<hr SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=Left>



BBC interviewed farmers expressing the fear there was a hidden agenda in
Europe designed to curb British exports and squeez prices!  French don't
like British lamb competition coming to France. Farmer says he was "gob-smacked, 
couldn't speak.  I saw it coming but still
was  stunned when it did" referring to the ban on sheep brain, spinal chord
and CNS.
Irish are concerned because <B>denerving lambs difficult</B> due to the size of the
animals.
<hr SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=Left>


BBC estimates value of lamb market in UK super markets £1.2 billion.

Beef sales still 11% below (Note :Seasoned Ag analysts confirm this
figure is really 20%)
<hr SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=Left>


Consumers Interviewed by the BBC: 
"I don't think I would trust anything anyone says at this stage.  They lied
for so many years about the BSE"

"Sort of scares you , makes you wonder what you will be able to eat in the end"

<hr SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=Left>

Prof Almond, interviewed by the BBC : 

The reason why waited till now to release this information on sheep and
goats was that there was no evidence.
There is no evidence that it has infected our sheep in the fields.
In the absence of proof.  What should we do but act to protect the consumer.

<hr SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=Left>

British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg :

Given the concerns of the new strains of CJD...... 
On the continent there has been no MBM feed ban in place - given the concern
generally throughout the continent.  It is unwise to eat sheep brains at the
present time.

He then said :
it is completely safe to eat lamb.
No reason for people to stop buying lamb despite the ban on sheep spinal
cord, brains and nervous system.
For any sheep which may have been eating MBM across Europe there is a faint
risk.

France succeeded in infecting sheep.  Fischler said so last night.

Later on he said :
Insists there is no reason for collapse or fall in confidence in meat.
"I believe lamb throughout Europe is wholly safe.  Science has shown that
BSE transmissible to many species.......
No evidence that sheep can catch it in the fields.  Tests have been
conducted in laboratory. 

<hr SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=Left>

The Commission said :
Uppermost in one's mind is ultra-caution for consumers.

Then later :
EU spokesman said the proposed measures were a precaution.

Then later :
spokesman said <B>people shouldn't be over concerned by scientific research</B> 
Never been a case where cows passed BSE to sheep.

<hr SIZE="2" WIDTH="25%" ALIGN=Left>

All day as EU ag ministers met they took every opportunity to address the alarm
over eating lamb.
BBC said Ministers and Commission joined forces in trying to calm fears
caused by banning sheep and goat offal.
Govt and EU spent the day trying to prevent the collapse of confidence
consumers in Lamb and Goat.
As there had been sheep and goats fed contaminated cattle remains it was
wise to  
remove the brain and the CNS and spinal chord.

BBC reported the ban had already had an impact on meat markets around the
country (Britain). Prices have dropped especially for export.  Prices down
by about 3£ a head.  Orders for export lost.  Lamb market highly skittish.

TOKYO  - Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. said Monday it was recalling three imported drugs for the treatment of anemia and bronchitis due to the possibility that they contain fat extracted from cattle in Britain.<p>


    The company said it had begun collecting 400,000 pills of Fero Gradumet, a drug for the treatment of anemia, and 140,000 cylinders of Medihaler Iso and Medihaler D, for bronchitis.<p>

    Since April the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare has prohibited the manufacture or import of foods and drugs that use British cattle products.

Nando.net and  Reuter Information Service ... 24 July 1996<P>

TOKYO (Jul 24, 1996 02:11 a.m. EDT) - Shocked by two more deaths from a food poisoning epidemic, Japan scrambled on Wednesday to
contain the outbreak and accepted an offer of help from the United States.

Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he felt helpless in the face of the deaths from the O-157 colon bacteria, which has now killed seven
people since the infection broke out in May.<P>

"The deaths came in a row immediately after it looked as if the situation was improving," Hashimoto told reporters.

"I feel helpless, that this might be the limit of modern medical expertise," Hashimoto said.

A 10-year-old schoolgirl and an 85-year-old woman died from the bacteria on Tuesday.

Hashimoto said the most important thing now was to identify the source and route of infection.<P>

In the most serious outbreak, 96 children are in serious condition at hospitals in Sakai, near Osaka. Twenty-eight of them are in critical
condition, including three in comas.

More than 6,400 people, mostly schoolchildren, have come down with the germ in Sakai alone. The 13-day-old outbreak in Sakai was traced
to school lunches prepared by city-run kitchens, but the tainted food carrying the bacteria has not been identified.<P>

Except for one isolated case in which a nine-year-old boy became infected with the bacteria after <STRONG>eating raw cow's liver</STRONG>, a delicacy in
Japan, experts have so far failed to pinpoint the origin of the infection.

Earlier outbreaks of the bacteria elsewhere in Japan since May have stricken 2,000 people, killing five of them.

The health and education ministries said they were preparing emergency measures to trace and contain the O-157 bacteria.<P>

The Health Ministry planned to invoke a special clause in the Food Sanitation Law that would require all food firms to report in detail their
sources of raw food, part of a measure that would help in tracing tainted food sources.

A spokesman for the Health Ministry also said Japan would accept an offer of expert help from the U.S. Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC).<P>

"We must discuss details on how exactly the CDC will help us," the spokesman said. "Options include having them send us specialist doctors
who will help out at national hospitals, or research personnel who will then advise their counterparts in Japan."<P>

The Education Ministry on Wednesday also approved a crash research programme into the O-157 strain.

Ministry officials said Dr Takeshi Honda of Osaka University, a germ specialist, will head an eight-member team to conduct a detailed study
of the O-157 strain.

Scientists are puzzled by the series of outbreaks.

The particular strain, one of about 200 colon bacillus bacteria, is known and has been identified as often occurring in uncooked meat. But
the O-157 strain had been considered too weak to sustain a major poisoning outbreak.<P>

"Even to an amateur like me, this does not look like ordinary food poisoning," government spokesman Seiroku Kajiyama told a regular news
conference on Wednesday. "We must ask researchers to get to the bottom of this infection."

The Japanese media was critical of the government's slow response to what it called an epidemic of crisis proportions.

"Among those in the government, there is simply no realisation that this, like last year's Kobe earthquake, is a major crisis," the Asahi
Shimbun said in an opinion piece.

"Sakai did not follow prefecture orders to change the school menu to cooked food. Sakai officials have said: 'We did not think the O-157
infection was this bad'," the column said. "They seriously lacked imagination."

FROM ROBERT WHYMANT IN TOKYO

<BR>The Times: World News:July 25 1996<P>



 AS a food poisoning epidemic spread across Japan, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Prime Minister, declared a national emergency yesterday and pledged no effort would be spared to combat the outbreak.

<P>

In a statement on the epidemic, which has struck 8,230 people and killed seven, Mr Hashimoto said that the infection, caused by intestinal <I>E. coli</I> bacteria, was no longer confined to one region but threatened the health of everyone in the country.

<P>

"The food poisoning by the 0157 colon bacillus bacteria which started in May has now spread to the entire nation," the Prime Minister said. "I recognise that the 0157 food poisoning is a problem deeply related to the daily lives of the people and that it is now a national issue."

<P>

Mr Hashimoto pledged urgent action a day after a girl, aged ten, died in the town of Sakai, where more than 6,400 primary schoolchildren have been stricken in the past fortnight. By last night the number of seriously ill children with symptoms of haemolytic uraemic syn drome, a kidney-destroying disease caused by the food poisoning bacterium, rose to 96, up 22 from the previous day, Sakai city officials said.

<P>

The epidemic has claimed two other lives this week &#173; an 85-year-old man in Osaka and a 56-year-old man in Kyoto. These were the first deaths reported since four people died in the western city of Okayama last month. Mr Hashimoto vowed that every step would be taken to trace the route of the infection. Scientists are analysing hundreds of samples of lunches served in Sakai schools earlier this month to try to identify the source. Main suspects are cold noodles, raw cow's liver and undercooked hamburger.

<P>

The Prime Minister, who is to announce a detailed plan to tighten food inspection procedures tomorrow, urged the public to get medical treatment at the first sign of the unusual symptoms.

<P>

Japan has accepted an offer of help from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to fight the epidemic. The Atlanta-based institution helped to eradicate an 0157 outbreak in 1993 which killed four children in the American Midwest.

                 <CENTER><H3>  Ministry blamed for CJD growth hormone deaths 
</H3>
</CENTER>
                                            BY DOMINIC KENNEDY, SOCIAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT ...  July 20 1996 London Times<P>

          A JUDGE ruled yesterday that the Government was to blame for the deaths of a number of
          people who contracted the human form of "mad cow" disease after being treated as children
          with a growth hormone. <P>


          Mr Justice Morland said in a test ruling that anybody who began treatment from July 1977
          and developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease could claim damages for negligence against the
          Department of Health, which took over responsibility from the Medical Research Council for
          the formerly experimental programme from that date. The Government will inevitably have to
          pay damages to a number of bereaved families. <P>

          Most of the plaintiffs began their treatment before 1977 ≠ some as long ago as 1959 ≠ and so
          have lost their claims for negligence. But Stephen Dorrell, the Health Secretary, will be urged
          to compensate all the victims and their relatives, including those whose treatment began
          earlier. <P>

          There is uncertainty about the position of the "worried well", who fear they will develop the
          illness and suffer a death the judge described as terrible to the victim and ghastly and utterly
          distressing for his family.<P> 

          The Medical Research Council had been warned as early as 1976 that Creutzfeldt-Jakob
          disease could be contaminating batches of hormone extracted from the pituitary glands of
          corpses. It was not until three patients receiving similar treatment died in America in 1985
          that the therapy was halted. <P>

          Sixteen people have already died from the incurable disease; three others are dying, and
          1,900 are living with the knowledge that they could be infected. 

          The judge said at the High Court that, had doctors been made aware from 1977 of the risks,
          they would not have put new children on to the treatment, although they would have probably
          let existing patients continue. "It is to be hoped that no more cases will occur, but realistically
          that is an optimistic hope," he said. <P>

          David Body, solicitor for the plaintiffs, said: "The Department of Health, in the name of
          humanity, should make ex-gratia payments to all the families and individuals, whenever their
          treatment began." An early-day motion will be tabled in the Commons on Monday demanding
          compensation for all. <P>

          Tam Fry, honorary chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, which helps the affected
          families, described as iniquitous the payment by ministers of millions of pounds in
          compensation for cattle with BSE while they resisted any payments to families of CJD
          victims. <P>

          Ashraf Khan, whose son Bahram, a graduate engineer, died aged 27 last year, said: "When they
          knew the bells were ringing, why didn't they stop it? They should never have played with
          innocent young lives. They should have at least told the parents that these were experiments." <P>

          Paul Andrews, 30, of Bromley, Kent, is one of the "worried well", who are seeking
          compensation for the psychological anguish of knowing they could be struck down by the
          incurable brain disease. He was expected to grow naturally to 5ft but reached 5ft 5in after
          receiving injections between the ages of 11 and 17. 

          "At the end of the day we were short and that was that. What is the difference between 5ft and
          5ft 5in when you are alive? I could be dead this time next year and there is quite a high chance
          of that." <P>

          The judge, who heard 25 days of evidence, said many would be disappointed by his conclusions
          but that he must not be guilty of hindsight or let sympathy affect his judgment. <P>

          After being alerted to the CJD risk in 1976 by Alan Dickinson, an eminent veterinary
          research scientist in Edinburgh, the Medical Research Council did not ask the advice of two
          expert professors until a year later. 

          Within a week, they said that they were in the uncomfortable position of "not knowing how bad
          the worst is. Any clinician who uses growth hormone must be made aware of the gruesome
          possibilities." <P>

          But instead of telling doctors who were recommending young people for this treatment,
          information was kept to the chosen few, the judge said. "The clinicians were kept in the dark,"
          he said. "An unwise philosophy pervaded within the Department of Health and the Medical
          Research Council that the risk of slow virus contamination of human growth hormone was too
          awful to contemplate."<P> 

          In ruling that only cases of CJD among people treated after July 1977 were caused by the
          negligence of the Department of Health, he absolved the council of any blame during the period
          before then. 
<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Court says Britain <A NAME="negligent">negligent</A> in some CJD cases</CENTER></H3>
July 20 1996 Reuter Information Service<P>
LONDON - Relatives of children who died from the human equivalent of mad cow disease after being treated with human growth hormone won a court case Friday for conpensation from the British government<P>


    A London court ruled that the government's Department of Health had been negligent, but only in cases arising from treatment after July 1, 1977, when the risk of catching Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease should have become clear.<P>

    David Body, a solicitor representing families of those killed by CJD after being treated with human growth hormone (HGH), said it was not yet clear how many people would be entitled to compensation under the judge's ruling.<P>

    "Our view is that everybody should receive compensation and that it would be inconsistent for the pre-1977 families to be treated differently," he told reporters outside the court.<P>

    At a later news conference, Body said a motion would be tabled in the parliament next week aiming at securing an ex-gratia payment to the pre-1977 families.

    "There is a great deal of support in all the opposition parties for it," he said.<P>

    Eight families whose children caught CJD after treatment with growth hormones and later died brought an action against the health department and the Medical Research Council (MRC), a government body.

    A further four plaintiffs were added toward the end of the trial, two of whom have died of CJD and two who now have the invariably fatal neurological disease.<P>

    The treatment, for children with growth abnormalities, involved hormones taken from the pituitary glands of human corpses. It started in 1959 and came to an end in 1985 when the first linked deaths from CJD were reported in the United States.<P>

    The health department and MRC conceded that CJD had been transmitted by the growth hormone, but fought the six-year legal battle on grounds it was not known at the time of the program that there was a risk of transmitting the disease.<P>

    Noel Baldwin, father of Patrick Baldwin who died of CJD aged 30 after treatment with HGH between the ages of 14 and 17, said there had been no real winners in the court battle.
    "Justice can never be done for Patrick because Patrick died as a result of the program," he said. "I don't feel bitter toward the people involved, but I feel bitter at the system that allowed this to happen."<P>

    There are another 200 cases pending from participants in the GH program on behalf of those who have not developed CJD but have suffered psychiatric injury because they fear they might.

    The case has no connection with the new strain of CJD, which triggered the mad cow scare and beef crisis in Europe.

 by Peter Conradi: Brussels ... July 21 1996 ... The Times<P>


GRAIN farmers are likely to have their huge European Union subsidies cut to
help meet the cost of the BSE beef crisis. EU farm ministers are to discuss
reductions in the subsidies this week, after learning that the price of rescuing
the beef industry will rise to more than £2 billion by the end of the year. <P>

Farm ministers, meeting in Brussels tomorrow to discuss the beef crisis, will
hear calls from Franz Fischler, the agriculture commissioner, for cuts in
other sectors of farm spending. Cereal growers, among the largest recipients
of EU cash, are the favourite target. <P>

While beef farmers are pushed towards bankruptcy, Britain's cereal growers
have seen incomes rise by more than a quarter as part of an aid programme
that costs EU taxpayers £13 billion a year. 

British cereal farmers, who receive about £1.5 billion a year from the EU,
appear reconciled to the fact that Brussels will try to curb windfall gains
caused by a global shortage of grain which has pushed world prices well above
those within the EU. <P>

However, Peter Limb, who heads the National Farmers' Union's cereals
committee, said his members were anxious that any reform should include a
provision to push subsidies up again if the world price falls back. "World
prices will remain high as along as the world shortage continues," he said.
"But they are also very volatile. When the next downturn comes, farmers
could be vulnerable." <P>

European commission officials warned this weekend that the cost of buying and
storing the growing mountain of unwanted beef will pass £1 billion if demand
does not recover. A further £1.2 billion is being made in direct payments to
British and continental beef farmers.

July 18 1996  ...  London Times<P>


          Britain and the European Commission are to be called before a European parliamentary
          inquiry to answer allegations that they mishandled the BSE crisis, MEPs decided yesterday.
          The move to set up a formal commission of inquiry followed anger in the Strasbourg
          parliament this week at reports that the Brussels executive had sought to play down the BSE

There have been several queries about Harash Narang recently - I heard on
the news this morning that he has brought an unfair dismissal claim, which
goes to industrial tribunal today. I don't remember who he was employed by
at the time (Central Veterinary Laboratory?), but it is likely that his
claims of a test for BSE will form a part of the evidence and may therefore
be discussed in some detail.

<P
Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. Agriculture Department said it had slaughtered
48 of 113 British cattle known to be in the country in a program begun in
March to try to prevent an outbreak of mad cow disease here.
<P

While most US pork is free from trichina, some pork is still infested.
Consequently ALL pork in the US has to be treated to kill the pests.
Europeans have long scornfully suggested we just stop feeding "garbage" to
hogs to eliminate the parasite. Clearly you are not one of these. You must
feel that as long as we have a "bandaid" for the problem, it is of no
importance that it be further controlled.

<h5><center><a NAME="Experimental">Experimental</a> infection of cattle with the agents of transmissible mink
encephalopathy and scrapie</center></h5>
<blockquote>Robinson, M. M.\ Hadlow, W. J.\ Knowles, D. P.\ Huff, T. P.\ Lacy, P.
A.\ Marsh, R. F.\ Gorham, J. R.

Cattle are susceptible to experimental infection with the Stetsonville
isolate of the transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) agent.
Susceptibility to other TME isolates was investigated in 2 groups of calves
inoculated intracerebrally with the homogenate of mink brain containing
the Hayward or the Blackfoot isolates. A third group was inoculated with
a brain homogenate from a steer infected with the Stetsonville isolate in
its primary cattle passage and a fourth group was inoculated with a pool
of brain homogenate from the 3 cattle experimentally infected with a
sheep and goat scrapie agent in its primary cattle passage. <p>

Clinical signs
of neurological disease appeared in each steer of every group between 15
and 25 months after inoculation. An encephalopathy characterized by
severe spongiform change and pronounced astrocytosis occurred in the
3 groups inoculated with the TME agent. The neurohistological changes
in the steers inoculated with the cattle-passaged scrapie agent were
slight and subtle. Analysis of the octapeptide repeat region of the bovine
protease-resistant protein (PrP) gene showed that variations in
incubation period, clinical signs, and neurohistological changes were
unrelated to the homozygous or heterozygous condition of 6 or 6/5
octapeptide repeats.</blockquote>

<hr>
In "Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy: A New Disease of Cattle?" Marsh writes:<p>
<blockquote>
"Most believe that [BSE] is of recent origin initiated by feeding rendered
animal protein from scrapie-infected sheep to cattle. . . . This paper
explores an alternative hypothesis that BSE existed in cattle populations in
an unrecognized form for a much longer time until amplified by changes in the
rendering process that allowed cattle to cattle transmission to occur. This
viewpoint is supported by observations that transmissible mink
encephalopathy, a disease that first occurred 45 years ago, is likely caused
by feeding downer cows to mink."</blockquote>
 <hr>

In "Transmissible mink encephalopathy" 
co-authored with W.J. Hadlow, Marsh
writes, <p>
<blockquote>"There are two incidents of [transmissible mink encephalopathy] which
occurred in Ontario in 1963 and Stetsonville (Wisconsin) in 1985, where the
mink rancher stated with a high degree of certainty that sheep had not been
fed. The Stetsonville incident is especially interesting because this rancher
was a 'dead stock' feeder who used mostly dairy cows which he collected daily
within a 50-mile radius of his mink ranch. ... If TME results from feeding
infected cattle tissues to mink, there must be an unrecognized BSE-like
infection in American cattle and in other countries where TME has been
reported. This hypothetical agent need not have biological properties
identical to those of the BSE agent because it is likely that cattle could be
infected with several 'strains' as are sheep."</blockquote>
 <hr>

In his interview in AgriView, Marsh states:<p>
<blockquote> "I went
to the meeting of the U.S. Livestock Association (in late 1985) and reported
that there is strong circumstantial evidence that mink encephalopathy is
caused by feeding infected dairy cows to the mink. I tried to put them on the
alert to look for such a disease in dairy cows. To try to experimentally back
this up, we inoculated two Holstein steers with the mink brain in the summer
of '85. Within 18 months, both of these cows came down with the brain lesions
seen with spongiform encephalopathy. ... The reason I feel so strongly is
that we have a unique perspective here in this laboratory because we work on
mink encephalopathy. I believe mink encephalopathy is caused by feeding
downer cows to mink. I think our evidence is very sound, and I think our
experimental studies on inoculation of cattle are sound."</blockquote>
<hr>
Marsh considers USDA surveillance measures inadequate.
The "high risk samples" being tested for BSE in the U.S. are rabies-negative
cows, on the assumption that the staggering and drooling symptoms shown by
British Mad Cows could be misdiagnosed as rabies. <p>

What Marsh found, however,
was a TSE that caused different symptoms: infected animals simply fall over,
like downer cows. "Downer Cow Disease" is a syndrome involving a far larger
number of animals than rabies, and no procedure for routine diagnosis.
Accordingly, Marsh concludes that:<p>

<blockquote> "The only way to absolutely prevent
cattle-to-cattle transmission ... is to ban the feeding of ruminant animal
protein to other ruminants. ... It is unlikely that surveillance programs
will provide adequate warning since it will be almost impossible to detect
the disease in the first few animals affected, and an incubation period of
3-8 years may allow a decade of exposure before the disease is recognized."
(Source: "BSE: A New Disease in Cattle?")<hr>
Marsh sees mink outbreaks, like zoo or wildlife
outbreaks, as naturally limiting in terms of contagion, but massive
outbreaks of contained animals, where there is ample opportunity for
contagion, as limited by genetic variation, age, gender and normative
compensatory processes.<p>
 
But maybe the limits are off in multiparous, old age animals, especially
when receiving hormones and turning over massive amounts of calcium.</blockquote><hr>

<h3><center>US: BSE researcher arrested, Alzheimer researcher <a NAME="murdered">murdered</a> </center></h3>

Listserve correspondence ... 22.7.96<p>

"In the months since Gajdusek's arrest and weeks since Saitoh's murder, as
no other explanations have come forward, I have wondered what could have
been the motivation, what the intimidation could be about. Certainly the
murder of Saitoh and his daughter could have been a mistake. Gajdusek could
simply have gone too far in his cultural relativism.<p>
 
But there are some big money issues in the mix, such as transgenic mice,
growth hormone, drug development, and chemical toxin liability.  I have
become intrigued by Saitoh's interest in the shift in the glutamate -
calcium intracellular flux and the resulting shift to amyloid accumulation
intracellularly as opposed to an intercellular messenger path.<p>
 
The University of Kentucky Brown-Sanders Center for Aging has an
<a HREF="http://www.coa.uky.edu/ADReview/">Alzheimer's Ezine</a> with a summary by Saitoh and a Eulogy in the same issue."<p>


If it is this excitotoxic process which accelerates the neurodegeneration
in Alzheimer's Disease, and also in other neurodegenerative diseases, then
I could see a link to BSE. That's the long way around to what Saitoh would
have to do with intimidation about BSE. Not the cause, but the mechanisms
by which a neurodegenerative process picks up speed, is what I think could
be the link. Gajdusek seemed to hope he had the key, from the Papua New
Guinea population, for resisting the neurodegeneration of HTLV-1.

<h3><center><a NAME="Symptoms">Symptoms</a> of Milk Fever</center></h3>
Listserve correspondent ... 21 July 96<p>

Field advisories  paint a picture for Downer Cow Syndrome of mostly
neurological symptoms for mostly Milk Fever, in mostly aged cows, around
parturition, with a largely confused and extreme set of suggestions for
more, or less calcium, and additional hormones. With plenty of glutamate in
the diet as well, a neural excitotoxic episode at parturition could put a
cow's brain down as quickly as indicated in the reports.<p>

 
The similarity in pattern I was referring to is the increased calcium
turnover, increased endocrine disruption, and perhaps increased pesticide
use, which, in comparison to earlier decades, could accelerate an age
related, stress related, genetically predisposed disorder to an epidemic,
even without the addition of an infectious vehicle in feed supplements.
That is the pattern that I see as similar on U.S. and European dairy farms.<hr>


<h4><center>MILK <a NAME="FEVER">FEVER</a> IN DAIRY COWS</center></h3>

LANE, G.T., P.W. CLARK, AND R.W. HEMKEN<br>
HERD AND ANIMAL HEALTH  1979<p>
 
Milk fever, or parturient paresis, is a metabolic disease of dairy cows
which usually afflicts animals just preceding or immediately following
freshening. While the exact cause of this disease is not completely
understood, it is associated with the onset of lactation and failure of the
animal to maintain an adequate supply of calcium from both feed intake and
mobilization from the bone. In milk fever animals, the blood serum calcium
levels will drop from a normal g to 12 milligrams (mg)/100 milliliter (ml)
to 3 to 7 mg/100 ml, and blood phosphorus levels will drop from a normal of
6 to 8 mg/100 ml to below 5 mg/100 ml.<p>
 
Several factors are known to affect the incidence of milk fever in dairy
cattle. Older animals are more susceptible than are young cows. Milk fever
occurs more frequently in Jerseys than in the other dairy breeds. High
producing animals are more prone to milk fever than are low producers. Cows
with a previous history tend to have repeat cases of milk fever.<p>

<b> SYMPTOMS OF MILK FEVER</b>
 
<pre>Symptoms commonly observed in animals with milk fever include:
 
1.    Dull eyes and action
2.    Subnormal body temperature
3.    Cold and drooping ears
4.    Staggering gait and incoordination
5.    Weakness and partial paralysis of rear legs
6.    Muscle spasms
7.    Inability to rise
8.    Lying on the sternum with head tucked into flank</pre>
 
In advanced cases, the cow may lie completely outstretched on her side. If
left untreated complete paralysis and coma, followed by death, will result.
Death can occur within a few hours from the onset of milk fever. Therefore,
immediate attention is necessary. Usually, animals will respond quickly to
a slow intravenous infusion of a calcium gluconate solution. This solution
must be administered slowly; it can stop the heart if given too quickly.
Cows which do not respond to the intravenous injection may be suffering
from a complication of the condition called the "downer cow" syndrome.
Therefore, it is advisable to contact your veterinarian for diagnosis
before starting treatment.<p>
 
<b>FEEDING TO PREVENT MILK FEVER</b><p>
 
Providing a ration with adequate levels of calcium and phosphorus during
the dry period is the most practical method of reducing the incidence of
milk fever. The feeding program should be adjusted so the calcium:
phosphorus ratio of the total ration is between 1.5:1 and 2.5:1. Ratios not
in this range increase the risk of milk fever.<p>
 
The actual amounts of calcium and phosphorus in the diet are also
important. Minimum percentages needed in the total diet for dry cows are
0.40 percent calcium and 0.26 percent phosphorus (dry basis). Intakes of
more than 0.2 pounds of calcium per dry cow per day should be avoided.<p>
 
The dairy cow's parathyroid gland secretes a hormone which draws calcium
from the cow's bones to help meet the increased demand for calcium when
milk flow begins at freshening. High levels of calcium in the dry cow diet
cause the parathyroid gland to become less active. When this mechanism of
bone calcium mobilization is not activated, the cow is forced to rely
mainly on calcium absorption from the gut which is often inadequate for
high levels of milk production. Feeding rations low in calcium for two
weeks prior to calving has been helpful in stimulating parathyroid activity
and reducing the incidence of milk fever. This practice should be used only
in problem herds. It is important that adequate levels of calcium be fed
both before and after the two week treatment period.<p>
 

<h4><center>TROUBLE-SHOOTING MILK FEVER AND <a NAME="DOWNER">DOWNER</a> COW PROBLEMS</center></h4>

ADAMS, R.S., & L.J. HUTCHINSON  HERD AND ANIMAL HEALTH,  1987<p>
 
<pre>Probable Causes:
 
1. Decreased mass of the calcium pool prior to parturition and failure of
calcium absorption to increase fast enough after the onset of lactation.
 
2. Excessive bone formation due to elevated levels of gonadal hormones.
 
Probable Factors Involved:
 
1. Low calcium intake especially for dry cows
2. Low phosphorus intake
3. Excessive calcium intake  (High legume intake by dry cows; Over
supplementation with calcium.)
. . .
 
10. Toxemia
11. Nerve or muscle damage   (Injury at calving, damage from going down, or
lying on limbs for a prolonged period.)
 
 
Problem Situations:
 
1. When over 10-15% of the cows are afflicted on an annual basis, the
higher value applies to a herd with a lot of previous cases which may make
the cows more susceptible.
 
2. When a high proportion of cows in a sizeable group of freshenings is
afflicted. (ex. 5 out of 8 cows).
 
Forms:</pre>
 
1. Typical milk fever - Acute form affecting cows usually within a few days
after parturition, but sometimes in late lactation or dry period. Responds
well to treatment.<p>
 
2. Refractory or atypical milk fever - Acute form with little or no
response to treatment. Cow may remain alert, eat and milk but cannot regain
its feet, may become a "creeping" downer cow with flexed pasterns and
posterior paralysis. Rupture of the large muscle or group of muscles in one
or both hind legs may complicate the picture. Similar fracture or
dislocation of a high joint may have occurred when the cow went down
initially or in struggling to rise. In addition to usual treatment,
administer intramuscularly 50 mg of selenium and 680 units vitamin E. As a
last resort, do not milk for 24-48 hours or inflate udder with air, and
administer 2 lbs of Epsom salts in one gallon of water to remove possible
toxins and provide ample magnesium.<p>
 
3. Tremors or sub-acute - Cows easily excited, twitching, tremors. Usually
a number of cows involved, many of which are in late lactation, dry or
recently fresh. Often there is magnesium involvement.<p>
 
<pre>Control Suggestions:
 
1. Make certain that standard plus mineral tests on forages are available.
2. Submit feed program request with notation of high incidence in proper
place on form.
3. Submit blood samples for metabolic profiling at the Large Animal
Diagnostic Lab, Penn State or other laboratories.
. . .
5. Use plain calcium borogluconate for the initial treatment to
keep refractory cases at a minimum.
 
6. Last resort - use one of the following:
 
a. Feed mixed with the grain or other quickly eaten feed, 100 grams (3.5
oz) of ammonium chloride per head daily beginning not less than 2 days
before and continuing at least 2 days after freshening..\
. . .
d. Administer high calcium boluses (about 75 grams of calcium
carbonate as soon as possible after calving and within 8 hours of
freshening.

75% of all downed cattle are preventable by good management. It is likely
that 10% of the bad dairies areresponsible for 90% of the downers.<p>
 
Observations by the author indicate that cattle with broken limbs are a

<hr> <h3><center>Exchange of Views on <a NAME="Stetsonville">Stetsonville</a> Mink</center></h3>

<pre>
1)  Last case in U.S. of TME in mink was in 1985, over ten years ago.
 
2)  Non-ambulatory cattle still fed (raw) to U.S. mink.
 
3)  Since 1985 outbreak, the U.S. Mink industry has realized
    that sheep materials should be avoided due to scrapie.

 [Actually, scrapie was considered the likely cause of TME for quite some time
PRIOR to the 1985 outbreak, which is significant primarily because it
contraindicates sheep as the source of infection.]

4)  Setsonville Mink Rancher does not support the comment that
    only 'downed' cows were fed prior to 1985 outbreak.  States
    that other "uncharacterized" animal materials were fed.

 [If by "uncharacterized" you mean "not exclusively downer cows," this is
correct. However, the rancher was emphatic that sheep were NOT fed.]

5)  USDA concluded 1993 report with "Given the potentially
    large number of nonambulatory cows fed to mink and the
    historically sporatic occurrence of spongiform
    encepalopathy in mink, it was concluded that if a TSE
    exists in U.S. cattle, then it is very rare or the
    conditions for its transmission to mink must be highly
    specific."  (BSE: Implications for the U.S., 12/93,
    USDA:APHIS:VS).<p>

 [This is correct and in line with Marsh's conclusions. Marsh speculates that
if a strain of BSE is responsible for TMEs, it may be occurring through
spontaneous mutations similar to the mutations which have been theorized as
the cause for incidence of "spontaneous CJD" in the human population at a
rate of one case per million people per year. This is, of course, theory and
conjecture.]</pre>

<h3><center>EU <a NAME="curbs">curbs</a> beef output to halt fall in prices</center></h3>

Daily Telegraph ... Thursday July 11 1996<br>
By Toby Helm, EU Correspondent, in Brussels<p>


EMERGENCY measures to cut European Union beef production are
being drawn up by Brussels amid growing concern that the market is
failing to recover after the BSE crisis. <p>

Franz Fischler, the EU agriculture commissioner, said yesterday that
action was urgently needed if a continuing fall in beef prices
throughout Europe was to be reversed. "The chaos unleashed upon the beef
sector of the European Union by the BSE crisis has been so precipitous,
and of such magnitude, that it is unparalleled in the history of the
common agricultural policy," said Mr Fischler. <p>

Among measures being considered by Brussels are the imposition of
maximum weight limits for cattle that can be bought into intervention
and less generous EU grants for farmers rearing beef cattle. Such
measures, which are likely to be tabled by Mr Fischler at a meeting of
farm ministers on July 22, would be another blow to British beef farmers
in the short term. <p>

Mr Fischler said yesterday: "The economic viability of the beef sector
in the future can only be guaranteed through a rebalancing of the
market. The livelihoods of millions of beef producers, and the economic
stability of the whole beef industry of the European Union, is under
serious threat if urgent and radical action is not taken." <p>

Continuing falls in beef prices have forced the European Commission to
buy up 180,000 tonnes of beef since the beginning of the "mad cow"
crisis. By the end of the year stocks bought into intervention could be
more than 600,000, leaving the EU with another large beef mountain to
clear. In the past, it had been possible for the community to sell its
intervention beef at low prices on the world market, but recent changes
in world trade agreements have rendered this impossible. <p>

"Given this scenario, there is a very real danger of an unprecedented
level of beef intervention stock overhanging and depressing the market,"
said Mr Fischler. It was against this "bleak outlook" that measures "to
reduce beef output as radidly as possible" were being drawn up, he
added. <hr>

The Times,  editorial comment<br>
17 July 1996<p>


HELP may be on its way to the Meat and Livestock Commission, which had
its wrists slapped by the Advertising Standards Authority last week. 

The ASA upheld complaints over one of the Commissions newspaper
advertisements, which stated that beef was perfectly safe to eat and
that there were even cases of vegetarians getting CJD, the human
equivalent of "mad cow" disease.<p>

Rumour has it that a complimentary copy of the Richards Butler "A Guide
to UK Advertising and Sales Promotion Law" is currently winging its way
to the commission's HQ in Milton Keynes. 

Helpfully, it contains a special chapter entitled "Misleading
Advertisements".

Dealler's <A HREF="http://neon.airtime.co.uk/bse/">rumours/gossip section</A>.  Note he is sponsoring a free <A HREF="http://www.airtime.co.uk/bse/input.htm">Internet BSE journal and conference</A>.<P>

The information is probably high grade info but
there is no backup info. He may of heard it from Prof. L:acey who hears it from clinicians. <P>

 The additional cases are practically certainly
new cases with the appropriate symptoms who are still alive, when they
die they perform an autopsy and they go into the official count if CJD2
is confirmed.  The rate of the new variant of CJD looks like steady at about 1
case per week.<hr>

<h3><center>Can humans get scrapie from <a NAME="eating">eating</a> sheep?</center></h3>


Adapted from Listserve item ... 17 July 1996<p>

"In Italy, people commonly eat sheep"s brain. Lo-Russo et al. (1980) point
out that the distribution of CJD corresponds with that of sheep-keeping in
Central and South Italy. As 6 of the 8 cases are women, they suspect that
the agent passes over during the process of preparing food, more than by
eating.<p>
 
In France, where brains are also very popular, the first case of V-CJD out of
GB was duly confirmed. Besides, the CJD correlates with the population
density. Perhaps in big towns such delicacies are eaten preferably?<p>
 
In Slovaky, in a sheep area, the accumulation of CJD is particularly striking
(Mayer, 1977). The authors report that scrapie wasn't noticed there, but
perhaps scrapie is just a well kept secret there as in GB since the 19th
century; the reports on scrapie are contradictory.<p>
 
In GB, scrapie appeared in the 18th century for the first time, first in
South England (Stamp, 1958) and spread afterwards. It would be interesting to
know if it happened to be Kent where the first cases of BSE and after that
the clusters of CJD were found?<p>
 
As far as the Libyan Jews are concerned, they are a small community.
Possibly, they make use of their own breeding of sheep with scrapie-infected
sheep. Perhaps other ethnic groups with equal eating habits have got
scrapie-free sheep? [CJD here has been attributed to a codon 200 mutation -- webmaster]<p>
 
Whoever states the genetic constellation as proof to the contrary should also
explain why frequently sections of the population involved in sheep breeding
and eating are affected by CJD. I think the genetic peculiarities deliver the
disposition, but they aren't the cause.<p>

 A herd of 155 cows in the Cantal region of central France was
slaughtered yesterday after one was found to have BSE. The animal was
born in 1991, after the ban on livestock feed imported from Britain came
into effect. It was the ninth case in France this year and the 22nd
since 1990, officials said. <hr>

<h3><center>Scientists' report raises new fear for beef <a NAME="deal">deal</a></center></h3>
 FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN STRASBOURG<br>
THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS ... July 17 1996<p>


THE safety of British beef by-products was thrown into question again yesterday when the European Commission reported scientific doubts about the conditions under which Britain is to be allowed to resume exports after a hard-fought agreement last month.

<p>

Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, reported that "the whole issue of gelatine" was to be re-examined today by a new multi-disciplinary committee which was created to handle the BSE emergency. He was addressing the European Parliament after MEPs expressed their anger over the disclosure of an old Commission memo that reported an alleged decision to stifle news of the epidemic.

<p>

Although gelatine and tallow, the two main by-products, are not yet back on the export market, the fresh doubts about their safety are a blow to Britain because the decision to lift the ban on them was deemed a breakthrough in the campaign to end the whole embargo. Britain launched its non-cooperation campaign when EU officials initially refused to lift the ban, claiming that the by-products could be infected. Germany and other European states have continued to insist on the possible risks from the by-products despite the easing of the ban, taken after a narrow majority supported the action.

<p>

Officials said a scientific committee had found evidence to suggest that gelatine could still carry the infective agent for BSE when treated at the temperatures imposed in the deal with Britain. Other methods might have to be sought to neutralise the agent, they said.

<p>

"The issue is partly academic because there is no sign that the manufacturers of gelatine in Britain are close to meeting the standards we set in June," a Commission spokesman said. "But it is now possible that we will have to increase those standards before allow ing exports to resume." The latest worry over the by-products is certain to bolster Germany's refusal to ease any aspect of the beef embargo. Bonn is heading for a collision with the Commission and Britain over its continuing blanket ban.

<p>

Continuing passions over the beef affair were on display in the Strasbourg Parliament yesterday as Jacques Santer, President of the Commission, struggled to quell the indignation of MEPs over the 1990 note in which a Brussels official reported an alleged decision to play down BSE disease through "disinformation".

<p>

Mr Santer reported that his inquiry had shown that the note, which was disclosed in France last month, gave a false account of a veterinary committee meeting in October 1990. Its author, Gilbert Castille, an official who has now retired, had been reflecting a personal bias in a low-level report on the meeting, Mr Santer said. Other officials at the meeting had denied the truth of his account, he added.

<p>

Styling themselves the guardians of the European consumer, MEPs from every main group accused the Commission of sins ranging from incompetence to deliberate obfuscation because it had failed to lead an adequate campaign against BSE. The far-right French National Front likened the Commission to "one of history's great poisoners of humanity". The "mad cow" epidemic was the consequence of the lust for unrestricted free trade, one MEP said.

<p>

Several parties called for an official inquiry. The dominant Socialist group said the note was "the quintessence of everything that the public finds wrong with the Commission." Graham Watson, a British Liberal Democrat MEP, said: "The cover-up of this issue has been the UK's Chernobyl."

<h3><center>Research blow to <a NAME="gelatin">gelatin</a> exports</center></h3>
Daily Telegraph ... Wednesday July 17 1996<br>
                   
By Toby Helm <p>

THE ROW with Europe over the ban on beef derivatives threatened to blow
up again yesterday after a warning by Brussels that even tougher hygiene
standards may be demanded for the manufacture of gelatin. <p>

European Commission officials said yesterday that production standards
agreed last month as the basis for lifting the ban on gelatin exports
may have to be tightened again after a new study called for the
temperature requirements to be reconsidered [for adequacy in making beef-derived gelatin non-infectious]. 
<p>
The commission's committee of scientists and vets will meet in Brussels
today to discuss the research findings. 

Any move to tighten the rules further is likely to lead to accusations
from Government ministers that the commission and member states are
going back on their word.

<h3><center>Hopes for <a NAME="exporting">exporting</a> to non-EU countries</center></h3>
Daily Telegraph ... Thursday July 11 1996<p>


THE European Court of Justice is expected to make an interim judgment
today on Britain's complaint that the EU export ban on British beef is
illegal, writes David Brown, Agriculture Editor. <p>

Government lawyers are optimistic that the preliminary judgment will
allow the removal of the ban on exports of beef and beef products to
about 70 non-EU countries. Britain exported 191,000 tons of beef a year,
worth 457 million pounds, to EU countries before the beef crisis broke
in March. Export to non-EU countries totalled only 55,000 tons, worth 63
million pounds. [Thus 28% by weight or 13% by dollar value went to non-EU countries.]<hr>

BELGRADE - Yugoslavia has sent police and army units to seal off southern municipalities identified as having livestock infected with foot-and-mouth disease, according to agricultural officials.


    In an interview with the independent BK Television on Sunday evening, Federal Agriculgure Minister Tihomir Vrebalov said the police and army had established three "defensive lines" in a bid to stop the disease from spreading.<p>

    Vrebalov said several municipalities had been isolated in border regions of the southern province of Kosovo where the highly infectious disease was first detected last week.

    "We have deployed police and veterinary teams on the eight roads connecting Kosovo with Serbia -- this is our second line of defence," he told BKTV. "A third line is the blockade which has been set up in Serbian municipalities bordering Kosovo."

    He said the army had also moved to prevent all uncontrolled crossings of the Yugoslav borders with Albania and Macedonia.<p>

    Police investigating the spread of the disease through the Balkans say it appeared to originate in Greece earlier this month, before it struck in Albania.

    Cattle smugglers have been blamed for bringing it from Albania to Macedonia, while free grazing in border regions with Yugoslavia is believed responsible for the Kosovo epidemic.<p>

    The head of the crisis team established to contain the disease, Dr Georgije Trbojevic, said some 180 veterinarians were touring the affected areas, slaughtering any animals diagnosed as having contracted foot-and-mouth.

    At least 125 head of cattle had been killed by Monday morning, although that figure was expected to rise.<p>

    A veterinary expert, Marija Popovic said Yugoslavia had no significant quantities of foot-and-mouth vaccines in stock, and would have to import them from other parts of Europe.

    In 1974, the former Yugoslavia was declared free of the disease.

<h3><a NAME="Austria">Austria</a> warns of harmful bacteria in meat, milk</h3>
 Nando.net, Reuter Information Service<br>
Jul 17, 1996<p>

    VIENNA -- Austria's health ministry on Wednesday advised consumers to steer clear of raw meat and unpasteurised milk, saying they could be infected with a dangerous strain of bacteria.


    "Make sure all milk is pasteurised or boiled and meat is well cooked, especially minced meat," the ministry said in a statement.<p>

    Since May, seven out of 1,100 samples of meat and cow's and goat's milk have been found to contain a strain of Escherichia coli bacteria, more commonly known as E.coli.

    The virulent bacteria, which is borne by fecal material, have been shown to cause diarrhoea and kidney damage but can also prove deadly, especially in the elderly and children.<p>

    "We encourage small children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with weak immune systems to steer clear of raw sandwich meats and raw milk products," the minstry said.

    But it said all milk sold in supermarkets and properly cooked meat was safe.<p>

    The E.coli detected in the samples were a strain of the parasite which had only recently surfaced in Austria, the statement said.<p>

    In 1993, four children died in the northwestern United States after eating hamburgers infected with E.coli.

TOKYO -- Schoolteachers in a western Japanese city canvassed their pupils' homes Monday, searching for the cause of a food poisoning outbreak that has put nearly 500 children in the hospital.


Officials in the city of Sakai have yet to pinpoint the source of infections of the E. coli O157 bacteria, which is spread through a variety of foods as well as human contact.

<P>

Sakai is the latest of several areas to suffer outbreaks of food poisoning. Altogether the number of victims has topped 8,200 people, with four deaths, the Health Ministry said Monday. 



At least one poisoning case, in Yokohama, has been attributed to raw beef liver. Suspicion has also fallen on dishes such as cold noodles and pork, a summer favorite in Japan.

<P>

School lunches were blamed for a large number of cases, but nearly all schools have now closed for summer vacation. In Sakai, public schoolteachers were visiting the homes of pupils one by one, trying to determine which dishes each student had eaten.

<P>

By Monday afternoon, 478 children were hospitalized.



E. coli is particularly dangerous to children, who are at risk of a disastrous complication called hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, that causes kidney failure.

<h3><center>Meat <a NAME="Inspections">Inspections</A> Face Overhaul, First in Nearly a Century</center></h3>

>By TODD S. PURDUM<br>
July 7, 1996 NY Times
<p>   
WASHINGTON  --  President Clinton on Saturday announced the most
sweeping changes in the government's meat inspection system since
it was created nearly a century ago, outlining new rules that
would, for the first time, impose scientific tests for
disease-causing bacteria.
<p>   The new rules call for more inspection and controls by the meat-
and poultry-processing industry itself and new testing by the
Department of Agriculture. Drafted over the last two years, the
rules will be final upon their publication in the Federal Register
next week. They are to take effect in stages, some immediately and
some over the next two to three years, officials said.
<p>   "These new meat and poultry contamination safeguards will be
the strongest ever," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
<p>   "Parents should know that when they serve a chicken dinner,
they are not putting their children at risk," Clinton said.
<p>   Since the federal Meat Inspection Act was passed in 1907  --  after
the publication of Upton Sinclair's muckraking expose of the
industy, "The Jungle"  --  inspectors have relied on the "sniff and
poke method" to certify that carcasses are safe to eat as they
pass along a conveyor belt. But inspectors cannot always detect
contaminated meat just by quickly smelling or looking for the
obvious signs of decay.
<p>   The government had wanted processors to perform microbial tests
for the presence of the deadly salmonella bacteria, which kills
more than 4,000 people a year and sickens as many as 5 million, and
for E. coli bacteria, which indicates fecal contamination and can
be deadly in some forms. But in a compromise, processors will test
for E. coli. and federal inspectors will conduct tests for
salmonella at various stages in the process.
<p>   Consumer groups have been pressing for change since a virulent
strain of E. coli bacteria traced to undercooked hamburgers at Jack
in the Box restaurants killed several children in the Pacific
Northwest in 1993 and sickened hundreds of others. Saturday, such
groups joined industry representatives in praising the new rules.
<p>   "This rule is a landmark in improving meat and poultry
safety," said Caroline Smith De Waal, director of food safety for
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group.
"While it may need some fine-tuning, nonetheless it provides the
blueprint. They're giving more responsibility to the industry,
while at the same time providing adequate government oversight."
<p>   Gary M. Weber, director of animal health and meat inspection for
the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, an industry group, said:
"We're very pleased that after a 10-year struggle to redesign the
meat inspection system, we're at the first stages of implementing a
modern, scientific-based prevention system."
<p>   Inaugurating these new rules in an election year, the president
gave credit to consumer groups, especially the parents of the young
victims of the Pacific Northwest outbreak, who pressed for these
changes.
<p>   "The parents of many of the E. coli victims turned their grief
into a determination to help others," Clinton said. "In the face
of this unspeakable tragedy, they had one insistent question: How
could this have happened?"
<p>   Under the new rules, packers and slaughterhouses will be
required to establish a system known as hazard analysis and
critical control points, identifying each point and potential
problem in the process  --  such as cutting, grinding and overheating
 --  where contamination can occur and developing steps to prevent it.
The bacterial tests are intended to assure that the new safety
steps work, officials said.
<p>   Companies will have as long as 42 months to set up hazard
control systems, with smaller companies having the longest time to
comply. Eventually, plants will be required to reduce their
salmonella contamination to below the prevailing national average
for the type of meat they process. For example, 20 percent of
broiler chickens are contaminated with salmonella.
<p>   Within six months, companies will also have to set up new
sanitation systems to insure cleanliness.
<p>   Just months ago, when it became clear that the government would
not require processors themselves to test for salmonella, consumer
groups were sharply critical. But they participated in negotiations
over the final rules and now seem content to claim victory.
<p>   Ms. Smith De Waal of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest said that even though the industry will not be required to
conduct its own salmonella testing, companies will undoubtedly have
to test for the bacteria as part of their efforts to prove their
safety systems are effective.
<p>   "We didn't get everything we wanted," she said. "We wanted
mandatory salmonella testing by industry. But we did get it wrapped
into the initial validation work the industry will have to do."
<p>   The Republicans responded to Clinton's announcement by raising
questions about his behavior toward the meat industry when he was
governor of Arkansas, saying his actions then "left more than half
the streams in his home state too polluted for drinking, swimming
or fishing."
<p>   "As usual, Bill Clinton's past raises questions about his
credibility, even on an issue as nonpartisan as food safety," said
a news release from the Bob Dole for President committee. "After
waiting three years to take action, Bill Clinton today didn't
explain how his new election year 'get-tough with the meat
industry' attitude squares with his old 'easy-come, easy-go'
treatment of the same industry in Arkansas."
<p>   Some congressional Republicans tried to block the new rules, and
threatened to withhold appropriations for new inspectors and
training, arguing that they might be too onerous for the industry.
But administration officials said the new rules were intended to
grant the industry new flexibility in exchange for its assuring the
safety of its own processes.
<p>   "For years, we have had the government doing the work, the
inspectors in the plants, and you hear stories of cursory checks
and that's it," said Sally Katzen, administrator of the office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and
Budget.
<p>   "This is an attempt to get away from government micromanaging
the process and instead saying to the regulated entity, 'You figure
out how to do it, you're responsible, and we'll do some testing to
make sure there are performance standards.'"
<p>   The regulations build on similar standards for seafood
inspection issued nine months ago, Ms. Katzen said.<br>

The <a NAME="New">New</a> Meat Inspection Program</center></h3>

By NEIL A. LEWIS<BR>
7 July 96 NY Times<p>

WASHINGTON  --  The new inspection system announced Friday by the
Clinton administration provides for the government and the industry
to share responsibility for monitoring and testing meat and poultry
all along the processing chain from slaughter to the grocery shelf.
<p>   There are four major components of the program, which
Agriculture Department officials say is a profound change from the
current system that is based largely on sensory testing  --  the
"poke and sniff" test  --  that varies from plant to plant.
<p>   "Meat and poultry inspections now are subjective tests based on
seeing, feeling, touching," Dan Glickman, the secretary of
agriculture, said in an interview Friday. "What these rules do is
basically say we are moving to a science-based system."
<p>   Glickman described the current system as "catch as catch can."
Some companies, especially the larger ones, have already put in
place many of the changes that will become mandatory under the new
rules. But, he said, there is no modern, systematic monitoring of
the industry.
<p>   The main elements of the program are:
<p>    --  The federal government will set standards for contamination by
salmonella bacteria, and the Agriculture Department, for the first
time, will be responsible for conducting tests for that
disease-causing contaminant. Beginning this summer, no plant will
be allowed to exceed the current average contamination. Twenty
percent of chicken products currently show a trace of salmonella
contamination; for turkey products the level is 49 percent. Plants
not meeting that standard face penalties and ultimately could be
closed. The Department plans to tighten those standards in 16
months.
<p>    --  The processors will be required to test all their products for
the bacteria E. Coli, which is considered a reliable indicator of
fecal contamination. The department will not require the total
elimination of all such bacteria but will require plants to keep
contamination below a minimum level.
<p>    --  Each plant that processes meat and poultry will be required to
identify a series of critical points along the chain during which
the product could become contaminated, similar to what the
Agriculture Department required of fish processors last year. The
plants would have to check for contamination at each of the
checkpoints from when the product is received from the farm to when
it goes out to the grocery.
<p>   The Department of Agriculture will have to approve each plant's
program of checkpoints. Michael R. Taylor, the acting
undersecretary of agriculture for food safety said Friday that only
a minority of the nation's processing plants currently have such
programs.
<p>    --  All processing plants would have to adopt a written plan
within three months to keep them free from contamination. This
would include items such as what the plant does to ensure that
surface bacteria from an animal's skin is not carried into the meat
when it is slaughtered.
<p>   Taylor estimated the cost to the industry at $80 million
annually and said it would cost consumers a tenth of a cent per
pound on meat products. The government is planning to carry out the
program using current funds.
<p>   Carol Tucker Foreman, a former agriculture secretary and now the
head of the Safe Food Coalition, said the program was a major
change in how the government views meat contamination. She said the
program will not only save the lives of thousands of people each
year but will also save billions of dollars in annual health
costs.

<hr><h3><a NAME="Lessons">Lessons</a> Are Sought In Outbreak of Illness From Tainted Meat</h2>
By  LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.<br>
Public health officials around the country are pondering the lessons of the
outbreak of illness from undercooked hamburgers sold by the Jack in the Box
fast-food chain. The outbreak was the largest and most serious of a dangerous
bacterium that has struck before and will surely strike again.
<p>   After the initial outbreak, which caused the death of a 2-year-old boy, the
total number of confirmed and probable cases has risen to 400, Dr. John M.
Kobayashi, the Washington State epidemiologist, said in an interview yesterday. 
<p>    The tainted hamburger was voluntarily removed from sale on Jan. 18, and
there have been no new primary cases since then. To minimize a second wave of
the outbreak -- transmission from those who ate the tainted hamburger to others
in their homes, day care-centers and workplace -- health officials warned people
to wash their hands frequently. Whether or not for that reason, the number of
secondary cases is coming in less than feared, with only 35 in Washington State.
A few cases have also been reported in Nevada and Idaho.
<p>   "It's pretty encouraging," Dr. Kobayashi said, adding that his team continued
to be cautious.
<p>   Nevertheless, one measure of the seriousness of the Washington outbreak was
that 125 people had to be admitted to a hospital, Dr. Kobayashi said.
<p>   The tainted meat has led to kidney failure in at least 29 people and forced
21 to undergo kidney dialysis, said Dr. Ellis D. Avner, a kidney expert at
Children's Hospital in Seattle. Seven children with kidney damage caused by the
ailment were still in the hospital and three of the four undergoing dialysis
were in critical condition yesterday.
<p>   A 2-year-old girl also died in the outbreak in Washington, but health
officials have not been able to link her case to Jack in the Box hamburgers or
to any other case. They are still investigating.
<p>   Public health officials have many reasons to be concerned about E. coli
0157:H7, the bacterium that causes the illness involved in the outbreak. It can
crop up anywhere from municipal water and apple cider to rare hamburgers, one of
Americans' favorite foods. Doctors have not yet decided on the most effective
treatment and in most cases at present can do little more than let the disease
take its course. Antibiotics do not seem to help and may even make the disease
worse. The symptoms can range from mild to extremely violent, leading
occasionally to death, especially among children and the elderly.
<p>   E. coli 0157:H7 is a variant of one of the most common bacteria that live
harmlessly by the billions in the human gut.
<p>   The bacterium can cause diarrhea that is often bloody, severe bleeding,
anemia and kidney failure that requires dialysis. The bacterium can also produce
a wide variety of baffling symptoms, even fooling doctors into performing
unnecessary surgery.
<p>   The bacterial illness was unknown until 11 years ago, when it was linked to
tainted hamburger and added to the small list of potentially fatal food-borne
ailments.
<p>   Now the ailment is an important and growing public health problem. But
Federal health officials say that the true scope of the problem cannot be
measured because laboratories do not routinely test for the particular bacterium
because of time and cost.
<p>   Many experts have urged that more laboratories use the special culture medium
that is needed to identify E. coli 0157:H7 because identifying the organism can
affect therapy, eliminate the need for expensive unneeded diagnostic procedures
like barium enemas and colonoscopies, and can lead to recognition of outbreaks.
<p>   Epidemiologists have found that many cases go undetected unless there is a
cluster of kidney failure cases, or because large numbers of people are
hospitalized simultaneously with severe diarrheal illness.
<p>   Washington is one of the few states where E. coli 0157:H7 is a reportable
illness. More active surveillance is needed in other states to detect cases and
prevent further outbreaks, said Dr. Patricia M. Griffin, an expert in the
ailment at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
<p>   She and other experts have urged studies to determine the risks and benefits
of antibiotic therapy for the ailment.
<p>   Outbreaks can be particularly difficult to avoid because cattle are a key
reservoir of the bacterium. Dr. Griffin and other experts said there was a
critical need for studies of the mechanism by which meat becomes contaminated
with E. coli during slaughter and processing and of ways to reduce such
contamination. They suspect that most meat is contaminated at the time of
slaughter and that undercooked hamburger is the chief means of spread.
Undercooking is believed to be a greater problem than contamination by an
infected food handler.
<p>   E. coli 0157:H7 differs from other members of the E. coli family in that it
clings to the wall of the cell in the bowel and produces a toxin that can cause
bleeding. Precisely how the toxin damages tissues throughout the body is not
known, and it might be this factor that makes antibiotics ineffective.
<p>   Doctors and individuals can recognize the infection by its spectrum of
symptoms, which in addition to bloody diarrhea can include abdominal cramps and
vomiting, but often without fever. The illness usually resolves itself in about
a week. But complications can develop at any time, most commonly in the very
young and in the elderly.
<p>The most feared complication is hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is the
leading cause of acute kidney failure in children. Many children may need to
undergo dialysis. Although most soon recover, about 15 percent go on to need
permanent dialysis or a kidney transplant.
<p>   "It always hits healthy kids," said Dr. Howard Trachtman, a specialist in
kidney diseases of children at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park,
L.I. He is working with Robert Galler, who has established a foundation to
increase awareness and support research for a cure for the ailment that killed
his daughter, Lois Joy Galler, last July.
<p>   The ailment can easily be misdiagnosed. Severe abdominal pain and intestinal
bleeding from E. coli 0157:H7 infection has led surgeons to operate
unnecessarily and remove sections of the bowel and to mistakenly diagnose
inflammatory bowel disease.
<p>   E. coli's newly recognized role in human disease resulted partly from
happenstance in 1982 through an investigation of two outbreaks of a distinctive
bloody diarrheal illness among those who ate tainted hamburgers, including
customers at a McDonald's in Oregon and Michigan.
<p>   Laboratory workers, suspecting another microbe, were surprised to detect E.
coli 0157:H7 in cultures from a few cases. Because the particular type had never
been linked to human infection, though E. coli has been known for about a
century, proof of its causal role required further investigation. Even then, E.
coli 0157:H7 was thought to be a medical oddity.
<p>   Then came a link to the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which had been a puzzle
since it was first reported in 1955 in Switzerland. Because such cases occurred
in clusters, scientists had theorized that it was caused by a microbe. But the
many microbial candidates fell by the wayside as researchers ran into many dead
ends before E. coli was suspected.
<p>   Now, epidemiologists are finding that the ailment can strike anyone at any
age, with the highest rates in children under 5, especially for the kidney
complications. Adults may develop a bleeding disorder known as thrombocytopenic
purpura, or TTP.
<p>   The ailment has been reported throughout the world. Canada has noted a
problem with it, and for unknown reasons most of the cases in the United States
have been in states like Washington and Minnesota that border on Canada and that
have active surveillance programs.
<p>   Limited surveillance has shown that outbreaks in restaurants can occur at any
time but that sporadic cases occur most frequently in the summer.
<p>   Hamburger seems to pose the greatest risk because such meat is ground and
mixed, providing a large surface area for growth of the bacteria. Little risk of
illness from these bacteria exists if hamburger has been thoroughly cooked, as
pork usually is. But if hamburger is undercooked, bacteria inside a hamburger
patty may escape destruction. If the bacteria are on the surface of steak and
rib meat, they are generally killed when the outside is cooked even though the
inside may be rare, health officials said.
<p>As a result of the investigation of the Washington outbreak, the Food and
Drug Administration has recommended that the Federal minimum cooking temperature
for ground beef be raised to 155 degrees from 140.
<p>   Mike Espy, the Secretary of Agriculture, has also pledged to tighten Federal
meat inspection standards.
<p>   But some critics contend that only irradiation of meat will eliminate the
hazard of infection from E. coli 0157:H7 and other dangerous microbes because no
meat is sterile and most contains millions of bacteria.<hr>


<h3><center><a NAME="Tainted">Tainted</a> Hamburger Raises Doubts on Meat Safety</center></h2>
By  TIMOTHY EGAN<br>
Jan. 27, 1993 NY Times<p>

At Children's Hospital here, a 9-year-old girl is hanging on to life by a
thread after eating tainted hamburger. A 2-year-old boy has already died, and 16
other children are being treated for severe illness brought on by the same
contaminated meat.
<p>   Federal officials say the cries of these children are raising alarms across
the nation about how meat, particularly hamburger, is processed, inspected and
cooked. In the last two weeks, more than 200 people in the Pacific Northwest and
a handful of people in other Western states have been stricken with E. coli
0157:H7, a bacterium that has killed 16 people nationwide since it was first
identified 10 years ago.  
<p>    The hamburgers in the most recent outbreak came from the Jack in the Box
food chain, which has 1,170 restaurants, all west of the Mississippi. In an
interview today, Robert Nugent, president of company, said the chain cooked its
meat below a standard set by Washington State. 
 
More Illness Expected
<p>    "This is a catastrophe," Mr. Nugent said. "It has become clear that we were
not cooking our meat in compliance with Washington State standards." The company
has 60 restaurants in the state.
<p>   He added: "This has opened up a lot of people's eyes. We know all meat has
bacteria, but how much of that bacteria will kill somebody?"
<p>   He said the company was in violation of the safe-cooking regulations because
it was unaware that last May Washington had set a higher temperature requirement
of 155 degrees inside the meat, a level that normally produces a medium
hamburger. That required temperature is the highest in the nation.
<p>   This state's chief epidemiologist, Dr. John Kobayashi, said he expected the
toll of serious illnesses to continue to climb for the next few days. Although
the tainted meat was recalled last Monday, the illness has an incubation period
of up to nine days, he said.
<p>   "This has been a nightmare for the parents," said Dean Forbes, a spokesman
for Children's Hospital, whose doctors first alerted health authorities about
the outbreak. "To think that something as benign as hamburger could kill a kid 
is just startling to most people."
<p>   In the wake of the food poisoning outbreak, Federal officials say they are
considering raising the minimum guidelines for cooking processed beef to
something above the current level of 140 degrees. That is the standard most
states follow and close to the level at which Jack in the Box was cooking the
meat that has been traced to 200 cases of severe food poisoning.
 
Batch Was Contaminated
<p>    But it is not just the cooking of meat that has come under criticism. After
laboratory analysis by state and Federal health scientists, Jack in the Box last
Monday recalled about 28,000 pounds of frozen hamburger patties from a batch of
meat found to have been heavily contaminated with the strain of bacteria that
health officials say caused the outbreak. Another 40,000 patties were consumed,
officials said, in Washington, Nevada and parts of Southern California.
<p>   The fact that so much contaminated meat could be shipped to retail outlets
without being detected has called attention to the meat safety process itself.
Federal officials say that 7,400 inspectors examine the carcasses of 120 million
animals a year and that very little contaminated meat gets through. But the
inspections are limited to visual examinations, for discolored meat, rather than
laboratory analysis of certain samples.
<p>   "It's unbelievable that such a low level of inspection exists in a society so
advanced," said Joseph Dolan, whose two young daughters suffered kidney failure
after eating contaminated cheeseburgers from Jack in the Box. "No matter where
you buy ground beef, you're susceptible to getting sick."
<p>   Federal officials say about 6,000 cases of illness caused by E. coli 0157:H7
are reported each year. The strain, first discovered in 1982, is a particularly
virulent form of a bacteria found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. In
about 10 percent to 15 percent of the reported cases, it will cause hemolytic
uremic syndrome, an illness that can lead to a failure of the kidneys and heart,
and to death. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable.
<p>   Washington raised its meat-cooking standards last May in response to a
previous outbreak of E. coli here, in 1986, when two people were killed.
<p>   Roughly four million cases of some type of food poisoning are reported
annually, but the strain of bacteria that caused this outbreak is one of the few
kinds that can kill people. "In terms of severity, this is one of the worst,"
said Dr. Douglas Archer, director of the Federal Government's Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition.
<p>   Dr. Archer, like other food inspection officials interviewed, emphasized that
the nation's food supply might be the safest in the world. "How many billions of
hamburgers are consumed annually with no resulting illness?" he said. "People
should put this case in context."
<p>   But many food experts, in and out of Government, say this outbreak in the
Northwest has pointed to a need to upgrade the inspection system and cooking
process. Despite the elaborate system of inspections, the safety of meat
depends, ultimately, on whether it is cooked adequately enough, officials say.
<p>"Raw meat is flesh -- tissue -- and all tissue contains bacteria," said Jim
Greene, a spokesman for the Food and Safety Inspection Program of the United
States Agriculture Department. "You're never going to get sterile meat."
 
Sampling Begun
<p>    The Government is starting to examine samples from selected meat processing
plants to see whether E. coli and other dangerous bacteria are widespread. If
they find a high level of contamination, they may change the inspection process
to include more laboratory sampling, officials said.
<p>   The tainted meat from Jack in the Box was processed by Vons Companies of
Arcadia, Calif., from cattle slaughtered in California, Colorado and Michigan.
Julie Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the meat processor, said the company was in
compliance with all Federal regulations and, like other plants, has Federal
inspectors who work on the premises.
<p>   "We are confident the contaminated meat did not occur as a result of
processing from Vons," Ms. Reynolds said.
<p>   Other officials have speculated the meat was contaminated at the time it was
slaughtered, but Government investigators have yet to confirm where it was
tainted.
<p>   Even though the meat was badly contaminated, the bacteria could have been
eliminated had the meat been thoroughly cooked to reach the temperature of 155
degrees or above, Federal officials said.
<p>   But Mr. Nugent, the company president, said he questioned whether cooking the
meat at the Washington threshold would have killed the bacteria.
<p>   "I think there is a responsibility at both ends of the food chain," he said.
"How do you explain the fact that for more than 30 years we've been selling
hamburgers without a problem then all of a sudden -- Bam! -- this happens."
 
Higher Cooking Temperature
<p>    The company has since raised the minimum temperature for cooking hamburgers
in all its outlets to 155 degrees, Mr. Nugent said, and has apologized in
full-page newspaper advertisements in the Seattle area.
<p>   Jack in the Box's parent company, Foodmakers Inc., lost 30 percent of its
value in the stock market last week. It has since regained much of the loss. The
company had $1.29 billion in earnings last year; nearly two-thirds of the
revenue came from Jack in the Box outlets, Mr. Nugent said.
<p>   The McDonald's Corporation, the leader in fast-food hamburger sales
nationwide, has long cooked it burgers to a temperature of at least 157 degrees,
said Rebecca A. Lewis, a customer relations representative at the company's
headquarters in Oakbrook, Ill.
<p>   Federal officials said most food poisoning from meat comes from home cooking,
particularly on outdoor grills. The Government recommends that people cook
hamburger to a temperature of 160 degrees.
<p>The death and illnesses in Washington has caused some parents here to
question the safety of fast food. But other parents say they believe that the
incident is a freak occurrence.
<p>   "I don't want to steal my children's joy at going to McDonald's," said Mr.
Dolan, who lives in the Seattle suburb of Kent. "It's part of growing up. My
daughters really enjoy eating there. And I don't want them punished for this
episode."

From a Britsh <a NAME="Correspondent">Correspondent</a><br>
Friday, 12 July 1996<p>

"The article below was found while browsing through the archives.
It is typical of UK Government (the author is on the SEAC committee) in
that it gives as little information as possible whilst giving the
impression that the government is in control and that there is nothing
to worry about. Nevertheless, it gives an insight into the direction of
UK government funded research.

People in the US are not aware that
while the UK puts about the image of the mother of democracies and
all that, it is rather far from the truth. Although we were more
democratic that most countries a long time ago, they have moved on and
we have not. Consider the following:<p>
	
<pre>-       We have an unelected head of state
-       We have an unelected second house
-       Our MPs boast that they vote "according to their conscience"
            ie not in accordance with their constituents wishes
-       The party system "whips" MPs into uniformity
-       The cost of standing for Parliament has been raised
            beyond the affordability of individual citizens
-       We do not have a secret ballot for elections (unbelievable isn't
             it?)
-       We have a formal system for news censorship (the D Notice
            system)
-       Key matters are decided in secret by the Privy Council, which    
            answers only to the sovereign. Members are appointed and include
            the leaders of all the political parties. Hence our loss of
            sovereignty to Europe.
-       We have no documented civil rights or free speech entitlements
             such as you have in the US
-       There is no freedom of information act. In law a civil servant
            can be jailed for revealing what brand of tea his minister drinks
       </pre>

<b>The D Notice system is used not just for national security matters, but
to suppress "unwelcome" information.</b> The UK Windscale and Russian
Chernobyl UK radiation levels were suppressed over here. One of our most
senior Conservative elder statesmen described our political system as
"an elective dictatorship": we elect them but have no control over them.
70% of the people want to bring back hanging for certain crimes but
there is absoluetly no chance of getting it through Parliament.<p>

<b>You have to understand this to appreciate how the BSE crisis developed.</b>
In many ways our political system is more akin to the old communist
regimes in Eastern Europe than a Western democracy. Apart from the
vastly different timescales the UK government reaction to BSE has been
the same as the Russian regime to Chernobyl: first deny it exists, when
that it not possible play it down, then try and make out it is all under
control, and when the truth comes out panic!<p>

I hope this helps people in America put UK news and government actions into context.
As you can imagine, the Internet is having a dramatic impact over here."<HR>

<h3><center>BSE: is British <a NAME="science">science</a> to blame?</center></h3>
The GUARDIAN - OFF LINE<br>
Jeffrey Almond <br>
Wednesday, July 3, 1996<p>


Over the years British researchers have made seminal contributions to
our understanding of the Transmissible Spongiform Encephal-opathies
(TSEs), the group of diseases that includes scrapie in sheep,
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD) in humans and BSE in cattle. The
persistence of scrapie in our sheep flocks prompted much of the early
research on the transmissibility and pathogenesis of this disease. At
that time British research in this area led the world. <p>

Research continued through the 1960s and 1970s, and in the early 1980s
The Neuropathogenesis Unit (NPU), a dedicated institute for TSE
research, was established in Edinburgh. Scientists at the NPU were the
first to identify genes that influenced the incubation period of
scrapie. They also defined scrapie "strains", the existence of which was
doubted for many years by other researchers around the world but which
now promise to shed light on the possible BSE/CJD connection. <p>

More recent discoveries at the unit should allow the eventual
eradication of scrapie from British flocks through selective breeding.
Although the unit was slow off the mark in the era of molecular biology
and it was not in the frame during the crucial period in the mid 1980s
when the prion gene was first isolated and its role in pathogenesis
confirmed, the unit's present research programme as part of the
Institute of Animal Health, which it joined in 1986, includes much good
quality molecular work. <p>

Unfortunately, the IAH has suffered severe cuts in research funding over
the past 10 to 15 years and has lost a considerable number of staff. Its
core budget continues to be pruned by around three per cent per annum.
The scrapie/TSE programme has been partially protected by short term
funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.
The council's Biology of the Spongiform Encephalopathies Programme
(BSEP), which was launched following the "Mad Cow" publicity in 1989/90
and was an attempt to stimulate more basic science research in
universities and research institutes, came up with 9 million over
the four years to 1994. <p>

BSEP, and to a lesser extent The Wellcome Trust, injected much needed
funds into TSE research, some of which has paid off. In particular, the
group headed by John Collinge at St Mary's Hospital, London, is ahead of
strong American competition and complements the work of the IAH. The
group has done excellent research on the genetic determinants of
susceptibility to both sporadic and familial CJD. Most crucially, its
mouse model for CJD provides a unique system in which to assess whether
BSE can infect humans. <p>

The model, based on seminal ground work by
Stanley Prusiner from the University of California, relies on mice that
have been genetically engineered to carry the gene that encodes the
human prion protein. The disease process involves the conversion of the
prion protein into a highly stable form called PrPSc. When challenged
with CJD the engineered mice convert their human prion protein to the
stable form and develop disease in around 200 days. <p>

Normal mice, which
have only the mouse prion gene, are poorly susceptible, and if they
develop CJD at all, it usually takes over 600 days. The engineered, or
"humanised", mice have received much media attention: they are presently
incubating BSE but as yet (400 days plus) have not developed disease. If
they do develop disease over the next year or so, it would indicate that
BSE could convert the human prion protein to the stable, PrPSc form,
thereby indicating the potential for BSE to transmit to humans. <p>

In parallel to the basic science, there is a BSE research programme
funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF). Worth
around 6 million per year, the programme concentrates on applied
topics such as diagnosis, pathogenesis, transmission and epidemiology.
It is not unfair to say that the bulk of this work has focused on the
industry rather than on the possible link between BSE and CJD. Most of
the work has been very necessary and underpins the control measures that
have been put in place.<p>

 For example, transmissions have been attempted
from over 60 different tissues derived from diseased cattle. Only brain,
spinal cord and intestine have so far proved positive. Some of the
experiments are hugely expensive as compared with those in basic
science. For example, a cow-to-calf transmission study has involved
housing 630 cattle in relative isolation on four farms for seven years
followed by culling and analysis of their brains. This experiment is
still running but will be completed by the end of the year. <p>

Other research, under Bob Will, head of the CJD Surveillance Unit, also
in Edinburgh, was stepped up in 1990. Will's unit recently identified
the new variant form of CJD that precipitated the present crisis. <p>

So has British research on TSEs been slow and poorly innovative? Could
more have been done? Answers are probably no, and definitely yes,
respectively. There have been some failures. For example, we still do
not have a transgenic mouse engineered to contain the cattle prion gene.
This would provide a highly sensitive bioassay for detecting low levels
of BSE that might be present in some non-SBO (specified bovine offal)
tissues.<p>

 Also, more effort should have been put into diagnosis, although
this is not an easy topic to study. As far as potential cures are
concerned, we are nowhere. We have also failed to invest in the social
science that might have given information on such topics as where did
SBOs go before the ban and how does the eating of beef and beef products
vary with social or ethnic group, age, region and so on? <p>

By and large, however, British researchers are doing good work with the
resources available. Surprisingly, there have been periods over the past
few years when it has been suggested that BSE was getting more than its
fair share of the limited science budget. Indeed, in 1993, I had to make
a strong case in the face of considerable opposition for the
continuation of BSEP beyond its first phase. I was successful, but
regrettably the funding for the next three years, to 1997, was reduced.
If UK voters are dissatisfied with progress they should consider the
broader problem. <p>

As is often the case in science, breakthroughs are as likely to derive
from advances in other areas of research as they are from TSE research
itself. Sadly, British research has suffered from under investment over
the past two decades. The science base struggles to maintain its
competitiveness internationally and is less well placed than previously
to respond to new challenges. <p>

Training, and the building up of expertise in the TSE area in
particular, is a long process and skilled scientists of the sort
required cannot be pulled out of a hat. Research could be faster with
better funding but we cannot expect answers overnight. A long-term
commitment to scientific infrastructure is essential to attract the most
able people. Now is not the time to criticise our scientists. It is the
time to support them against short-term political decisions. The BSE
crisis has plunged the nation into an awful mess. High quality science,
rationally applied, is our only sensible way forward. <p>

CLAIMS that the EU authorised a top-level disinformation campaign about
mad cow disease in 1990 to prevent the beef market collapsing have been
backed by a former Brussels bureaucrat. Brussels was forced on the
defensive yesterday after Gilbert Castille, an ex-employee of its
consumer affairs service, was quoted in the French newspaper Liberation,
corroborating the allegation. The claims, which first surfaced last week
when a memo written by Mr Castille in 1990 was leaked to the French
press, are severely embarrassing to the EU.<P>

It has taken the moral high ground over BSE since imposing the world ban
on British beef in March. The new evidence came on a particularly
unfortunate day for Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, who
demanded reassurances yesterday from Douglas Hogg, Agriculture Minister,
that the ban was being enforced fully.<P>

Mr Fischler sent a letter to him following complaints from the German
ambassador in Rome that British beef was still getting to Italy via
Ireland and France. Mr Castille's remarks to Liberation suggest that the
EU and its vets had ordered a disinformation offensive to stop the press
"exaggerating" the BSE problem and destabilising the market.<P>

Summarising a submission by an EU colleague in the committee meeting six
years ago, Mr Castille's memo said that "the BSE affair should be
minimised by practising disinformation".

The memo also stated that the British Government was going to be told
"not to publish any more results of their research" into BSE. Mr
Castille, who was tracked down by Liberation in the South of France,
told the newspaper: "I am not blaming the person who declared that [the
representative of the Commission]. The person who said that did so
because he felt he had to."<P>

He said the EU vets who attended the meeting said nothing. "They must
have had instructions." The EU said last night the memo was a "one-off"
account of one meeting which in no way reflected policy at any stage.<P>

One senior source close to Mr Fischler said: "This is absurd. This memo
was written by somebody of little importance who couldn't find anything
better to do with his time.

"It was not circulated to anyone of any importance. People sit in on
these meetings all the time if they have nothing better to do."<P>

A spokesman said it would also investigate reports that Germany's
ambassador in Italy had complained that British beef was being illegally
transported into EU countries by a "meat mafia" via France and Ireland.

A diplomatic cable from the ambassador addressed complaints from
European farmers, alleging that live cattle from Britain were being
exported with forged health certificates.<HR>







<h3><center>EU 'loses' <A NAME="vital">vital</A> mad cow papers</center></h3>
Sunday Times   14 July 1996<br>
Wayne Bodkin <p>

VITAL documents that could shed light on an alleged plot by Brussels
bureaucrats to cover up "mad cow disease" are missing from the European
commission's files, it emerged this weekend. <p>

A former official has admitted drafting a memo to his superiors after a
meeting of the EU's veterinary committee, at which he claims plans were
put forward to minimise the BSE scare by using disinformation. <p>

However, the commission, which denies the plans were ever acted upon,
says it no longer has the memo or the official minutes of the meeting
held in Brussels six years ago. 

L'affaire de la vache folle, as it is known in Brussels, is causing the
European Union acute embarrassment at a time when it is under criticism
for failing to lift its controversial ban on British beef. <p>

Yesterday another legal bid to lift the ban, the second in 24 hours,
faltered when the European Court of Justice threw out an application by
the National Farmers Union for its immediate suspension. <p>

The affair will deepen this week when Franz Fischler, the agricultural
commissioner, and Emma Bonino, the commissioner responsible for consumer
rights, are summoned to the European parliament to answer questions
about the memo and related matters. 

Klaus Hansch, president of the parliament, has said he wants a "more
complete explanation" about allegations that officials tried to suppress
reports about the disease. <p>

The memo, dated October 12, 1990, was written by Gilbert Castille, a
senior French civil servant with the commission's consumer protection
agency, who retired a month after the meeting. In the note, copied to
Peter Prendergast, the Irish head of the agency, and two other
officials, Castille described how an unnamed commission representative
had told the committee, comprising veterinary officers from the member
states: "We have to have a cold attitude so as not to provoke
unfavourable reactions on the market. We will not speak about BSE. This
matter will not appear on any agenda . . . We will officially ask the UK
not to publish the results of their research." <p>

The memo concludes: "On the general plan, this BSE affair must be
minimised using disinformation. It is better to say that the press have
a tendency to exaggerate." <p>

Last week The Sunday Times traced Castille to his home in the lush
cattle country of the French Limousin. He said it was a mystery that the
minutes had disappeared. 

He added: "It is astonishing that the huge bureaucratic machine at
Brussels suddenly loses documents relating to this incident. Everything
is written down five times in five languages." <p>

The commission, while ordering an investigation into the affair, has
been quick to distance itself from Castille. A spokesman said: "We do
not have a copy of this memorandum or the minutes. The memo has no place
in the politics of the EU. It is not an official document, but an
information note showing the personal opinions of the writer." <p>

Castille, however, insists the memo was an accurate record of the
meeting he attended. 

The commission said this weekend that the contents of the memo were
totally at odds with the policy it had pursued.

                         <h3><center> <a NAME="Germany">Germany</a> breaks ranks to keep ban on beef </center></h3>
FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS <br>
Sunday Times ... July 11 1996<p>

                                                         

          GERMANY set itself on a collision course with Brussels yesterday by extending indefinitely a
          national ban on the import of all British beef and its by-products although the EU has already
          begun to ease the embargo. <p>

          Bonn's apparent readiness to defy the EU is certain to stoke passions in Britain when the
          European Court of Justice rules tomorrow on Britain's request for an emergency suspension of
          the overall ban. Britain is thought unlikely to win this or two other cases before the court, on
          pensioners' bus passes and the protection of birds. <p>

          Responding to the intense public fear over Britain's BSE crisis, the German Cabinet
          renewed a ban imposed in March and due to expire on September 29. It also made clear that it
          has no intention of excepting bull semen, which was cleared for export by EU officials last
          month. Exports of gelatine and tallow, two other by-products, have also been approved once
          Britain conforms to new requirements. <p>

          The German Agriculture Ministry said that Bonn had no plans to follow the Brussels order to
          start to lift the ban on the by-products. A spokesman for Franz Fischler, the EU Farm
          Commissioner, said that Germany was expected to obey EU decisions easing the ban. "If they
          don't, they are clearly in breach of the law," he said. <p>

          Germany's near-panic over "mad cow" disease reached new intensity this week with reports,
          as yet unconfirmed, that British beef was being smuggled onto the Continent via Italy. The
          German action embarrassed the Brussels Commission, which could be obliged to take Bonn to
          the European court if it maintains an import ban no longer supported by the EU. "They have to
          obey the rules like anyone else," an official said. <p>

          All EU states imposed bans when the BSE crisis started in March, but they are expected to
          fall into line with the decisions on easing the embargo. Germany's apparent willingness to flout
          EU decisions will add to pressure from some Conservative ministers and Euro-sceptics for
          defiance of rulings from the Luxembourg court that are deemed to interfere with Britain's
          sovereignty. <p>

          The most controversial case involves a likely court decision in September that will require
          Britain to enforce a maximum 48-hour working week. However, the three cases over the next
          few days are certain to sharpen Conservative anger. 

          Tomorrow the judges are thought likely to uphold at least most of the EU beef ban for the time
          being, although some experts believe that they might challenge the EU's pow ers to block
          exports to third countries. <p>

<hr>

                                           BY CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS AND ANDREW PIERCE 
July 13 1996 ... Sunday Times

          SIR NICHOLAS LYELL, the Attorney-General, yesterday insisted that the fight to end the world
          ban on British beef exports would go on despite the European Court of Justice dismissing every
          aspect of the attempt to have the restrictions lifted. 

          Sir Nicholas said: "We will continue with our main court action, arguing strenuously that the
          ban is unlawful and should be lifted in its entirety." 

          The relief was palpable in the Commission and around Continental capitals after the
          Luxembourg judges endorsed the legality of the global ban imposed by the European Union in
          March. A decision even partly in Britain's favour would have ignited a new crisis, since most
          of the 14 other member states were certain to maintain their own embargoes if the European
          order had been curbed or struck down. 

          "This is what we wanted," said Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner. Some
          Commission officials had been nervous over the legal basis of the EU's authority to impose a
          ban on exports to non-EU countries. 

          John Major expressed surprise and disappointment at the court's decision. "We need to
          continue to restore confidence in British beef. I think there is no reason not to have confidence
          in British beef," he said. <P>

          Britain last month applied for an interim order halting the ban while the court reviewed the
          substance of its double-pronged claim that the EU action was illegal and inflicted
          disproportionate suffering on the British beef industry. 

          The final decision will not come until next year, well after the Government hopes to have freed
          more beef products for export under the procedure agreed at the Florence EU summit last
          month. <P>

          The court said the EU had been justified in intervening over British beef because of scientific
          findings linking BSE to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), the human equivalent. The
          judges said they acknowledged the economic and social difficulties caused by the ban, but
          rejected Britain's case, citing "the paramount importance to be accorded to the protection of
          health". <P>

          There were still too many uncertainties over the link between BSE and CJD, the
          judges said. They noted that death invariably followed the diagnosis of CJD within months.

          "Since the most likely explanation of this fatal disease is exposure to BSE there can be no
          hesitation. The ban has a legitimate aim Ç the protection of health Ç and, as a containment
          measure prior to eradication of [BSE], it was essential to the achievement of that aim," it
          said. 

          The court, which was composed of 12 judges sitting under its Spanish president, acknowledged
          that some of Britain's arguments merited closer analysis, but there would be too great a risk
          in suspending the ban while these were considered. <P>

          The court said the statement in March from SEAC, the Government's advisory Committee on
             BSE, on new evidence suggesting a link between BSE and CJD had changed the
          situation over the need to protect consumers. "There is nothing to suggest that the Commission
          acted, as the United Kingdom claims, solely for economic reasons in order to stabilise the beef
          and veal market," the court concluded.<P>


          The Luxembourg judges will rule today on a separate application, by the National Farmers
          Union, for a suspension of the ban. Yesterday's ruling makes rejection a foregone conclusion. 

          The NFU said yesterday it was disappointed by the court's decision but vowed to press ahead
          with its own case. 

          "We believe the European Commission misused its powers contrary to the Treaty of Rome and
          acted disproportionately in imposing the ban", the NFU said. <P>

          Colin Maclean, director-general of the Meat and Livestock Commission, the government quango
          charged with the promotion of British meat, said: "The court's decision is particularly
          discouraging as we already have customers in third countries willing to resume trade in
          British beef as soon as the ban is lifted." <P>

          Tory MPs may reignite the internal warfare over BSE by voting against the selective cull of
          up to 80,000 cattle, Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, was told at a meeting of
          backbenchers last night. Critics of the cull, of cattle born between 1988 and 1993 in herds
          where there had already been evidence of BSE, spoke at a meeting of the Tory backbench
          agriculture committee. <P>

          The regulations to approve the cull, which was part of the Government's framework document
          at the Florence summit, will have to be ratified by the Commons. One MP who was at the
          meeting said: "A number of us may write to the Chief Whip to warn him we may vote against
          it." Tory MPs are pressing Mr Hogg to agree compensation that would be more favourable to
          farmers.

<H3><CENTER>Farmer wins retrial over sheep dip effects </CENTER></H3>

The Times: Britain:July 13 1996<BR>

<i>
[One theory attributes BSE to organophosphate poisoning -- webmaster]<p></i>

 A FARMER who was jailed for 12 years for attempted murder won a retrial at the Court of Appeal yesterday because of new evidence that sheep-dip chemicals might have affected his mental state.

<P>

Lord Bingham of Cornhill, the Lord Chief Justice, ordered the retrial after finding that the conviction of Robert Billings, 60, of Warninglid, West Sussex, was unsafe. He said the jury at Lewes Crown Court in December 1994 had not had an opportunity to consider the new evidence.

<P>

Lord Bingham, sitting with Mr Justice Owen and Mr Justice Connell, turned down a request for bail and gave the prosecution 28 days in which to prefer new charges.



The case could have implications for scores of other farmers who allege they have suffered from exposure to sheep dip and are considering claims for compensation from the Ministry of Agriculture.

<P>

Billings was found guilty of attempting to kill with a shotgun George Foster, a casual labourer. The court was told that Billings had been drinking heavily before the shooting and that he had a long history of alcohol abuse.



Heather Hallett, counsel for Billings, said yesterday that recent research on possible poisoning by the organo-phosphate [OP] chemicals used in sheep dip had not available at the time.

<P>

The Appeal Court agreed to admit as evidence a report from Robert Davies, a consultant psychiatrist who has studied OP poisoning. Dr Davies argues that heavy drinking combined with OP poisoning could have induced an "uncontrollable rage".

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS ... July 13 1996
 THE European Court ruling yesterday was the latest in a series against Britain over the past year.

<P>

The next big collision between Britain and the court will come in September when the judges rule on the Commission's attempt to ensure that Britain abides by a European Union directive enforcing a maximum 48-hour week and other restrictions to working time. John Major has promised to trim the court's powers and the EU's ability to impose such social measures at the inter-governmental conference, which is revising the Maastricht treaty.

<P>

Meanwhile, the Commission said yesterday that Germany could face action in the European Court if it persisted with a ban on British beef products which are to be allowed back on the world market under EU decisions last month. The German Government decided this week to extend indefinitely the blanket ban imposed by Bonn in March. This appeared to breach the EU decision to authorise the export of bull semen, gelatine and tallow.

<P>

Commission spokesmen said German conduct was being examined and action would follow if it was seen to be violating the EU law.

<P>

Bull semen is already back on the world market, but Britain must still meet certain conditions before gelatine and tallow may be exported.

Tory Euro-sceptic MPs were last night urging the Government to restore the policy of non-cooperation with the EU to counter the "politically motivated" decision.

James Cran, MP for Beverley, called for Britain to use its veto at the next inter-governmental conference. He said: "People have got to wake up to the fact that the ratchet is working and that Britain is being dragged into a European union. One day we will wake up and find we cannot turn back. It is very depressing news."

<P>

Iain Duncan-Smith, MP for Chingford, said: "We should ignore the ruling and restart exports to the rest of the world. We have proof that there are no health grounds for this ban. This is more about confidence in the market. It is vindictive."

<P>

Reiman et al. (March 21 issue) (1) conclude that abnormalities in glucose metabolism, evaluated by positron-emission
tomography (PET) in asymptomatic subjects homozygous for the (epsilon)4 allele for apolipoprotein E, provide
preclinical evidence of Alzheimer's disease. The (epsilon)4 allele is highly prevalent not only in patients with
Alzheimer's disease but also in those with atherosclerotic vascular disease, including ischemic cerebrovascular disease
and vascular dementia. (2,3,4) The PET abnormalities cannot be used to distinguish vascular dementia (formerly called
multi-infarct dementia) from Alzheimer's disease. (5,6) Thus, apolipoprotein E genotyping, PET, or the two combined
may not be reliable tools for confidently diagnosing presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease. In fact, healthy persons
carrying two copies of the (epsilon)4 allele and thought to have Alzheimer's disease on the basis of brain abnormalities
detected by PET may actually have unrecognized atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease.

              To the Editor: 

              Alzheimer's dementia is typically characterized by bilateral reductions in glucose metabolism in posterior
              cingulate, parietal, temporal, and prefrontal regions. (1) In contrast, vascular dementia is characterized by a
              variable pattern of reductions in glucose metabolism. These reductions are often focal, scattered, and
              asymmetric; they appear to be related to the location of infarcts. (2) Algorithms developed at the University of
              Michigan and used in our study to generate spatially standardized, three-dimensional surface-projection brain
              images improve the ability to detect the pattern of hypometabolism typically associated with Alzheimer's
              disease and distinguish it from those associated with vascular dementia and other forms of cerebrovascular
              disease. (3) 

              Persons homozygous for the (epsilon)4 allele for apolipoprotein E appear to have an especially high risk of
              Alzheimer's dementia. In the original case-control study, 91 percent of (epsilon)4 homozygotes had
              Alzheimer's dementia by the age of 80. (4) In our study, a cognitively normal group of (epsilon)4 homozygotes
              in their 50s and early 60s had bilateral reductions in glucose metabolism in the same posterior cingulate,
              parietal, temporal, and prefrontal regions as an older group of patients with Alzheimer's dementia. This group
              had few risk factors for ischemic cerebrovascular disease other than the (epsilon)4 allele and no indication of
              cerebrovascular disease on the basis of history, neurologic examination, or T1-weighted magnetic resonance
              images. 

              Although the (epsilon)4 allele is a risk factor for both cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's dementia, it
              remains to be determined whether this allele increases the risk of these disorders by the same or different
              mechanisms. The (epsilon)4 allele may be a risk factor for vascular dementia and other forms of ischemic
              cerebrovascular disease, but postmortem studies are needed to address the potentially confounding effect of
              coexisting Alzheimer's disease. 

              Clinically, apolipoprotein E genotyping and PET are not indicated to determine a healthy person's risk of
              Alzheimer's dementia. At this time, they cannot predict with sufficient certainty a person's risk of this
              disorder, they cannot predict with sufficient accuracy when symptoms might develop in a person at risk, and
              they do not indicate what measures might be taken to address the potential problem. Together, these tests
              promise to help researchers characterize the brain changes that herald the onset of Alzheimer's dementia; they
              may offer a relatively rapid way to assess future treatments to prevent this devastating disorder.

<blockquote><h3>Preliminary study shows genetic <a NAME="testing">testing</a> could detect Alzheimer's<hr></h1>
Jul 12, 1996<br>
Nando.net and Associated Press
<p>  

 DURHAM, N.C. -- A new genetic test to detect Alzheimer's disease may bolster efforts to treat the crippling neurological disease, according to a Duke University scientist.<p>


   A definitive diagnosis would make it easier for doctors and family members to plan for the care of Alzheimer's patients, said Dr. Allen Roses, who is leading Duke's research into the genetics of Alzheimer's.<p>

   Roses thinks his team's genetic discoveries -- which were patented by Duke and licensed to test manufacturer Athena Neurosciences of California -- have produced an extremely accurate diagnostic tool.

   "If I had a patient who tested positive, I would tell them that the probability this is Alzheimer's is very high," Roses said.<p>

   If follow-up studies support the Duke findings -- to be published Saturday in the British medical journal The Lancet -- the test could become the first reliable Alzheimer's test. Currently, the only way a doctor can accurately diagnose the disease is by examining brain tissue after an autopsy.<p>

   Lindsay Farrer, a researcher at Boston University School of Medicine, called Roses' findings "exciting and interesting" but said more research needs to be done.

   Farrer was chairman of the committee that recommended against routine use of the diagnostic test. The patients in Roses' test -- who were followed over a long period of time -- may not represent the typical patient who shows up at a doctor's office complaining of memory loss, he said.<p>

   "Before it is applied in any doctor's office, we need studies to see if its predictive value is as high as Dr. Roses says it is," he said.<p>

   The test, which has been on the market since March, <strong>detects the presence of a gene known as APOE type 4</strong> that Duke researchers first linked to Alzheimer's in 1993. The manufacturer cites statistics and estimates to back its claims of the test's accuracy, but medical experts have been reluctant to endorse its widespread use until more solid data was available.<p>

   So Roses sought confirmation in his center's "brain bank", a collection of frozen brain tissue samples.

   <b>The study marked the first time researchers used actual autopsy results to confirm the findings of a diagnostic Alzheimer's test</b>. They performed genetic tests on brain samples from 67 suspected Alzheimer's patients and found that every patient who tested positive for the gene had autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's.<p>

   The test's shortcoming is that <b>a negative finding tells the patients virtually nothing</b>, Roses said. All of the patients who turned out not to have Alzheimer's tested negative for the gene -- but so did 25 percent of the patients with the disease.

   "It doesn't mean a thing," he said of the negative tests.<p>

   Although no effective treatment exists, doctors and advocates for Alzheimer's patients agree that an accurate diagnostic test would allow them to better manage patients with the unique type of memory loss and confusion the disease causes. The $200 test could mean patients would not have to undergo a battery of expensive tests in search of a diagnosis.<p>

   <b>About 4 million Americans suffer from suspected Alzheimer's, but about 15 percent of those diagnosed with it actually suffer from another condition that produces similar symptoms.</b><p>

   Unlike other forms of dementia, Alzheimer's "erases" a person's memory, beginning with recent events and working backward, said Alice Watkins, director of the Alzheimer's Association of Eastern North Carolina.

   She called the Duke findings "exciting" but preliminary.<p>

   Roses agreed that the findings need to be confirmed.

   "We are talking about small numbers, which is why it is labeled an early report and why it needs to be confirmed," he said.

   Still, he thinks his study -- along with the unpublished results of several others -- should begin to satisfy skeptics who advised against the routine use of the test in a November article in the influential Journal of the American Medical Association.</blockquote>

<P>
The presence of mutations around the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
sequence in APP provides strong argument for the involvement of
APP, and A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> in particular, in pathogenesis
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro studies demonstrated that
A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> may cause neuronal death, supporting
the hypothetical involvement of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
in neurodegeneration in AD. However, concentrations of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
required for neuronal death are nonphysiologically high. Nevertheless,
the predominant idea in the field is that it is sufficient to
postulate A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> as a major culprit in
AD development. The question we pose is whether the potentially
important involvement of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> precludes
the etiological (primary) involvement (not pathological, i.e.,
secondary) of APP functions. We do not have an adequate answer
to this question. Current knowledge about APP functions indicates
that APP is critically required for the maintenance of neuronal
and synaptic structure and function. Because AD is a disease of
neuronal and synaptic deterioration, APP may be involved during
the course of AD pathogenesis, perhaps secondarily. To ponder
the question whether APP may be etiologically involved in AD,
much needs to be learned about APP functions. This article is
intended to provide a foundation for this challenging task.

<A NAME="Introduction"><B>Introduction</B></A>
<P>
A major feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the formation of
senile plaques in a selected area of the brain. An amyloid deposit
composed mainly of <FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>-amyloid peptide
(A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>) occupies the plaque center.
A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> is a peptide of 40 to 43 residues
derived from a larger amyloid precursor protein, APP [Selkoe,
1994]. Genetic studies have provided evidence that APP mutations
in the region critical for A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> generation
are tightly associated with familial AD (FAD) [Hardy, 1994]. Furthermore,
transgenic animals with an APP minigene containing a mutation
develop A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> deposition in the brain
[Games et al., 1995]. Thus, A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> has
been a focus of intensive investigation toward the understanding
of AD.
<P>
APP is a transmembrane protein with various isoforms<B> </B>that
result from alternative splicing [Selkoe, 1994]. APP also exists
as secreted forms. By cleavage in the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
region of APP, the long N-terminal fragment (secreted APP, sAPP)
is secreted into the extracellular space. It is found in plasma
and cerebrospinal fluid [Ghiso et al., 1989; Podlisny et al.,
1990]. Considering the abundance of both membrane-bound APP and
sAPP, they are likely to have significant biological functions.
Several APP functions have been suggested. Membrane-bound APP
has been suggested to have a receptor-like structure [Kang et
al., 1987], with the cytoplasmic domain capable of complexing
with a GTP-binding protein [Nishimoto et al., 1993]. Membrane-embedded
full-length APP might also have a cell adhesion function [Qiu
et al., 1995]. Conversely, proposed functions for sAPP include
the regulation of blood coagulation [Cole et al., 1990; Smith
et al., 1990; Van Nostrand et al., 1990], wound-healing [Cunningham
et al., 1991], extracellular protease activity [Oltersdorf et
al., 1989; Van Nostrand et al., 1989], neurite extension [Jin
et al., 1994; Robakis et al., 1990], cell adhesiveness [Schubert
et al., 1989a], cell growth, [Bhasin et al., 1991; Saitoh et al.,
1989], and differentiation [Araki et al., 1991; Milward et al.,
1992; Yamamoto et al., 1994]. 
<P>
Here it may be worth entertaining a hypothesis that APP functions
may be etiologically involved in certain cases of AD. First, the
APP mutation identified by Goate et al. [1991] affects the <FONT FACE="Times">gamma</FONT>-secretase-dependent
cleavage of APP, producing longer A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
1-42 instead of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> 1-40 [Suzuki et
al., 1994]. Does this affect APP's function? Perhaps. There are
two possibilities. A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> has been shown
to bind APP [Strittmatter et al., 1993b], raising the possibility
that &quot;APP function&quot; may be regulated by A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT><FONT FACE="Symbol">,</FONT>
and that A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> 1-40 and A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
1-42 might have different regulatory activities. The second possibility
is that APP's function is the sum of &quot;trophic APP&quot; and
&quot;atrophic A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>&quot; and that
A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> 1-42 is more atrophic than A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
1-40. The second mutation in APP [Mullan et al., 1992] affects
the <FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>-secretase-dependent cleavage
of APP producing more A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> [Cai et
al., 1993; Citron et al., 1992]. In this case, the potential involvement
of APP's function is explained either by postulating physical
binding of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> with APP or biological
interaction of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> with APP. Thus,
possibly, knowledge about normal functions of APP is crucial in
understanding the etiology of AD. At least there is evidence that
abnormality in APP processing and eventual APP dysfunction, aside
from amyloid accumulation, contributes to neurodegeneration.

<A NAME="APP"><B>APP expression</B></A>
<P>
Many different types of cells synthesize APP. In neurons it is
abundantly located in the synaptic zone [Schubert, 1991]. Different
cell types produce different isoforms of APP. Differentiated neurons
produce mainly the APP695 form whereas non-neuronal cells produce
the Kunitz-type protease inhibitor (KPI)-containing forms of APP
[Selkoe, 1994]. An APP lacking the exon 15 sequence contains a
chondroitin sulfate (CS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chain near the
N-terminus of the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> region [Pangalos
et al., 1995]. The presence of exon 15 disrupts the consensus
sequence for CS chain attachment. Because the CS attaches close
to the <FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>-secretase site, A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
production might be affected by this modification that hides the
N-terminal cleavage site from proteolytic processing. This form
of APP is produced abundantly in astrocytes, but is not present
in neuronal cells, oligodendrocytes, and microglia in culture
[Shioi et al., 1995]. cAMP treatment blocks the production of
this type of APP in the N2a neuroblastoma cell without affecting
APP expression. Thus, available data suggest that APP in the presence
or absence of the KPI domain and exon 15 are functionally different
from one another and are differentially regulated. Abnormal APP
splicing which results in altered expression of APP isoforms may
contribute to AD [Jacobsen et al., 1991; Johnson et al., 1990;
Konig et al., 1991; Neve et al., 1990; Rockenstein et al., 1995;
Tanaka et al., 1992]. Considering that APP695 is a brain-specific
isoform of APP, one can speculate that the secreted form of APP695
(sAPP695) is a key molecule involved in some brain-specific mechanisms.

<P>
Using a battery of different antibodies to various regions of
APP, Cole et al. [1991] and Joachim et al. [1991] have shown that
N-terminal as well as C-terminal fragments of APP accumulate in
the periphery of the senile plaques. This probably indicates the
presence of full-length APP in the swollen neurites surrounding
the plaque core, which is consistent with the finding that APP
undergoes fast anterograde axonal transport [Koo et al., 1989].
These findings have raised the possibility that N-terminal fragments
of APP play a significant role in the aberrant sprouting reaction
observed in the vicinity of the plaques. We have shown APP to
colocalize with GAP-43 in both neuritic plaques [Masliah et al.,
1992b] and growth cones [Masliah et al., 1992a] and to be concentrated
at the synapses. If APP has a trophic or maintenance function
in the synapses, an alteration in the processing of APP, and consequently
an alteration of the concentration and activity of APP695 in the
synapses, could lead to synapse loss and neuronal death, as observed
in AD. Conversely, APP might be involved in the sprouting reactions
of remaining neurons, which is also observed in AD. To see whether
this is the case, a full understanding of the physiological functions
of APP is necessary. <BR>

<A NAME="Proteoglycan"><B>Role of proteoglycans in neurite outgrowth</B></A>
<P>
sAPP and its fragments fulfill the definition of the neurotrophic
factor by supporting neuron survival and promoting neurite outgrowth.
Several regions of APP are potentially involved in trophic functions.
APP binds heparin as do many trophic proteins [Schubert et al.,
1989b]. Two heparin binding domains (HBD) in the N-terminal region
of APP and one heparin binding consensus sequence within the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
region have been reported [Multhaup, 1994; Snow et al., 1995].
Small [1996] discusses the significance of the HBD in detail.
Although extracellular matrix molecules are important for neurite
outgrowth in the developing brain, APP may also bind to cell surface
heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). When heparitinase or heparin
is coincubated with sAPP in B103 neuronal cell culture, sAPP binding
to cells is reduced [Ninomiya et al., 1994], and the APP effect
on neurite extension is reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Small
negatively charged ions as well as chlorate can block the trophic
effect of sAPP. Further, HSPG from a certain developmental stage
can bind to sAPP [Small et al., 1994], suggesting that the degree
of sulfation on GAG or the equilibrium of charge in the extracellular
space might regulate the affinity of sAPP to its hypothetical
receptor. One possible model for the involvement of cell surface
HSPG in the trophic function of sAPP is that the binding of HSPG
with sAPP increases the affinity of sAPP to its receptor and facilitates
the eventual induction of a second messenger cascade. This mode
of HSPG involvement is similar to the basic fibroblast growth
factor (bFGF) receptor. bFGF binds to HSPG and is transferred
to the receptor, which activates a second messenger cascade [Olwin
and Rapraeger, 1992). In spite of these data for the involvement
of proteoglycan in the regulation of APP functions, it seems that
proteoglycan plays only a modulatory role, and the major determinants
of APP functions are within its protein sequence. <BR>

<P>
<A NAME="sAPP"><B>Role of sAPP and its fragments on neurite outgrowth</B></A>
<P>
Functional mapping of APP shows that the RERMS domain in the middle
portion of APP is responsible for growth stimulation on the A-1
fibroblast [Ninomiya et al., 1993] as well as for neurite extension
in clonal B103 neuronal cells [Jin et al., 1994] and primary cortical
neurons [Yamamoto et al., 1994]. As the RERMS domain (APP 319-335)
sequence is highly conserved in different species and is present
in all the isoforms of APP, the biological role of this domain
might be important. This domain of APP, in addition to being neuritotropic,
could increase synaptic density and memory retention in vivo [Roch
et al., 1994] and could reduce neurological damage in ischemia
[Bowes et al., 1994]. Also, sAPP protects neurons from hypoxia-induced
cell death and calcium-mediated glutamate toxicity [Mattson et
al., 1993]. One possible mechanism of neurotrophic function for
sAPP could be the binding of sAPP to a cell surface receptor that
can activate a signal transduction cascade inside the cell. The
supportive evidence for the presence of the sAPP receptor is threefold.
First, the binding assay using <FONT SIZE=2>125</FONT>I-labeled
sAPP on B103 cells shows 10<FONT SIZE=2>5</FONT> binding sites
per cell with K<FONT SIZE=2>d</FONT> values of 20 &#177; 5 nM.
The binding is sequence specific and the RERMS sequence is essential
for binding activity [Saitoh and Roch, 1995]. Second, sAPP induces
phosphatidyl inositol turnover [Jin et al., 1994], activates MAPK
[Greenberg et al., 1994], and affects Ca<FONT SIZE=2>2+</FONT>
homeostasis [Mattson et al., 1993], signature biochemical reactions
for the presence of receptor activation. Considering that the
RERMS sequence is involved in both neurite extension and cell
surface binding, the neurotrophic function of sAPP is likely through
a cell surface receptor that recognizes a specific ligand and
induces the signal transduction cascade inside the cell. Third,
sAPP activates membrane-bound guanylate cyclase [Barger and Mattson,
1995], and exogenously provided cGMP mimics sAPP's function [Barger
et al., 1995]. Combining the above results with the abundant presence
of APP in the synaptic zone, sAPP very likely has a trophic or
maintenance function in synapses. An alteration in APP processing
might cause a biologically inadequate concentration or activity
of sAPP in the synapses which could lead to synaptic loss and
neuronal death. sAPP might also be involved in sprouting reactions
of the remaining neurons which in turn could lead to or accelerate
the pathogenesis of AD [Ihara, 1988]. <BR>

<P>
<A NAME="signal"><B>Induction of signal transducing pathways by
sAPP and its fragments</B></A>
<P>
Biological effects related to cell growth and neurotrophic function
of sAPP have been intensively studied. Less is known, however,
about the intracellular cascades that mediate these effects. As
a pharmacological approach, genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor,
and orthovanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatase,
have been tested in conjunction with sAPP in B103 cells [Saitoh
et al., 1995]. Genistein greatly potentiates sAPP's effect on
neurite outgrowth in B103 cells whereas orthovanadate abolishes
the sAPP effect, suggesting that sAPP action is associated with
tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, sAPP induces
a 10-fold increase of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
activity in PC12 cells, which is blocked by a dominant-negative
ras [Greenberg et al., 1994]. In general, MAPKs are activated
by a variety of trophic factors and regulate many substrates involved
in gene transcription, cell growth, and signaling. 
<P>
The levels of intracellular Ca<FONT SIZE=1>2+</FONT> and cGMP
are also regulated by sAPP. The sAPP treatment on cultured hippocampal
neurons lowers intracellular Ca<FONT SIZE=1>2+</FONT> concentration
rapidly [Mattson et al., 1993] and elevates the cGMP level [Barger
et al., 1995]. The effect is mimicked by the membrane-permeable
analogue of cGMP. Further investigation to understand the mechanism
of the sAPP effect on cGMP and calcium homeostasis has shown that
the sAPP effect is through a membrane-associated guanylate cyclase,
not a soluble (cytosolic) guanylate cyclase [Barger and Mattson,
1995]. Because cGMP can protect neurons against glutamate toxicity,
cGMP induction may play an important role in sAPP's function to
antagonize glutamate toxicity. Taken together, sAPP could regulate
several pathways of signal transduction. When abnormality in APP
function occurs, it might cause a disruption of intracellular
signaling, leading to AD pathogenesis. In effect, grossly abnormal
signal transduction systems are observed in the early phase of
AD before full-blown pathology develops [Saitoh et al., 1991].
<BR>

<P>
<A NAME="Neurotoxic"><B>Neurotoxic effect of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT></B></A>
<P>
To explain massive neuronal loss in the brain of AD patients,
several models have been proposed placing A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
as a principal culprit [Cai et al., 1993; Citron et al., 1992;
Hardy et al., 1992; Joachim and Selkoe, 1992; Kosik, 1992; Mattson
et al., 1992; Pike et al., 1993; Yankner et al., 1989, 1990a,b].
Possible mechanisms of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> toxicity
include calcium channel formation [Arispe et al., 1994], anomalies
in potassium channels [Etcheberrigaray et al., 1994], kinase activation
[Zhang et al., 1994], generation of free radicals [Behl and Schubert,
1993], and enhancement of glutamate toxicity [Mattson et al.,
1992]. Because APP plays a role in cell growth and neuronal maintenance
and differentiation, understanding the relationship between sAPP's
neurotrophic function and A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> neurotoxicity
is important. sAPP treatment could reduce the effect of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
on neurons<B> </B>[Goodman and Mattson, 1994] which suggests that
the neurotrophic effect of sAPP is sufficient to overcome A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
toxicity under normal conditions. 
<P>
In this context, note that the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
peptide is not a pathological product but a physiological product
found in the culture-conditioned medium or cerebrospinal fluid
[Haass et al., 1992; Seubert et al., 1992; Shoji et al., 1992].
This makes it possible that A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> has
a physiological function. Although the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
peptide has been shown to be toxic in extreme conditions [Yankner
et al., 1990a,b], we hypothesize that the real function of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
is to negatively control synaptic function after transport to
the axonal terminals. Experiments using cloned neuronal receptors
expressed in oocytes show that A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
weakly activates tachykinin receptors [Kimura and Schubert, 1993].
But in the presence of NMDA and AMPA&ntilde;kainate glutamate
receptors, A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>-induced tachykinin
receptor responses are greatly enhanced. Glutamate and A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
together also induce inositol trisphosphate (IP3) accumulation
and increases in intracellular Ca<FONT SIZE=2>2+</FONT>. These
observations suggest that in the presence of glutamate, A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
can activate tachykinin receptors and phosphatidyl inositol turnover.
A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> may therefore act as a neuromodulatory
peptide. These results tend to agree with the enhancement of glutamate
toxicity by A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> [Mattson et al., 1992].

<A NAME="Hypothesis"><B>How may APP dysfunction be involved in
AD pathogenesis? A hypothesis</B></A>
<P>
Numerous literature firmly establishes both the neurotrophic and
neurotoxic activities of APP. What might be the significance of
these activities in the pathophysiology of AD? The currently predominant
hypothesis for the etiology of AD is that A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
toxicity is responsible for neurodegeneration in this disease.
However, A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> per se might not be sufficient
to cause neuronal death and dementia. The release of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
protein by cultured cells under normal physiological conditions
raises the question of how and why the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
peptide adopts the <FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>-pleated amyloid
conformation that may be neurotoxic. In this respect, the interaction
of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> with other molecules might
yield crucial information. In addition to apolipoprotein E (apoE)
[Strittmatter et al., 1993a], one of these molecules that interact
with A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> is APP itself [Goldgaber
et al., 1993]. Hence, one possibility is that APP may affect the
A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> structure and its toxicity, and,
conversely, the trophic sAPP activity might be affected by the
A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> peptide. In any event, it is likely
that the balance between the trophic sAPP<FONT FACE="Times">alpha</FONT>,
generated by the <FONT FACE="Times">alpha</FONT>-secretase pathway,
and the toxic A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>, generated through
the <FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>-secretase pathway, affects
the homeostasis of neurons. Especially,
because the <FONT FACE="Times">alpha</FONT>-secretase pathway
excludes the possibility of A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> formation,
the regulation of this pathway should be crucially important in
understanding the biological significance of the two pathways
of APP processing. Many activities attributed to sAPP as discussed
above could be influenced by the simultaneous signal pathways
triggered by A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> peptide. Maintaining
the balance between the two major pathways of APP, one leading
to the &quot;physiological&quot; secretion of the N-terminal portion
(<FONT FACE="Times">alpha</FONT>-secretase pathway), and the other
leading to the secretion of the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>
peptide (<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>-secretase pathway), seems
important. 
<P>
<A NAME="Summary"></A>Both sAPP and A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> protein may play
key roles in AD pathology although the molecular mechanisms by
which they become involved in the neurodegeneration are still
unclear. Whereas the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT> peptide might
be neurotoxic when deposited in the amyloid form, an alteration
of the neurotrophic activity of the secreted form of its precursor
might also be considered as an event potentially leading to dementia.
Thus, one working hypothesis on the role of APP in the pathogenesis
of AD can be the following: APP is an important protein involved
in the regulation of synaptic function and neuronal homeostasis.
This regulatory role of APP is manifested in two domains of the
molecule, the RERMS/neurotrophic domain in the N-terminal secreted
moiety, and the A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>/neurotoxic domain
that can form amyloid under pathological conditions. In AD patients,
abnormal metabolism and compartmentalization of APP leads to an
imbalance of two APP functions and eventually to alteration in
the maintenance of synapses and the homeostasis of neurons. This,
in turn, could lead to the massive neuronal loss and reactive
sprouting observed in AD brains. In conclusion, APP is both a
neurotrophic and a neurotoxic protein whose activities are represented
by small domains in the middle and carboxyl terminal portions
of APP, respectively. Perhaps the balance between these neurotrophic
and neurotoxic activities of APP may not be properly controlled
in AD. The balance may be regulated by controlling the pathways
by which APP is processed or by controlling the availability of
molecules interacting with APP and A<FONT FACE="Times">beta</FONT>,
such as apoE [Strittmatter et al., 1993a], NACP [U&eacute;da et
al., 1993], and <FONT FACE="Times">alpha</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT>-antichymotrypsin
[Abraham and Potter, 1989]. At present, we have only fragmented
knowledge about APP functions, and understanding the complete
picture requires further investigations.<BR>

<P>
We tragically lost our friend and colleague, Tsunao Saitoh, Professor
of Neurosciences at the University of California San Diego, and
his 13 year old daughter, Louille, at about 11 PM on Tuesday May
7, 1996 as they were returning from his laboratory. They were
killed at gun point in front of their home. He had spent the evening
working and helping his daughter with her homework. This tragedy
is deeply felt by his remaining family, his many colleagues, collaborators,
and friends.<BR>


<P>
We were extraordinarily fortunate in recruiting Dr. Saitoh to
the UCSD Department of Neurosciences and the Alzheimer Disease
Research Center in 1985. Tsunao initially studied changes in protein
kinases in brains of Alzheimer patients. Subsequently, he turned
his attention to the physiological function of the APP molecule,
demonstrating its trophic properties. During these studies, he
and his collaborators identified a 17 amino acid active neurotrophic
region near the insertion point of the Kunitz sequence. He then
discovered a new amyloid component protein (NACP and cloned the
NACP gene which is located on chromosome 4 and is present as part
of the amyloid core in about four-fifths of the neuritic plaques
in Alzheimer brains. He showed that NACP aggregated with the A
peptide to form amyloid, in a manner analogous to apolipoprotein
E. During the past several months, Dr. Saitoh's laboratory has
investigated the possibility that inheritance of a specific allele
of NACP might alter susceptibility to the development of Alzheimer's
disease. This work was part of a larger scientific effort aimed
at identifying genetic factors that might modify the risk of developing
Alzheimer's disease in both apolipoprotein E4 positive and negative
individuals. At the time of his death he was at the very peak
of his productive career. Numerous manuscripts were in preparation
when his life was cut short.

Listserve Commentary<BR>
22 July 1996<P>

"In the months since Gajdusek's arrest and weeks since Saitoh's murder, as
no other explanations have come forward, I have wondered what could have
been the motivation, what the intimidation could be about. Certainly the
murder of Saitoh and his daughter could have been a mistake. Gajdusek could
simply have gone too far in his cultural relativism.<P>
 
But there are some big money issues in the mix, such as transgenic mice,
growth hormone, drug development, and chemical toxin liability.  I have
become intrigued by Saitoh's interest in the shift in the glutamate -
calcium intracellular flux and the resulting shift to amyloid accumulation
intracellularly as opposed to an intercellular messenger path.<P>

 
If it is this excitotoxic process which accelerates the neurodegeneration
in Alzheimer's Disease, and also in other neurodegenerative diseases, then
I could see a link to BSE. That's the long way around to what Saitoh would
have to do with intimidation about BSE. Not the cause, but the mechanisms
by which a neurodegenerative process picks up speed, is what I think could
be the link. Gajdusek seemed to hope he had the key, from the Papua New
Guinea population, for resisting the neurodegeneration of HTLV-1.<HR>

COLLINS CALLS FOR EUROPEAN SOLUTION TO BSE CRISIS
</H4>
</CENTER>
If the European Community had not existed before the BSE crisis, it would have had to be invented, Mr Ken
COLLINS, chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and
Consumer Protection, said as he opened the hearing, held jointly with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural
Development, at the European Parliament in Brussels on Monday 24 June 1996.
<P>
"This is not an issue which can be contained within one country," he told the meeting. "The effect has been
felt in other countries of the Community. We have to find a European level response to it. If the European
Community had not existed before  the BSE crisis, we would have had to invent something like it to find a
solution".
<P>
Unless consumer confidence picked up, there was no doubt at all that the beef industry would continue to
suffer - not just in the UK, where there had been more than 160 000 cattle affected, but in other countries
where there had been almost no cases at all.
<P>
The EP was good at opening up to the public gaze an issue like this which had, in some ways, been discussed
hitherto behind closed doors. The purpose of this hearing was to bring the discussion into the public domain.
<P>
The protection of health was a Treaty obligation. Since 1990 the EP had raised the BSE problem at
Community level and had urged the Commission  to act by banning protein foodstuffs for cows and developing
research into BSE and its transmissibility because there was already some evidence of a possible link between
BSE and CJD. 
<P>
Again in 1993 the EP had insisted upon the need to keep the citizens of Europe properly informed and had
taken the view that the initiatives taken by the Commission were insufficient. 
<P>
"With the current crisis, the EP again called - on 28 March and 6 June this year - for firm and substantive
decisions at the Community level to eradicate BSE, to prevent the spread of BSE within Europe and the wider
world, to help beef producers and, above all, to restore the confidence of consumers", he said.
<P>
The so called "mad cow crisis" highlighted the general problem of food safety. "For the sake of productivity,
should we put our health at risk?" asked Mr COLLINS.

<A NAME="bla">
Dr Jean BLANCOU, General Director of OIE (Office international des &eacute;pizooties), Paris
</A>
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Dr BLANCOU said that the OIE (with 143 member countries) was the only world organisation for animal health.
<P>
The OIE has a permanent staff of 30, an estimated 100 experts working voluntarily, and 104 reference
laboratories. 
<P>
Dr BLANCOU underlined the 2 main objectives of the OIE :
<P>
<OL>
<LI>. World surveillance of 104 animal diseases, including BSE;
<LI> Harmonization of legislation regulating trade in animals and animal products through the world (the OIE
International Health Code).
</OL>
<P>
In the OIE surveillance of BSE, epidemiological studies of affected cattle have shown, in most cases, potential
exposure to protein products of animal origin. Some cases have occurred in animals born after the prohibition
on incorporation of meat and bone meal in feed for ruminants came into force ("BAB" - born after the ban) : 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>UK  26 000
<LI>CH       9
<LI>IRL      3
<LI>FR       1
</UL>
<P>
The OIE has followed the evolution of BSE since it made its appearance and has prepared several normative
texts  on the subject since 1990. These have been regularly updated, with continuous concern for the
protection of animal and public health.  According to the International Animal Health Code, this is a nervous
disease of adult cattle, affecting individuals and not whole herds. There is no evidence that it is contagious.
It has a long incubation period, measured in years.
<P>
The Code, added Dr BLANCOU, divides countries into 4 categories based on the incidence of BSE (Chapter
3-2-13 on BSE).
<P>
1. High incidence countries :  
<BR>UK - 168 000 cases
<P>
2. Low incidence countries : 
<BR>CH  216 cases
<BR>IRL 125 cases
<BR>PT   39 cases
<BR>FR   20 cases
<P>
3. Countries where all BSE cases have clearly originated directly from 
importation of live cattle from countries where BSE has been reported :
<P>
In the EU : 
<BR>D   2 cases
<BR>I   2 cases
<BR>DK  1 case
<P>
In third countries : 
<BR>Canada, Falkland Islands, Sultanate of Oman.
<P>
These countries may be considered free of BSE (no incidence).
<P>
4. Countries with no cases of BSE (reported by their governments). Among these countries one must
distinguish between :
<BR>a. countries with effective and continuous surveillance
<BR>b. countries with no surveillance.
<P>
Veterinary controls have been set up in all these countries.
<P>
In addition, concluded Dr. BLANCOU the Code specifies the conditions to be satisfied in international trade
:  "Veterinary Administrations can authorise without restriction the import or transit through their territory,
directly or indirectly, of milk, milk products, hides and skins originating from healthy animals from countries
where BSE has been reported. There is also no scientific evidence of a risk associated with the trade in semen
from healthy animals. By-products, such as gelatin, collagen and tallow are considered to be safe if produced
by processes (under study) which inactivate any residual BSE-infectivity."
<P>
Responding to questions by various MEPs, Dr. BLANCOU said that :
<UL>
<LI> the code is based on epidemiological results and on the declarations of suspect/recorded cases given by
each member state.
<LI> there are currently no occasional controls set up to verify the implementation of the regulations since they
have never been asked for by any member state of the OIE.
<LI> the activities of the OIE are absolutely transparent and both the European Commission and the WHO  take
part in the fact-finding meetings.

Origins and causes of BSE

<A NAME="gro">
Dr Martin H. GROSCHUP, Federal Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals, T&uuml;bingen
</A>
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Dr GROSCHUP addressed the question of the causes of BSE and the reasons why BSE led to such a big
epidemic in the UK in particular. 
<P>
The origin of the agent was either scrapie in sheep and cattle or it is a new agent in cattle which was already
present in the UK before the BSE crisis but only in small quantities. 
<P>
Three factors were decisive for the emergence of the epidemic in the UK:
<OL>
<LI> The emergence of transmissible encephalopathies in the British animal population. There was a high
incidence of scrapie in British sheep ;
<LI> Changes in rendering, which meant that the efficiency of BSE and scrapie agent inactivation was reduced
so that these agents could survive the treatments involved;
<LI>The increased use of animal feedstuffs for cattle in the UK.
</OL>
<P>
The most important measure to combat this problem was the 1988 UK ban on the use of animal protein in
cattle feedingstuffs. 
<P>
BSE had a four to five year incubation period. While there had been a reduction in the incidence of BSE in
cattle in recent years, 28 000 cattle born since the ban had been found to be suffering from BSE. This was
because cattle had been fed with these feedingstuffs illegally. "Some British farmers have continued to feed
cattle with infectious bone meal, which was not meant for ruminants, but for pigs or poultry," he said.
<P>
The Specified Bovine Offal ban was introduced in 1989 (for food for human beings) and in 1990 (for animal
feed) to remove possibly infectious tissues from any slaughtered British cattle intended for human or animal
consumption.
<P>
However, it was scarcely possible to remove brain and spinal cord completely from the slaughtered animal on
a routine basis. There were also problems with the retina of the eye, which was now known to be highly
infectious. 
<P>
Until March 1996 British cattle could have been infected, through feedingstuffs, by the BSE agent. "The British
cattle population before 1996 must be regarded as potentially affected by BSE," he said, "since it is impossible
to date to identify the presumably declining number of infected animals".
<P>
Was there a danger for human beings from the disease? No link between CJD and BSE had been proven,
he said. However, there were coincidences of time and place, which could not be explained away.
<P>
<HR>
<UL>
<LI>
<I> 
<A NAME="obe">
Mr Dr Radulf C. OBERTH&Uuml;R, a member of the technical committee of EURA (European Renderers
Association), Rotterdam
</A>
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Dr OBERTH&Uuml;R told the hearing that it was a 'high probability' that BSE was caused by a recycling of bovine
tissue into cattle feed. He said the early explosive increase in BSE cases pointed to a kind of chain reaction
involving infectious particles. A catastrophe could have taken place if the ruminant feed ban had not been
imposed. 
<P>
In response to Mr COLLINS, who wanted to know if there was any link between the use of organo-phosphates
and BSE, both Mr OBERTH&Uuml;R and Mr GROSCHUP felt there was no evidence of such an interaction on the
present level of knowledge. Mr OBERTH&Uuml;R pointed out there was a big fall in the number of BSE cases in the
UK after the use of ruminant proteins in the preparation of animal feed was banned. Organo-phosphates might
still have acted as a trigger but there was no proof of this, he said. 
<P>
In reply to other questions, Mr OBERTH&Uuml;R ruled out the possibility of groundwater being contaminated by
rendering plants. He also said there was no possibility of the BSE agent being passed on through feed bins
which once stored contaminated feed. He did, however, admit that the infected dose required to pass on the
disease was very low - at less than 1 gramme of infected brain. Mr OBERTH&Uuml;R also insisted that the rendering
procedure could be guaranteed with the requisite heat treatment and strict monitoring.

</UL>
<H4>General aspects</H4>
Prof. SAVEY [who was not able to address the hearing until 25 June] introduced his speech by underlining
that :
<BR>"BSE is a transmissible disease but currently cannot be considered contagious". In fact the exact nature of the
infectious agents is not known.  There are therefore no methods available for identifying infected animals and
animals affected by the disease but still alive.
<H4>State of the art of diagnosis</H4>
Prof. SAVEY then gave the reasons why diagnosis of BSE is still a difficult matter :
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Diagnosis is possible only in specialized laboratories;
<LI> It presuppose having direct access to the central nervous system (CNS) of the animal, after death, to identify
specific lesions in the brain;
<LI> the epidemiological differences among countries (e.g. UK, IRL) are too important to give an adequate
measurement tool.
</UL>
<P>
Moreover, he added that the scientific community itself is divided on different possible causes of the disease,
e.g. perhaps a little virus, perhaps the prions (the hypothesis which has received the most attention by the
media).
<H4>Research</H4>
Prof. SAVEY said that research is currently following two directions :
<UL>
<LI>research on sick animals. The characteristics of these tests are not known (e.g. level of detectability, 
specificity, etc).  They can only detect a disease clinically declared.
<LI>research on affected animals (not sick yet). It is long-term research and, in the current state of knowledge,
no tests are available to this end.
</UL>
<P>
Prof. SAVEY concluded that the future of research was based on comparison with research into other diseases
(e.g. CJD).
<P>
He added that it was possible to control a disease without knowing the cause (as has been done e.g. with
plague) and it was possible to agree on a diagnosis without agreeing on the origin of a disease, but to develop
a test a consensus was needed the methods for diagnosis and on the causes of the sickness.
<P>
The solution is therefore a consensus within the scientific community which is possible only through by pooling
the available information and test results on transmissibility/non transmissibility from animals to human beings.

Prof. Roy ANDERSON, Head of the Department of Zoology at Oxford University 
</A>

</UL>
<P>
Prof. ANDERSON said that the scientific evidence pointed to the fact that BSE was a transmissible agent and
that at present it was not possible to support arguments about co-factors such as the use of chemical fertilizers
(organo-phosphate) sprays.
<P>
The epidemic had begun in 1986 and BSE cases in Great Britain had peaked in 1992.  After 1992 the
epidemic had been declining rapidly . The majority of cases had been in dairy animals, not beef. This was
because of the high meat and bone meal diets given to young dairy animals before the food ban in mid-1988.
The feeding pattern of beef animals is different. They suckle from the mother for a longer period and so have
been exposed to less artificial protein feed. 
<P>
Current evidence suggested that the incubation period of BSE - defined as from the time of the acquisition of
the infection to when neurological disease (BSE) is diagnosed - was approximately 4 to 5 years on average.
However, cases did occur before and after that period since there was much variability in individual animals
in the incubation period. 
<P>
To understand the transmission of the agent, it was necessary to analyse the pattern of the epidemic and the
demography of the UK cattle herd. Life expectancy of cattle in the UK from birth was 2 to 3 years, but those
that joined a dairy herd at the age of two (the normal age) might have a life expectancy of 4 to 5 years
thereafter. (The size of the national herd in Britain had fallen from 13 million in 1975 to about 9.5 million in
1995.) 
<P>
Many uncertainties still surrounded the transmission of BSE in cattle: maternal transmission; time-dependent
and age-dependent exposure to infected feed; variability in infectiveness over the incubation period; age-
dependent susceptibility; the incubation period (Is this age-dependent or dose-dependent ?); and host
genetics and its influence on the course of disease.
<P>
Scientific methods were available, given knowledge of the incubation period, to back-calculate when animals
acquired infection on the basis of the observed trends in the number of BSE cases per year. Such analysis
showed clearly that the incidence of new infection fell dramatically in 1989 after the food ban was introduced.
Since then, it had continued to fall, but new infections had persisted at  a low level in recent years. Three
hypotheses might explain these new infections:
<OL>
<LI> the continued use of contaminated food;
<LI> maternal transmission from mother to calf; 
<LI> horizontal transmission. 
</OL>
<P>
At present further analysis and experiments suggested contaminated foodstuffs as the major cause. The
likelihood of vertical transmission remains uncertain but, if present, analysis suggests it accounts for a very
small fraction of new cases since 1989. At present there is no evidence of horizontal transmission.
<P>
Scientific methods were available to work out the optimal culling policy to rapidly eliminate BSE in the UK.
Current data on the epidemiology of BSE in cattle and the demography of the UK cattle herd facilitated such
predictions.

<A NAME="wil">
Dr Robert G. WILL, CJD Surveillance Unit, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh
</A>
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Dr WILL said that scrapie had been endemic in sheep flocks in many countries for many years but there was
no good evidence that it had caused disease in the human population. CJD occurred in countries like Australia
and New Zealand that were scrapie-free and there was no evidence of an increased risk of CJD through
occupational exposure to scrapie.
<P>
It could be argued that scrapie in cows was, therefore, unlikely to pose a threat to human health, but this
hypothesis might be incorrect. The agents of the spongiform encephalopathies could be transmitted to
susceptible laboratory host species and in some of these experiments the characteristics of the infectious agent
could change after transmission from one species to another. It was, therefore, possible that the BSE agent
might pose a greater risk to the human population than scrapie and indeed the transmission characteristics
of the BSE agent in laboratory mice were distinct from previously studied strains of scrapie. It had, therefore,
been imperative to minimize any potential human exposure to the BSE agent and this had led to a range of
legislative measures in the UK. Of particular importance was the specified bovine offal ban introduced in 1989
to prevent tissue containing high levels of infectivity, such as brain and spinal cord, from entering the human
food chain. 
<P>
The CJD surveillance unit was established in 1990 in the UK in order to determine any change in the pattern
of this disease following the epidemic of BSE in the cattle population in the UK. Data from this study had been
published in annual reports and although there had been some changes in the epidemiological characteristics
of CJD, comparative evidence from other countries in the European Union suggested that there was no distinct
change in the UK that might be related to BSE. 
<P>
However, early in 1996 10 cases of CJD were identified in the UK with unusual clinical phenotype and
neuropathological changes distinct from any previously seen in the study in the UK. Detailed investigations of
these cases had failed to reveal any common risk factor for CJD, including recognized risk factors such as an
iatrogenic source of infection or a mutation of the prion protein gene. 
It was felt that these cases might represent a new variant of CJD and, in the absence of any other explanation,
there was a possibility that these cases might represent a causal link between BSE and human disease. 
<P>
Dr WILL accepted that there was major public concern about BSE and CJD. Scientific research could not give
answers in the immediate future and, in his opinion, it might be six to 18 months before epidemiological studies
could provide more definitive evidence. In the meantime, it was important to stress a number of facts:
<UL>
<LI>CJD remained very rare disease;
<LI>a causal link between BSE and CJD had not been proven;
<LI>if there was such a link, this reflected exposures that took place many years ago and almost certainly
before many of the legislative measures to protect human health were put in place;
<LI>although the cause of CJD was not known, the disease occurred worldwide with a relatively constant
incidence and in most countries BSE could not be the cause of CJD;
<LI>CJD was not a contagious disease and did not spread through social or personal contact;

Dr David L. HEYMANN, Director, Division of Emerging and other Communicable Diseases Surveillance
and Control, WHO, Geneva
</A>
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Dr. HEYMANN said that since the identification of BSE in 1986 the main role of WHO had been the regular
monitoring of real potential risks of BSE to human health. With this in mind and with the aim of evaluating
possible means of transmission, four expert meetings were convened by WHO in 1991, 1993 and 1994
(together with the Office of International Zoonoses) and 1995.
<P>
The epidemiological and experimental data available included : 
<UL>
<LI> analysis of classic spongiform encephalopathies like SCRAPIE-CJD-KURU;
<LI> hosts like pigs, poultry and monkeys challenged with BSE agent;
<LI> infectivity of bovine tissues affected with BSE;
<LI> preliminary results of studies on vertical and horizontal transmission in cattle;
<LI> the recovering of infective material mostly in the central nervous system tissues (CNS) of cattle with BSE.
</UL>
<A NAME="exp">
<H4>After reviewing these data, most of the experts :</H4>
</A>
<UL>
<LI> concluded that, provided certain tissues are excluded from the cattle-feed and human-food chains,
transmission by meat to humans is unlikely;
<LI> concluded that the epidemiological evidence in Europe did not indicate a change in the incidence of CJD
attributable to BSE;
<LI> but emphasized the importance of maintaining vigilance because of the long incubation period of these
diseases.
</UL>
<P>
Following the report of 10 cases of a newly identified variant of CJD in the UK in March 1996, WHO convened
two consultations (April and May 1996) to review the public health issues related to BSE and the newly
identified variant of CJD. The consultations concluded that :
<P>
<UL>
<LI> No definite link between BSE and the variant of CJD can be established ;
<LI> Circumstantial evidence suggests, though, that exposure to BSE is the most likely cause
</UL>
<H4>Measures to be taken</H4>
Dr. HEYMANN stressed that the consultations confirmed the importance of :
<UL>
<LI> banning the use of ruminant tissues in ruminant feed;
<LI> the exclusion of tissues likely to contain the BSE agent from any animal and human food chain.
</UL>
<H4>Recommendations</H4>
The consultations concluded that : 
<UL>
<LI> milk is safe;
<LI> tallow and gelatine are safe if manufactured with a process that inactivates the transmissible agent;
<LI> the pharmaceutical industry must obtain bovine materials from countries with a surveillance system for BSE
and where no case or only sporadic cases of BSE have been reported; 
</UL>
<P>
They recommended : 
<UL>
<LI> further research on all transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) to characterize the agent causing
the disease in humans and compare it to other TSEs, including BSE ;
<LI> that risks factors for human infection be established.
</UL>
<P>
Based on these recommendations, WHO is presently establishing an intensified worldwide system for CJD
surveillance.
<P>
WHO will also continue to update the current "state of the art" as it has done since 1991 because advancing
knowledge through research, however slow or rapid it may be, will in the long run allow the best decisions to
be taken to ensure the development of the beef industry and, above all, to restore consumer confidence and
safeguard public health.

Mr Carlo BERLINGIERI, DG VI, EC inspectorate
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Mr BERLINGIERI outlined the findings of six separate inspections in the UK by EU officials from the
Commission's Office of Veterinary Control over the period May 1990 to May 1996.
<P>
He told the hearing that the early inspections, in particular, revealed shortcomings in animal records with
insufficient data on the identification and movement of slaughtered animals. Even by the third visit in May 1994,
it was still difficult to check the movement history of slaughtered animals. The following visit in September 1995
noted that there was still no control register of animal movements in England, Scotland and Wales. On the
other hand, controls on the destruction of specified bovine offal had been strengthened considerably by
September 1995 and the risk of contamination in feed mills had been reduced. 
<P>
The subsequent visit in April 1996 was concerned that the separate slaughter policy for animals over 30
months had still not been implemented, but recorded that the UK ban on the feeding of animal protein to cattle
seemed to be effective. The lack of animal records remained the weak point, Mr BERLINGIERI told MEPs. He
also noted that at this time the UK authorities had very little control over the gelatine industry.
<P>
Regarding the last visit in May 1996, Mr BERLINGIERI said a complex processing chain had been put in place
for slaughtering and destroying the relevant cattle, although there were still some problems with the controls.
On the feed ban, he noted that feed containing meat and bone-meal delivered to farms before the ban came
into effect had still not been withdrawn.  
<P>
Replying to questions, Mr BERLINGIERI confirmed that 'tagging' or individual identification of cattle had been
undertaken in the UK by the breeder but not by a central authority. The system had, he felt, worked reasonably
well and was certainly far better than in some other states. The problem was the lengthy 6-8 year incubation
period. Mr GILL from the National Farmers Union later elaborated on this point by explaining that not only was
the system not centrally controlled but that farmers were only obliged to keep records on the farm for three
years. 
<P>
Problems were now occurring in tracing animals from six years ago, although he did feel that breeders' records
provided a satisfactory way of retaining controls. 
<P>
On the question of whether it was an infectious disease, Mr BERLINGIERI said this was a matter of
'semantics'. Animal feed containing the suspected bone-meal was exported up until 1996. It was, however,
subject to restrictions and was also used in poultry and pigs in the UK.

<I>
Dr Jos&eacute; Augusto CARDOSO DE RESENDE, Baston&aacute;rio da Ordem dos M&eacute;dicos Veterin&aacute;rios, Lisboa
</I>
</UL>
<P>
In introducing Dr CARDOSO, M. HAPPART had pointed out that, up to the end of 1995, about 30 animals
had been affected by BSE in Portugal, probably due to imports of infected meat and bone-meal from the UK. 
<P>
Background
<P>
Dr CARDOSO said that the first animals affected to be detected in Portugal in July 1990 were directly imported
from the UK.  Twelve thousand animals were in fact imported from the UK during the 1980s.
<P>
It was when the first Portuguese-born infected animal was detected that the Portuguese authorities alleged
that this was due to the meat and bone meal imported from the UK.
<P>
Even after the ban in the UK (1988) these products continued to be exported to Portugal.  This led to a fivefold
increase in the expected number of affected animals.
<P>
What does this mean ?
<P>
Since only 7 animals among the 12000 imported were notified as being infected, one may conclude that many
animals went into the food chain or were buried without the authorities being notified.
<P>
Dr CARDOSO then stressed that until 1994 the Portuguese authorities did not recognize the existence of the
disease in Portugal.  Hence they avoided taking measures which would have led to the identification of sick
animals.
<P>
Although legislative measures were in force between 1990-1994, their enforcement was never effectively
monitored.  This is proven by the cases of BSE detected by private vets despite the lack of support by the
authorities and of an official epidemiological detection system.
<P>
It was only after the declaration of 20 March 1996 in the Commons (UK) that new legislative measures were
taken and the number of official declarations have increased with the aim of appeasing public opinion. 
Nevertheless, consumer confidence in control measures has been severely damaged and consumption of meat
fell by up to 70 % . 
<P>
The consumers felt that the official system based on Community measures did not guarantee that affected
animals and banned products were not traded. In spite of the recommendations made by independent experts
- on a request by the Commission - with the aim of guaranteeing the efficiency of veterinary controls in the
Single Market, according to the Bendixen report such recommendations have not been enforced in Portugal. 
<P>
Mr CARDOSO concluded : "The BSE crisis underlined the need for measures giving credibility to veterinary
controls in order to restore consumers' confidence and promote economic activity".
<P>
Replying to questions, Dr CARDOSO said that given the amount of feedstuff imported into Portugal from the
UK one would have expected 400 cases to have been reported. This, however, was not the situation. In fact,
of the 45 cases reported, 7 were reported in animals originating in the UK while another 38 were born in
Portugal. He admitted, however, that since 1994 bone-meal had still been imported into Portugal. The issue
could only be tackled on a basis of mutual trust.

<I>
Mr Ben GILL, Deputy President, National Farmers Union, UK
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Mr GILL said that it was easy with hindsight to be critical of the approach adopted until recently with regard
to BSE. It was important to recognize how far the science of encephalopathies had advanced during recent
years. If we knew then what we know now we would have done things differently.
<P>
Two major experiments were currently taking place in the UK with regard to BSE, one involving 630 animals
and the other 340 animals.
<P>
Farmers had a single aim: to get rid of this terrible disease. It was a gross 
misrepresentation to claim that farmers had taken feedingstuffs clearly identified as bone and red meat and
had force-fed it to animals. In fact, since the early 1980s they had been pressing the foodstuff manufacturers
for a feed ingredient declaration. It was only six weeks ago that the major feed companies had agreed to this.
<P>
The only procedure possible now was to restore consumer confidence with measures that were not always
necessary for scientific or health reasons.
<P>
As regards controls in abattoirs, farmers had been pressing for a national control agency since the beginning
of the 1990s: in April 1995 the Meat Hygiene Service had been created. 
<P>
A scheme had been introduced to remove all the older cattle - those over 30 months old - from the food chain.
"Now in the UK we shall be removing from food production about one million cattle - one third of all production -
to re-establish the trust that the consumer needs to have in our product," he said.
<P>
If the organo-phosphate fertilizer hypothesis was adopted, why was the incidence
of BSE higher in the Channel Isles where no organo-phosphates had been used.
<P>
He disputed the suggestion that levels of scrapie in sheep were very high in the UK. In fact, it was less than
one per cent.
<P>
On the question of labelling the ingredients of animal feed, Mr GILL said farmers had been demanding this
for some time but the request had been resisted by manufacturers fearful of giving away commercial secrets.
Now a voluntary scheme has been reached under which ingredients used in the field will be labelled but not
in the exact percentages in order to preserve manufacturers' rights.
<P>

UK OFFICIAL VIEW
</A>
</CENTER>
<P>
A question was also put at this stage to Dr Kevin TAYLOR, Deputy Chief Veterinary Officer at the UK's Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<P>
Asked whether the changes in the rendering process which had occurred in the UK were made with the
agreement of the UK Government, he replied that the changes which took place in the UK rendering industry
in the 1970s/early 1980s were independent of the Government. 
<P>
Although comment at the hearing had suggested that rendering temperatures were reduced and that this
allowed BSE/scrapie to survive and cause the BSE epidemic, this was not so. The important change was the
discontinuation of a post-rendering process in which hydrocarbon solvents were used to remove additional
fat/tallow from the solid protein-rich residue which rendering produced. The process was stopped in most
plants for economic and safety reasons. The change took place suddenly and the proportion of meat and bone
meal subjected to the process fell from about 70 per cent to 20 per cent (by weight) in a period of 24 months.
"This period coincided with the time when BSE first entered the British cattle population," he said. 
<P>
When ruminant derived protein (ie meat and bone meal or MBM) was identified as the cause of BSE in 1988,
the Government had two choices. The first was to make the MBM safe by treatment at a time and temperature
which would destroy the agent. However, the information required for this was not available at the time "and
is still not available today". So the only practical alternative was implemented and from July 1988 the use of
ruminant-derived protein in feed for ruminant animals was prohibited.

Mr Robert DELVILLE, general delegate of CIAA (Confederation of the food and drink industries of the EU)
</I>
</UL>
<P>
M. DELVILLE emphasized that the consequences of the current crisis confirmed the interdependence of the
food chain at all levels and therefore the importance of an integrated approach to food safety.
<P>
BSE had had disastrous consequences for the industry in three main areas :
<UL>
<LI> consumer confidence;
<LI> trade;
<LI> food safety.
</UL>
<P>
The whole impact could not be measured yet but to give an idea of the magnitude of the problem, the UK food
and drinks industry alone (without mentioning the agricultural sector ) had suffered losses of up to ECU 300
m.
<P>
How can the food and drinks industry help solve this crisis ? The integrated approach of the food chain, "from
the stable to the table", implies that each link of this chain has an interest for consumers.
<P>
Regarding BSE, he continued, it is important to underline that it is an animal health issue, and therefore it
cannot become a "food safety issue" (given the correct application of protection measures).
<P>
The CIAA considers that effective control of foodstuffs is based on :
<UL>
<LI> control by the enterprises themselves;
<LI> well-organised monitoring by governments.
</UL>
<P>
The system applied until now is based on 3 pillars :
<OL>
<LI> regulations focusing on safety and based on scientific evaluation (e.g. the creation of a Multi-disciplinary
Scientific Committee to advise the Commission on issues relating to BSE and the recent decisions of the
Standing Veterinary Committee).
<LI> rigorous enforcement of these provisions (to ensure and restore public confidence). 
<LI> industry's responsibility (e.g. development of the quality assurance system and the concept of Hazard
Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP).
</OL>
<P>
The HACCP is a management tool involving the following steps :
<UL>
<LI> analysing the potential food hazards;
<LI> identifying the points where food hazards may occur;
<LI> deciding which of those points are critical to food safety;
<LI> implementing effective control and monitoring procedures at those critical points;
<LI> reviewing periodically the various steps involved.
</UL>
<P>
The importance of HACCP resides mainly in the fact that it can easily be adapted to new scientific knowledge.
<P>
The steps in question were outlined in Council Directive 93/43/EEC on Hygiene of Foodstuffs.  The three pillars
appear even more important when a solution to the problem of BSE is being sought.
<P>
Restore consumer confidence
<P>
M. DELVILLE went on to underline the importance of the quality and transparency of information to restore
consumer confidence. For this reason, the CIAA welcomed the initiatives taken by the Commission to create
a committee on BSE.
<P>
In this respect, it was important to recognize that food companies had taken specific measures, such as
installing telephone helplines for consumers.
<P>
Moreover, the CIAA believed in the importance of the urgent enforcement of decisions :
<UL>
<LI> the traceability of cattle should guarantee the quality of products;
<LI> the CIAA fully supported the development of an information programme for consumers, as suggested in the
EP resolution of 6 June 1996.

Mr LUGAN, who was representing the animal fats, tallow, lard and margarine industry, said that the raw
materials used in the industry came exclusively from the food chain. Tallow was one of the by-products of
slaughtering.
<P>
End uses as far as human beings were concerned included fried food, biscuits and soups and soap. 
<P>
In close cooperation with the European Commission, the industry had made a big contribution towards the
drawing up of stringent regulations governing their activities. "The regulations see to it that our products are
safe," he said. 
<P>
"In the existing state of research - and results which showed that fats are safe in so far as transmission of the
BSE agent is concerned - and as a result of strict implementation of the regulations, the consumer has the
assurance that products placed on the market are safe," he concluded.

<P>
Mr AGER said that the pharmaceutical industry had been caught up on the edge of this issue when the
Commission adopted the ban in March this year since the ban covered not only animals, meat and embryos,
etc. but also derivatives destined for use in cosmetics and pharmaceutical products.
<P>
The industry was highly regulated. There was a comprehensive framework in the EU regulating the safety,
quality and efficacy of all medicines authorized for patients in Europe. This was founded on a series of
Community directives, regulations and guidelines. 
<P>
The scientific backbone for this regulatory framework was the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products
(CPMP) and the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP). 
<P>
On the question under discussion, in December 1991 the CPMP had adopted guidelines on "Minimizing the
risk of transmitting agents causing spongiform encephalopathy via medicinal products". These guidelines,
which set out detailed parameters to ensure safety, were put in place the following year. 
<P>
"The safety of patients is paramount," said Mr AGER. The industry was fortunate in having had four or five
years adherence to scientifically based guidelines. "We were ahead of the problem," he said.

Mr Michael JOFFE, President of EPHA (European Public Health Alliance) 
</A>
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Mr JOFFE said that, despite the uncertainty of the size of the coming epidemic, the BSE/CJD issue should
be regarded primarily as one of health protection and subject to the "precautionary principle" ie if in doubt, act
to avoid harm. 
<P>
It was a matter for concern that in many discussions the focus had been on economics, especially on
consumer confidence. Although this was important (not least because the destruction of an industry had
adverse effects on the producers), it had to take a subsidiary role.
<P>
"We have to recognize that a majority of people living in Britain may have already consumed the BSE agent," 
he said. "One expert suggests fifty meals as a possible average."
<P>
However, now was not the time for most British people to alter their eating habits dramatically, although it was
worth trying to avoid further large amounts. The quantity of the agent was important because this affected both
whether one would become affected and, if so, the number of years before onset of the disease. The range in
humans was approximately 8 to 30 or more years. Among young people, the incubation period was towards
the lower end of this range. 
<P>
The types of food most likely to contain the BSE agent are brain and certain offals such as thymus ("ris de
veau"). These were rarely consumed as such in many countries, including Britain, and in practice the greatest
risk was probably from "mechanically recovered meat" (MRM). This was a sludge obtained by removing all
remaining scraps of fibrous tissue, muscle, etc. from left-over bones. Unbelievably, until November 1995, this
could include the vertebral column so that MRM contained some pieces of spinal cord (a high-risk material).
<P>
"MRM finds its way into all sorts of manufactured products, especially pies, sausages and hamburgers," he
said."However, even in 1988, not every hamburger will have contained the agent: it is a question of
probabilities."
<P>                   
The long incubation period meant that older people who continued eating beef and beef products were not at
risk of developing CJD within their remaining lifespan. On the other hand, young children may have consumed
no BSE agent at all, or only small amounts. "It is justifiable to remove beef from school menus, and more
generally to protect small children in Britain, for this reason (though not because they are at increased risk,
which is unlikely)," he said.
<P>
While BSE still existed in cattle, the agent would continue to enter the food chain, albeit in small quantities.
This was because of the lack of trained veterinary staff, together with a history of inadequate enforcement, and
the observation  that "confidence" is still considered the priority by those in authority.
<P>
At this stage, the rest of the world needs to be protected from any further exposure. A cordon sanitaire around
Britain for beef and beef products is therefore scientifically justified until the BSE epidemic among British cattle
has ended. - not only until suitable measures are in place.
<P>
The feeding of animal remains to ruminants was monstrously unnatural, he said. "Nevertheless, it has been
done for several decades - and in many countries - without manifest harm, until the rendering process was
altered in Britain in the early 1980s", he said.
<P>
Speaking generally, he added: "We certainly do need to reconsider how agriculture is practised, based on the
precautionary principle. Criteria would include human health and environmental protection, among others, and
would need to take account of the complexity and unpredictability of biological systems."
<P>
Health protection needed to be considered in the formulation of all policies. BSE/CJD was not the first problem
to result from economic logic being considered above and in isolation from other criteria.

How to restore confidence?

Mr Jim MURRAY, BEUC
</I>
</UL>
<P>
Mr MURRAY from the European Consumers' Association emphasised that human health was paramount.
Consumers could not be forced to eat beef. And, he added, confidence in the food industry had, he felt, been
declining for some time. BSE only added to this. It was important to take account of emotional reactions to the
crisis as well as just scientific evidence. On the whole he felt, however, that consumers' views were not taken
sufficiently into account. The only solution lay in providing as much information as possible to enable
consumers to make an open choice. Despite all the recently announced measures the problem would not go
away for some time. There would be some 80,000 cases in the UK this year, another 5,000 in 1997, dropping
to 2,500 in 1998. 
<P>
His view was that all 'suspect' meat should be removed from the food chain and this included cattle that had
not been proved to have the disease but those whose life history could not be recorded. The rules should be
strictly enforced and no animal whose history could not be traced should be exported. On labelling it was
important to indicate the kind of meat used in food products, its origin and whether or not it had been produced
through a 'mechanically recovered' treatment. This should always be indicated on the label, although in reply
to questions later he said he was not yet in a position to recommend banning such a process. There needed
to be closer surveillance of the rules in all member states. On the question of labelling, Mr MURRAY pointed
out that the French Consumers' Association had already said that it would call for a boycott of beef whose
origin was not clearly labelled.

CONCLUSIONS
</H3>
</A>
</CENTER>
Summing up the latter part of the meeting, Mr Jos« HAPPART, first vice-chairman of the Committee on
Agriculture and Rural Development, took the view that it was now time to put the situation into perspective. 
He felt the worst was now over and he for one would be eating meat in the confidence that controls were now
better. 
<P>
Closing the meeting, Mr Ken COLLINS, chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and
Consumer Protection, said that an increase in EU research funding was needed to provide crucial information
on questions such as how soon a tried-and-tested live test could be developed, how long a prion (if that were
indeed the BSE agent) could exist for independently in the environment and whether by-products such as
animal cells were safe to use. 
<P>
There had been a long-term decline in confidence in foodstuffs as successive food scares had dented
consumer trust. "From growth-promoting hormones in meat to salmonella in eggs and poultry and high levels
of residual pesticide in fruit and vegetables, it is not surprising that consumer confidence in food production
is declining," he said. This could have negative consequences for the single market.
<P>
Part of the problem was that producers themselves were often unaware of the risks. "How many times have
we heard farmers saying that they had no idea of the content of the feed they gave their animals?" he asked.
<P>
As safeguards were taken to reduce the risk that human beings would contract diseases from infected meat
and meat products, there was more action that the EU could take in the following areas:
<OL>
<LI> Health.  Despite the most recent cases of CJD, it was still most likely to affect older people with symptoms
similar to dementia. Therefore, the most logical EU programme to address CJD was through the new
Alzheimer's programme, which was an EP initiative;
<LI> Food safety. What was needed was a proper system for tracking and identifying animals, together with an
effective and targeted culling programme directed to older animals, with an independent inspection team to
oversee both measures;
<LI> In the long term, however, the crisis would confirm the EP's repeated call for a European Food Agency
independent of agricultural interests and national governments.
</OL>
"Finally, we should perhaps examine the system of food production itself to try to devise a scheme that will

<blockquote><h3><center>Showdown Looms: Do Cattle Increase Threat OF Wildfires?</center></h3>

Arizona Republic, July 6, 1996<p>

<p>
        For more than a century, cattle and sheep have browsed the
wilderness of Arizona, leveling the grasses that ranchers say would
otherwise feed the wildfires.
        Were it not for the cows, they assert, this year's fire danger,
made severe by the worst drought of the century, would be even
worse.<p>
        But environmentalists and a growing pool of scientists say
that's pure bull.
        Cattle and sheep, in fact, have helped cause the problems by
eating away grasses that prevent the growth of thickets of smaller
trees and bush which choke forests and feed bigger, hotter, more
dangerous wildfires.<p>
        In addition, nearly a century of rushing to put out every fire
has led to an unintended consequence: a potential catastrophic
buildup of fire-prone vegetation.<p>
        "Unless, and until, intensive grazing of the National Forests
end...(this) crisis cannot be resolved," said Dennis Morgan, research
associate for the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity.
        But because of a sharp reduction in herds in recent years,
the dangers posed by grazing may be abating. Since 1980, the
number of cattle and sheep on federal land in the Southwest has
fallen by a third, to fewer than 270,000 head from more than 400,000.<p>
        Among the reasons are growing calls for habitat protection
and preservation of endangered wildlife. Stands of old growth
forest are needed for nesting Mexican spotted owls. And high- mountain, 
cold-water streams, which environmentalists say are
ravaged by cattle, are essential for Arizona's dwindling number of
endangered native fish, such as Apache trout.<p>
        One of the biggest reasons for the reduced herds is urban
sprawl, as the recreational needs of an exploding number of city
residents - wanting to tube, hike and hunt - compete with ranching.
        The Southwest Forest Alliance, a coalition of 50 environmental 
groups, is calling for less grazing, not just because of
the drought, but because much of the Southwest is simply too dry
to support ranching.<p>
        Most of the nearly 1,670 ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico who 
have permits to graze livestock on pubic lands are removing animals 
during the drought.
        But as many as 50 ranchers in both states have refused, setting 
up a possible show in coming weeks with federal agents.<p>
        Adding tension is the charge that cattle are to blame for the 
threat of fires.
        Steve Brophy, treasurer of the Arizona Cattle grower's 
Association, said the notion that cattle contribute to fire danger is 
laughable. "I don't know how anybody under the sun could possibly blame 
a cow," said Brophy, whose family runs several ranches in eastern 
Arizona."<p>
        "Grazing also heightens fire dangers by aggravating the drought, 
some experts say.
        Robert Ohmart, a professor of ecology at Arizona State 
University's Center for Environmental Studies, maintains that cattle 
may be harming the watershed of rivers that flow to the Valley.<p>
        Instead of absorbing rains like a sponge and slowly releasing 
them through springs, Ohmart said, the damaged land acts as a frying 
pan, so bare and hot that it causes much of the water to evaporate."<p>
        Earlier this year, Ohmart wrote a scathing review of a report 
published by the New Mexico Department of Agriculture, which called for 
more cattle grazing in wilderness areas. The report concluded that 
"economically, it might shield the ranchers and surrounding communities 
from bankruptcy."<p>
        The report was also dismissed by Charles Cartwright Jr., the 
Southwest's Regional Forester for the Forest Service. Instead of more 
grazing, Cartwright said, forest lands need to be thinned through 
prescribed burns, ignited during moist period so they can be controlled.<p>
        Dave Stewart, a range-management official for the U.S. Forest 
Service in Albuquerque, said a lack of grass in some areas recently has 
prevented the agency from setting controlled burns.
        Grasses carry fast-moving spot fires that clear out the 
abundance of brush, needles and small pines while leaving unharmed the 
mature fire resistant trees with their thick bark. Spot fires return 
nutrients to the soil, and grasses quickly sprout back.
        A review conducted by the Forest Service last year concluded 
that the lack of culling fires threatens to "unravel and destroy" 
wilderness areas."<p>
    A measure before Congress known as the Livestock Grazing Act, 
backed by the Cattle Grower's Association would ensure that ranching 
continues and that government regulation is limited.
        President Clinton has vowed to veto the measure.<p>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Anthrax">Anthrax</A> outbreak casts shadow over homes site</CENTER></H3>

BY MICHAEL HORNSBY ...The Times: Britain:July 22 1996<P>

 FEARS of an outbreak of anthrax caused by spores that have lain dormant for decades is delaying the start of a major housing development.


Spores of the anthrax bacteria, lying inert in the soil, are thought to have been disturbed by ditch-dredging work on Storridge Farm, near Westbury in Wiltshire, where three cattle have died of the disease since early June.

<P>

Anthrax is one of the deadliest and oldest diseases known to man. It can infect human beings as well as livestock and, although it is extremely rare in Britain, in its most severe form is nearly always fatal if not treated promptly with antibiotics.

<P>

Local people fear that the spores might have been carried along a stream from an abandoned leather works on the outskirts of Westbury, where infected hides are said to have been buried in the past.


The farm is about a mile- and-a-half downstream from the works. The former tannery is on a 50-acre site, mostly now farmland, that has been earmarked for development. West Wiltshire District Council is considering a proposal to build 800 homes, a superstore and a primary school.

<P>

Alison Irving, a Liberal Democrat councillor who lives near the old tannery, said: "Local residents are worried that once construction workers start disturbing the site, they could release anthrax spores that have been lying dormant up to now."


Concern voiced by Mrs Irving led the council's plan ning committee to defer a decision on the housing scheme and to ask Persimmon Homes, the development company, to analyse soil and water at the site.

<P>

David Bardwell, the council's principal environmental officer, said: "We are aware of the site's history and we need to be sure that it is safe for development." He added: "The developers need to be satisfied, too, because their employees would be most at risk."

The managing director of Persimmon Homes, Clive Drinkwater, said: "We are in the process of appointing consultants to investigate and report back on the condition of the land. We will then agree with the local authority any work which may need to be undertaken."

<P>

There is pressure to develop the site as the council has been allocated 11,000 of the 65,000 houses that the Department of the Environment says Wiltshire must provide by 2011. It is government policy to devel op old industrial sites where possible.

<P>

The leather works, which dates from the last century and once employed 200 people, went out of business in 1983 and is a wasteland of broken-down buildings and rusting machinery.

In the 1950s, a cluster of anthrax cattle deaths occurred on farms either side of Biss Brook, which runs through the former tannery. There are records showing that the owners paid farmers compensation for the animals.

<P>

Former workers at the tan nery say that <B>in the immediate postwar years, imported foreign hides often came with an anthrax warning</B>. One who worked at the plant from 1946 to 1981 remembers <B>two mild cases among employees</B>.

<P>

Until the latest outbreak at Storridge Farm, no case of anthrax among cattle had been reported in the area for more than 20 years. It is thought the farmer may have disturbed old anthrax spores while dredging a ditch and spread them unwittingly over adjacent pasture where cattle were grazing.<HR>

<h3><center>Anthrax found in <A NAME="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</A> cow herd </center></h3>

The Times: Britain: July 6 1996<p>

ANTHRAX, the virulent bacterial disease, has been confirmed in two cows on a farm near Westbury, Wiltshire, the Ministry of Agriculture disclosed yesterday.

The farm, which has not been identified, is three miles downstream from a disused tannery where local people say <b>infected hides had been buried more than 30 years ago</b>. The site has been earmarked for a housing development. "It is thought that the farmer may have brought anthrax spores to the surface while digging a field close to the river bank," a Ministry spokesman said.

<p>

Anthrax was diagnosed in the first cow on June 10 and in the second on July 1. The disease may be characterised by high fever and diarrhoea but often the animal dies suddenly without showing any signs of sickness. Infection is usually through food or water. Two or three cases of anthrax are notified to the ministry every year. The Wiltshire outbreak is the first this year. Any animal that gets the disease must be burnt and the affected farms quarantined and disinfected.

<p>

In November 1994, three cows on a farm in Gloucestershire were infected by anthrax spores thought to have been left in the soil after another animal with the disease had been buried there 52 years ago. Even burial in quicklime is not sufficient to destroy the spores.

<p>

In <b>1942</b> a canister containing anthrax was exploded over Gruinard Island off northwest Scotland as part of a Second World War experiment in biological warfare. The Ministry of Defence declared the island <b>safe for crofters to return only in 1988</b>, after a two-year decontamination programme.

        <b>Pestivirus</b> has also been one of my areas of investigation in the
vaccine industry.  Because of it's small size it does pass through many of
the more common filters.  The usual filter being used is .2 microns and the
common smallest is .07 microns.  There has been a statment that 99% of all
foetal calf serums have pestivirus present.  Foetuses don't mount their own
immune response till about day 90 of gestation so the presence of virus
prior to that time will not mount an antibody response as it becomes
excepted as normal when the immune system becomes active.  Co-inidentally,
pestivirus has been isolated from children with microencephaly.  Although
conclusions cannot be drawn, they are worth consideration.  Foetal bovine
serum is the most common serum used by the biologics industry.<p>

        By the way, the US does have vampire bats.  The most common cause of
<b>rabies in cattle</b> in Texas is the Mexican vampire bat.  In the norther states
it is the result of attacks on cattle by foxes, badgers and possibly skunks.
Since the animal loses its normal fear of larger animals, even a skunk will
attack a cow and all it takes is one bite.  <p>

        I still strongly believe that Marsh's work on downer cow suggests
that many of the cases are a BSE situation.  The fact that calcium can cause
temporary relief is also suggestive of this since we know that prions are
involved in mircrotubule formation at synapses for calcium transfer.  By
overloading the system with calcium, you may in turn temporarily overide the
obstruction of faulty microtubules."

<H3><CENTER>Military may <A NAME="vaccinate">vaccinate</A> 1.5 million troops against anthrax</CENTER></H3>
Associated Press ... 3 October 1996 
<P>
WASHINGTON -- Defense Secretary William Perry is considering a Pentagon plan to vaccinate the 1.5 million members of the active-duty military against the deadly biological warfare agent anthrax, senior defense officials said Wednesday.


Though final approval could be weeks away, the momentum for the anthrax vaccinations got a major boost when the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that planning for the $120 million program proceed, Pentagon spokesman Sam Grizzle said.

<P>

Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gave the verbal go-ahead and is expected to send Perry a formal recommendation shortly.


Troops deployed to Korea and the Persian Gulf -- considered the highest risk regions for biological warfare -- would be first to receive the six inoculations over 18 months, Grizzle said. Service members within 35 days of going to those areas would be next on the priority list.

<P>

The program, described in Wednesday's editions of the Washington Post, marks a reversal of policy among senior commanders, who have worried that the vaccine was costly, not needed and might have worrisome side effects.

A defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the vaccine is licensed by the Food and Drug Administration and has been in use since 1970 with ''very few side effects.''

<P>

Anthrax is considered the most lethal of biological agents by the U.S. government. Anthrax is an infectious disease that normally afflicts animals, especially cattle and sheep. Veterinarians and others who work with these animals are among those who have been inoculated.  

<P>

The Anthrax spores are stable and remain viable in water and soil for years. Of greater importance to the Pentagon, anthrax can easily be put into a dry powder form that can be stored as a weapon for long periods. Inhaling even microscopic amounts can be fatal. The inoculation provides effective protection.

Military leaders had favored a multipurpose vaccine to counter a variety of biological weapons. And some thought the United States could deter an anthrax attack by threatening a massive retaliation.

<P>

But the Pentagon has become increasingly concerned about a possible biological attack. Iraq, Russia and as many as 10 other countries are believed to have the capability to use anthrax in weapons, although no one has used it in battle.

''The whole area of biological warfare was one not very familiar to the chiefs,'' an unidentified senior defense official told the Post. ''It's been a gradual process for the military to recognize the seriousness of the threat and understand the kind of protection that vaccination provides.''

<P>

About 150,000 of the more than 500,000 U.S. personnel sent to the Persian Gulf War in 1990 and 1991 were given anthrax vaccinations out of concern that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein would use the biological weapon.

There has been some speculation that the vaccine may be linked to the Gulf War syndrome illness that many U.S. soldiers have suffered, but no link has been established.

Nando and Reuter Information Service <br>
7 July 1996<p> 

   LONDON (Jul 5, 1996 5:41 p.m. EDT) - French researchers said Friday they had discovered what they believe to be the first case of a non-laboratory monkey catching a form of mad cow disease.<p>


    The researchers, writing in the Lancet medical journal, said the discovery appears to back up theories that mad cow disease can be transmitted between species through the food chain. [Bons N et al (1996) "Spontaneous spongiform encephalopathy in a young
adult rhesus monkey", The Lancet, 348, 6 July 1996, 55.]<p>

    The monkey, which died at Montpellier zoo in 1992, had been fed on meat products.
    The only monkeys previously reported to have contracted spongiform encephalopathy, the brain disease that affects cows as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) and humans as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), were deliberately infected in laboratory experiments.<p>

    "As far as we are aware, this is the first reported case of spontaneously developed spongiform encephalopathy in a monkey," the research team from the University of Montpellier wrote.<p>

    "The feeding of this monkey with animal protein raises the possibility of cross-species transmission of the disease through contaminated foodstuff."

   Montpellier's zoo bought the rhesus monkey, born in 1982, from a British zoo in 1986.  In 1991, the monkey developed the first symptoms of spongiform encephalopathy, lethargy and mood swings.  It was fed on standard monkey food, <b>including one containing meat products declared fit for human consumption.</b>

<h3><center>Between <a NAME="Cows">Cows</a> and Monkeys</center></h3>
NATURE 381, 734-735, 1996 (June 27)<br>
From: <a HREF="mailto:adriano@pathol.unizh.ch">Adriano Aguzzi</a> <p>

What would constitute definitive evidence that bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) has spread to humans? This question - the importance of
which cannot be overstated - is exercising scientists as much as politicians
and public health officials and for several months it has been a front-page
issue in the European press. <p>

The latest storm was provoked by reports of a
novel form of spongiform encephalopathy occurring in young people in Great
Britain and, at least in one case, in France<sup>1,2</sup>. The salient feature (which
was termed, perhaps somewhat conservatively, Ñvariant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease" or vCJD) is the presence of abundant "florid plaques", large
cortical deposits of pathological prion protein (PrPRES) decorated by
vacuolated brain tissue in a daisy-like fashion (a in the figure).<p>

Two weeks ago came news of a study with macaque monkeys, released at a
press conference, which reinforces the suspicion of a link between BSE and
vCJD, and adds pathogenetic evidence to epidemiological data. Elements of
the study concerned, which was carried out by LasmÈzas and colleagues, now
appear in Scientific Correspondence on page 743 of this issue<sup>3</sup>. <p>

The authors
have found that intracerebral inoculation of three macaques with brain
extracts from BSE-sick cattle produced a brain disease with plaques
identical to those of vCJD patients (b in the figure), whereas no plaques
were seen in two macaques inoculated with sporadic human CJD. The monkeys
are reported to develop a syndrome consisting mainly of prominent cerebellar
signs, but also more exotic signs such as "voracious appetite". The latter
symptom was described by Gajdusek to occur in kuru-affected patients from
Papua, and was ascribed to hypothalamic damage. <p>

The BSE agent shows a characteristic behavior which has never been seen
before in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. For example, it is
highly promiscuous in its choice of hosts. Unlike its counterpart in sheep,
mice and hamsters, it appears to infect animals of other species easily,
especially when transmitted orally. The molecular basis for these
"strain-specific" traits is completely unknown. <p>

Because kuru also exhibits
abundant plaques, one might argue that the presumptive oral route of
application is the main determinant of neuropathology in vCJD. The
observations of LasmÈzas et al. run counter to this argument and suggests
that the neuropathological findings characteristic of vCJD in man represent
a specific trait of the BSE strain of prions in primates. (Here I will use
"prion" as a generic term to refer to the infectious agent involved in
transmissible encephalopathies, irrespective of its actual physical nature.
There is strong, but not yet clinching, evidence that the agent is an
aberrant isoform of a normal cellular protein called PrPC. The agent is
thought to recruit PrPC and transform it into further infectious protein.)<p>

The results of Lasmezas et al., of course, leave many questions open, the
first of which is whether the macaque system is a realistic model of the
situation in humans? Although the inoculum used is large by molecular
criteria, is equivalent to only 50-100 mg of infectious brain homogenate. <b>It
is unsettling that these amounts are well within the range of brain tissue
present in commercial food products for human consumption until few years
ago.</b><p>

 On the other hand, however spectacular (and worrying) these findings
are, it should be stressed that transmission was achieved by direct
intracerebral inoculation, and we can hope that the oral route of
administration will be considerably less efficient. Although there is no
available data on the relative efficiency of oral as opposed to
intracerebral transmission of BSE to primates, we know that as little as 500
mg of brain extract administered orally produced encephalopathy in 1 out of
6 sheep<sup>3</sup>.<p>
 
Next, how can we go about estimating the risk of contracting the disease
after exposure to the BSE agent? One issue of utmost interest is the
possibility of genetic susceptibility to infection. By extrapolation of the
findings in transgenic and knockout mice, two factors may be expected to
play a key role: first, the primary sequence of the PRNP gene which encodes
the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC); and, second, the availability of
PrPC for conversion into pathological PrPRES by the infectious agent (which
may or may not be identical to PrPRES).<p>

 As far as the first issue goes, the
polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP gene (which encodes either methionine
or valine) is emerging as a crucial parameter4. All published British vCJD
patients, as well as the recent case from France, were homozygous for
129Met, while a further suspected patient is homozygous for 129Val (J.
Collinge, pers. comm). Therefore, 129Met/Val heterozygosity (prevalence: 51%
in Caucasians) would appear to be a protective factor. Within the framework
of the protein-only hypothesis<sup>5</sup> this finding may indicate that heterozygous
individuals produce two PrPC moieties which are subtly different from each
other, and reduce the efficiency of PrPC-PrPRES conversion by reciprocal
competition. <p>

Regrettably, this important issue was not studied in detail:
the codon 129 status in the three inoculated animals was not determined, and
indeed it is unclear whether codon 129 is polymorphic in the macaque. 
A further potential risk factor may be represented by the amount of PrPC
present in the brain. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that prion
replication relies on the presence of PrPC (ref. 6), and that Prnp+/o
heterozygous mice with reduced levels of PrPC develop a milder form of
scrapie after challenge with infectious prions<sup>7,8</sup>. Moreover, PrPC is an
essential mediator of pathogenesis since chronic exposure of Prnpo/o mice to
large doses of prions does not induce any brain damage<sub>9</sub>. So it will be
important to confirm that PrPC expression levels in macaque monkeys are
similar to those of humans. <p>

Another largely not understood issue relates to the mechanisms of
neuro-invasiveness. How do prions, when administered via the gastrointestinal
tract, travel across the body and colonize the nervous system? Several lines
of evidence point to lymphatic organs as a possible link. As recently shown
by LasmÈzas and colleagues, the neuroinvasiveness of intraperitoneally
administered prions is impaired in SCID mice (which suffer from major
lymphatic defects), and can be reconstituted by transfer of spleen cells<sup>10</sup>.<p>

While transgenic mouse models are proving helpful in dissecting this
problem, they may fall short of reproducing all the peculiarities of the BSE
agent. The reason why caution needs to be exerted is that, although BSE
prions may replicate in the lymphoreticular system of most species
(including sheep, hamster, and mouse), they show a surprising hesitance to
infect spleen and lymph nodes of cattle. <p>

One obvious question, therefore,
which demands to be addressed with urgency, reads: Will BSE prions cause
vCJD in macaques even if they are administered orally? If so, what is the
minimal infectious dose? Such studies are demanding since they require
exposure of a large number of primates to serial dilutions of the infectious
agent over many years. Further experiments will have to address the
molecular basis of the strain characteristics of the BSE and the human vCJD
agents. A thorough understanding of the latter is likely to be a
precondition to devising rational approaches to prevention and, perhaps, to
treatment<sup>11</sup>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT

<BR>The Times: Britain:June 24 1996

<P>
THE manager of the farm where "mad cow" disease was first identified has spoken publicly for the first time of his horror as he watched a mysterious illness in one cow turn into a national disaster.

Eleven years ago, at Plurenden Manor Farm near High Halden, Kent, Tom Forsyth and his head dairy stockman first noted the symptoms later to be diagnosed as BSE.

<P>

He said: "Looking back over the years since then, horror is the only word to decribe my feelings &#173; horror that we had got something that seemed to be out of control. We did not know where it was coming from and we did not know how to put it right. Even now the origin of the disease is still not known for certain."

<P>

In April 1985 a cow called Jonquil started behaving oddly. The stockman, John Green, was in charge of the herd of 300 Holstein Friesians. Now retired, he said: "From being a nice quiet cow, she had turned into a nuisance in the milk parlour, acting aggressively towards the other cows. She seemed to hallucinate."

<P>

The men's first thought was that the cow might be suffering from "grass staggers", which can affect cattle after they are turned out to lush grass in the spring. Caused by a shortage of magnesium in the bloodstream, it is characterised by shivering and staggering, symptoms superficially similar to those of BSE.

<P>

The cow did not respond to the usual treatment. Colin Whitaker, the local cattle vet, found she had cystic ovaries. He said: "I treated the ovaries, which got better, but the cow did not. She got worse and was very unsteady on her feet. I thought she might have a brain tumour or abscess."

<P>

Eventually the animal was put down. For six months or more, no similar cases appeared. Mr Forsyth hoped that the condition was one of the unexplained curiosities farmers encounter from time to time. Then, at the start of 1986, several more cows went down with identical symptoms.

<P>

Mr Forsyth realised he was dealing with something new and frightening. He said: "With our vet, we considered a whole range of possible causes, from lead poisoning to rabies, but nothing made sense."

<P>

The decision was taken to alert the Ministry of Agriculture. For the first time, in November 1986, pathologists at the Central Veterinary Laboratory at Weybridge, Surrey, diagnosed an encephalopathy similar to scrapie in sheep.

This has led to the hypothesis that BSE had been caused by cattle feed containing sheep remains.

<P>

Mr Forsyth said: "It was hard to believe that a scrapie-like disease could have passed to cattle. Sheep had had scrapie for centuries and had been living together with cattle without any problems. Farmers had been including meat and bone meal in cattle rations since the 1920s."

<P>

Since 1986, he has seen "many" cows on his farm go down with BSE &#173; he declines to give an exact number &#173; among a toll of 160,000 across the nation. As many as 146 of his 300 dairy cows could be lost under the new cull agreed by Britain at the Florence summit. This will target cattle regarded as being at special risk of developing BSE because they were reared alongside animals that have since died of the disease.

<P>

Plurenden Manor Farm is still flourishing. It is part of R. Sternberg Farms, an amalgamation of several holdings covering more than 4,000 acres, on about 3,000 of which arable crops are grown. The business is owned by the family of the late Lord Plurenden of High Halden, a German-born entrepreneur and refugee from the Nazis, who was a close friend of Sir Harold Wilson. He was created a life peer in 1975 and served for a time as chairman of the British Agricultural Export Council.

</B></I><P>

 JOHN MAJOR invoked the spirit of roast beef yesterday in a signed article for the conservative Madrid daily <I>ABC</I>.

<P>

In a long and elegant essay entitled "A solution for the beef crisis", the Prime Minister said Britain could not tolerate such an attack on its national interests as the worldwide ban on its beef exports.

<P>

The beef industry, Mr Major wrote, "is a part of the psyche of our nation". He said: "For Germany, forests play a special part in her national life. For France, it is her language and cultural traditions. For Britain, our seas and 'the roast beef of Old England' matter more deeply than the simple, bald, economic figures say."

<P>

He insisted that "free trade is a fundamental principle of the European Union which cannot be set aside without very good reason". The EU beef ban "was a disproportionate reaction unjustified by science, which has unsettled beef markets across Europe".

<P>

There were four elements to the beef crisis, he wrote: "Animal health, public health, consumer confidence and politics." The EU had banned beef exports "because these four issues have become jumbled up. Our task is to separate them and make sure we have sensible solutions for each of them ... consumer confidence is not a basis for banning trade but I accept that it is important."

<P>

Ending his article on a conciliatory note, Mr Major said that at the Florence summit he would be "very willing to listen to the ideas which our partners bring to the table" so that a framework for agreement could be constructed. He concluded: "For that is how Europe works: with goodwill by all."

<H3><CENTER>Smithfield meat <A NAME="porters">porters</A> bow to market forces </CENTER></H3>

BY IAN MURRAY ... The Times: Britain:June 21 1996



 A &#163;2 MILLION "redundancy" package yesterday brought down one of the last bastions of trade union restrictive practices &#173; Smithfield meat market in London. A total of 162 porters, 69 of them pensioners and many more than 70 years old, had been holding out against the introduction of equipment to carry carcasses required by the European Union.

<P>

The porters, self-employed and consequently not entitled to redundancy, are all members of the Transport and General Workers Union. They are allowed to work in the market under a licence granted by the Corporation of London. Only those nominated by the union are given a licence and they guard their closed shop closely. Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother is an honorary member.

<P>

"The market is an area the trade union legislation of Margaret Thatcher never dared to enter," according to Peter Martinelli, a meat trader and member of the City council. "This deal is a golden opportunity to end all that and start a new age for Smithfield," he said.

<P>

The porters, who are divided into specialist groups of pullers-back, pitchers, shunters, cartminders and bummarees, have been handling meat in the same way as their Victorian forefathers. The pullers-back drag the carcasses to the tailboards of the incoming vehicles. The pitchers carry goods from the tailboards and pitch them into the market. The shunters move the lorries and the bummarees have the exclusive right to carry the meat from the market butcher to the buyer's vehicle. They are paid a penny for each pound of meat they shift and, with around 2,500 tonnes of meat going through each week, can earn up to &#163;50,000 a year.

<P>

EU regulations came into force three years ago requiring all meat to be handled mechanically and forbidding porters from tossing carcasses over their shoulders or onto trolleys. The Corporation, which owns the markets and has a statutory duty to provide them, launched a &#163;60 million refurbishment of the Grade II listed Victorian halls, equipping them with overhead rails to transport carcasses. Although work on the first hall was completed last year, it is still not in use because of the difficulty in making the porters accept that they are redundant.

<P>

The Corporation recruited Dennis Boyd, who had been chief conciliation officer at ACAS for 12 years, to help. He had 59 meetings with the porters and the Smithfield Market Traders Association over nearly two years and said that the negotiaions proved the most complicated in which he had been involved. As recently as last month he had made little progress.

<P>

In the end he advised that the only way out was for the Corporation to pay redundancy money, even though the porters were not entitled to it. Even those over retirement age were to be offered &#163;8,000 each. Others would receive up to &#163;20,000. About 30 bummarees, who will run the overhead system, will keep their jobs. The traders, anxious to move into the refur bished hall, agreed to pay 40 per cent of the bill. A final meeting with the pitchers at 4am yesterday clinched the deal.

<P>

"This is a necessary step for the Corporation to win back control of its own market," Nicholas Anstee, the market committee chairman, told the Corporation's Court of Common Council at its meeting yesterday. "Frankly, it is the best that can be achieved by negotiation and if we fail to accept it this will lead to a strike and to possible closure."

<P>

Richard Scriven, chairman of the finance committee which must find the money, was outraged. "We are being blackmailed and in my opinion this is not a suitable use of public funds," he said. But having been warned again that the market was in jeopardy if the deal was refused, he voted with the rest of the court to accept it.

<P>

Tom O'Driscoll, the TGWU markets officer, said: "This is the end of an era and a lot of these people will not know what to do now because all they have ever done is work.

<P>

"They are tough men who have worked hard in appalling conditions for decades. They deserve every penny they are being offered."

<H3><CENTER>Farmers demand full payment for extra <A NAME="culled">culled</A> cows </CENTER></H3>



BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT

<BR>The Times: Britain:June 21 1996<P>



FARMERS demanded full compensation yesterday for any extra cull of cattle ordered by the Government as part of a deal to lift the European Union's export ban on British beef.

<P>

Contrary to claims by Downing Street that only "clapped-out old milkers" would be affected by the cull, they said thousands of high-value dairy cows in the prime of life would be destroyed.

<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture conceded yesterday that potentially up to 147,000 animals could be affected by the cull, which is designed to remove animals identified as being at particular risk of developing "mad cow" disease.

<P>

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, told the Commons yesterday that farmers would be given "significantly higher" compensation than the &#163;480 they receive for each cow under the existing slaughter scheme for animals over 30 months old. The cost of the eradication programme so far has been &#163;190 million and Mr Hogg predicted that figure would rise to &#163;1.5 billion over the next three years. Tony Tapper, the Nottinghamshire secretary of the National Farmers' Union (NFU), calculates that under the new cull he could be facing the loss of 80 of the 250 dairy cows he keeps on his 2,000-acre Kingston Farm near Newark. He estimates that each animal could cost up to &#163;3,000 to replace &#173; a total bill of &#163;240,000.

<P>

"There will be many others worse affected than me," he said. "It will be devastating if we do not get proper compensation for our animals, many of which are in the prime of life with several years of milking still left in them."

<P>

Since 1988, Mr Tapper has lost 40 cows to BSE. He has received the standard compensation rate for these animals of about &#163;630 each. That has covered about two thirds of the cost of replacement.

<P>

As a dairy farmer, he has not suffered too much from the ban on selling cattle older than 30 months for food. He can keep his dairy cows for milk production until they would be slaughtered anyway. Under the new cull, however, Mr Tapper would be forced to kill much younger cows. "I reckon that 45 of the 80 cows I would lose would be between only four and five years old," he said. "These have at least four more years of milk and calf production in them. Each cow produces about &#163;1,850 worth of milk a year.

<P>

"It is nonsense for Heseltine to say only a handful of cows would be affected and that most would be old and close to slaughter anyway."

<P>

The idea is to trace and destroy any cattle that were born at the same time and on the same farms as the 162,000 animals, nearly all from dairy herds, that have died of BSE. Farmers like Mr Tapper, who have had a significant number of BSE cases spread over several years, will thus be particularly badly hit.

<P>

The vast majority of the cattle killed under the new cull would be perfectly healthy. Ministry officials estimated earlier this month that only about 1,450 out of 80,000 at-risk animals culled would have gone on to develop BSE.

<H3><CENTER>Cattle <A NAME="Loss">Loss</A> totals $794 million</CENTER></H3>

By Daniel Fisher  ... 21 JKune 96<BR>

Bloomberg Business News<P>

AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas cattle producers lost almost $794 million through May because of a drought that increased feeding costs and forced ranchers to slaughter hundreds of thousands of head of cattle, the state's comptroller said.

<P>

The slaughters forced ranchers to sell into a market that already has an oversupply of beef, Texas Comptroller John Sharp said. The state had a relatively dry winter and spring, extending a drought that in some parts of Texas has gone on for almost three years.

<P>

''One industry official said he can't remember when so many things were out of kilter at the same time,'' Sharp said in a news release. ''Cattle ranchers are working hard to weather these factors until the outlook for prices improves.''

<P>

Consumers haven't fully benefited from falling beef prices, Sharp said. While wholesale beef prices dropped by a third from their 1993 peak, retail prices fell only 7 percent, Sharp said.

<P>

The price disparity led farmers and ranchers to complain to state officials that meatpackers use anti-competitive practices to keep wholesale costs low, the comptroller said. He proposed an electronic pricing network to ensure that cattle ranchers obtain fair prices and will study whether the state should require arms-length relationships among feeding, producing and processing sectors of the cattle industry.

<P>

Texas' Agriculture Department said a major investigation of buying practices by meatpackers in Kansas failed to turn up any evidence of price manipulation.<HR>

FROM RICHARD OWEN

<BR>THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS ... June 21 1996<P>



 LAMBERTO DINI, the Italian Foreign Minister, yesterday said his country would not allow the row over "mad cow" disease to disrupt today's Florence summit at the expense of European integration and "irreversible" progress toward a single currency.

<P>

"John Major should by now have sufficient reassurance that we are on our way to agreement over British beef," he said. Signor Dini and Professor Romano Prodi, the Italian Prime Minister, would meet Mr Major and Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, early today to try to ensure that Britain did not push all other business aside.

<P>

Signor Dini appeared confident and relaxed, joking that he would offer Mr Major and other European Union leaders <I>bistecca fior</I><I>entina,</I> the thick, charcoal-grilled steak specialty of Florence, his home town. "I am sure they will love it," he said with a broad grin.

<P>

The Foreign Minister, a former central banker and international economist who was caretaker Prime Minister for the first four months of the year, is more experienced in international affairs than Signor Prodi, the mild-mannered economics professor who steered his Centre-Left coalition to victory in April's election.

<P>

Signor Dini and Signor Prodi are pinning their hopes for a smooth end to Italy's EU presidency on the framework agreement and Britain's latest concessions on slaughtering cattle. "I do not believe the British will engage in boycotts and disrupt the meeting in Florence," he said in an interview in his Rome office before leaving for Florence. "It just doesn't make sense. The issue has already been overtaken by events." Signor Dini said that job creation and monetary union were at the top of the Florence agenda. "Monetary union is a historic step, and we cannot afford to fail. It must be an irreversible move, and there must be no watering down of the Maastricht criteria for joining the single currency."

<P>

Signor Dini said: "BSE will not dominate the summit, neither will it disrupt it. 'Mad cow' disease is not a political issue. It is a health issue which has political consequences."

<P>

Substantial progress had been made in the past few days on the British position, taking into account the views of the EU scientific committee, the veterinary committee and the new multi-disciplinary committee.

<P>

British beef exports to non-EU "third countries" remained a problem, but the agreement on how to proceed with slaughtering was "an important step forward".

<P>

Signor Dini insisted that neither Italy's temporary political chaos nor "mad cow" disease had been a major impediment to Italy's hand ling of EU business. Britain's policy of non-cooperation had been a "hindrance", but had been applied in a selective manner in recent weeks. "My strong expectation is that Britain will take a co-operative attitude to the items on the Florence agenda."

<P>

He said that Italy, which hands over the presidency to Ireland on July 1, had succeeded in launching the inter-governmental conference (IGC) in Turin in March, even though it was overshadowed by "mad cow" disease. The IGC agenda on reforming Maastricht deals with the powers of EU institutions, cross-border issues such as immigration, employment and Europol, and common foreign and defence policy.

<P>

He said Italy had been able to keep foreign policy on track by holding two summits on Bosnia, and had identified areas for compromise for a draft IGC treaty later this year. "We are on our way," he said. "We are creating a new Europe for the year 2000."

<P>

Signor Dini said he and Mr Major had agreed on the mechanism for regulating the relationship between those inside the single currency and those outside it; the "ins and outs". He expected the lira to rejoin the exchange-rate mechanism soon, perhaps by the autumn, to prepare for Italian membership of the single currency.

<P>

The lira had shown strength and stability since the Centre-Left Government was formed, and inflation had fallen. The Prodi administration has outlined spending cuts of &#163;6.5 billion to reduce the budget deficit without, so far, arousing the discontent that has hit France and Germany.

<BR>Major hopes for beef deal ... June 21 1996<P>


JOHN MAJOR flew to Italy last night claiming he was hours away from a deal to end the beef crisis. But he faced charges at home that he had been humiliated and routed and from his fellow leaders that his tactics had damaged the European Union.

<P>

The Prime Minister arrived in Florence for the two-day summit ready to accept the broad outlines of the Brussels plan put forward to end the four-week-old "beef war". He will indicate today that he will end the British policy of non-cooperation if the summit approves the plan for a stage-by-stage raising of the beef ban and if it makes plain that it is ready to do so without conditions in the final communiqu&eacute; tomorrow afternoon.

<P>

One of Britain's key remaining demands, which Mr Major will press for today, is for a lifting of the ban on exports to third countries. As fellow leaders arrived at the summit it was by no means certain that Mr Major would get a clear run. There were indications that Germany might insist on tighter political control of the ban-lifting process. Mr Major would be forced to oppose such a move and a senior German diplomat said last night: "Don't bet on a deal."

<P>

Even so there was a mood of greater optimism that one of the most unhappy periods in recent EU history might be coming to an end. Professor Romano Prodi, the Italian Prime Minister and summit chairman, said: "The worst is over."

<P>

French officials said President Chirac could live with the Commission approach.

<P>

Mr Major left behind him a deeply dissatisfied Tory party and a farming industry furious at the Government's decision to increase the cull programme to cover tens of thousands more animals born in 1989.

<P>

In a move to placate them the Government announced that they would get a "significantly" higher level of compensation for cows in that category than the &#163;480 given for those slaughtered under the blanket destruction of cattle aged over 30 months. Downing Street estimates that only an additional 25,000 cows would have to be slaughtered before the end of their working lives as the result of the new cull.

<P>

The Ministry of Agriculture is now negotiating with the National Farmers' Union and the European Commission over the size of compensation payments.

<P>

MPs were despondent that the Government had been forced to make further concessions on the slaughter of cattle without getting a firm timetable for the lifting of the ban, although Mr Major said he hoped it could start in the autumn. Tory MPs were angry but resigned.

<P>

The Liberal Democrats will attempt to exploit Tory differences in an all-day debate on the beef crisis which they have called for next Tuesday.

<P>

Before leaving London Mr Major was subjected to a withering attack from Tony Blair, the Labour leader. During a fierce question time clash Mr Blair said Mr Major was so desperate to extract himself from the mess he had got Britain into that he would settle for anything. He pointed out that Mr Major had failed to secure lifting of the third country ban, there was no additional compensation and no timetable. "There is humiliation, there is ignominy in this deal. In fact it is not a deal, it is a rout," Mr Blair declared.

<P>

A defiant Mr Major defended his handling of the crisis. He said that for eight weeks after the ban was imposed nothing was offered by the rest of Europe. Now four weeks after the process of non-cooperation began agreement was close.

<P>

In television interviews before he set off for Florence an angry Mr Major insisted that "not a single extra cow" would be slaughtered under the new deal. He emphasised that the average age for a cow to be slaughtered was 6 years and 6 months so many of the estimated 67,000 cows now over 7 years old would have been killed anyway.

18 June 1996<P>


     EU Socialists tonight set out key conditions for accepting a
framework to lift the European Union ban on British beef exports
following a decision by the European Commission.<P>

      The statement from the European Parliament's largest political
group followed news that the European Commission had agreed to table
proposals for lifting the ban subject to the British Government ending
its policy of non-cooperation with the EU.<P>

      Socialist leader Pauline Green (Lab., London North) said:  'We
welcome the framework if it is based on good, substantial, scientific
evidence which guarantees two things -- first, that no BSE-infected meat
can enter the food chain and secondly that a programme for the
eradication of BSE is put into action.'<P>

     She added:  'These are the two things that are crucial to restore
consumer confidence and to allay people's very genuine public health
fears across Europe.

     'The framework for lifting the ban can only be agreed if the British
Government abandons its policy of non-cooperation in Europe.  No half-measures,
no ifs and buts -- no staged lifting of its policy of non-cooperation.<P>

     'Europe needs the 15 states to work together on its very real
problems.  The crisis created by the British Government's inept handling

<H3><CENTER>EU moves <A NAME="step">step</A> closer to easing beef ban</CENTER></H3>

BY CHARLES BREMNER AND ANDREW PIERCE

<BR>
The Times: Britain:June 19 1996

<P>
THE European Commission last night gave broad endorsement to a plan to defuse the British beef crisis, although resistance from several commissioners left details to be settled and boded ill for the prospects of a deal at the Florence summit on Friday.

<P>

The proposed framework for easing the export ban will be put to the European Parliament tomorrow. But it already contains steps that the Government considers too demanding and Downing Street reacted cautiously to suggestions of a breakthrough.

<P>

The Commission's plan rejects Britain's call for a quick exemption on exports to non-EU states and requires a selective cattle cull going back to animals born in 1989, a year earlier than that proposed by Britain. The EU's veterinary committee is also expected to seek a broader cull.

<P>

Commission sources were nevertheless confident that Britain would support the plan and urged the Government to end its policy of non-cooperation "in parallel" with the tabling of the proposed framework. Britain has said that it will automatically stop blocking EU business once agreement has been reached.

<P>

Several of the 20 commissioners were reported to be reluctant to endorse even the toughened version of the plan, arguing that Britain should do much more to convince Europe that its anti-BSE measures were effective. A German official depicted the commission paper as an exercise in "bending over backwards" to help Britain, and said: "They are certainly not going to get anything better than this, so they would be wise to take it."

<P>

Downing Street officials were, however, careful not to build up expectations. A spokeswoman said: "There has been a lot of hard negotiations going on and we are still talking. The hard negotiations will intensify in the run-up to Florence."

The Times: Opinion: June 19 1996
<P>

Sir, In attacking Britain for allowing the export of infected animal feed after 1988 (report, June 14), French politicians have inadvertently highlighted the hitherto little-remarked scandal of France's own policy on BSE.

<P>

If the disease is transmitted through feed, and large quantities of contaminated feed were imported into France, it is inconceivable that France can only have suffered the 15 or so cases of BSE that have been officially notified. Further, the policy of slaughtering whole herds whenever a single case is reported clearly does not prevent infected meat from entering the food chain, since the long incubation period means that cattle from these herds may be sold and slaughtered before symptoms appear.

<P>

Whenever <I>Country Life</I> has spoken to the French Ministry of Agriculture they have been emphatic &#173; indeed heated &#173; in their assertion that there is no BSE in France. Consequently, they do not take any precautions against it. The brains, spinal column and other specified offals are not removed from slaughtered animals, as they are here.

<P>

If the French really do believe that BSE is a threat to humans, they have shown appalling insouciance about the danger posed by their own beef. It is hardly surprising that German consumers' confidence in beef has fallen. As a prominent German manufacturer of organic products told me, Germany has open borders with the other European nations and the German consumer is not convinced of the honesty of French farmers or the diligence of the French authorities.

<P>

It seems extraordinary that the European Union is not protecting its citizens by insisting on the removal of specified offals from cattle slaughtered in France. Until it does, surely the British Government should ban the import of p&acirc;t&eacute; and other French products containing beef, on the grounds that France's safety measures do not match those in this country,

Sir, You reported on Friday that there was outrage in France at the alleged failure of the European Commission to prevent the export of suspect animal feed from Britain in 1989.

<P>

The Commission raised the issue of the safety of animal feed in 1988, but was rebuffed by member states, including both Britain and France. It was not until 1994 that regulations were introduced at the European level.

 

Many of us are angered by the efforts of member states, including our own, to scapegoat the Commission for their own mistakes and shortcomings.

</I>Sir, Your headline today, "Scientists find direct evidence for BSE link", simplifies and distorts.



In fact the transmission of BSE to monkeys was achieved only by injecting material into their brains (not, by the way, the first time this has been done).


There is no evidence that BSE can be transmitted orally into monkeys nor any proof of a link between BSE and CJD. There has been no rise in the normal incidence of CJD cases, even though evidence has been found of a different kind of CJD. Indeed, the number of cases of CJD actually came down last year.

<P>

But even if there were a link between BSE and CJD we have the strictest safeguards in the world in place. This is why the experts are able to assert that British beef is safe to eat.


I am in favour of everybody being made aware of the facts on BSE because this is a matter of such understandable public concern. But the debate should be conducted on the basis of science, not sensationalism.

Sir, Your headline today, "Britain may be frozen out of hostile EU", at least raises the prospect of our leaving by mutual consent.



When we joined the EEC, was there anyone who believed that Brussels could decree that we should not send our beef to South Africa or other third countries even if they wanted it?

<P>

Such interference is monstrous. I warned the Commission at a meeting of the Beef Advisory Committee a month ago that their actions could turn the majority of UK citizens into Euro-sceptics. If this happens they will only have themselves to blame.

  BY CHARLES BREMNER IN ROME<BR>
 June 18 1996    London Times <P>

               BRITAIN'S European partners laid down tough new demands over BSE yesterday, including a
               much wider cull of cattle, if John Major is to be granted a deal at the forthcoming Florence
               summit to end the "beef war". 

               The foreign ministers of Germany, France and other countries, meeting in Rome, endorsed
               the conditions, which will be formally proposed by the European Commission today. <P>


               The Government made plain last night that it was considering calls for the slaughter of an
               additional 20,000 cattle to take the figure to 100,000. But the plan, which might face
               strong opposition from Tory Euro-sceptics, was being looked at only in the context of an
               overall agreement. <P>

               The move came as Tony Blair called on the Government to redouble its efforts to have the
               ban on beef exports lifted and signalled that Labour was preparing to withdraw its support
               for the non-cooperation policy. During a meeting with Helmut Kohl, the German
               Chancellor, in Bonn, Mr Blair argued that the Government should be pressing for both a
               timescale for the ban to be lifted and for extra compensation for the British slaughtering
               programme. He indicated that if Mr Major failed to achieve these objectives at the European
               summit in Florence, which starts on Friday, Labour would withdraw its support for the
               Government's policy. <P>

               EU ministers, weary and frustrated over Mr Major's non-cooperation policy, made clear
               that they were in no mood to offer anything that Mr Major could claim as a victory for his
               tactics. Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, rejected new calls to end the
               non-cooperation drive, but he also offered an inducement for accord at Florence in the form
               of a promise to give Britain's blessing to the long-stalled machinery for setting up
               Europol, the European police intelligence system. <P>

               The Commission's "framework" for the eventual lifting of the ban adds new conditions to
               Britain's original plan. It rejects Britain's wish for a rapid lifting of the global embargo on
               exports. The plan also goes well beyond Britain's offer of a selective cull of some 80,000
               animals, dating back to those born since 1990. French officials were talking of a figure
               close to half a million, although the Commission's experts are only pressing for an extra
               20,000 to be killed, and British officials said yesterday that ministers' minds were not
               closed on the latter proposal. <P>

               However, the culling programme will have to be approved by the Commons. It is clear that
               any plan to increase the figure would be bitterly resisted unless the Prime Minister can
               return from Florence with what Tory MPs would regard as a satisfactory deal. 

               Under the Commission plan, powers of supervision would also be given to a new
               "super-committee" of experts from various disciplines. 

               The Commission plan contains stringent scientific criteria for monitoring each stage of the
               eventual lifting. Jacques Santer, the Commission President, emphasised that the crisis
               could not be resolved "with a quick fix." The framework was not a timetable and agreement
               at Florence would not be legally binding. <HR>

                 JOHN MAJOR's hopes of a swift end to the beef crisis suffered a serious setback last night

                 tougher line over Britain's "insufficiently rigorous" plan to eradicate BSE. 

                 The President assured French farmers that would tackle the consequences of the slump in
                 beef consumption and his spokeswoman said he intended to take a firm line at the Florence
                 summit on Friday and in advance of the next meeting of EU agriculture ministers. Britain is

    THE European Commission, under mounting pressure on the
    Continent to defend its support for Britain in the BSE
    crisis, last night denied that it suppressed a warning
    from its own scientists in early March that mad
     cow  disease could be transmitted to human

    beings.<P>

    The report, in Le Monde, said the Commission's food
    science committee said on March 8 that "the risk of human
    contamination by tissue infected with BSE still exists".
    It said the Commission's agriculture directorate had
    applied "very strong pressure" to prevent it delivering
    the opinion.<P>

    The report, which also mentioned the scientists'
    misgivings over lifting the ban on British gelatine and
    tallow, fuelled the outrage in France yesterday over BSE
    and the Commission's alleged failure to prevent Britain
    from exporting suspect feed to the Continent after it was
    banned at home in 1989.<P>

    Le Monde, which quoted sources on the committee,
    suggested the Commission had withheld new information on
    a link between BSE and CJD two weeks before the House of
    Commons announcement on the issue. Any new evidence held
    by the Commission would have been explosive because Franz
    Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, blames Britain
    for failing to give the Commission advance warning of the
    Commons announcement on a new strain of CJD, which
    triggered the scare.<P>

    The Commission said the committee, which is composed of
    independent scientists, had been stating the position
    held by the Commission for years. A spokesman for Herr
    Fischler said: "Our position since 1988-89 on BSE has
    been that we cannot exclude the risk for human health."
    He described as "absolutely ridiculous" the allegation
    that the report had been suppressed.<P>

    The Commission confirmed that the food committee had also
    voiced doubts on the wisdom of lifting the ban on the
    by-products at another meeting in early April, but he
    said these had been answered to the experts' satisfaction
    by a later meeting of the committee of veterinary
    experts. Officials noted frequent tension between the
    food scientists and the veterinary experts.<P>
<P>
    The Commission found itself under attack from French
    politicians yesterday for failing to stop Britain selling
    potentially infected animal feed in the rest of the EU.<P>

Britain dumped <A NAME="tainted">tainted</A> animal feeds on other countries</CENTER></H3>
The Times: Britain: 6.13.96
<P>

 BRITISH exports of animal feeds suspected of causing "mad cow" disease more than doubled after their sale was banned at home, it was disclosed yesterday.

Most of the cut-price feeds went to France until it, too, banned them, but the exporters swiftly found new markets elsewhere in Europe, the Far East and Israel.

<P>

The disclosure, in the scientific journal <I>Nature </I>, caused serious concern in France where the report was the main item on television news bulletins last night, and the public outrage there will make it hard for President Chirac to give any further ground to John Major on lifting the ban on British beef exports.

<P>

The continued export of suspect feeds after they were withdrawn from the domestic market in 1988 was criticised at the time by a British Veterinary Association official who told <I>Nature:</I> "I badgererd our chief veterinary officer, saying that having identified a "poisoned food", it was <B>immoral to export it</B>. I was firmly put in my place." And Udo Weimar of the German Agriculture Ministry complained: <B>"They knew at that time that meat and bone meal was dangerous, yet they exported it and spread the danger."</B>

<P>

But the Ministry of Agriculture said last night that while the feed had been banned for ruminants, it could still be fed to pigs and poultry and there was no reason not to export it.  [[Pigs are highly susceptible -- webmaster]]

<P>

Customs records show that the exports increased from about 5,000 ton a year to just over 13,000 between 1985 and 1988. But after the product was banned in Britain, <STRONG>overseas sales soared</STRONG> to 30,000 tons in 1989 &#173; and France more than doubled its order to take more than half of the total. When France introduced an import ban in August 1989, the <B>cheap price attracted new customers in Israel and Thailand.</B>

<P>

The <I>Nature </I> report caused immediate recriminations in France, where the Government &#173; under fire for agreeing to ease the British beef exports ban &#173; accused the Socialists of neglecting their responsibilities by allowing the feed imports when they were in power in the 1980s.

<P>

A French expert also used the report as evidence that "mad cow" disease was more widespread than had been reported. He said it was impossible that it was restrict ed to the sporadic cases identified in France, Portugal, Switzerland and Ireland, and said <B>other countries must have been affected and were hiding the truth</B>.

<P>

French officials, however, played down the dangers of the imports, saying traditional farming practices might have prevented a BSE epidemic.

Professor Marc Savey of the National Centre for Veterinary Studies said the health risks would have been greater had French farmers not tended to use a low concentration of animal feed for cattle, using strong concentrations only for pigs and poultry.<HR>

The Times: Britain: June 15 1996<BR>

FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS<P>


BRITAIN'S plan for easing the ban on beef exports earned a mixed review from Europe's veterinary officials yesterday, raising new doubts over the chances of defusing the BSE crisis before next week's EU summit in Florence.

<P>

After a day examining Britain's anti-BSE measures and its scheme for lifting the ban, the EU Standing Veterinary Committee indicated that it was unlikely to deliver a verdict, leaving it up to EU leaders next week.

<P>

"A majority of member states were supportive of the framework idea and were prepared to work on this basis," a British official said. However, German officials among others voiced strong reservations about aspects of both the eradication programme and the British framework plan to phase out the ban. Keith Meldrum, the Chief Veterinary Officer, said: "It's up to the Prime Minister how to take it forward."

<P>

Britain remained under pressure from the Commission and the other states to extend its plan for a selective cull to include animals born since 1989. Britain has offered a cull of cattle born since 1990 into herds where animals of the same age had contracted BSE, estimated at 80,000 animals.

<P>

The veterinary committee, which must endorse every step in the BSE affair through a qualified majority vote, will give guidance to foreign ministers who meet in Rome on Monday to prepare for the Florence summit next Friday. On Tuesday, the Commission is to take a position on the framework but will not seek a formal vote. Some veterinary officials said they did not want to be rushed into decisions on the basis of Britain's broad eight-page-plan.

<P>

On Tuesday the Commission is likely to draft a political, rather than a technical, proposal for a possible accord in Florence in which the other states agree to the outline of a phase-out, with no dates, in return for a commitment from John Major to end his blocking drive.

<P>

The brief, five-step framework plan is deemed by the Commission to be general enough to satisfy Germany, France and the other states which are under fierce domestic pressure to yield no ground to Britain. Britain has made no friends with its blocking campaign and its case has been further hindered by the news this week that it had exported suspect animal feed to France and other continental states.

<P>

A key point in the framework is the absence of dates for lifting the embargo. Britain is pressing first for the right to export beef to non-EU countries. The other four steps cover exemptions from the ban for exports of cattle embyros, of live animals born after Britain's plan to wipe out "mad cow" disease and ban suspect feed, of beef from herds certified to be free of the disease, and of meat from animals under 30 months old.

<P>

Meanwhile, the European Court of Justice agreed to hear Britain's request for an interim ruling on suspending the ban next Wednesday. The full court in Luxembourg will hear British lawyers argue that the Commission exceeded its powers in imposing the ban and that the British meat industry would suffer irreparable damage from it

The Court will probably issue its ruling two weeks later. A full hearing on Britain's complaint will not take place before the autumn at the earliest.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><CENTER> European <A NAME="vets">vets</A> want more cattle killed</CENTER></H3>
 

FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS

<BR>The Times: Britain:June 13 1996<P>

 EUROPEAN officials pressed Britain yesterday to slaughter thousands more cattle than the 80,000 already proposed to clear the way for an accord to end the beef crisis.

<P>

As British officials handed the European Commission a revised version of the framework plan for easing the overall export ban, the standing veterinary committee, composed of national officials, insisted on a deeper selective cull. The plan is the subject of hectic negotiations in Brussels and EU capitals as diplomats try to strike a compromise that could end the British campaign of obstruction before the EU summit in Florence next week.

<P>

Keith Meldrum, the Chief Veterinary Officer, said his colleagues appeared ready to endorse the overall BSE eradication programme provided the selective cull was extended to cattle born in 1989 and 1990.

<P>

The existing plan dooms animals born between 1991 and 1993 in herds where others of the same age had contracted BSE. Britain and the Commission have voiced optimism over the prospects for a framework agreement next week but resistance remains high in Germany and several other states to any commitment to relaxing the ban before Britain has proved that BSE has been virtually eradicated.

<P>

The framework scheme aims to achieve agreement on the scientific criteria Britain must meet for each phase of easing the export ban. With an overall plan it will be harder for reluctant states to block decisions in the veteri nary committee, which must rule on each step. The committee is due to review the framework on Friday before handing it to foreign ministers in Rome on Monday. The Commission may endorse it next Tuesday, in time for Florence.

<P>

A spokesman for Jacques Santer, the Commission President, called Britain's latest framework "a realistic basis" for a solution. Since an end to British obstruction is implicit in any deal, an explosive political equation has to be solved if leaders are to agree in Florence.

                        beef was to be found in its French shops. As the wave
                        of anger over imports of suspect animal feed continued
                        unabated, the retailer sought to reassure its French

                        poisoned.<P>


                        In spite of last week's slight relaxation by the
                        European Commission of the ban on British beef, the

                                 BY ARTHUR LEATHLEY, ANDREW PIERCE, AND CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS 

                The Foreign Secretary hardened Britain's position over the crisis after John Major held the
                first meeting of his "war cabinet" to decide tactics in the offensive against the rest of the
                EU. 

                Mr Rifkind said that Britain's refusal to co-operate in decisions requiring unanimous
                support was already biting. He signalled a lengthy campaign against the EU unless Britain's
                European partners lifted the ban on beef products such as gelatin, tallow and semen and
                agreed to a framework for the eventual lifting of the ban on beef. 

                "We do not know if this will run for days, weeks, perhaps even two to three months,
                perhaps even longer. The policy will continue until the objective has been achieved."
                Officials said that it had to be made clear to European Union members that "this is not a
                tantrum. It will be a well thought out and concerted campaign to achieve the result we
                consider to be right". 

                Although Mr Rifkind said that Britain would not back down over the issue, he conceded that,
                if ministers from other countries believed there should be an exception for a very serious
                issue, that exception would require the agreement of British ministers collectively. He
                added: "We do not anticipate exemptions."

<h3><center><A NAME="Calf">Calf</A> link raises new BSE fears </center></h3>
Steve Connor  Science Correspondent<br>
SUNDAY TIMES ... June 30 1996<p>

SCIENTISTS have uncovered the first evidence that
"mad cow" disease can be passed from mother to calf,
raising the prospect that BSE may be more difficult to
eradicate than currently envisaged. <p>

A new analysis of the 27,000 cattle with BSE that were
born after the 1988 ban on contaminated animal feed has
revealed a small but significant transmission from some
pregnant cows to their calves. <p>

Until now, the official view has been that there is no
evidence for such vertical transmission and that the
presence of BSE in cattle born after the ban was the
result of contaminated feed still being used on beef and
dairy farms after 1988. <p>

The new findings have not yet been given formally to the
spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (Seac),
the government's advisers on the BSE epidemic, but one
member aware of the research said the implications were
important. <p>

"This information might influence our advice if we now
have certain evidence of vertical transmission rather than
having no evidence," he said. <p>

It could also have far-reaching implications for other
European countries which have not established an
effective way of identifying cattle with BSE or calves
born to BSE cows on their farms. Where British
scientists are confident their measures should eradicate
vertically transmitted BSE, less rigorous approaches on
the Continent may lead to it spreading. <p>

The "slight" vertical transmission from BSE cow to calf
has been identified through sophisticated computer
modelling by a team of Oxford University scientists.
However, the researchers also found the vast bulk of the
27,000 cases have resulted from exposure to
contaminated feed. <p>

It is understood the scientists have concluded that the
current targeted culling policy of the government will
eradicate BSE in the long term, although the task may be
made more difficult because some pregnant cows that
were incubating the disease may have passed it on to
their offspring. <p>

The scientists do not believe other countries where BSE
is thought to be indigenous will be able to eradicate the
disease so easily. One scientist close to the Oxford team
said: "Other countries with BSE do not have a good
enough reporting system and still do not pay full
compensation to farmers with BSE cattle, so eradication
by targeted culling will be a problem for them." <p>

Vertical transmission is also being investigated by the
Ministry of Agriculture. Its experiment, set up in 1989, is
not due to be finished until next year but it has come
under pressure to publish preliminary results. <p>

Ministry scientists are monitoring 315 calves born from
BSE cows and another 315 from cows certified
BSE-free. It is a "blind" experiment with the code that
identifies the calves kept secret to prevent any bias in
how they are treated during the research. <p>

So far there have been 47 cases of BSE in the herd of
630 but scientists have up to now believed that this could
be accounted for by the unwitting exposure of some of
the animals to contaminated feed prior to the experiment. <p>

The scientists still believe they can disentangle BSE in the
herd caused by feed and BSE caused by vertical
transmission and are preparing to analyse the brains of
about 400 of the experimental cattle, which have already
been slaughtered. <HR>
     
<h3><center>EUROPE'S <A NAME="HIDDEN">HIDDEN</A> 'MAD COW' SCANDAL </center></h3>
Steve Connor  Science Correspondent<br>
<blockquote>
SUNDAY TIMES ... June 30 1996<p>

The great unwritten assumption about the export ban on
British beef is that beef produced in other European
countries is completely free of "mad cow" disease. A
closer look fails to deliver this reassurance. Consumers in
Europe are less protected against BSE than beef-eaters
in Britain. <p>

There is no denying that BSE is primarily a British
problem. We have nearly 170,000 confirmed cases
compared with just over 400 in the rest of the world.
Many cases overseas can be linked directly to either the
export of British cattle or British-made meat and bone
meal. However, there is now a growing acceptance that
there is a hidden epidemic of indigenous BSE in many
European countries that, unlike Britain, have failed to
institute the most basic measures for protecting public
health. <p>

One of the strongest pieces of evidence to suggest that
the rest of Europe has significantly under-rated its BSE
problem comes from an international team of scientists
who are shortly to publish their report on the
unacknowledged problem. As The Sunday Times
revealed two weeks ago, this report concludes that EU
countries failed to report more than 1,600 cases of BSE
in the 57,900 British breeding cattle they imported
between 1985 and 1990. Only 29 cases of BSE were
reported in this group of animals. <p>

A second piece of evidence to show that some European
countries have been economical with the BSE truth
comes from an analysis of the meat and bone meal
exported from Britain at the end of the 1980s. This was a
legal trade because the UK allowed it to be fed to pigs
and poultry even after it was banned in 1988 as a feed
for British cattle and sheep. Thousand of tons were
exported through brokers in Holland. France bought
15,000 tons in 1989 alone and sold some to Switzerland:
 which has the highest incidence of BSE outside Britain,
with 220 confirmed cases. <p>

All the BSE cattle in Switzerland were born in that
country and they undoubtedly developed the disease
through eating this imported feed. The question Swiss
scientists are asking is why France and other countries
that imported the same feed do not have as big a
problem. "We are an island of BSE in Europe," says
Marc Vandevelde, Switzerland's BSE expert at Bern
University. "The disease stops at our border." <p>

Vandevelde says that "if" the dairy practices in France
and the Benelux countries were similar to those in
Switzerland, there should be several hundred cases
instead of the mere 20 in France and none in Belgium,
Holland and Luxembourg. <p>

Meat and bone meal exported from Britain was almost
certainly mixed with meat and bone meal made in other
countries. Even if the British feed was intended for
French poultry and pigs, it would have contaminated feed
destined for French cattle in the French mills where both
products were processed. British scientists accept that
this kind of contamination caused thousands of BSE
cases in cattle born after the feed ban in 1988. If it
happened here, why not in France and other European
countries? <p>

What happened to the many hundreds, and possibly
thousands, of cattle with BSE that "disappeared" in
mainland Europe? Many, if not all, would have been
rendered into meat and bone meal and fed to other
animals. We know the British ban on feeding cattle
protein to cattle and sheep (ruminants) was not totally
effective. We also know that some European countries
continued the practice until very recently. <p>

Few scientists believe that countries in Europe have been
able to escape the deadly cycle of ruminant
contamination. Truly indigenous BSE (created by the
feeding of home-made feed to home-bred cattle) is very
likely, according to Bram Schreuder of Holland's Institute
for Animal Science and Health: "There is a risk that if a
local rendering plant is not fully effective, countries that
were continuing to feed meat and bone meal to cattle
were creating their own indigenous BSE. I think there are
countries in Europe that have had such cases." <p>

Scientists at the Institute for Animal Health here have
shown that many rendering processes used in Europe fail
to destroy the agent that causes scrapie, the brain disease
in sheep. This finding should be particularly worrying for
the French because even though the EU asked them in
1993 to set up an official system for notifying cases of
scrapie, they failed to do so until this year. <p>

Many sheep with scrapie must therefore have been
rendered in a system that failed to eliminate the scrapie
agent, which is how BSE in Britain is thought to have
developed. <p>

All this could, perhaps, be overlooked if France and
other European countries had set up an effective barrier
against BSE to protect public health. Central to this
strategy would be a well-policed ban on bovine offal in
the human food chain, particularly brain and spinal cord
matter where the BSE agent thrives. However it was only
in this year, for instance, that the French introduced such
a ban. The moral of the tale is that if British consumers
ever faced a risk from BSE, consumers elsewhere now
face a bigger risk from their own beef industries.

<H3><CENTER>BSE Transmission: From Cow to Calf?</CENTER></H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Adapted from memo of  English biostatistician <A HREF="http://http2.brunel.ac.uk:8080/~hssrsdn/bse.htm">Stuart Neilson</A> ... 10 June 1996<P>


The vertical transmission study was set up in 1988/9 with the purchase of
315 calves born to BSE-affected dams and 315 control calves (from the same
farms) born to unaffected dams. The calves are to be kept until the age of
seven years (November 1996) and all survivors will be autopsied for signs of
BSE. So far about 150 have died, 51 confirmed BSE. The trial is blind, so
no conclusions can be drawn from the deaths alone, only when the trial ends
will the maternal status be revealed. All calves were apparently exposed to
contaminated feed at some point. Epidemiological surveys to date have shown somewhat elevated odds-ratios in the
offspring of BSE-affected cattle.<P>

The calves.were up to six months old and all were
weaned.  The period selected is dangerously close to
the feed ban in July 88. As a result a 10% infection rate could be
expected, or if most of the calves were weaned after the ban (allowing
for feed stocks etc) then one would expect a very much lower figure.<P>
 
Note control calves may have been born to cattle that 
 developed BSE at a later date  -- perhaps 20% of them. If there is genetic predisposition to BSE, the calves from sick cows would have a greater penetration of it.  These calves were also exposed in utero to a cow with a more advanced stage of disease than controls (whose mothers may not have been sick at all). BSE cases are expected in both groups, but 51 BSE cases (possibly more at autopsy) may be enough to show a statistically significant effect if there is one.<P>

 
A statistical significance of 5% would be possible now [from chi-squared test] if there were
twice as many affected case calves as control calves, but an elevation of
50% over control calves would be significant if a further 40 BSE cases turn up. [More cases give better statistical resolving power.] If maternal status is a factor then this study should show it. The
autopsies should also show how many clinically asymptomatic animals have BSE
at seven years of age.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>There are demands for the trial to be ended now (including some
from individual members of SEAC), rather than wait for November.The incidnce of BSE amongst seven-year-old cattle in 1994 was
4.75%, which equates to a further 15 cases of BSE or 2.5 cases PER MONTH in
the 630 cattle in the study. The table shows how rapidly significance rises
with additional cases of BSE. Unblinding the trial will not affect
significance, but ending it most certainly will.<P>

The vertical transmission study achieves greater statistical resolving power than previous
epidemiological surveys by a balanced design.  The large number of affected mothers
 ensures that a much lower ratio of experimental to controls is  likely to be
significant. Conversely, the selection process and large numbers involved
ensure that a spurious correlation is less likely. "Maternal status" in this
trial is whether or not the calf's mother had been diagnosed with BSE.<P>
 
If there is an excess of BSE among  calves with BSE-affected
mothers, it would indicate that maternal status is associated with calf
status. In the absence of any other transmission route, this would imply a
causal association and maternal transmission. Because these calves were
also exposed to BSE-infected feed (and equally so because both cases and
controls come from the same herds) it will not be possible to conclude that
maternal transmission occurred, only that the maternal status was a factor
in the status of the calf. This is the real hypothesis that the
study will test: BSE occurs more frequently in the calves of dams with BSE.<P>
 
It is not clear how genetic predisposition is disentangled from in utero infection. Dependent on the
inheritance pattern (and on what proportion of the dams of control calves
were truly BSE-free), there are likely to be between twice and three times
as many BSE-susceptible animals amongst calves of affected dams. My rough
guess was that 20% of bulls are BSE-susceptible, leading to a BSE
susceptibility rate of 60% (rather than 100%) in the case calves. The fact that both cases and
controls were exposed to contaminated feed is unlikely to significantly
alter the findings.<P>


The numbers of case and control cattle with BSE may become
available to the public long before the formal publication of results
(indeed  announced recently  by the BBC Newsnight
team, not the researchers). 
 
This experiment is very significant to lifting of the EU beef ban, because maternal transmission could make the currently proposed eradication scheme wholly inadequate. If there is ANY
excess of BSE in case calves, some will say: "the study demonstrates maternal transmission,
therefore blood leukocytes are infective, therefore all parts of the cow
(including milk) are infective, therefore the human dimension is beyond
measure."  The final report is due officially in mid 1997.</BLOCKQUOTE><HR>

<P>EDITOR, - In their article looking at the possibility of maternal transmission of
spongiform encephalopathy R M Ridley and H F Baker analyse previously published
information and conclude that natural sheep scrapie has a genetic basis.[i] Of
course this is so. Because of the absence of nucleic acid within the infective
particle, host genome is required for the pathogenesis of the disease,[ii] and it
follows that such genes are inherited in various ways. This in no way negates the
well established observations that the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
are due to infectious agents which are acquired by vulnerable hosts in a variety
of ways, including maternal transmission.[iii] Maternal transmission cannot
sustain the disease in a species in the long term, but it will occur in
association with horizontal transmission due, for example, to several lambs or
ewes eating or having contact with an infected placenta.[iv]

<P>Ridley and Baker omit to provide any of the evidence supporting the occurrence of
vertical and horizontal transmission of the infectious agent for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy under farm conditions. This evidence includes the
following.

<P>By early 1989 bovine spongiform encephalopathy had been carefully studied for
three years, and it was predicted that the total number of cases would be
17,000-20,000, on the assumption that neither vertical nor horizontal
transmission occurred.[v] By 26 October 1995 the number of cases of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy that had been confirmed in the United Kingdom was
154,150.[vi]

<P>Because of the belief that recycled animal remains was the cause of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy[v] this practice was made illegal from 18 July 1988
after extensive consultation. Indeed, in early 1989 this ban was considered to
have been implemented effectively.[v] From September 1988 to April 1989, newborn
calves were removed from 600 dams by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and
Food and were reared on fresh grass so that the extent, if any, of vertical
transfer could be quantified.[v] By January 1995 more than 30 of these animals
had died of bovine spongiform encephalopathy,[vii] although the details of the
experiment have not been published.

<P>Furthermore, since the ban on cannibalistic feeding was imposed in 1988 over
22,000 animals have been born that have subsequently developed bovine spongiform
encephalopathy; one was born as recently as June 1993. Interestingly, the range
of ages at which the disease was diagnosed in these animals is virtually the same
as that in animals born before the ban (table).

<P>These figures show that bovine spongiform encephalopathy is now endemic and is
being maintained by vertical and horizontal transmission. However, the Ministry
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food maintains that all the affected animals that
were born after the ban were exposed to remnants of contaminated feed (data given
in letter from A Browning (minister for food) to D Hinchcliffe (member of
parliament), Nov 1995),[vi,vii] with the implication that those involved in the
production of feed and also farmers have been breaking the law on a massive
scale. But if traces of infectivity from the feed were responsible for the
disease in these animals, the animals would be expected to be older, as the
incubation period of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies is inversely
related to the infecting dose.[iii]

<P>EDITOR - R W Lacey admonishes us for failing "to provide any of the evidence
supporting the occurrence of vertical and horizontal] transmission of the
infectious agent for bovine spongiform encephalopathy under farm
conditions." [i]The data from commercial farms regarding the occurrence of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy in the offspring of cows that themselves developed the
disease can be found in Hoinville <I>et al's</I> paper.[ii]

<P>These veterinary epidemiologists carried out a case-control study of 477 animals
with bovine spongiform encephalopathy and 1,294 matched, unaffected animals all
born after the ban on feed containing recycled animal remains was introduced in
1988 and retained in the same 349 farms. The results showed that 94.4% of the
animals with bovine spongiform encephalopathy and 95.7% of the control animals
were born to dams that did not subsequently develop the disease. This difference
is not significant, and the data provide strong evidence that maternal
transmission is not a risk factor. The possibility of horizontal transmission is
being assessed by looking for bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the indigenous
members of herds that have never been exposed to the foodborne source of
infectivity but into which purchased animals that subsequently developed bovine
spongiform encephalopathy have been introduced. This assessment is incomplete but
to date provides no evidence for horizontal transmission.[iii]

the issue that seems to provoke the greatest hostility. Earlier associations are probably real, but masked by the high levels of infectivity to which cattle have been exposed in the past. A

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS July 8 1996<br>

FROM ROGER BOYES IN BONN<p>

THE German Government yesterday demanded an investigation into how British beef is being infiltrated into other European Union states in defiance of the export ban.

<p>

Bonn was alerted by a cable from the German Ambassador in Rome, who reported that beef from herds that should have been slaughtered under the British culling programme was moving from Scotland and Ireland into France and then to Italy with forged health certificates.

<p>

According to the diplomatic cable, which has sent Germans into a new spiral of panic, live British cattle are also ending up in Italy and being reclassified as Italian. Behind it all, there is a "meat mafia". The ambassador's report says, in part: "Last Friday Italian police discovered a shipment of meat falsely described as potatoes."

<p>

A spokesman for the German Health Ministry said yesterday Bonn was demanding an immediate examination and explanation from the European Commission. The government of Hesse, one of Germany's 16 provincial states, has already announced an alert and is stepping up its controls on all animal and meat imports.

<p>

"If our suspicions are borne out, it will be another heavy blow against the confidence and the health protection of the consumer," said Dietmar Glasser, a State Secretary (junior minister) in the Hesse government. Herr Glasser and other provincial politicians are putting pressure on Bonn to reconsider its policy on lifting the ban on British tallow, gelatine and bull semen.

<p>

The German Federal Government is allowed to uphold its national ban on British beef derivatives until September but must then, as part of the Florence compromise, allow these products to be imported. The governments of Germany's provincial states are against any such lifting, and the whole issue is likely to create a major constitutional row.

<h3><center> French sell BSE cows to Britain</center></h3>
 by Steve Connor  Science Correspondent <br>July 07 1996  ... Sunday Times
<p>                                                            

FRENCH cattle with BSE have been exported to Britain, according to official information
that has been withheld by the British government because of fears that it might offend a
European partner. <p>


Scientists believe they have proof that at least one French-born cow has been imported into
Britain while it was incubating BSE. They say it is significant because it contradicts
assertions by the French government that it can guarantee the safety of all French beef
exports. <p>

The disclosure will raise questions about the export ban on beef from Britain alone, given that
it shows other coun tries have a potentially significant BSE problem with their own
exports that has been played down. <p>

The animal was born in 1991, a year after the French government imposed its own ban on
contaminated animal feed, and therefore constitutes the country's first known case of a cow
that has developed BSE despite the restrictions on feed. <p>

It was imported into Britain from the north of France in April 1993 and was diagnosed with
   BSE in June 1994, 14 months after arriving in the UK. Scientists say there has never
been a case of BSE where the incubation period has been less than 22 months, so the
French animal must have contracted the disease in France. <p>

The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) has known about the case but has not
made it public because "we were anxious not to embarrass the French too much", according to
one official. The discovery came at a critical time, before the imposition of the present export
ban, when Britain needed allies in Europe over BSE. <p>

In 1991, when the BSE cow from France was born, the UK imported only 116 French
cattle. However, in 1992, this rose to 2,625 and a further 5,387 French cattle were
imported in 1993 in order to bolster the breeding stock of the British dairy herd. <p>

Officially, France has had only 20 cases of BSE in 19 herds, all of which were destroyed
when the disease was diagnosed. 

Farmers who have bought foreign cattle have been concerned about whether their imported
animals can be guaranteed to be free of BSE, but they have been unable to prove their
suspicions. <p>

Robert Robinson, a beef farmer in Alnwick, Northum berland, said he had had only two
confirmed cases of BSE in his 1,000-herd of Irish-born cattle. He said that he had never
fed any of his animals meat and bone meal feed, the source of BSE. <p>

"When France and Ireland came out with the policy of slaughtering whole herds, even with
compensation, it was the surest way of ensuring that they didn't get proper reporting of
   BSE," Robinson said. <p>

Suspicions of a cover-up over BSE in Europe have been raised by a comparison of how
many cases should have appeared, based on what is known in Britain and how many have
actually been reported. <p>

Further concern was raised last week when it emerged that a senior bureaucrat within the
European commission wrote a memo in 1990 reporting that European veterinary officials
should "minimise the BSE affair by using disinformation". <p>

The note quotes representatives on the commission's veterinary committee as saying that
people should "show a cool attitude so as not to provoke unfavourable reactions by the market".<p>

Revelations of the memo's existence, published in the French Journal du Dimanche, provoked
embarrassed denials from commission officials. Jacques Delors, the then president of the
commission, said he had never seen it. 
<h3><A NAME="Magnitude">Magnitude</A> of EU Cheating over BSE</h1>
by Charles Clover
<hr>
From <i>The Electronic Telegraph</i>, June 24, 1996.
<P>
                   Beef from many EU countries is now more likely to be
contaminated with BSE than British beef, European vets have concluded from
evidence that thousands of cases in Europe have not been reported.
<p>
                   The Federation of Veterinarians in Europe will call on
Franz Fischler, Agriculture Commissioner, this week to impose a
British-style ban on specified beef offals throughout the EU. It will also
seek tighter monitoring of farms, abattoirs and butchers. This follows
evidence from Swiss experts of
gross under-reporting of BSE by many EU countries.
<p>
                   Prof Marc Vandervelde, head of the Institute of Animal
Neurology at the University of Berne, believes that France ought to be
declaring around 200 BSE cases a year - instead of the 22 it has so far
declared - given the amount of contaminated feed it has imported. It was
"astonishing", he   said, that France had not had more cases. He is also
openly incredulous of Holland, Luxembourg and Belgium which also imported
thousands of tons of contaminated feed from Britain in the 1980s but had
declared no cases of BSE. Prof Vandervelde joked: "In some countries BSE is
banned."
<p
                   Switzerland has the highest number of reported cases of
BSE outside Britain - 218 - and is also the most open about the number of
cattle at risk. Prof Vandervelde added: "BSE stops at the Swiss border. Some
spill-over would be expected but the surrounding countries will not admit it."
<p>
                   His colleagues have calculated that the whole Swiss dairy
herd, some 800,000 cows out of a total herd of 1.7 million, was at risk of
exposure to contaminated feed imported from Britain, through France. Of
these, 200,000 dairy cows, mostly the older ones, are estimated to have been
exposed to
around 10,000 tons of contaminated feed. Experts believe that all the Swiss
cases of BSE arose from these animals. Swiss cases of BSE are no longer
increasing, thanks to the same controls used in Britain.
<p>
                   There was a danger that the French could be recycling
their own BSE in other animal food.
<p>
                   The magazine Nature recently reported that contaminated
feed from Britain, could have been fed to cattle in France until this year.
Prof Vandervelde said: "We would expect to see a couple of hundred cattle a
year with BSE. It wouldn't be wrong to say that at least a couple of hundred
thousand cattle had been exposed. Most of our imported feed came from
France. It would be
difficult not to find a similar incidence of the disease as in Switzerland."
<p>
<p>
                   Greater certainty may come from tracing the 57,900
pure-bred breeding cattle exported from 1985 to 1991. A report by European
scientists last week said that around 1,668 of these might be expected
statistically to have contracted BSE. One of the authors, Prof Otto
Christian Straub, said that a list of countries most at risk could be
compiled, based on those who had imported the most dairy cattle.
<p>
                   The figures are still being analysed by the Central
Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey. British vets believe that the
"at risk" list will be topped by Portugal (which imported 12,000 head of
cattle and has so far declared only seven cases of BSE), followed by Spain
(which has declared none) and the Netherlands (none).


<hr><h3><center><a NAME="Crackdown">Crackdown</a> on bogus beef safety ads</center></h3>


July 07 1996  ... Sunday Times
<p>
* THE government organization charged with promoting British meat will be lambasted this week
for misleading the public over the safety of beef in the wake of the BSE crisis, writes
Paul Nuki. 

The Advertising Standards Authority will announce that five out of eight "facts" claimed in
full-page newspaper adverts by the Meat and Livestock Commission in defense of British beef
were fiction. 

Among its alleged crimes was to claim that non-beef eaters faced the same risk of contracting 
    CJD (human BSE) as beef eaters.

  <h3><center><A NAME="COVER">COVER</A> UP: Mad Cow Fury Erupts</center></h3>


Socialist Party Group of the European Parliament<br>
July 8, 1996<p>



Proof of a Commission cover-up of mad cow disease six years ago has been
obtained by Luxembourg Socialist Euro MP Ben Fayot.

Now he is tabling a question to the Commission on behalf of the Socialist
Group for the July session of Parliament.<p>

Mr Fayot wants to know if officials responsible for the cover-up are
still working for the Commission.  He asks:  'Does the Commission today
share the view that a major catastrophe with serious consequences for the
health of EU citizens as well as for the EU economy could have been
avoided if the Commission had reacted in an appropriate way when this
disease appeared?'<p>

The cover-up took place under controversial farm commissioner Ray
MacSharry of Ireland.  

A confidential summary in French of a permanent veterinary committee
meeting of 8 and 10 October 1990 obtained by Mr Fayot spells out the
extent of the Commission cover-up.  It also reveals Irish fears of
'bankruptcy' over a decision on removing the nervous system from
carcasses.<p>

The note quotes a Commission representative as telling the committee: 
'We must have a cold attitude so as not to provoke unfavourable reactions
on the market.  Do not speak any more about BSE.  This point should not
be on the agenda.'<p>

The summary notes:  'We are going to ask the United Kingdom officially
to stop publishing the results of its research.'

It concludes:  'We must play down this BSE affair by engaging in
disinformation. It would be better to say that the Press has a tendency
to exaggerate.'<p>

Mr Fayot wants to know if Commissioner MacSharry was informed of the
cover-up.  He says:  'We have to react vigorously.'

<H3><CENTER>Brussels begins inquiry into British beef <A NAME="smuggling">smuggling</A></CENTER></H3>

FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS

<BR>
THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS July 9 1996<P>

THE European Commission yesterday launched an investigation into reports that British beef is being sold on the Continent in defiance of the export ban and officials gave a warning that London could be held responsible.

<P>

At the same time, the French daily <I>Lib&eacute;ration</I> traced the author of a six-year-old memorandum which alleged that European Union farm officials had tried to stifle news of "mad cow" disease to protect the market. The newspaper said G&eacute;rard Castille, a former civil servant with the Commission's consumer affairs division, had tried to sound the alarm.

<P>

Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner, said he had written to Douglas Hogg and the other EU agriculture ministers after claims by the German Ambassador in Rome that British beef was being shipped to Italy via Ireland with fraudulent certificates. Herr Fischler said: "I am taking this very seriously, but there is no proof yet."

<P>

The Commission farm directorate said the onus was on Britain to prevent exports.

The Ministry of Agriculture said last night: "No export certificates for beef are being issued, so any that is being exported would have to be illegally disguised."

<h3><center>Britain to cull <a NAME="120,000">120,000</a> cows to speed BSE deal </center></h3>

BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT

<br>

The Times: Britain:July 4 1996
<p>

UP TO 120,000 cattle, mainly from dairy herds, are to be culled to speed the eradication of "mad cow" disease, the Government said last night. The cull is likely to cost a minimum of &#163;100 million and the final bill could be more than twice that amount.


Last night the Agriculture Ministry refused to put its own estimate on the cost, which the Treasury is understood to be contesting fiercely.

<p>

The number of animals to be killed is considerably higher than the "low tens of thousands" envisaged by Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, last April, but slightly lower than the 147,000 mentioned after last month's European Union summit in Florence.

<p>

The slaughter is one of the key conditions that have to be met by Britain under the summit deal before a stage-by-stage lifting of the EU ban on British beef exports can begin. The National Farmers' Union gave a cautious welcome to the slaughter proposal, which was announced by Anthony Baldry, the Junior Agriculture Minister, but said crucial questions about compensation to be paid to farmers remained unanswered.

<p>

Sir David Naish, the union president, said: "The NFU still firmly believes a selective cull is unjustified. Farmers are still extremely worried about the impact it will have on their individual farm businesses, and there are many issues that have to be resolved in detail.

<p>

"It is critically important that compensation is based on the replacement cost of any culled animals, and not just on their market value."

<p>

Mr Baldry said he recognised that there was a case for using replacement cost as the basis for compensation, but the Government was still "re flecting on the correct approach". He added: "It is right that the farmers should be fairly compensated, but they must not be over-compensated."

<p>

Farming organisations have until July 9 to comment on the plan. It must then be laid before the Commons before MPs go on their summer holidays at the end of this month, and could still run into difficulties there.

<p>

The cull would affect about 5 per cent of the 2.4 million dairy cattle in Britain and an estimated 2,500 individual herds. The worst affected herds could lose up to 40 per cent or more of their cattle.

<p>

Mr Baldry said the slaughter would probably start in September and last for six to nine months. During August, ministry veterinary surgeons would visit the farms concerned to identify the animals to be culled.

Brussels memo reveals '<A NAME="plan">plan</A> of silence' on BSE</center></h3>

<font SIZE=-1>THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS ... July 2 1996<br>
BY CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS AND ANDREW PIERCE<p></font>

THE European Commission issued embarrassed denials yesterday after the emergence of a six-year-old memorandum which reports an alleged decision by European veterinary officials to play down the BSE epidemic through a campaign of "disinformation".

<p>


In the document, reproduced by the French <i>Journal du Dimanche</i> , an unidentified Commission official summarises a meeting at which the EU Standing Veterinary Committee is alleged to have concluded that <b>"it is necessary to minimise the BSE affair by using disinformation"</b>.

<p>

The note also claims that the Commission's representative on the committee had <B>called for BSE to be taken off future agendas "in order not to provoke unfavourable reactions by the market</B>". A call was also said to have been made to Britain to <b>stop publishing the results of its BSE research</b>. The committee, made up of the veterinary chiefs of the member states, is the body which voted in the beef ban and must approve its eventual lifting.

<p>

Tory MPs reacted with anger and amazement and some said they planned to table questions in the Commons.
Bill Cash, the Tory MP whose Referendum Bill was supported by 78 colleagues last month, said: "This demonstrates the irresponsible hypocrisy of the very people who have now caused so much trouble to the British farmer. It is important that the memorandum is thoroughly investigated and a full report laid before Parliament."

<p>

Sir Paul Marland, chairman of the Tory backbench agriculture committee, said: "The French ... have done exactly what this report rec ommended. While we have been the honest broker throughout ... the French have covered it up. The Agriculture Commissioner, instead of pointing his finger at us, should start examining what is going on in his own backyard."

<p>

The Commission said it had been unable to trace the document, but it said that the published version conveyed a false account of EU policy on BSE in 1990 and now.  A spokesman for Jacques Santer, the Commission President, promised an investigation into the note.


"Everything in this note is contradicted by events," said Gerry Kiely, spokesman for Franz Fischler, the Agriculture Commissioner. <P>

<h3><center>EUROPE'S <A NAME="HIDDEN">HIDDEN</A> 'MAD COW' SCANDAL </center></h3>
Steve Connor  Science Correspondent<br>
<blockquote>
SUNDAY TIMES ... June 30 1996<p>

The great unwritten assumption about the export ban on
British beef is that beef produced in other European
countries is completely free of "mad cow" disease. A
closer look fails to deliver this reassurance. Consumers in
Europe are less protected against BSE than beef-eaters
in Britain. <p>

There is no denying that BSE is primarily a British
problem. We have nearly 170,000 confirmed cases
compared with just over 400 in the rest of the world.
Many cases overseas can be linked directly to either the
export of British cattle or British-made meat and bone
meal. However, there is now a growing acceptance that
there is a hidden epidemic of indigenous BSE in many
European countries that, unlike Britain, have failed to
institute the most basic measures for protecting public
health. <p>

One of the strongest pieces of evidence to suggest that
the rest of Europe has significantly under-rated its BSE
problem comes from an international team of scientists
who are shortly to publish their report on the
unacknowledged problem. As The Sunday Times
revealed two weeks ago, this report concludes that EU
countries failed to report more than 1,600 cases of BSE
in the 57,900 British breeding cattle they imported
between 1985 and 1990. Only 29 cases of BSE were
reported in this group of animals. <p>

A second piece of evidence to show that some European
countries have been economical with the BSE truth
comes from an analysis of the meat and bone meal
exported from Britain at the end of the 1980s. This was a
legal trade because the UK allowed it to be fed to pigs
and poultry even after it was banned in 1988 as a feed
for British cattle and sheep. Thousand of tons were
exported through brokers in Holland. France bought
15,000 tons in 1989 alone and sold some to Switzerland:
 which has the highest incidence of BSE outside Britain,
with 220 confirmed cases. <p>

All the BSE cattle in Switzerland were born in that
country and they undoubtedly developed the disease
through eating this imported feed. The question Swiss
scientists are asking is why France and other countries
that imported the same feed do not have as big a
problem. "We are an island of BSE in Europe," says
Marc Vandevelde, Switzerland's BSE expert at Bern
University. "The disease stops at our border." <p>

Vandevelde says that "if" the dairy practices in France
and the Benelux countries were similar to those in
Switzerland, there should be several hundred cases
instead of the mere 20 in France and none in Belgium,
Holland and Luxembourg. <p>

Meat and bone meal exported from Britain was almost
certainly mixed with meat and bone meal made in other
countries. Even if the British feed was intended for
French poultry and pigs, it would have contaminated feed
destined for French cattle in the French mills where both
products were processed. British scientists accept that
this kind of contamination caused thousands of BSE
cases in cattle born after the feed ban in 1988. If it
happened here, why not in France and other European
countries? <p>

What happened to the many hundreds, and possibly
thousands, of cattle with BSE that "disappeared" in
mainland Europe? Many, if not all, would have been
rendered into meat and bone meal and fed to other
animals. We know the British ban on feeding cattle
protein to cattle and sheep (ruminants) was not totally
effective. We also know that some European countries
continued the practice until very recently. <p>

Few scientists believe that countries in Europe have been
able to escape the deadly cycle of ruminant
contamination. Truly indigenous BSE (created by the
feeding of home-made feed to home-bred cattle) is very
likely, according to Bram Schreuder of Holland's Institute
for Animal Science and Health: "There is a risk that if a
local rendering plant is not fully effective, countries that
were continuing to feed meat and bone meal to cattle
were creating their own indigenous BSE. I think there are
countries in Europe that have had such cases." <p>

Scientists at the Institute for Animal Health here have
shown that many rendering processes used in Europe fail
to destroy the agent that causes scrapie, the brain disease
in sheep. This finding should be particularly worrying for
the French because even though the EU asked them in
1993 to set up an official system for notifying cases of
scrapie, they failed to do so until this year. <p>

Many sheep with scrapie must therefore have been
rendered in a system that failed to eliminate the scrapie
agent, which is how BSE in Britain is thought to have
developed. <p>

All this could, perhaps, be overlooked if France and
other European countries had set up an effective barrier
against BSE to protect public health. Central to this
strategy would be a well-policed ban on bovine offal in
the human food chain, particularly brain and spinal cord
matter where the BSE agent thrives. However it was only
in this year, for instance, that the French introduced such
a ban. The moral of the tale is that if British consumers
ever faced a risk from BSE, consumers elsewhere now
face a bigger risk from their own beef industries.

<h3><center>Beef <A NAME="business">business</A> may never recover </center></h3>

The Times: Britain:July 2 1996<br>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT<p>


DEMAND for beef may never recover fully from the crisis over "mad cow" disease, Franz Fischler, the European Union's Agriculture Commissioner, told British farmers yesterday.

<p>

Risking the wrath of dairy and beef producers, Herr Fischler honoured a long-standing invitation to open the annual Royal Show at Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. In the event, no protests marred the occasion and Herr Fischler, who has a farm in the Austrian Tyrol, was spared having to eat British beef for lunch. Later, however, he sampled beef satay at the stand of the Meat and Livestock Commission.

<p>

The organisers were careful to steer their visitor away from the cattle lines and took him to a flower show, the organic farming stand and a British food exhibition. At a packed meeting with farmers, Herr Fischler was chal lenged about alleged under-reporting of BSE in cattle herds elsewhere in Europe. Robert Robinson, from Alnwick, Northumberland, said the only two cases of the disease in his herd had been imported from Ireland, where he estimated there might have been 7,000 unreported cases. He asked why the export ban applied only to British beef.

<p>

Herr Fischler said he had heard rumours of under-reporting and he would raise the matter with the new EU scientific group set up to investigate the disease. He believed that 99 per cent of all cases of BSE had occurred in Britain.

<p>

In his opening address, Herr Fischler hinted that beef farmers might have to face production curbs to reflect permanently lower demand, although Britain could be less badly affected than some continental coun tries. "There is no doubt in my mind that we have seriously to look at the beef production of the future and how the system has to be adapted both to satisfy consumer demands and to allow farmers to earn an acceptable living."

<p>

Later, at a press conference, Herr Fischler said: "It will not be easy to get back to the level of consumption that existed before the crisis." Production subsidies to help beef farmers could provide only a short-term solution.

<p>

He refused to endorse the Prime Minister's forecast after the EU summit in Florence that the worldwide ban on British beef exports would be largely lifted by November. That would depend on how quickly Britain could satisfy the conditions set for each stage in the removal of the ban.

<p>

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said Britain had "turned the corner" in the beef crisis, although he admitted he did not expect to see the export ban being significantly eased before "the back end of the year".

<p>

At a private meeting with Herr Fischler, Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said that he did not regard the cull ordered by the EU as scientifically justified but said he and other farmers would support it if it led to the removal of the ban.

<p>
<H3>Beef <A NAME="consumption">consumption</A> down 20%</H3>


Consumption of beef fell by 20 per cent in the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the National Food Survey. The total household consumption of all meat and meat products declined by 1.5 per cent in 12 months.

<CENTER><H3><B>BSE deaths 'could be two <A NAME="million">million</A>'</B></H3></CENTER>
 


BY MICHAEL HORNSBY ...London Times  ...4.17.96

<BR>

 A LEADING scientist alarmed and bewildered MPs yesterday with a barrage of statistics suggesting that the number of deaths from eating meat infected with "mad cow" disease could be as few as ten or more than two million.

<P>

Dr Stephen Dealler, a consultant medical microbiologist, described the upper figure as "a worst-case scenario". He also said that the risk from eating beef now, with new safeguards in place, was "absolutely minimal".

<P>

Dr Dealler offered the estimate at a joint session of the Commons Agriculture and Health Select Committees, called to consider the latest evidence on BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the counterpart condition in human beings. Others giving evidence included Sir Kenneth Calman, the Government's Chief Medical Officer, Keith Meldrum, the Chief Veterinary Officer, and Professor John Pattison, head of the Government's advisory committee on BSE.

<P>

When Edward Leigh, Conservative MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle, and a professed beef-eater, pressed Dr Dealler to say what his own chances of contracting CJD from BSE-infected meat were, Dr Dealler replied, to laughter: "Between zero and 100 per cent."

<P>

Professor Pattison told the MPs that Dr Dealler's figures represented the "possible range of what might happen", but added: "The longer we go on without a significant rise in the number of CJD cases, the greater the chance that [the number of deaths caused by BSE] will be at the low end of the range. It would be very surprising if there is no species barrier between cows and human beings. It would also be very surprising if [BSE] infection is ever found in muscle meat [as opposed to offal]."

<P>

Dr Dealler said he had arrived at his estimates by looking at the potential times when people might have become infected and the number of infected cattle likely to have entered the food chain each year. He assumed that no one would have been infected after November 1989, when the offal ban took effect.

<P>

The committee also heard evidence from Dr Harash Narang, a clinical virologist who formerly worked for the Public Health Laboratory Service in Newcaste upon Tyne, who claims to have made a breakthrough in developing a test to detect BSE in the urine of live cattle. Dr Narang, who repeatedly clashed with Sir Kenneth and Mr Meldrum over his claims that the Government had obstructed his research, said: "The urine test, used on farms, could eradicate any remaining BSE by identifying cattle with the disease so that they could be removed."

<P>

The value of such a test is that it would avoid the need to destroy thousands of healthy animals merely to eliminate those with BSE. At present the disease can be confirmed definitely in cattle only by analysis of brain tissue after death.

<P>

Mr Meldrum said Dr Narang had failed to produce any evidence that his test worked. Sir Kenneth said Dr Narang's research had been taken seriously, but other scientists who had looked at earlier work of his on detecting tell-tale prion proteins in brain tissue had been unable to repeat his experiments.

<h3>Government Claims <A NAME="Challenged">Challenged</A></h2>

From <i>The Manchester Guardian Weekly</i>, November 26, 1995
<p>
Renewed fears that "mad cow disease" -- bovine spongiform encephalopathy 
(BSE) -- could lead to an epidemic of the Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD)
in humans were raised by a medical microbiologist, who questioned the
government's assertion that the public were not at risk.
<p>
Dr Stephen Dealler, writing in the British Food Journal, claimed that
<b><i>most adult British meat-eaters will, by 2001, have ingested a potentially 
fatal dose of meat infected with BSE</i></b>.
The disease was thought to have been
caused by feeding cattle with infected foodstuffs. That practice was ended 
in 1988, but 18,000 cases of BSE have been reported since, and even the
Ministry of Agriculture suspects that cases are under-reported.
<p>
Dr Dealler said that the medical and dietary professions should question
the present policy of "waiting passively" to see if the incidence of CJD
rises in the UK. Present methods of diagnosing CJD were inadequate, he
said, and "aggressive" and long-term research was needed.


<H3>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies</H1>

Adapted from the special coverage in April's Public Health News.<P>


<EM>MAFF Food Safety Information Bulletin, 1996, no70, February, pp1-2</EM>

<P>Dr Stephen Dealler, consultant medical microbiologist at Burnley General Hospital, who has 

studied epidemiological aspects of BSE and CJD since 1988 and warned in a paper in the 

<EM>British Food Journal</EM> in November 1995 that the ethics of waiting to see if there is 

an epidemic of CJD must be questioned, said that children should not be fed beef but that it 

was too late for adults. In his paper he estimated the most adults in Britain who eat meat 

would have ingested meat infected with BSE by the year 2001. Dr Dealler believes that any 

epidemic in humans would start about 15 years after that in cattle and about 250,000 

BSE-infected cows were eaten in 1990. There could be an epidemic of this new form in the year 

2005. These 10 cases were probably infected some time before the BSE epidemic started. 

Professor John Pattison of SEAC warned that the next 12 months would be crucial in determining 

if the UK is likely to see an epidemic of CJD. He called for all cases of CJD to be reported 

to the CJD Surveillance Unit as early as possible. Professor John Bourne of the Medical 

Research Council neuropathogenesis unit were investigating cases of CJD in farmers but results

 could not be expected until later this year. He said that he was not aware of any evidence 

that pointed to beef being anything other than safe. Dr Richard Lacey, a microbiologist, 

claimed that a worst-case scenario would be 500,000 people affected.<HR>


<EM>Independent 21.3.96<EM>

<P>The Chairman of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Support Network of the Alzheimerís Disease 

Society, writing to the Editor of the <EM>Independent</EM>, expressed his horror at the 

prospect of an epidemic of infected people and said that "the government owes it to the 

people who have become infected to prepare sufficiently and commit enough funding to care 

services to make their last months as dignified as possible".<BR>

<EM>Independent 22.3.96, p12</EM><BR>


<P>The Department of Health set up a helpline number (0800 344355). The World Health

<P>Reports from private individuals. What seems the best for the farmer may not seem the

best for the consumer and what is best for the politician to

keep the populus calm may not be the whole of the information

that the populus feels itshould have been given.</P>

<DL>



<DT>1983<DD>It is claimed that MAFF [= Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Fish = British USDA] knew about BSE in 1983 but

decided not to let the public (and possibly the politicians)

know.  This agrees with Helen Grant other heresay and with

Dealler and Kent's calculated statistics.







<DT>First numerous cases of BSE not going to be announced.<DD> 

They were found by a farmer in Surrey and reported to the local

vet and hence to MAFF.  They were slaughtered and the farmer was

going to publish the data (in 1986).  He was told not to do this

and the information reached the Veterinary Record from the

histopathologists in a small collumn in 1987.  The reason why

MAFF told him not to publish it is not clear.







<DT>No BSE available for research.<DD>  Apparently, the experts

all over the world were asking MAFF for samples for BSE (after

all they had a lot of it) but MAFF refused to play ball for the

first few years fo the epidemic.  A researcher from the US

actually came over to the UK and got hold of the head of a cow

with the disease, put it in his fridge and then took it back to

california in his baggage.  He was stopped by the guards at the

airport and the head taken away.  This may have shown the MAFF

just what researchers will do to get a sample and may have

pushed them to allow others some BSE.







<DT>Wilesmith's suggestion that BSE may not be from scrapie.<DD>

Everything that is published from the Central Veterinary

Laboratory has to go to higher authorities to get permission. 

This one, in 1990 (?), did not get the permission and still

stays with them.  It is not clear why MAFF would prefer that

information suggesting that they were wrong about scrapie being

the immediate cause of BSE should be kept from the public and

possibly politicians too.







<DT>The beefburger fed by John Gummer<DD>, Then the Minister for

Agriculture Fisheries and Food, he fed it to his daughter in

front of all the cameras at the Houses of Parliament was

actually largely turned down by her and he had to eat it

himself.  How he could have known that it did not contain

infective material is not clear.  The question arises as to

whether the ministers have been told by MAFF what is actually

going on.







<DT>Denials of BSE risk.<DD>  Bradley gave specific direct

denials to the media in 1989-1994 that bovine brain tissue never

reached British food and had not until then.  Specific machines 

were available for the removal of brain tissue from the cranium.

One of them seemed to be like a sort of claw and the other was a

band saw that cut the head in half.  It was well known that

brain was used for the manufacture of human food and this was

present in text books.  Brain had a specific value as offal and

as such was removed from the head for sale.  It was said that

the EC rules stated that brain was meat and hence could be used

in various products that were claimed to be beef.  Bradley

denied this and said that brain could not be used in specific

products.







<DT>Is BSE new at all?<DD>Calculations show the first case of

BSE to have been born before the change in the way in which

bovine food was manufactured (1980/81).  Originally it seemed

that BSE infected the cattle when they were very young but this

would be difficult if there was not BSE in the food! What might

have happened is that the older cattle dying with BSE in 1990

might well have not become infected when young but rather when

they were being fed large amounts of infective food to get them

to produce milk.  One group thought that BSE was not a new

disease at all and was probably present in 1 of every 20,000 to

1 in 30,000 cattle.  ANyway, both of the hypotheses would not

fit well with scrapie being transmitted to cows to cause BSE.







<DT>Plum Island<DD>When BSE was first announced the exported

cattle that were moved to the USA were actually rounded up and

taken to Plum Island when they were kept to see if they

developed BSE and exports of live cattle to USA were stopped. 

At this time  MAFF were stating that there was no problems with

BSE and that nobody was worried.







<DT>Transmision of BSE by a bull?<DD>A herd of cattle in

Northern Ireland became had no cases of BSE.  A bull brought in

from England died of BSE but so did some of its offspring on the

farm.  It was as if the bull had infected its calves in some way.







<DT>Tissue from cattle was tested for BSE by inoculation into

mice. <DD> Only the brain and spinal cord tissue caused a

disease in mice and this was used as an indication that there

was no infectivity in the other tissues.  This was clearly

misleading but was shown to the press as proof that there was no

risk to humans from eating bovine tissue.  (1993 onwards)







<DT>Southwood not accepted<DD>The 'Southwood' report (from the

Working party on BSE, organised by the MAFF in 1987) was

produced by spring of 1988, and was presented to MAFF. 

Apparently they were horrified by the report, which made heavy

statements about how we did not know enough to be certain of the

risk. It is said that MAFF put pressure on him to change the

text in such a way at to make it clear that eating bovine tissue

would not be a risk.  This, it is said is the reason for the two

revisions of the report, which not become reach Parliament for

several months later, the reason for which is unclear. 







<DT>Southwood sources<DD>It seems that Southwood did not

actually take information from the right sources to decide what

to do about BSE anyway.  Several experts were almost pulling

their hair out when they saw the report, which said that no

restrictions should be put on the consumation of brain, spinal

cord, etc and that BSE would not go on to infect further

animals.  These are clearly ignorant statements and could not

have been advised by anyone involved in the science.







<DT>Farmers have been much more worried about BSE than has been

reported.<DD>  They feel that they have been treated badly and

that, as there is no risk to humans whatever (as MAFF keeps

telling them) why should they have to work hard and pay up to

report the cattle?  There is a great feeling that BSE actually

came into the UK from elsewhere and that BSE is in fact

prevalent in France but the french are not reporting them

(apparently they are calling them cases of rabies). 







<DT>Are BSE cases getting to MAFF statistics<DD>After 1991

farmers that reported cases born after the feed ban of what they

were certain were BSE (by this time many farmers had seen half a

dozen cases) to the veterinary officer found themselves in a

problem.  The problem was that initially the VO would say that

he wasn't sure that it had BSE and that it had to wait on the

farm for a month when he would return.  Then the VO came back to

find that the animal was sick but could not be said to have

certain BSE and so the VO turned it down. There the farmer was

left with a sick cow, that could not be sold to anyone except

for animal meat and would be worth less than ú100, whereas when

the VO was first called the farmer could have taken it to the

market just looking a little low and got ú800. The reason was

twofold.  Partly it was because the farmers were getting much

better at spotting the initial changes in personality of the cow

that preceded the clinical disease and the second was that the

VOs had been told to be tighter in their selection of cattle. 

They were also told that there would be few cows born after the

ban that showed BSE.  Eventually, a particularly honest farmer

called Lacey, saying that the VO had turned down a 'barn door'

case and that he wasn't having it.  Lacey had it slaughtered,

the brain examined and it was clearly BSE.







<DT>Vets at markets<DD>Initially vets were hired to be at the

market for quite long hours inspecting cattle to make sure that

clinically infected animals did not get sold.  In about 1992/3

the time of the vet was dropped from 12 hrs to week to 2 hrs per

week (one local vet that is known).  Few infected cattle were

picked up and it was not thought to be worthwhile. No farmer has

been taken to court as if any infected animal was pointed out

the farmer just apologised and took it home. 







<DT>EC regulations were not enforced fully<DD>The Germans and

eventually the whole EC, in 1990 demanded that UK meat not be

exported if it came from an infected herd.  This was to be

carried out by: 1 the farmer selling the cow at market would

announce that he had a case of BSE on his herd within the

previous 2 years and the price of the cow would drop

accordingly.  2.  The market would announce this to the buyer. 

3.  The buyer would not export the meat  4.  The abattoir would 

supply certificates for any meat being exported, signed by a vet

to say that the meat was not from an infected herd.



In 1992 the workers at Smithfield and the meat groups marched on

the MAFF and told them that this simply would not do.  The

reason was that such a high proportion of the cattle were from

an infected herd (by this time it was probably 65%) that it was

ruining the export and making such difficulty that things had to

change.



In around 1992 things seemed to change.  The markets seemed to

stop asking the farmers presenting cattle if they had had a case

of BSE previously, they stopped putting ribbons around the cow

when sold, the abattoirs happily exported them as if they were

from a non-infected herd.  Vets were put under pressure to sign

the certificates even though there was no evidence that what

they were saying was true. This all changed with Maria Hovi,

(0734 667090) who was sacked after she refused to sign the

certificates because they were not true. She made it plain that

this was unacceptable.







<DT>Misleading data<DD>The impression is that 55% of the dairy

herds in the UK are affected at one time or another by BSE.  It

is a misleading impression, however, as the larger the herd, the

greater the likelihood of BSE.  In fact >90% of the dairy cattle

in the UK are now from an affected herd.







<DT>Vertical transmission means that large numbers were

infected<DD>The number of cattle infected with BSE that are

being eaten has been claimed to reach 1.8 million by 2001 but it

is not realised that the figure is four times as great if the

cattle become infected from their mother.  







<DT>USDA<DD>The USDA was determined to carry out as much as

possible of the research into BSE in the USA and researchers

there outside the USDA had trouble at times getting funding or

samples to carry out experiments.







<DT>USDA research<DD>Workers at the USDA have been under

pressure not to find out what is actually going on with BSE. 

For instance they were told to feed the mink some amounts of

bovine brain to fid out how much was needed to transmit the

disease.  In their publications they say that they tried out

down to 1g (which still worked).  This is extremely unlikely. 

Anyone carrying out this sort of experiment will use doses much

lower than this, probably 1000 times lower.  Perhaps the USDA

does not want the results to be published??







<DT>Experiments not done<DD>Numerous experiments into the risk

of BSE to humans have not been done and some have been done that

have turned out to be useless. For instance: No measurement of

the amount of infectivity in tissues was done properly until

1992 (far too late).  No measurement of the amount of specific

tissues needed to infect specific animals (sometimes done with

grossly too high amounts, officially).  No range of animals

tested with BSE to work out the chance of transmission to

humans.  No transgenic mice made to look for methods of tissue

testing.  Cattle have not actually been fed specific amounts of

bovine meal as a test to see if this is the way they become

infected.  No infectivity has in fact been found in the meal at

all. 







<DT>No replies from officialdom<DD>Various groups have written

to the Minister of Agriculture and not received replies.  Dr.

Dealler wrote to Wilesmith at his parliamentary address, at his

constituency address and at the MAFF and got no reply.







<DT>Tyrrell<DD>Attempts made to get in touch with Tyrrell have

been difficult and it has been worrying that he seems to have

been believing everything told to him by MAFF.  At a meeting he

stated that the mouse assay for infectivity in tissue of cattle

tissue should be thought to be 100% sensitive, a clear mistake

but one put over by MAFF regularly to the press. Tyrrell used to

run the common cold unit associated with Porton Down. Although a

lot of work was done, it is not clear if we have less common

colds.







<DT>A meeting between Wilesmith, Bradley, Tyrrell, Lacey and

Dealler at the MAFF centre of the Royal Showground in 1993.<DD> 

It was made clear that by Wilesmith that the cases of BSE born

after the feed ban were simply due to bags of meal being kept

for longer than expected.  When asked, farmers said, however

that they never kept bags for longer than 6 weeks because they

generally rotted.  Lacey made it clear that the Aspergillus

fungus that would grow was unacceptable and the economics would

make sure that the bags were not kept for any length of time. 

"do they think we're idiots?" Lacey growled to Dealler and

pulled Wilesmith's arguments to pieces. Tyrrell claimed that he

would not let ten thousand infective units of BSE into a human

diet as this was shown to be an oral dose in some TSEs.  Lacey

explained that if 10,000 IU was not in a meal of 100g of food

then they would have to use a test that would find 100 IU in a

single gram and that was not possible by inoculating tissue into

mice.  







<DT>Cases in France? <DD>They say they've had about 6.  Farmers

in the UK think they've had more.  The Portuguese say they've

had 12 but they are generally the offspring of imported UK

cattle...and one that is the offspring of a Dutch cow. It is not

clear how the infectivity could have reached them as other

Portuguese cattle do not seem to be affected.







<DT>The case of BSE in a bull exported to Canada<DD> In 1994 it

was a shock.  The response from the Canadian meat groups was

severe.







<DT>The original cat with FSE<DD>It was claimed that the cat

that originally died of FSE did not eat any infective food at

all.  It was supposedly only given proper steak.  Similarly, the

puma and the cheetah that died in the zoo were not knowingly

given the offal of infected animals.  Could cats be particularly

open to infection.







<DT>Before BSE got going there were only a few, specific groups

in the world working on TSEs<DD>.  Meetings were of an eye

scratching type, with one group trying to be one up on the other

group.  At one meeting one of the lecturers was picked up by his

lapels and pushed off the stage.  Now there are too many people

involved to be the king of the castle and hopefully things will

be less personally messy.







<DT>Daisy leaves in Bradford.<DD>  Dealler found a specific

chemical in the leaves of the daisy with Nash.  It was found to

be active against HIV but he wanted it to be active against BSE.

The children of Bradford collected hundreds of bags of leaves on

the 'daisy day' in 1993 and the chemicals still lie in wait.

Dealler could find no funding to go further.







<DT>MAFF knew the numbers of cases were not going away.<DD> In

order to find out if the case numbers is changing is actually

much more difficult than it seems but MAFF had about 6 people

(e.g. Linda Hoinville, Judy Ryan) at one time working on it at

the Central Veterinary Laboratory.  They must have known that

things were not a good as seemed.  It does not seem obvious,

however that they told the politicians.







<DT>The computer was useless. <DD> Originally it was a good idea

that instead of all the information being given from one person

to another about each cow, the farmer would put a tag on its ear

and keep a record of what happens to it. A computer would keep

all the records of deaths and farms etc.  This was probably

going to be used for the abattoirs to check if it came from an

infected herd but it turned out that the information could not

actually be released by the computer to anyone outside MAFF. 

The machine became a statistics machine and little else until

the law was changed in late 1995.







<DT>Offal has a price.<DD>  Offal of various sorts is removed at

slaughter in the abattoir.  What happens to it then?  It is very

difficult to be sure and it is said that the offal may well end

up in animal food.  The fact that they have now demanded that

offal is stained black by the abattoir may be an indication that

MAFF can realise that they might not all be being destroyed as

they should be.







<DT>Meat and bone meal.<DD> MBM could no longer be used for

bovine feed in the UK as of July 1988.  So what happened to the

meal?  Well, it was just exported.  Bradley put it over to the

EC that it was sent to foreign parts to be used in soil

fertiliser but the evidence for this is poor.  The worry is that

it got sent to Europe and that they will follow us with an

outbreak of BSE.







<DT>Mechanically recovered meat.<DD> MRM is the meat that is

removed from the surfaces of bone after the abattoir workers

have taken as much as they can.  The effect is really quite

large but contains fragments of bone and hence has a lot of

calcium.  Human food is always worth more than animal food and

it is expected that MRM still ends up in human food.  The worry

is that MRM is likely to contain many tissues.







<DT>The use of bull's eye balls in school was recommended to

stop (1995).  But it was OK to eat.<DD>







<DT>Various schools refused to continue to give beef to the

children (1994).<DD> This was put down as rediculous by Meldrum

and pressure was put on schools to change their ways. Various

schools refused to do this (try some in the Hull area).







<DT>Sausages.<DD>  What is in your sausage? It is not exactly

clear but it is expected to contain a fraction of many of the

tissues that you did not otherwise eat (e.g. lungs). Some of

these tissues are known in other species to be infective for

TSE. 







<DT>For some reason Lacey is no longer lambasted at lectures

that he gives.<DD>  The media pulled him to pieces for saying

that the cattle born after the ban would continue to be infected

and for saying that we may find the ground to be infected (as

with scrapie perhaps).  It now seems that various groups are

happy with what he is saying.







<DT>Dealler's argument with McLean.<DD> McLean (then the junior

minister for agriculture in 1991) had given a lecture to the

abattoir workers and the butchers in Bradford and stated that no

infection had ever been found in meat.  He had said that there

was no possible risk to the workers and not to worry.  

Afterwards Dealler approached him and offered to make some kind

of agreement; (?if McLean tells the truth then perhaps Lacey

will stop spreading the fear. ??).  Apparently McLean was

determined that all the information concerning infectivity in

meat was simply wrong and invalid.  It ended up with Dealler

shouting out of the door of the hall at McLean and his entourage

heading for their car.  Meantime, the workers were all talking

to Lacey and were clearly unimpressed by McLean's denials.







<DT>Wilesmith claimed that there would be no cases of BSE born

in 1992 and put his job on the line.<DD> When a case appeared,

and the EC demanded to know how, MAFF could not say but promised

that there would be no more in 1993. There has now been one born

in 1993 (and this is only around 2 years old so there will be

plenty more.  One neurological case has been reported to a VO in

the west that was born in 1994.  The farmer thought it was BSE

but the VO didn't and told that he couldnt get any compensation.

The farmer told Granada Television. 







<DT>Hugh Frazer.<DD> HF the expert in scrapie and other TSEs has

now left the BBSRC Unit in Edinburgh.  He has retired.  This is

a great loss as he was an excellent researcher. When BSE was

first being investigated MAFF ordered him how to do the

experiments (wrongly) but he had to do them that way.  This is

not the sort of man to lie down when retired and it would be a

pity if he left. What a loss.







<DT>Honors.<DD> Ray Bradley, who has been in charge of the BSE

Unit at the Central Veterinary Laboratory since the beginning of

the epidemic has been given the CBE...and now retired.  Keith

Meldrum has also (but not retired) and Rob Will has been made a

Professor.  Narang has been sacked, Dealler has had attempts

made to destroy his career, and Lacey has been demoted.  I hope

that the winners are right.







<DT>Keep official sources quiet.<DD> The Communcable Disease

Report (CDR), which is produced by the Public Health Laboratory

Service was determined to produce regular information on the BSE

epidemic.  They were told not to.  A meeting there was a serious

argument as to whether they should put up with the directions

from above.  This was obviously a public health matter and

should be spread as information to doctors.  It turns out that

the whole of the PHLS were told to provide no information about

BSE to anyone. No information could be obtained on BSE from the

Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Pathologists,

the British Medical Association, the Royal Society,

Environmental Health and many more. This was probably because of

the effect the salmonella and listeria news outbreaks had. 

Originally when it was anounced that listeria was in cook-chill

food, everyone rang up the PHLS and asked what it was.  PHLS

told them that it was a pathogen that causes a severe disease

and is sometimes associated with outbreaks from food.  This

caused a press calamity.  With BSE the way to handle it was to

make sure that there was only one source of information and that

was to be MAFF.  







<DT>Consumers Assn. <DD>The main group that kept needling the

MAFF was the consumers association. 







<DT>Richard Kimberlin.<DD>  He is more in charge than you think.

An excellent scientist from the era of TSEs when interpersonal

vengeance was known, is determined that the risk to humans from

BSE is minimal.  He left the research unit in Edinburgh in 1987

and set up his own company as advisor to other food groups,

Governments, research groups, drug companies, committees etc.

Unfortuneately this means that they have all heard the Kimberlin

side of the story more than others. 


<DT>Various BSE researchers in the UK have made it plain that

they would not let their children eat sausages, meat pies, etc.

<DD>



<DT>Infection in meat?<DD>  McLean stated that Dr. Pattisson, a

veterinary researcher into scrapie, now deceased, was misleading

when he stated that there was infectivity in goat meat with

scrapie. Pattisson wrote back to the Veterinary Record making it

plain that the meat taken from the goat was nothing but meat and

it was injected into another goat.  The second goat died of

scrapie so there was infection in the meat.  He told me that the

real problem was that he carried out the experiment with a small

herd of goats and was told to slaughter them when only a few

years old.  If only I had let them live on, he said, possibly

all of them would have died of scrapie.



<DT>GPs.<DD>Various GPs have made it clear that they will not

eat bovine material and certainly not recommend it to their

patients.  One near Cambridge and one near York are determined. 




<DT>Narang is now backed. <DD>To MAFF's annoyance he is backed

by a food manufacturer.


<DT>The information source for the media from MAFF is very

poor.<DD>  Numbers can be got but information about diseases is

difficult.  There is a special telephone line at MAFF but this

is limited in its value. Various researchers have needed some

information from a vet locally and been referred to the Central

Veterinary Laboratory.  Here the researcher says they must speak

to the manager, the manager refers them to MAFF, the MAFF demand

that they speak to Kieth Meldrum.  Its felt to be a tight ship.


<DT>Farmers want nobody to realise that their cattle are

sick.<DD> Although such a high proportion of herds are affected

by BSE the farmers are still embarrassed.  If they could, a

farmer would sell his cow, with symptoms of BSE to an

intermediate farmer (there was one near Ilkley and one in

Cheshire) who would then announce the case to the veterinary

officer and claim the compensation. Mean time the original farm

did not have anything wrong with his farm. Originally MAFF took

some trouble to prevent this but little has been heard since. 


<DT>Vicky Rimmer.<DD>  She was with an incurable presenile

dementing illness and now in a coma was first seen by the expert

from the CJD Unit in Edinburgh when she was 16. He came and

asked her grandmother questions about what was wrong and then

told them not to tell anyone about the case.  What he did not

seem to realise was that Alan Watkins, the Today expert on BSE

was actually in the room with them. Was this a cover-up?


<DT>An expert at MAFF applied to the Spongiform Encephalopathy

Research Campaign for the post as the manager.<DD>  He/she made

it clear that what MAFF was doing concerning BSE was quite

unacceptable and that some of the things said were almost

unbelievable.  SERC wondered whether the appointment was genuine

but the person seemed good.


<DT>London Zoo and its Kudu.<DD> Dealler went to London Zoo to

look at the Greater Kudu.  Unfortunately the vet was out but one

of the zoo keepers was there and showed him around.  Apparently

they were expecting to discard the top food of soil from the

kudu pen because of infection remaining in the soil, all

droppings from the animals had to be collected and incinerated,

the man had to get changed  before he entered and left, and

anything that was dropped into the pen by a viewer would be

incinerated too.  This was at the time that MAFF was telling

farmers that BSE would not remain endemic in their farms.


<DT>Tyrrell Committee.<DD> For some reason there does not seem

to have been specific groups invited to the Tyrrell Committee

for advice concerning BSE.  The most important one would be one

of Medical Ethics (the people that decide what is morally

acceptable), then the Medical Microbiology group, then the

Infectious Disease, and especially Public Health.  What is being

discussed is a matter of public health.  The reason why PH is

not fully involved is not clear.



<DT>Death certificates.<DD>Various relatives of people that have

died of CJD have reported that the doctors refused to write CJD

as the cause of death on the certificate.  Some (for instance

Mr. and Mrs. Churchill) were determined and demanded the change.

Exactly why this is cannot be sure.  We are told that recently

the CJD people have been asking  histologists not to report

cases but I cant believe that this can this be true.  It is also

said that various cases of CJD have not reached the CJD unit

records.


<DT>Two diseases??<DD>Initially it was found that around 10% of

the cases of BSE reported to MAFF in 1988 were not

histologically true.  This represented a few hundred.  By 1993

it had risen to 15% of the cases but this was several thousand. 

So what was wrong with the other ones?  How could the number of

other fatal neurological diseases have increased remarkably at

the same rate as the number of cases of BSE?  Are we having two

epidemics in parallel?  Could it be that we are just getting the

histology wrong?


<DT>Urine test.<DD> A technique may have been found to look for

the diagnosis of BSE by looking at urine.  The experiment work

has been stopped and the funding removed at MAFF.


<DT>Mawhinney. <DD> In charge of the Department of Health he

announced in 1995 that there would be no research into methods

of diagnosis or treatment of BSE as this would simply be used to

indicate that there was a risk to humans.  He made no notice of

the fact that we do not yet know if there is or is not a risk.



<DT>Germans are not so easily misled. <DD> It was expected that

the Germans scientists would not be misled by MAFF but when

speaking to them. Dealler found that they too had believed many

of the pieces of data that Bradley had put out (which were all

essentially true) and took them to show that BSE was going away

and there was little risk.



<DT>Questions not answered.<DD> Meetings involving Linda

Hoinville and John Wilesmith with the vets from the south of

England were strained as they refused to answer some questions.

For some reason the 'vertical transmission study', which will

not now be able to show if there is any because both the control

mothers and the test mothers are from the same herd, has

finished but the results not arrived for publication. 


<DT>Hogg the new minister<DD> Hogg got in as the Minister of

MAFF and must have wondered why.  His wife has been disposed of

by Major as an advisor and there had been a mild fracas.  When

arriving in the post he asked to see all the information about

BSE. It is assumed that some of it was not as he liked and a

press conference was announced saying that there was more

infection in bovine tissue than they thought.  No further data

was given.  Bradley said later that this was due to the oral

transmission of BSE by 1g of brain tissue to another cow. 

Clearly this did not incidate more infectivity in the tissue, so

there must have been some more information.  Is the information

fully reaching the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee?

It is worried that the SEAC is being used to blame when things

go wrong and their advice is more manipulated than wanted.  One

thing is clear from the way things happened is that Hogg might

have wondered if anything  was wrong when he got the job. 


<DT>SEAC decisions.<DD> The decisions made by MAFF and by SEAC

early in the epidemic had to be on best guesses because there

was simply not enough information to be sure of the risks that

were being taken. It is not at all clear, however, how those

best guesses were calculated.  Dealler's calculations of the

number of infected cattle that were being eaten was given to

MAFF and SEAC 4 months in advance of the following SEAC meeting.

Bradley was to send copies to all the members.  They reached the

members a week before the meeting and were little looked at. A

letter was sent back to him saying that they could not accept

his findings of human risk because they were calculated assuming

cumulative doses of BSE and there was not proof of this. The

problem with SEAC is that it has had to make decisions where

there is inadequate proof. Anyone in Public Health would have

accepted the findings as you must always assume the worst. 

Instead Dealler offered to calculate risks with non-cumulative

doseas of disease. He received no reply. Could SEAC be looking

on the bright side when the dark side is the PH line it should

take?  Are they going to be the fall-guys?


<DT>New test for CJD.<DD>  Narang claims that by looking at the

urine of a patient under the microscope he identified the

objects that were associated with infection.  He says that he

used simple local urine as controls and was happy.  He felt that

the test should be tried by many other groups and that he should

be allowed to carry it out without the fight of trying to use a

laboratory.  "Why dont you use your garage?" said a local

hospital manager.


<DT>Foreign cows.<DD>  A farmer with a number of cases of what

he thought were BSE reported them to the VO.  The VO ignored a

few of them and when asked why, he said that they were foreign

cows and therefore couldn't have BSE.  Apparently MAFF has had

pressure put on it to cut any budgets that it can and the

compensation for BSE is one of them. 


<DT>MAFF chases away experts.<DD> Some researchers appeared from

Edinburgh to a farm in the South of England to carry out

electronic recordings of the brain waves of the cows suffering

from BSE and those that were apparently normal.  The reason was

that this particular herd had had a large number of cases of BSE

and nobody was sure why. Initially the vet reported to the

Veterinary Record that there had been 12 cases and it was

published.  There was at least 60 by a few years later however. 

By this time it seemed that there was something special about

the farm and they may be able to tell which cattle were

incubating the disease and which were not so an agreement was

made with the farmer.  MAFF arrived to chase them away.  



The vet in charge of this farm described the tale in awful terms

and actually moved house partly to get away from the problem.

<DT>Espionage??<DD>  The worry among the people outside MAFF/DoH

has always been that they are at risk in some way. Letters have

gone missing, computer discs, files, publications, and crackles

on the line, but nobody is sure of any espionage.  The publisher

of Lacey's latest popular book about BSE seemed to vanish after

spending a year of organising and few books were sold.  A bit

strange but not surely a spy.  Dealler's manuscript was turned

down for the Lancet but none returned.  He found that the

computer disc and the hard copy of the manuscript had gone from

his office. Not exactly serious; he just rewrote it.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Learn">Learn</A> from the crisis and restore consumer confidence</CENTER></H3>
Economic and Social Committee Press Release no 95/96<BR>
Brussels 10 July, 1996<P>

The recommendations of the ESC Own-initiative Opinion on the "Mad Cow" crisis:<P>


At its Plenary Session today, the Economic and Social Committee adopted, by
a majority vote, with 17 votes againsta nd five abstentions, an
Own-initiative Opinion on "The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis
and its wide-ranging conssequences for the EU".  The Rapporteur was Manuel
ATAIDE FERREIRA (Portugal) a legal adviser for consumer interests and the
co-rapporteurs were Campbell Christie (UK) for the trade unions and Guiseppe
Pricolo (Italy) for the employers.<P>


Whilst not seeking to take on the work of scientific or political bodies,
the Committee feels that it must express the position of the Community's
socio-economic groups and offer some general pointers for future action.

The BSE crisis has highlighted a number of shortcomings in EU policy on
consumer health protection.<P>


It has also shown that the single market brings a need for a firm, mutually
supportive policy on risk prevention.  Without such a policy, there is a
risk of a return to protectionism, possibly even at local level.

The slump in beef consumption throughout the EU shows that the public's
right to healthy, safe food no longer knows any frontiers.  To restore
consumer confidence, an EU policy to guarantee food safety is vital.<P>


The Opinion also emphasizes the impact which the crisis has had on
employment, not only in the beef industry but throughout the production and
marketing chain.  This aspect has not received sufficient attention at
Community level and calls for a special initiative that is proportionate to
the crisis.<P>

The Committee welcomes the agreement reached by the Florence European
Council.  It also applauds the Commission departments' speedy, coordinated
response to the crisis.  However, the Committee points out that there have
been shortcomings in this area in the past, notably in terms of prevention,
effective controls and implementation of the provisions adopted.  The
Community must learn from this if it is to prevent any recurrence of similar
situations.
<P>
There must be no deregulation in matters of health and safety.  With public
attention worldwide focused on the EU, it must act cohesively in order to
prove its effectiveness.<P>

Ç<p><A NAME="OPINION">
</A> of the Economic and Social Committee<p>on BSE crisis and its wide-ranging consequences for the EU<p>Rapporteur: Mr ATAODE FERREIRA<p>Co-Rapporteurs: Mr PRICOLO, Mr CHRISTIE<p>At its Plenary Session of 25 April 1996, the Economic and Social Committee decided, in accordance with Rule 23(3) of its Rules of Procedure, to draw up an Own-initiative Opinion on<p>The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis and its wide-ranging consequences for the EU.<p>The BSE Sub-Committee, set up in accordance with Rule 19 of the Rules of Procedure, was instructed to prepare the Committee's work on the subject. The Sub-Committee adopted a draft Committee Opinion on 2 July 1996, by a majority vote with three abstentions.<p>At its 337th Plenary Session (meeting of 10 July 1996), the Economic and Social Committee adopted the following Opinion by 126 to 17 with 5 abstentions.<p>Scope of the Opinion<p>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has reached epidemic proportions in the UK and there have been sporadic cases in some Member States which imported cattle or meat-based meals from the UK. <p>There are also grounds for suspecting that a small number of human fatalities within the EU may be BSE-related. Consumers have naturally reacted to this, triggering an economic crisis in beef-farming and downstream sectors which has led to numerous job losses throughout the meat production, processing and marketing industry<p>In the view of the Committee, it is significant that this crisis has occurred against the backdrop of increased pressure to cut public spending generally and reductions in public-sector research as a result of public-sector cuts, privatization and deregulation. There is no substitute for properly funded public-sector monitoring and enforcement of food safety regulations and independent research into BSE and possible links with the new strain of CJD, and the Committee is concerned that the BSE crisis has coincided with cutbacks in these areas.<p>The recent Florence European Council agreed in principle on a framework for implementing a BSE eradication plan in the UK and approved the granting of aid to farmers, while stipulating that the BSE issue must be resolved according to scientific criteria and respect for consumer rights and public health. The Committee welcomes this agreement and notes that the Commission departments have made major efforts at coordination in the face of the gravity of the crisis.<p>It is not for the Committee to take on the work of scientific bodies or political bodies which will have to decide further measures for dealing with this crisis. However, the Committee is concerned at the loss of consumer confidence and is mindful of the views of the representative organizations of the EU's farmers, industry, traders, consumers and workers. The Committee therefore feels that it must make a number of general remarks and offer recommendations to the Community institutions in accordance with Article 198 of the Treaty, in order to see what lessons can be learned from this crisis which has brought serious consequences for public health and for the operation of the single market.<p>The Committee is also concerned at the fact that the EU decision-making mechanisms have been compromised by unilateral obstructionism. The Committee is sure that this issue will not escape the attention of the IGC. Accordingly, the present Opinion will not examine this aspect in detail.<p>Public health<p>The body of scientific and technical evidence tending to suggest that BSE might transmit to humans through food is a matter of concern.<p>The WHO's conclusions of April 1996 state that "a link has not yet been proven between V-CJD ... and the effect of exposure to the BSE agent". However, "the most likely hypothesis for V-CJD is the exposure .... to BSE."<p>The EU has proved poorly equipped to act quickly and effectively, and to provide reassurance, in defence of the health and rights of the consumer.<p>Despite the warnings of the experts consulted by the WHO (Geneva, May 1995) and the European Parliament's study and resolution on the subject, the Community has continued to take a relaxed - if not negligent - attitude to the possible gravity of the public health implications.<p>Although a series of legislative provisions have been adopted, insufficient checks have been carried out to ensure that the Member States have implemented them properly. Matters are made worse by the non-binding nature of recommendations.<p>The Committee also notes that health policy has been slow to address the problem of transmission of BSE and prion diseases. However, the Committee is pleased to note that the recent proposal (still under discussion) to set up an epidemiological surveillance network does consider CJD.<p>The warnings and hypotheses of some scientists appear to have made insufficient impression on the relevant EU authorities, as strict measures have not been established for preventing transmission across the "species barrier".<p>The Committee thinks that extra resources should be allotted to EU scientific research into BSE and CJD. It trusts that the findings of this research will be made more widely available than those of the programmes launched in 1990.<p>The interests of health protection have taken second place to the major economic interests at stake.<p>The views of the experts have been ignored for economic and political reasons, and the absence of proof of risk has been interpreted as proof that there is no risk.<p>Changes in the processing of animal meal, clearly motivated by producers' interests, were made possible by absence of adequate regulation and a lack of proper controls. Such a situation is liable to hurt everyone, including the economic operators concerned.<p>The agri-food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industries are rightly being criticized for having in some cases used unsafe products as a result of inadequate checks on the purchase of raw materials.<p>Unfortunately there is still no test usable by the agri-food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics industry to ensure that their raw materials do not contain any BSE agent. Until such a test is available, quality control has to rely entirely on certificates from suppliers of the raw materials.<p>Doubts thus remain as to whether industrial and quality control practices are as effective as they might be. Moreover, given the Member States' differing approaches to epidemiological surveillance programmes, and given the conclusions of the experts consulted by the WHO in April 1996, it is difficult to ascertain solely on the basis of origin whether raw materials are safe.<p>Significant measures have been taken to withdraw certain products from the market. It is vital that these continue to be strictly enforced, in accordance with the opinions of the relevant scientific committees, in resolute defence of public health. The Committee welcomes the setting-up of a multidisciplinary committee on BSE, made up of leading scientists, to provide an independent, cross-sectoral approach to the problem.<p>As regards the inactivation procedures and the origin of the raw materials, the Committee is concerned that in deciding to lift the ban on gelatin, tallow and semen subject to certain conditions, the Commission has ignored the recommendations of the Opinion issued on 15April by the Scientific Committee for Food.<p>For the pharmaceutical industry, the European Medicinal Products Agency (EMEA/354/96 of 16 April 1996) has identified the following problems:<p>a)Place of origin of raw materials<p>b)Provenance of tissue<p>c)Safety of rendering procedures (temperature, pressure, duration).<p>The 1992 guidelines concerning excipients based on gelatin and tallow derivatives have recently been confirmed by the Medicinal Products Agency, and should continue to be heeded. However, attention is drawn to the difficulties, acknowledged by the industry itself, of clear recognition of the origin of the raw material (see (a) above).<p>Hence it is vital not only to prohibit production but also to compulsorily withdraw, throughout the EU, all medicinal products and placebos containing products of hazard levels I to III that are not medically essential. Those which replace them should be issued solely on prescription, as it is up to doctors to decide whether a risk is acceptable when prescribing both conventional and, in particular, homeopathic medicines.<p>Similar comments apply to the cosmetic industry. Consideration should be given to banning the marketing of products which have not been subject to appropriate inactivation processes.<p>Concerns were expressed by those working in the industry about the implications to their health from possible exposure to BSE either from contact with the infected live animals or carcases.<p>Based on the evidence of the Health & Safety Executive's Independent Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) and Trade Union (TU) specialists, workers have been advised that there is no discernible association with occupational exposure. Nevertheless, the Committee feels that caution is necessary, especially for workers who handle meat directly, because the longer term effects cannot be established. All appropriate precautions should be taken, and full details of all accidents should be recorded.<p>The internal market and the consumer<p>The measures taken by the Community authorities and the UK's belated recognition of the  possible transmission to humans of the BSE agent have obviously sapped the European consumer's confidence in certain products which move freely within the EU. Consumers were rightly concerned to learn that infected animals, contaminated feed and other potentially dangerous bovine products had, for a certain period, moved freely within the EU.<p>These misgivings led to a resurgence of protectionism as consumers showed a marked reluctance to eat imported products and in some cases even those from outside their region or local area.<p>As consumers have switched from beef to other meats and fish, the prices of these other products have risen unduly, hitting the poorest consumers.<p>At the present juncture, it is desirable to exclude potentially infectious products from the market. Products with no perceivable infection risk should have all bones and nerve and lymphatic tissue removed before they are sold to consumers, as these parts cannot be decontaminated properly.<p>Bearing in mind consumer concern about food safety, the Committee calls for an education and information campaign to promote a healthy, balanced diet in line with the action programmes on public health.<p>On a more general note, the Committee stresses that the availability of clear, reliable information is a fundamental citizen's right and is crucial for restoring the desired climate of confidence. Consumer and retailer organizations should play an active part in public information campaigns. All the sectors affected by the crisis should be given prompt updates on the situation. Product labelling should give details of composition and the percentage of each ingredient.<p>An assessment should be made of the effectiveness of the Directive on general product safety (92/59/EEC). The Directive on liability for defective products (85/374) should be revised to include farm products and unforeseeable risks, as the Committee has already recommended.<p>Independently of the criticisms levelled at certain industries which use bovine derivatives as raw materials, the question arises of the financial and other problems which the BSE crisis has brought for many businesses in the beef industry (abattoirs, hauliers, packaging, processing, the dairy sector, etc). These businesses bear no direct responsibility for the situation, but are losing income because of the drop in consumption.<p>Impact of BSE on cattle production<p>The crisis in the EU beef industry worsened dramatically in the spring of 1996, following the generalized slump in consumption and the ensuing collapse of farmgate prices, while consumer prices remained stable.<p>The impact of the crisis on the beef sector can be summarized as follows:<p>-significant reduction, and in some areas stoppage, of slaughter as fewer cattle were purchased from farmers;<p>-parallel reduction, and in some cases stoppage, of processing of meat and meat products;<p>-dramatic reduction in exports, including traditional ones, to third countries;<p>-fall in distribution and in retail sales.<p>The immediate direct consequences for beef farmers were as follows:<p>-blockage of sales, obliging farmers to keep on the farm animals ready for slaughter;<p>-reduction in alternative farming possibilities, as the land is tied up producing feed for livestock which is unproductive but necessarily continues to occupy that land;<p>-farmers are effectively unable to benefit from any alternative CAP measures for the production of arable or organic crops.<p>It goes without saying that all these harmful consequences are caused by the collapse of consumption, which in some countries has slumped to around 40% . The precise impact on farm incomes cannot be calculated yet. However, the few sales being made are at prices 20% below the pre-crisis level.<p>It is too soon to quantify definitively the structural reduction in beef consumption caused by the "mad cow" crisis.<p>However, it has already been calculated that a five percentage point fall in EU consumption could increase the surplus over domestic consumption to a million tonnes. A 20% fall would product a two million tonne surplus in 1997.<p>It is thus clear that unless consumption picks up, the market balance which has so painfully been achieved after years of costly public action will be jeopardized.<p>Measures to be adopted at EU level for the beef and veal sector<p>Apart from the ban on the export of UK cattle, meat, and bovine byproducts to the other Member States and to third countries, which was introduced solely on health grounds, the only EU-level measures adopted hitherto have been market management measures facilitating the sale of beef into intervention.<p>Realizing that these were merely stopgap measures, the Commission proposed allocating ECU 650 million to income support for beef and veal producers. The Florence European Council increased this to ECU850 million.<p>The Committee thinks that to revitalize the livestock sector, both emergency aid and longer term measures are needed.<p>Emergency aid should include:<p>-compensation for producers in the infected areas who must slaughter their livestock;<p>-compensation for farmers who have to keep cattle which are ready for slaughter but have not been withdrawn from the market;<p>-soft loans for farm management expenditure, for at least two farm-years;<p>-an increase in the premiums for male bovine animals and suckler cows.<p>Three longer term measures should be envisaged:<p>-priority aid for farmers, under the scheduled structural programmes, to adjust farm structures to the needs of health and hygiene controls and preventive measures (including regular rehabilitation of pasturage/meadows);<p>-grants for switching from intensive indoor rearing of male bovine animals to extensive or semi-extensive systems;<p>-promotion schemes (also on third markets) run by well-qualified, clearly defined producer organizations, to guarantee the quality, origin and commercial value of the product.<p>Animal health<p>Over-production and the overriding need to protect food quality, the environment and animal welfare have prompted a switch to more extensive farming methods in the EU.<p>This welcome trend, which is clearly evident in the CAP, is more respectful of the ecological balance which until recently was threatened by intensive farming systems that were plainly geared towards high levels of production.<p>However, more still needs to be done to promote animal health by means of health programmes which ensure effective disease eradication throughout the EU.<p>These transnational programmes must be drawn up and implemented with EU-level coordination and checks on compliance. Closer harmonization is also needed of the training received by the inspectors who carry out the checks. The subsidiarity principle should in no circumstances impede the adoption of appropriate measures to safeguard animal health. The Committee welcomes the Resolution on animal health policy and the internal market which the Agriculture Council adopted at the end of June, as the Resolution addresses these issues.<p>In the specific case of BSE, and in view of the urgency of the situation, it would be desirable to set up special administrative bodies where necessary; these products should be independent of producers' interests, with the power to inspect farms, abattoirs and shipments of live animals and products of animal origin, including imports from third countries.<p>In this context, the Committee notes with interest the Commission's proposal of 29May to create a European inspection and control agency for animal and plant health, to be set up in Ireland. The Committee may comment at a later date on the functions of this body, notably in terms of prevention.<p>Health measures to be taken on beef and veal<p>BSE has severely hit the whole beef sector - producers, slaughter houses, processors, distributors and retailers. In such a situation, the Committee thinks that the following measures are urgently needed:<p>The first task is to eliminate the main cause of the disease, namely the use of meat meal in ruminant feed.<p>The ban on this must be enforced effectively throughout the EU forthwith, and the case should be considered for extending it as a precautionary measure to non-ruminants.<p>The feeding of meat products to herbivores is harmful to public health, to the farm economy, and to the environment, because it:<p>-is a BSE vector;<p>-discourages the use of plant-based meals, which are and must remain the natural foodstuff for ruminants;<p>-leads farmers to abandon husbandry practices based on pasturage/meadows, which should be safeguarded at least in those areas (uplands and other disadvantaged regions) where the ecological and soil balance is at risk.<p>Veterinary checks on the health status of farms and the types of feed supplements used must be introduced or stepped up.<p>The farmer should be given active responsibility through the introduction of a special document (indicating origin, diet, any illness, etc.) which would accompany each animal through to slaughter. This document should provide a basis for clear, detailed information targeted at the consumer.<p>Consequences for employment<p>The impact on employment and on the cash-flow of many companies due to the collapse of consumer confidence in beef has had a severe effect in a number of EU countries. An ETUC estimate of the impact in all Member States puts the loss of jobs in the region of 50,000.<p>In the UK the employment consequences are already manifest. At the end of April, the British government were of the view that 4,000 workers had been made unemployed because of the BSE crisis. The overall impact is likely to be far higher, with very early trade-union estimates of at least 10,000 jobs having been lost. This estimate is now thought to be low and the number of jobs lost is considerably more.<p>It must be borne in mind that there will be continual and changing impacts and that workers and businesses throughout the food chain are affected. For example, once the culling of animals over 30 months has been operating for a few months, there will be a considerable impact on farm workers. Approximately 25% of farm workers are involved directly in the beef sector. The culling of animals over 30 months will require additional abattoir workers. However, this additional work will only be for the duration of the cull.<p>When the culling takes place, it will impact severely on the dairy herds and the workers employed on the dairy farms. Milk supplies to the consumer will be disrupted and milk product processors such as cheese and butter manufacturers will find their raw materials cut.<p>At this stage it is impossible to estimate the full implications on employment in the milk sector, but they are likely to be severe.<p>One implication for milk producers is that older dairy cattle, which would normally have been slaughtered at the end of their economic milk-producing life, will not have been slaughtered because of the crisis and will still produce milk. With younger animals continually introduced to the herd, many thousands of milk producers may be over quota at the end of the quota year and therefore face severe penalties.<p>The question of whether a farmer receives compensation for culling and then can restock or not will be critical to farm workers. This will also raise questions about "clean" restocking of animals that carry no trace of BSE.<p>In addition to jobs in the farming industry direct, thousands of workers are involved in the beef processing and beef packaging industries; in the manufacture of beef pies and sausages and other bakery products; in live animal and refrigerated meat transport; in packaging; and in pharmaceuticals and confectionery. Jobs will be lost in all these sectors, and companies are already suffering as a result of reduced business.<p>Farm and food industry businesses hit by the crisis, as well as hard pressed workers, will put less money into the local economy which means fewer rural jobs. Therefore villages and local services, which are often struggling to survive, may never recover from the loss of income caused by the BSE crisis.<p>The scale of the social crisis caused by the BSE epidemic is still uncertain, and this leads the Committee to stress the importance of the Social Protocol to the Maastricht Treaty. The Committee is concerned that the Florence European Council did not give the employment aspect the priority it deserves and put off any decisions. The Committee recommends that the employment crisis caused by BSE be made the subject of a special Community initiative making flexible use of the various structural funds available as a recognition of the urgent nature of the crisis.<p>Conclusion<p>Public health and the safety of food products are vital for the quality of life of all EU citizens. The Committee therefore calls on the Council, Commission, Parliament and Member States to take all appropriate measures in their respective spheres of responsibility to guarantee that food products are safe for consumers and to prevent any worsening of the present situation. In this connection, the Committee calls for:<p>a)a ban on the production and sale of all meat-based feed for ruminants, and consideration of the case for extending the ban to non-ruminants, backed by reliable systems for the manufacture of petfoods and feed for other animals that are kept in captivity;<p>b)a ban on the circulation and sale of high-risk products as identified by the experts consulted by the WHO; and closer cooperation between the WHO and the relevant Commission departments;<p>c)checks to be carried out by independent, coordinated national authorities;<p>d)an information programme for all consumers and socio-economic players concerned, to be drawn up in cooperation with their representative organizations, national health authorities and other independent bodies; and a major food campaign, under the banner of health promotion and disease prevention, focusing on measures to protect against the transmission of BSE.<p>e)the introduction of a special document, indicating origin, diet, and illness, etc., which would accompany each cow through to slaughter. This document should provide the basis for clear, detailed information targeted at the consumer.<p>The Committee asks the Commission to present a draft Directive on cosmetics labelling, similar to the Directive on medicinal products, and for the labelling of all products of ruminant origin, including indication of source and type of feed, and standardization of labelling of cattle feed, with full disclosure of all ingredients including the percentage of each ingredient.<p>The Committee also calls for immediate removal from Council Directive 85/374 (25July 1985) of the exemption for agricultural products and unforeseeable risks.<p>The Committee calls on the Commission to encourage further scientific research into BSE. At EU level, special consideration should be given to the following points:<p>a)Causes of BSE and links with the new strain of CJD. <p>b)Early diagnosis of BSE.<p>c)A research project to monitor the occupational health of workers in any way involved with BSE as part of their employment.<p>The Committee asks the Council, Parliament and Commission to provide European agencies, Community bodies and Community services with the legal, financial and human resources needed to take protective measures against BSE.<p>In addition to the measures already adopted or recommended to help beef farmers and the other sectors affected by the crisis, consideration should be given to support for workers and businesses in sectors and areas losing income as a result of BSE. It is important to consider how such support can be provided in a flexible, fast and effective way.<p>The Committee feels that a special Community initiative could well address this, since it can operate in all those parts of Europe - both urban and rural - affected by the crisis, using all the available structural funds (agricultural, social, regional).<p>Done at Brussels, 10 July 1996<p>The President<p>of the Economic and Social Committee<p>Carlos FERRERActing Secretary-General<p>of the Economic and Social Committee<p>Adriano GRAZIOSI<p>*<p>*          *<p>N.B.:Appendix overleaf<p>APPENDIX<p>to the Opinion of the<p>Economic and Social Committee<p>Defeated amendement<p>During the discussion the following amendement, which was supported by over 25% of the votes cast was defeated.<p>Point 1.4.1.<p>Amend as follows:<p>"Changes in the processing of meat meal have been influenced by deregulation˜" (remainder unchanged).<p>Reason<p>Self-evident.<p>Voting<p>For:34<p>Against:83<p>Abstentions:13<p> WHO/EMC/DIS/96.147<p>OJ C 42 of 15 February 1993<p>OJ L 172 of 7 July 1994, page 23;<p>OJ L 172 of 7 July 1994, page 25; amended by 95/29/EC in OJ L 38 of 18 February 1995, page 17;<p>OJ L 194 of 29 July 1994, page 96; amended by 94/794/EC in OJ L 325 of 17 December 1994, page 60, and by 95/287/EC in OJ L 181 of 1 August 1995, page 40<p>OJ L 78 of 28 March 1996, page 47.<p>For an overview of measures taken by the Commission, see Annex I to the Guide to Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE)-Information for Consumers, published by DG XXIV.<p> COM(96) 78 final<p> For examples of transmission across the "species barrier" observed prior to 1995 see the Supporting Document for the OIE's ("Office International des Epizooties") International Health Code Chapter 3.2.13. on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) (updated May 1996), and references therein.<p>The Lancet, Vol. 347, April 1996<p> "in the absence of surveillance data the status of a country with respect to the occurrence of BSE must be considered as unknown"<p> The Opinion stated that "Based upon current incomplete knowledge regarding BSE and its possible transmission to humans and the uncertainty about the inactivation of the infective agent, the Committee at present is only able to advise that bovine source materials for these products are to be taken only from geographical areas where BSE does not occur in epidemic proportions".

Substances Prohibited From Use in Animal Food or Feed; Animal 
Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed

AGENCY: Food and Drug Administration, HHS.

ACTION: Proposed rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend 
the regulations to provide that animal protein derived from ruminant 
and mink tissues is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use in 
ruminant feed, and is a food additive subject to certain provisions of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). The proposed 
regulations would establish a flexible system of controls, designed to 
ensure that ruminant feed does not contain animal protein derived from 
ruminant and mink tissues in a manner that encourages innovation. FDA 
is also considering alternatives to this proposed ruminant-to-ruminant 
prohibition, and is requesting comment on the relative merits and 
disadvantages of the alternatives. FDA is proposing this action because 
the feeding to ruminants of protein derived from potentially 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)-infective tissues may 
cause TSE in animals. TSE's are progressively degenerative central 
nervous system (CNS) diseases of man and animal that are fatal. 
Epidemiologic evidence gathered in the United Kingdom (U.K.) suggests 
an association between an outbreak of a ruminant TSE, specifically 
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the feeding to cattle of 
protein derived from sheep infected with scrapie, another TSE. Also, 
scientists have postulated that there is an epidemiologic association 
between BSE and a form of human TSE, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
disease (nv-CJD) reported recently in England. BSE has not been 
diagnosed in the United States. However, this proposed rule is intended 
to prevent the establishment and amplification of BSE in cattle in the 
United States, and thereby minimize any risk which might be faced by 
animals and humans.

DATES: Written comments by February 18, 1997. FDA proposes that any 
final rule that may issue based on this proposal become effective 60 
days after the date of its publication in the Federal Register.
    Submit written comments on the collection of information 
requirements by February 18, 1997.

I. Summary

A. Introduction

    In the Federal Register of May 14, 1996 (61 FR 24253), FDA 
published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) that 
solicited information and public comment on the issue of using protein 
derived from ruminants (cattle, sheep, goats, deer, and elk) in 
ruminant feed. The agency requested information and comment on a number 
of issues because it was assessing whether to prohibit the use of 
ruminant protein in ruminant feed. BSE has not been identified in the 
United States. The agency issued an ANPRM because of its concern about 
the possible adverse effect on animal and human health if TSE's were to 
be spread through animal feed. After reviewing the ANPRM comments and 
other sources of information, the agency is proposing to prohibit the 
use of ruminant and mink animal tissue in the feed of ruminants. 
Because TSE has been found in U.S. mink, the agency is also including 
mink tissue in the proposed prohibition. The agency is also considering 
alternatives to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition, 
including the alternative of taking no action.

B. GRAS Status of Ruminant and Mink Tissues

    The agency is proposing to declare that protein derived from tissue 
from ruminant animals and mink is not GRAS, by qualified experts, for 
use in ruminant feed and is therefore a ``food additive'' under the 
law. As a result, because neither a food additive regulation nor an 
exemption is in effect for ruminant and mink tissues intended for 
feeding to ruminants, such tissues would be deemed adulterated. Milk 
and gelatin proteins derived from ruminants, and blood from cattle are 
exempt from the proposed prohibition. The proposed rule does not apply 
to any nonprotein animal tissues such as tallow or other fats.
    Expert opinion that the tissues are GRAS would need to be supported 
by scientific literature, and other sources of data and information, 
establishing that there is a reasonable certainty that the material is 
not harmful under the intended conditions of use. Expert opinion would 
need to address topics such as whether it is reasonably certain that 
BSE does not, or will not, occur in the United States; whether it is 
reasonably certain that the BSE agent will not be transmitted through 
animal feed, i.e., that the processed tissues are not infected by the 
agent, are deactivated by the rendering process or are not transmitted 
orally; and whether it is reasonably certain that the agent will not be 
transmitted to humans through consumption of ruminant products. 
``General recognition'' cannot be based on an absence of studies that 
demonstrate that a substance is unsafe; there must be studies to 
establish that the substance is safe. Also, the burden of establishing 
that substance is GRAS is on the proponent of the substance. See U.S. 
v. An Article of Food * * * Co Co Rico, 752 F.2d 11 (1st Cir. 1985).
    Although the ANPRM did not specifically ask for opinion on the GRAS 
issue, a number of comments from scientific organizations and 
individual scientists strongly suggest that the comments would support 
the view that ruminant and mink tissue is not GRAS when fed to 
ruminants. Some of these comments submitted data and information that 
would support such opinions. Only a few comments included statements by 
scientists, or scientific organizations, to the contrary. Similarly, 
the opinions stated by scientists who spoke during a 1996 symposium on 
TSE's would, in general, support the ``nonGRAS'' position. The 
symposium, ``Tissue Distribution, Inactivation and Transmission of 
Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies,'' was cosponsored by FDA and 
USDA, and was held in Riverdale, MD, on May 13 and 14, 1996.
    FDA has searched for but has not found sufficient literature or 
other sources of data and information that would, on balance, support 
expert opinion that ruminant and mink protein is GRAS as a ruminant 
feed additive. Previous comments on the agency's proposal to prohibit 
the feeding of specified sheep and goat offal (59 FR 44584, August 29, 
1994) did not include either written GRAS opinions from qualified 
experts, or data and information that would support such opinions. The 
relevant data and information, and lack thereof, are discussed more 
fully in this section, and in section II. of this document. See Section 
III.A., of this document, for a further explanation of ``GRAS'' and 
``food additive.''

C. The ``No Action'' Alternative

    Even when, as in this case, FDA has taken steps leading to a 
tentative determination that a substance added to food is not GRAS, the 
agency is not required to issue a proposal declaring that the substance 
is not GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act. 
Section 570.38 provides that the agency may take such an action. The 
agency considered the possibility of not issuing a proposal with regard 
to the feeding of ruminant and mink tissues to ruminants.
    The fact that the data and information do not document an immediate 
threat to the U.S. public health supports this ``no action'' 
alternative. Moreover, certain of the available data and information 
can be used to support the view that the threat, if any, is minimal.
    The evidence suggesting that there is no immediate threat is 
summarized as follows. First, BSE has not been detected in cattle in 
the United States despite an extensive surveillance effort that has 
been in place for several years. Restrictions on the importation of 
cattle, cattle products and feed ingredients from BSE-affected 
countries are in place to minimize the possibility of BSE entering into 
the United States. Surveillance, training of veterinary practitioners 
and diagnosticians, and other efforts are in place to detect any 
occurrence of BSE quickly, and to minimize its spread among the cattle 
population. No empirical scientific evidence is available to establish 
that BSE will occur from any of the possible sources, such as 
transmission from another U.S. species in which TSE's have been 
diagnosed; spontaneous occurrence in cattle; or importation of live 
animals or animal feed products carrying the BSE agent. For example, 
transmission between any two species is difficult to predict, based on 
available data, because of variability in species barriers (Ref. 1).
    Second, even if BSE did develop in the United States there is no 
conclusive scientific evidence that the disease would be spread through 
animal feed, the product that provides FDA's jurisdictional nexis. 
Although there is strong epidemiological evidence that the feeding of 
processed tissue from sheep containing scrapie to cattle caused the 
widespread BSE infections in the United Kingdom, many experts believe 
that the chances that the United States will have a BSE outbreak, 
similar to the epidemic that took place in the United Kingdom, are low. 
For example, most of the industry practices and other conditions 
believed to have been associated with the BSE epidemic in the United 
Kingdom do not exist in the United States. Further, the U.K. 
epidemiological evidence of transfer from sheep to cattle has not been 
confirmed by direct scientific data. This has caused some to question 
the assumption that the BSE originated from scrapie (Ref. 1). Further, 
some

[[<strong>Page</strong> 554]]

experimental information suggests that the TSE's in general are not 
readily transferred by the oral route. Experimentally, the oral route 
has been suggested to be the least efficient means of transmission for 
TSE's (Ref. 1).
    Third, the postulated connection between BSE and CJD has not been 
definitively established. Scientists have theorized an association 
between BSE and the recent appearance of nv-CJD in the United Kingdom. 
While the epidemiological association, both in time and geography, of 
these two diseases in the United Kingdom provides suggestive evidence 
of an association between the two, the available evidence does not 
establish causation. Although the BSE agent has been transmitted to 
laboratory animals, the species barrier between cattle and humans may 
be higher than between cattle and mice (Ref. 1). Epidemiological 
evidence linking BSE with classical CJD is even less supportive. 
Although CJD occurs in the United States, nv-CJD has not been reported 
in this country.
    The FDA's conclusion that there is no immediate threat to the 
public health in the United States is supported by a statement from the 
World Health Organization (WHO) that the ``risk, if any, of exposure to 
the BSE agent in countries other than the U.K. is considered lower than 
in the U.K.'' (Ref. 2). A number of comments to the ANPRM made a 
similar assertion, urging that FDA's regulatory decision be made on the 
basis of scientific information and contending that the available 
information did not support the contemplated action.

D. The Basis for the Agency's Proposed Action

1. General Discussion
    Even though there is no immediate threat to the U.S. public health 
and some information that indicates that a threat, if any, is minimal, 
after careful consideration the agency has tentatively concluded that 
regulatory action is necessary to protect animal and human health. The 
agency has reached that tentative conclusion because there is a growing 
body of data and information that affirmatively raises public health 
concerns.
    The data and information raise concern that BSE could occur in 
cattle in the United States; and that if BSE does appear in this 
country, the causative agent could be transmitted and amplified through 
the feeding of processed ruminant protein to cattle, and could result 
in an epidemic. The agency believes that the high cost, in animal and 
human lives and economics, that could result if this scenario should 
occur, justifies the preventive measure reflected by the proposed 
regulation. Although the agency expects some continued voluntary 
reduction in the feeding of ruminant and mink tissues to ruminants, the 
reduction is not expected to be extensive enough to obviate the need 
for mandatory preventive measures.
    Statements from several prominent public and animal health 
organizations support this proposal to regulate the feeding of ruminant 
tissues to ruminant animals. For example, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) has urged the agency to adopt a ruminant-
to-ruminant feed prohibition (Ref. 3), and USDA has recommended the 
same action. Although WHO considers the risk in countries such as the 
United States to be minimal, that organization has nevertheless called 
on all countries to prohibit the use of ruminant tissues in ruminant 
feed (Ref. 2).
    A number of comments to the ANPRM, including comments by several 
consumer groups, supported regulatory action by FDA. The Pharmaceutical 
Research and Manufacturers of America urged FDA to take all necessary 
steps to prevent an outbreak of BSE, and to prevent the potential 
spread of BSE should a case occur in the United States. One 
pharmaceutical firm emphasized the importance of acknowledging public 
perception, stating that a ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition would 
``significantly decrease the concern regarding this perceived risk.'' 
Another pharmaceutical firm characterized the risk as ``small but 
real.'' A group of livestock producers, veterinary associations and 
scientific organizations cited the WHO recommendations to support their 
call for a voluntary ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition. The group stated 
that such a prohibition would ``eliminate any risk, no matter how 
remote [and would] totally prevent BSE from ever occurring in the 
United States.''
    The agency is concerned about the public health issues raised but 
not resolved by the available scientific information. The fact that the 
causative agent or agents for TSE's have not been clearly identified, 
and their transmissibility has not been fully characterized, adds to 
the concern. However, certain information that is well documented 
supports the agency's decision as well. TSE's are 100-percent fatal 
diseases that have been diagnosed in humans and a number of animal 
species. The diseases are progressively degenerative CNS diseases that 
are characterized by a relatively short clinical course of neurological 
signs. TSE's have a prolonged incubation period, i.e., 2 to 8 years in 
animals, and scientific evidence supports the view that TSE's can be 
transmitted in the preclinical stage. There is no practical method to 
detect the presence of TSE's during the preclinical stage.
2. Analysis of Risk Factors
    This section describes the evidence that supports the agency's 
tentative conclusion. The evidence relates to the risks that BSE could 
occur in cattle in the United States; that the BSE agent or other TSE 
agents could be amplified in the cattle population by the feeding of 
ruminant and mink tissues to cattle; and that the agent could 
potentially be transmitted to humans.
    a. The risk of BSE occurring in the United States. BSE has not been 
diagnosed in the United States. FDA does not have evidence to support 
the theory that BSE already exists, undiagnosed, in this country. 
However, the agency does find plausible the arguments of the theory 
that BSE could develop in the United States from three possible 
sources: Transmission of TSE's from other susceptible species, 
spontaneous occurrence, and importation in live animals or animal 
products.
    The evidence concerning transmission from other species is 
summarized as follows. TSE's other than BSE have been diagnosed in 
animals in the United States. These include scrapie in sheep and goats, 
transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME), and chronic wasting disease 
(CWD) in deer and elk. Feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) has been 
diagnosed in cats in other countries. In general, the TSE's have been 
shown to be naturally transmissible within species and are believed by 
some scientists to be naturally transmissible (as distinguished from 
experimentally transmissible), at least to a limited extent, between 
species. Consumption of meat and bone meal (the predominant animal 
tissue-containing product fed to animals) which was produced under 
conditions similar to the meat and bone meal which was implicated in 
the U.K. BSE epidemic, as well as the feeding of raw bovine tissue, 
also appeared to cause TSE in exotic cats and various zoo animals. This 
implies that the species barrier for BSE may be uncharacteristically 
low. (See e.g., Refs. 3 and 4). In addition to the epidemiological 
evidence relating to TSE transmission from sheep to cattle in the 
United Kingdom, there is limited experimental evidence of transmission

[[<strong>Page</strong> 555]]

of the BSE agent from cattle to sheep. Many laboratory animal species 
have also been experimentally infected following the administration of 
tissues from animals with TSE disease.
    There is some evidence to support the theory that BSE can occur 
spontaneously in cattle. The leading theory as to the causative agent, 
e.g., infectious protein or prion, inherently suggests that the BSE 
could occur spontaneously. Additional support arises from the fact that 
85 percent of CJD cases are sporadic, and have no familial or 
identifiable link as to their cause. Recent surveillance information 
from Northern Ireland and Switzerland also supports the spontaneous 
theory. In these countries, BSE has occurred in cases in which no 
exposure to rendered protein can be found, and there is no evidence of 
BSE in the parental stock or herd mates of affected animals (Ref. 5).
    As described more fully in section II.F.1.b. of this document, 
USDA-APHIS has implemented import restrictions on live animals and 
animal products from BSE-affected countries. As a result of the 
restrictions, the potential risk of BSE occurring in this country as a 
result of exposure from imported cattle and imported animal protein 
products appears to be small (Ref. 6). However, the risk from foreign 
sources of BSE introduction into the United States cannot be dismissed 
entirely because the USDA import restrictions are unlikely to be 100 
percent effective even though no cases of BSE have been diagnosed to 
date in the United States. The USDA regulations are intended to reduce 
or control risk, not completely eliminate it. See e.g., 56 FR 63866, 
December 6, 1991.
    b. The risk of amplification in the cattle population. Research has 
shown that various animal tissues can transmit BSE infectivity. There 
is also evidence supporting the view that the agent could be 
transmitted orally (e.g., through animal feed). Although some 
experimental evidence suggests that the TSE's in general are more 
readily transmitted by means other that the oral route, research also 
suggests that the BSE agent is more susceptible to oral transmission. 
In most cases (e.g., the U.K. epidemic) the natural route of exposure 
to TSE's including BSE is suspected to be oral. This belief is 
supported by the dramatic decline in BSE cases in the United Kingdom 
following implementation of the ruminant-to-ruminant feeding 
prohibition. In the United Kingdom, where more than 160,000 cases of 
BSE have been diagnosed, a 1988 ban on the feeding of ruminant-derived 
protein supplements to other ruminants was associated with a steady 
decrease in the disease incidence starting in 1993. The 5-year period 
between the initiation of the ruminant-to-ruminant ban and the decline 
in the incidence of BSE is consistent with the known incubation period 
in cattle of 2 to 8 years. Further, preliminary experimental data show 
that the BSE agent can be transmitted orally to cattle through feeding 
of material from an infected cow (Ref. 3). Thus, there is a chance that 
BSE could be spread in animal feed if it developed in the U.S. cattle 
population, whether spontaneously, from another species or by some 
other means.
    The greatest risk factor for cattle may not be the single 
occurrence of a BSE case. Instead, the greatest risk may arise from the 
potential, given the prolonged incubation period, for unrecognized 
amplification of BSE in the cattle population, resulting in a potential 
for greater animal exposure. The possibility of risk from recycling 
ruminant tissues is enhanced by the fact that current rendering methods 
have not been shown, and are not expected, to completely deactivate the 
BSE agent, and that practical tests are not available for detecting 
either the BSE agent in rendered material or the presence of ruminant 
material in feed.
    The preliminary experimental cow-to-cow TSE transmission data 
previously described occurred with as little as a single dose (one-time 
exposure) of 1 gram of brain material from the infected cow, indicating 
a low transmitting dose. This means, among other things, that FDA 
cannot determine the level of feed ingredients from animals tissues, if 
any, that is considered safe in ruminants.
    c. The risk of transmission of humans. Finally, there exists the 
theoretical possibility of the transmission of a TSE in animals, such 
as BSE, to humans. CDC agrees that the link between BSE, and TSE's in 
humans, has not been fully demonstrated. Some of the ANPRM comments 
agreed. For example, one pharmaceutical firm stated that the evidence 
is not entirely conclusive. Nevertheless, a body of epidemiological and 
experimental evidence is developing to support the postulated 
association between BSE and nv-CJD. This and other scientific evidence 
developed more fully in section II leads the agency to propose for 
comment the prudent risk reduction regulatory action that is 
incorporated in the proposed rule.

E. Enforcement Provisions

    The agency is issuing this proposed rule within the context of 
comprehensive government-wide efforts to minimize the risks previously 
described, and within the statutory authority provided to the agency. 
The proposed rule has two major components. First, the agency proposes 
to prohibit feeding animal materials derived from ruminant and mink 
tissues to ruminants, in the absence of a food additive regulation or 
investigational exemption. Thus, the prohibition would ensure that 
tissues which could contribute to a TSE epidemic by spreading the 
causative agent rapidly would not be allowed in ruminant feed.
    The second component of the rule provides for a system of controls 
to ensure that the proposed rule would achieve its intended purpose. 
These provisions are necessary because limited controls are in place, 
or available, to prevent the spread of BSE through animal feed in the 
United States, should BSE occur. The proposed regulation places two 
general requirements on persons that manufacture, blend, process and 
distribute animal protein products, and feeds made from such products. 
The first requirement is to place cautionary labeling on the protein 
and feed products. The second is to provide FDA with access to sales 
and purchase invoices, for compliance purposes.
    Firms that handle animal protein products from both ruminant and 
nonruminant sources, and that intend to keep the two kinds of products 
separate, would have certain additional requirements. These 
requirements would relate to the need for separate facilities or 
cleanout procedures; the need for standard operating procedures 
(SOP's); and in the case of renderers, their source of nonruminant 
material. Similar requirements would be placed on firms that handle 
animal feed containing animal protein products from both ruminant and 
nonruminant sources, and intend to keep the two kinds of feed separate. 
Requirements would be greater for the firms that intend to separate the 
animal protein products and feeds, because of the greater risk these 
operations would present for the possibility that ruminant protein 
might be fed, inadvertently, to ruminants.
    However, the regulatory system would be flexible, allowing the 
regulated firms to innovate and choose the most cost-effective means of 
compliance. For example, some or all of the regulatory requirements 
previously described would not apply if any of the following 
innovations were developed and validated by FDA: Processing methods 
that deactivate the agent that causes BSE; test methods to detect the 
presence of the agent; or methods of marking or otherwise identifying 
the

[[<strong>Page</strong> 556]]

material that contains ruminant protein. Further, the agency will 
consider modifying or revoking any final rule that is published 
prohibiting the use of ruminant and mink tissues in ruminant feed, if 
scientific and technical advances permit even greater flexibility than 
that offered in the proposed regulation. Conversely, the diagnosis of 
one or more cases of BSE in the United States, or new scientific 
findings, could lead to stricter regulatory requirements.

F. Alternatives

    The agency is soliciting comments on several alternative means of 
minimizing the risk of transmitting TSE's in ruminant feed, in addition 
to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition. These alternatives 
include:
    (1) A partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition which would exclude 
all ruminant and mink tissues from ruminant feed except those bovine 
tissues that have not been found to present a risk of transmitting 
spongiform encephalopathy. Possible exclusions include slaughter 
byproducts from cattle that have been inspected and passed in inspected 
slaughter facilities, except tissues that have been shown through 
experimental trials and bioassays to transmit spongiform 
encephalopathy. Examples of the latter might include the brain, eyes, 
spinal cord and distal ileum. The agency solicits comments on the scope 
of this alternative;
    (2) A prohibition on the feeding of all mammalian tissues to 
ruminants;
    (3) A prohibition on the feeding of rendered material from those 
animal species in which TSE's have been diagnosed in the United States 
(sheep, goats, mink, elk, and deer);
    (4) A prohibition on the feeding of specified offal from adult 
sheep and goats as proposed in 1994;
    (5) Other alternative approaches that meet the agency's regulatory 
objectives and that might be suggested in comments to the proposed 
rule. The agency may in any final rule issued adopt such alternative 
approaches. Such alternatives may be more or less stringent than this 
proposal or may be a combination of provisions from this proposal and 
other alternatives. For example, one such option might be a proposal to 
exclude from the scope of any regulation certain facilities that apply 
specified risk-reduction measures in addition to, or in place of, those 
included in the regulation FDA is proposing in this publication. 
Therefore, the agency specifically requests comments on other 
approaches that would achieve the agency's regulatory objectives. Any 
proposed alternative approaches should be explained in detail, and 
their justification should be well documented. To the extent possible, 
please include information on costs and benefits of the proposals; and
    (6) The ``no action'' alternative as it relates to this proposed 
rule. Again, detailed explanation and well-documented justification 
should be presented.
    The agency's views on the advantages and disadvantages of these 
options appears in section V of this document. The agency invites 
comments on the relative merits and disadvantages of all these 
alternative concepts.
    FDA has estimated that the annualized costs of the proposal, 
comprised of both the direct compliance costs and various indirect 
gains and losses, would range from $21.4 to $48.2 million. The agency 
also estimated that the annualized costs could range from $45.0 to 
$56.5 million for the mammalian-to-ruminant option; from $28.5 to $37.3 
million for the partial ruminant-to-ruminant option; and would total 
less than $10 million for each of the remaining options. On the other 
hand, if the agency chooses the ``no action'' option and a BSE epidemic 
occurs, the above costs could be expanded by a great magnitude.
    Because the body of scientific research related to TSE's is growing 
rapidly, the agency will place in the Docket copies of relevant 
scientific literature published after the agency completes work on this 
proposal, and before the agency completes work on any final regulation. 
The agency will add to the Docket, as appropriate, a brief statement of 
its assessment of the significance of the literature, and will invite 
comments. However, substantive changes from the proposed rule would be 
made in accordance with the discussions in the preceding paragraphs and 
the Administrative Procedure Act.

II. Background

A. TSE's

1. Scrapie
    Scrapie is a slowly progressive, transmissible disease of the CNS 
in sheep and goats. Scrapie is characterized by a prolonged incubation 
period averaging 2 years, followed by a clinical course of 2 to 6 
months when the animal exhibits sensory and motor malfunction, 
hyperexcitability, and death. The agent presumably moves from infected 
to susceptible animals by direct or indirect contact and enters through 
the gastrointestinal tract. Consequently, its spread appears to be both 
vertical (mother to offspring in utero) (Ref. 7) and horizontal (direct 
contact) between sheep (Ref. 8). Early signs of scrapie include subtle 
changes in behavior or temperament which may be followed by scratching 
and rubbing against fixed objects. Other signs include loss of 
coordination, weight loss despite a good appetite, biting of feet and 
limbs, tremor around head and neck, and unusual walking habits (Ref. 
9).
    The scrapie agent is found in lymphatic tissue (spleen, thymus, 
tonsil, and lymph nodes) in sheep with preclinical infections; however, 
in clinically affected sheep, the agent is identified in the 
intestines, nervous tissues (brain and spinal cord), and lymphatic 
tissues as determined by experimental infectivity studies in a 
susceptible animal model (Ref. 8). The brain has been demonstrated to 
have the highest level of infectivity of all tissues (Ref. 10).
    Scrapie is known to have existed in Britain, Ireland, France, and 
Germany for over 200 years. It has been observed in the United States 
and Canada for about 50 years. The first case of scrapie in the United 
States was diagnosed in Michigan in 1947. From 1947 through January 
1993, approximately 653 flocks have been diagnosed with scrapie (Ref. 
11). At the present time, there are 67 known scrapie-infected flocks 
(flocks with sheep diagnosed with scrapie), and there are 8 known 
scrapie-source flocks (flocks to which scrapie-infected sheep were 
traced) (Ref. 12). In the absence of an antemortem diagnostic test, it 
is not possible to establish with absolute certainty that a flock is 
free of scrapie. Moreover, lack of reporting, the long incubation 
period, and open range husbandry practices in the western United States 
make it difficult to detect classical clinical signs and completely 
monitor scrapie in the United States.
2. BSE
    BSE is a transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative disease of 
the CNS of adult cattle. This disease has a prolonged incubation period 
in cattle following oral exposure (2 to 8 years) and is always fatal. 
BSE is characterized by abnormalities of behavior, sensation, posture, 
and gait. These signs are similar to those seen in sheep that are 
infected with scrapie. BSE is associated with spongiform lesions in the 
gray matter neuropil of the brainstem and neuronal vacuolization (Ref. 
13). The clinical signs usually begin with changes in animal behavior, 
and may include separation from the rest of the herd while at pasture, 
disorientation, or excessive licking of the nose or flanks (Ref. 14). 
The most common history given by the herdsman was nervousness

[[<strong>Page</strong> 557]]

or altered behavior or temperament, weakness associated with pelvic 
limb ataxia, paresis, and loss of body weight (Ref. 15). In some 
animals there are few gross pathological changes at necropsy associated 
with BSE other than the loss of body weight. However, postmortem 
histopathology of BSE distinguish it from other neurological disorders 
(Refs. 16 and 17). Neither vertical nor horizontal transmission has 
been documented for BSE.
    BSE was first recognized as a new cattle disease by researchers at 
the Central Veterinary Laboratory of the British Ministry of 
Agriculture, Fisheries, and Foods at Weybridge, England in November 
1986. As of November 15, 1996, BSE had been diagnosed in Great Britain 
in more than 165,000 head of cattle from more than 31,000 herds. Cases 
have been confirmed in 59.2 percent of the dairy herds and 15.3 percent 
of the beef herds (Ref. 18). The BSE epidemic curve for Great Britain 
peaked in January 1993 and is decreasing steadily, concomitantly with 
changes in rendering and feeding practices. BSE has also been reported 
in native cattle of Northern Ireland, Guernsey, Jersey, Isle of Man, 
the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, France, and Portugal. BSE has 
been confirmed in cattle exported from Great Britain to Oman, the 
Falkland Islands, Germany, Denmark, Canada, and Italy.
    There have been no cases of BSE in cattle in the United States. 
There has been one case of BSE in a cow imported into Canada from Great 
Britain. That cow was destroyed, along with its herdmates and other 
nearby cattle considered by animal health authorities in Canada to have 
possibly been exposed to the cow with BSE (Ref. 19).
3. Other Animal TSE's
    Other animals have TSE's with typical characteristics of long 
incubation, neurological degeneration, and a 100-percent death rate. 
These animals include: Mink, elk and deer, zoo ruminants, and exotic 
and domestic cats.
    TME is a mink disease with clinical signs and brain lesions similar 
to those of sheep infected with scrapie. TME is a rare disease in the 
United States. Since the disease was first recognized in 1947, in 
Wisconsin, four additional outbreaks have occurred in the United 
States. The last outbreak occurred in 1985 and was limited to a single 
mink ranch in Wisconsin (Ref. 20).
    CWD of deer and elk is characterized by emaciation, changes in 
behavior and excessive salivation, polydipsia, and polyuria. The 
clinical course is from several weeks to 8 months, and the disease is 
invariably fatal (Ref. 20). From 1967 to 1979, CWD was observed in 53 
captive mule deer in Colorado and Wyoming. Clinical signs were seen in 
adult deer and included behavioral alterations, progressive weight loss 
and death in 2 weeks to 8 months. Consistent histopathologic change was 
limited to the CNS and characterized by widespread spongiform 
transformation of the neuropil. The disease is a specific, 
spontaneously occurring form of spongiform encephalopathy (Ref. 21). 
Topographic distribution and lesion severity were most similar to those 
of scrapie and BSE. The duration of the clinical disease did not 
significantly influence lesion distribution or severity in either 
species (Ref. 22).
    Scrapie-like encephalopathies have been described in certain zoo 
ruminants, i.e., a nyala, an Arabian oryx, and a greater kudu. Clinical 
signs included ataxia and loss of coordination with a short, 
progressive clinical course. Histopathological examination of the 
brains revealed spongiform encephalopathy characteristic of that 
observed in scrapie and BSE (Refs. 23, 24, and 25). Strain typing of 
the agent suggests that all of the cases are directly related to BSE.
    Seventy domestic cats in the United Kingdom have developed FSE, a 
spongiform encephalopathy that was never previously reported. The cats 
all had progressive, neurological disease involving locomotor 
disturbances, abnormal behavior and, in most cases, altered sensory 
responses. Histopathological examination of the central nervous system 
revealed changes pathognomonic of spongiform encephalopathy; this 
included widespread vacuolization of the gray matter neuropil and 
neuronal perikarya (Refs. 26 and 27). Infective tissue from several of 
these cases, when injected into mice, resulted in brain lesions with a 
distribution and morphology that is undistinguishable from the lesions 
produced by BSE infective tissue injected into mice.
4. TSE's of Humans
    The TSE's of humans are divided into specific clinical types, which 
may appear similar histopathologically but are either transmitted 
differently or demonstrate different patterns of distribution and 
prevalence.
    a. CJD. CJD was first described in 1920 and 1921 when it was known 
as ``spastic pseudosclerosis'' or ``subacute spongiform 
encephalopathy'' (Ref. 28). The illness exists throughout the world and 
is claimed to have a similar prevalence in each of the countries tested 
with an annual incidence of approximately one case per million of the 
population. Autopsies are sometimes not performed on persons who may 
have died of CJD and many older people dying of a dementing illness do 
not have autopsies performed. There is an increased incidence among 
Libyan Jews (26 cases per million) and spatial or temporal clusters in 
areas of Slovakia, Hungary, England, the United States, and Chile. The 
average age of a typical CJD victim is 56 years of age, and only a few 
cases involving persons between 4 and 29 years have been reported prior 
to 1993. Between 4 and 15 percent of cases have a familial connection 
with other cases. There is a slightly higher incidence of CJD in women 
compared to men. Clinical prodromal symptoms start with changes in 
sleeping and eating patterns, and often include confusion, 
inappropriate behavior, vague visual complaints and/or ataxia. Those 
symptoms progress over a few weeks to a clearly neurological syndrome. 
A rapid onset of neurological symptoms appears in 20 percent of cases, 
most commonly myoclonic jerks and dementia with loss of higher brain 
function and behavioral abnormalities. The disease progresses with 
continued deterioration in cerebral and cerebellar function, and the 
onset of seizures. Ninety percent of the cases end in death within 1 
year of onset. Diagnosis is by clinical assessment of patients and by 
examination of electroencephalogram patterns. Post mortem diagnosis is 
currently carried out by histological examination of cerebral tissue 
under the light microscope, although this is not always reliable. 
Research techniques that have been used to demonstrate CJD (and other 
TSE's) include electron microscopic examination of brain tissue 
extracts for scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF), immuno-staining of the 
tissue for prion-protein (PrP) antigens, western blotting of extracted 
PrP antigens and the intracerebral injection of tissue suspensions into 
test animals.
    In some patients, the source of CJD has been claimed to be an 
infection transferred from other patients with the condition. For 
example, in one case, cerebral electrodes that had been sterilized with 
alcohol and formalin vapor after use in a patient with CJD, were used 
in the brains of two young epileptic patients, both of whom contracted 
CJD after a short incubation. The transfer of CJD by corneal transplant 
in 1 patient, by cadaveric dura mater grafts in several patients and by 
pituitary-derived human growth hormone injections in over 80 patients 
has also been reported.

    Only the medical procedures described previously have been 
conclusively linked to transmission. The transmission of the disease 
from animal sources has been suggested; see further discussion in 
section II.C. of this document.
    b. nv-CJD. A previously undetected new variant of CJD (nv-CJD) was 
reported by British scientists at a meeting of international experts 
convened by WHO on April 2 and 3, 1996 (Ref. 29), and published 3 days 
later (Ref. 30).
    The major evidence for the existence of nv-CJD is the recognition 
of a new neuropathologic profile and the unusually young ages of 10 
U.K. patients. Although all the cases had evidence of the pathognomonic 
spongiform changes characteristic of classic CJD, and therefore were 
appropriately classified as a form of CJD, the clinical course of the 
disease was atypical of classic CJD. The most striking and consistent 
neuropathologic feature of nv-CJD was the formation of amyloid plaques 
surrounded by halos of spongiform change. Plaques were extensively 
distributed throughout the cerebrum and cerebellum. Many of these 
plaques resembled those in kuru and were visible when examined by 
routine staining methods.
    The temporal cluster of cases of nv-CJD in young patients (three 
were teenagers, five were in their twenties, and two were in their 
thirties at onset of disease) is highly unusual. Five of the eight 
deceased patients died before 30 years of age. (The expected annual 
mortality rate for CJD in persons under 30 years of age is less than 
five per billion.) The characteristic clinical features of the nv-CJD 
cases were: (1) A psychiatric presentation, (2) onset of a progressive 
cerebellum syndrome with ataxia within weeks or months of the initial 
presentation, (3) memory impairment with dementia in the late stages, 
(4) myoclonus, and (5) the absence of electroencephalographic changes 
typical of classic CJD.
    Review of the patients' medical histories and consideration of 
various risk factors for CJD yielded no adequate clues as to the cause 
of this disease. The PrP genotype was determined for eight cases. The 
researchers noted that all genotypes were methionine homozygotes at 
codon 129 of the PrP gene. The research did not identify any of the 
known mutations associated with the inherited forms of CJD (Ref. 30).
    Although scientists have stated that exposure to the BSE agent 
prior to the U.K. bans described in section II.F. of this document is 
the most plausible explanation for these findings, no clear 
epidemiologic link to BSE was identified. (See further discussion in 
section II.C. of this document.) Another potential explanation is 
exposure to TSE agents from animals other than cattle. Because the 
United Kingdom reinstituted epidemiological surveillance for CJD in 
1990, increased surveillance is still another potential reason for the 
identification of this cluster of 10 cases of nv-CJD.
    c. Gertsmann-Strausller-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome. GSS syndrome is 
an autosomal dominant condition in about 50 percent of siblings of 
reference cases (Ref. 28). The disease is similar to CJD except that it 
has a more extended onset and duration, a tendency towards cerebellar 
ataxia as the initial predominant neurological sign, and a large number 
of amyloid plaques present among the spongiform encephalopathic changes 
of the brain. The extensive distribution of amyloid plaques in the 
patient's brain is an observation shared by GSS syndrome and v-CJD. It 
has been transmitted to monkeys and rodents by intracerebral 
inoculation.
    d. Kuru. Kuru is a condition of the Fore people of the Okapa 
district of the Eastern Highland in Papua New Guinea, in which a 
practice of ritual cannibalism of fellow tribesmen took place until 
approximately 1956 (Ref. 28). This TSE disease, which affected mainly 
adult women and children of both sexes, caused an annual disease 
specific mortality of approximately 3 percent. Most deaths of women in 
the tribe occurred through this disease. Some men who died from this 
disease were thought to have contracted it when they were young. Kuru 
may be transmitted by eating infected tissue or through open wounds. 
The brains of dead tribal members were eaten by women and children and 
the muscle tissue by men. The cohort of children born since 1957 have 
not suffered from kuru at all.
    Clinically the disease causes a progressive cerebellar ataxia, 
uncoordinated movements, neurological weakness, palsies, and decay in 
brain stem function. Most patients dying of kuru are not demented, a 
major clinical difference between kuru and CJD.
    e. Fatal familial insomnia (FFI). FFI is another inherited TSE-
linked disease (Ref. 31). FFI is characterized clinically by 
untreatable progressive insomnia, dysautonomia, and motor dysfunctions. 
The disease often starts between 35 and 60 years of age and leads to 
death within 7 to 32 months. FFI is characterized pathologically by 
atrophy, neuronal loss, and gliosis in the anterior and dorsomedial 
nuclei of the thalamus (Ref. 32). FFI has been successfully transmitted 
to mice (Ref. 33), but not to primates.
5. Etiology
    The cause of TSE's is controversial. The TSE agent: (1) Is 
presumably smaller than most viral particles and is highly resistant to 
heat, ultraviolet light, ionizing radiation, and common disinfectants 
that normally inactivate viruses or bacteria; (2) causes little 
detectable immune or inflammatory response in the host; and (3) has not 
been observed microscopically.
    Resistance of the TSE agent to physical and chemical methods that 
destroy nucleic acid have essentially ruled out conventional 
microbiological agents as the cause. Currently, the infectious protein 
or prion theory is favored. Other proposed causes are an unconventional 
virus, consisting of virus-coded protein and virus-specific nucleic 
acid with unconventional properties, and a ``virino'' consisting of a 
core of nontranslated nucleic acid associated with host cell proteins 
(Ref. 34). Proposed causes of TSE's with less supporting evidence are: 
(1) Retroviruses (Ref. 35), (2) a spiroplasma (Refs. 36 and 37), (3) 
organophosphates (Ref. 38), and (4) peptide hormones (Ref. 39).
    The prion theory suggests that the causative agent is a normal host 
protein (PrP or PrP-C) that is posttranslationally transformed into the 
causative agent or PrP-Sc. Transformation of the PrP can occur from 
rare somatic mutation of the prion gene, spontaneously or from contact 
with extraneous PrP-Sc. The spread of BSE in the United Kingdom is 
postulated to have occurred through the feeding of ruminant protein 
that contained the PrP-Sc protein and thus follows the portion of the 
theory that involves contact with extraneous PrP-Sc. This explanation 
requires that one accept that abnormal prion protein from sheep crossed 
the species barrier and resulted in BSE in cattle. An alternate 
explanation is that a spontaneous mutation or transformation or other 
nonorally induced event, occurred and resulted in undetected disease in 
a bovine. These explanations are not mutually exclusive and it is 
possible that both occurred.
    Recent surveillance information from Northern Ireland and 
Switzerland tend to support the spontaneous mutation as a method by 
which BSE can occur. Northern Ireland has had more than 10 cows produce 
offspring, after the feeding ban, that developed BSE. Thus, 10+ cases 
are theorized to be spontaneous because there is no evidence of feeding 
meat and bone meal to the offspring and the dams are alive

[[<strong>Page</strong> 559]]

and show no signs of BSE (Ref. 5). Switzerland, which has one of the 
most aggressive BSE investigational surveillance of any European Union 
(EU) country, has reported 205 cases of BSE. Some of these cases are in 
animals that were fed only grass and hay (Ref. 5). Regardless of how 
the initial cases occurred, however, the resulting unrecognized disease 
was amplified by the feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants.
    Additional support for the feasibility of the TSE spontaneous 
mutation explanation is the fact that 85 percent of all CJD cases are 
sporadic and have no familial or identifiable link as to their cause. 
It is these cases that give rise to the very stable, 1 in a million per 
year, world wide incidence of the disease. DeArmond and Prusiner (Ref. 
40), and Lansbury and Caughey (Ref. 41) have postulated that a 
noninduced somatic cell mutation or the spontaneous conversion of PrP-C 
into PrP-Sc are plausible explanations for the sporadic cases of CJD. 
DeArmond and Prusiner theorized that the 1 in a million

    * * * may represent the combined probabilities that a mutation 
occurs in the PRNP gene, the probability that the mutation leads to 
the synthesis of the PrP-cjd (the abnormal protein), and the 
probability that the resultant PrP-cjd targets other neurons for the 
synthesis of more PrP-cjd at a rate fast enough to cause clinical 
disease in the patient's lifetime.

    The etiology of human and animal TSE's are similar. Therefore the 
spontaneous mutation explanation cannot be dismissed with regard to 
BSE.
6. Pathogenesis
    Following oral exposure of goats or sheep to the scrapie agent, the 
agent first accumulates in gut-associated lymphoid organs (tonsils and 
Peyers patches of terminal ileum) and later in other lymphoid organs, 
such as spleen and thymus, and finally in the spinal cord and brain 
(Ref. 8).
    Likewise, in mice inoculated intra-peritoneally with the CJD agent, 
the agent localizes first in Peyer's patches and spleen, followed by 
the central nervous system (Ref. 42). The agent may enter the body 
through macrophages in the tonsils and domes over Peyer's patches in 
the intestine (distal ileum). The proposed routes of spread from the 
point of entry to other tissues and central nervous system are blood 
stream or nerve trunks. In experimentally inoculated animals, spread 
from the inoculation site in the eye of monkeys and peritoneum of mice 
has been shown to be by optic and splanchnic nerves respectively (Ref. 
43).
    Other investigators have demonstrated transient infectivity in the 
blood of experimentally infected laboratory animals, and naturally 
occurring infections of humans and mink, causing speculation that the 
agent is carried in the blood (Refs. 45 to 49). With one exception in 
serum (Ref. 50), all attempts to isolate TSE agents from the blood or 
milk of sheep or cattle have failed (Refs. 51 to 54). When TSE agents 
are injected intravenously into mice, the rate of clearance from the 
blood is extremely rapid (Ref. 55). In natural cases of BSE, 
infectivity has been found only in the brain, spinal cord, and eye; in 
experimental cases the agent has also been identified in the ileum 
(Ref. 56).
    The question of disease mechanism remains open. Candidate 
mechanisms are the storage or accumulation of a large amount of 
abnormal PrP in the brain (Refs. 57 to 60), or insufficient amounts of 
normal PrP.
7. Transmission
    There is little information about the natural transmission of TSE's 
of animals. In most cases the natural route of exposure to the TSE 
agent is suspected to be oral, although genetic disposition is known to 
play a role in sheep scrapie (Ref. 61). Investigators have suspected 
transmission of scrapie in sheep and goats by ingestion of placenta and 
have been successful in experimentally transmitting scrapie by feeding 
placenta to sheep (Ref. 62); however, genotyping of the PrP gene was 
not conducted.
    In 1993, a study by Foster, et al., (Ref. 63) using a line of sheep 
in which natural scrapie does not occur demonstrated that sheep can be 
experimentally infected with BSE by intracerebral or oral 
administration. The intracerebral challenge resulted in five of six 
sheep developing the disease. The oral challenge resulted in one of six 
sheep developing the disease. Brain and spleen were recovered from the 
orally infected sheep and from one of the intracerebrally injected 
sheep. Goldmann, et al. (Ref. 64), confirmed that both sheep had the 
same PrP genotype. In 1996, Foster, et al. (Ref. 65) reported the 
results of injecting homogenized tissue harvested from these infected 
animals into a panel of mice. Transmission from the brains and spleen 
of both sheep gave incubation periods and pathology in mice similar to 
those seen in direct BSE transmissions from cattle to mice. Foster's 
work supports the position that BSE can cross species barriers by the 
oral route and that, when judged by the mouse bioassay, the disease 
manifested in sheep retains the incubation time and pathology 
characteristic of BSE rather than scrapie. However, the manifestation 
of BSE in the sheep is histopathologically and clinically 
indistinguishable from natural scrapie.
    Information regarding the interaction of the TSE agents and the 
environment is limited. In 1964, Gordon reported the transmission of 
scrapie among bands of unrelated sheep on pasture. The mode of 
transmission was unknown (Ref. 66). In an effort to eradicate scrapie 
from Iceland a large area was depopulated of sheep and restocked with 
new sheep following a period of 3 years. Despite this effort, a few 
flocks of the new sheep developed scrapie; the origin was believed to 
be from scrapie that survived in the environment and not from 
reintroduction of the agent with the new sheep or through contaminated 
hay remaining on farms. However, a 1996 report suggests that six 
species of hay mites may be potential vectors associated with 
transmission of TSE's in Iceland (Ref. 67).
8. Genetics
    There is a genetic component associated with several of the human 
TSE diseases. A specific point mutation at codon 178 is associated with 
fatal familial insomnia (Ref. 68). Point mutations at codons 102, 105, 
117, 145, 198, and 217 are associated with GSS syndrome (Ref. 69). 
Point mutations at codons 178, 180, 200, 210, and 232 are associated 
with CJD (Refs. 68 and 70). Various insertions into the octapeptide 
repeat region of the PrP gene have also been associated with human 
TSE's (Ref. 71). It appears that the methionine/valine polymorphism at 
codon 129 may modify the phenotype and the transmission rate from GSS 
syndrome patients to mice (Ref. 72). No abnormalities in the sequence 
of the PrP gene in kuru patients were found.
    There is also a genetic component associated with sheep scrapie. 
Point mutations at codon 171 of the sheep PrP gene are linked to the 
disease in the Corriedale, Lacaune, Romanov, Suffolk, and Texel breeds 
(Refs. 73 to 76).
    An analysis of 370 cattle from Scotland revealed no difference 
between healthy cattle and cattle with BSE in the number of octapeptide 
repeat sequences (either five or six) and in a silent HindII 
restriction site polymorphism on the PrP gene (Ref. 77). No data were 
found that compared the sequence of the PrP gene of healthy deer, elk, 
mink, and goats with those afflicted by TSE's.
9. Diagnostics
    Because of the long incubation period, the ability to diagnose the 
presence of a BSE infection prior to the onset of the

[[<strong>Page</strong> 560]]

clinical disease would enhance the efficacy of surveillance and 
prevention programs. Because there is no fully characterized immune 
response to BSE or scrapie, diagnosis in live animals has been thought 
to be possible only when clinical signs are evident and must be 
confirmed by histopathology at post mortem (Ref. 10), or brain biopsy 
of moribund patients. Recently published research suggests antemortem 
tests for the TSE agent may be possible.
    The observation of histopathological changes in the brain, such as 
vacuolization of the brainstem in BSE are positive indicators of 
disease (Ref. 78). Other available diagnostic tests are 
immunohistochemical staining and immunoblotting of the abnormal protein 
(Ref. 10). Detection and titration of the TSE agent can also be 
accomplished by intracerebral inoculation in mice or hamsters with a 
brain homogenate from a suspected animal. After an appropriate 
incubation period, the brain of the laboratory animal is examined for 
histopathological changes characteristic of TSE (Ref. 8).
    The potential antemortem tests that have been published are 
described as follows: (1) Tests specific for PrP: (a) A capillary 
electrophoresis test (Ref. 79), and (b) a western blot test with 
increased sensitivity (Ref. 80); and (2) tests which identify 
metabolites of infected animals or humans: (a) A cyclic voltametric 
method which describes metabolites in urine (Ref. 81), and (b) an 
immunoblot test describing metabolites in cerebral spinal fluid (Ref. 
82). Antemortem tests have not yet been validated for practical use.
    Recent research has shown some promise for antemortem testing. 
Research by Shreuder et al. (Ref. 83), detected scrapie-associated 
PrPsc protein in tonsils from scrapie susceptible sheep about a year 
before the expected onset of the clinical disease. The research holds 
promise for preclinical detection in sheep, but needs further 
development. With regard to cattle, the researchers concluded that the 
technique may not work but is worth investigating. Research by Hsich et 
al. (Ref. 84), describes an experimental assay in humans and animals. 
The research found that a positive immunoassay in human dementia 
patients supports a diagnosis of CJD. The authors concluded that the 
assay may be helpful in premortem diagnosis of TSE in humans and 
animals showing clinical signs associated with TSE's. The validity of 
the test as a preclinical screen has not been established.
10. Inactivation
    The agency considered requiring procedures for the manufacture of 
animal-derived proteins that would inactivate TSE infectivity. There 
have been several studies on the inactivation of TSE agents. The only 
broad generalization that can be drawn is that agents that denature 
protein can diminish the infectivity of the TSE agents. TSE infectivity 
does not appear to be markedly diminished by radiation or UV-light.
    Recent research (Ref. 85) showed that 11 of the 15 rendering 
procedures tested produced meat and bone meal with no detectable BSE 
infectivity in a mouse bioassay. Only limited conclusions can be drawn 
about safety from these 11 procedures because the infectivity titer of 
the spiked starting material (which consisted of 10 percent brain) was 
several logs lower than that typically found in brain that is not 
minced and not stored at -20  deg.C. Also, the question of the adequacy 
of the mouse bioassay as the regulatory test which acceptably assures 
the absence of TSE infectivity to animals or man remains to be answered 
through future research investigations.
    The four procedures that failed included two protocols using 
continuous vacuum rendering of high fat material and two protocols 
using continuous atmospheric rendering of natural fat material. The 
continuous vacuum rendering processes that failed were 120  deg.C for 
20 minutes at a vacuum of 0.38 bar and 121  deg.C for 57 minutes at a 
vacuum of 0.4 bar. The continuous atmospheric rendering processes of 
natural fat material that failed were end temperatures of 112 and 122 
deg.C after 50 minutes; however, end temperatures of 123 and 139  deg.C 
after 125 minutes both inactivated the BSE agent. Unexpectedly, the BSE 
agent was inactivated by three wet rendering processes that only 
reached a maximum temperature of 119  deg.C with a cooking time of 240 
minutes, a maximum temperature of 101  deg.C with a cooking time of 120 
minutes, and a maximum temperature of 72  deg.C with a cooking time of 
240 minutes under a vacuum of 0.85 bar.
    Preliminary, unpublished results indicate that the only rendering 
process which completely inactivates the scrapie agent (which was 
spiked with higher infectivity than that in the BSE experiments 
described in this section) is batch rendering under pressure (Ref. 86). 
The agency encourages more research in this area.

B. The Association Between Scrapie and BSE

    Epidemiological studies of the outbreak of BSE in the United 
Kingdom, including a computer simulation of the BSE epidemic, have 
characterized it as an extended common-source epidemic. Each case has 
been considered a primary case resulting from exposure to a single 
common source of infection. It is believed in the United Kingdom that 
rendered feed ingredients contaminated with scrapie infected sheep, or 
cattle with a previously unidentified TSE, served as the common source 
of infection. One study demonstrated that meat and bone meal could be 
incorporated into cattle feed in sufficient quantity to transmit BSE to 
some of the animals that consumed the feed (Ref. 87). Thus far, other 
research including research by USDA has not confirmed that the feeding 
of U.S.-origin scrapie-infected feed ingredients to cattle produces 
BSE. Therefore, the theory that BSE evolved naturally in cattle has not 
been ruled out (Ref. 88). See also the discussion in II.A.5. of this 
document.
    Furthermore, the U.K. studies suggest that the spread of BSE 
appeared to have been exacerbated by the practice of feeding 
ingredients from rendered BSE-infected cattle to cattle, including 
young calves, a practice that was subsequently banned. Incomplete 
immediate compliance with the feeding ban may account for the fact that 
some cattle born after the ban continue to be infected with BSE and has 
complicated any theory of vertical transmission of the disease. The 
research findings of maternal transmission of BSE are inconclusive, but 
if it occurs, it does so at a rate insufficient to maintain the 
epidemic (Ref. 89).

C. The Association Between Animal TSE's and Human TSE's

    All the animal and human TSE's have been shown to be transmissible 
experimentally to laboratory animals. The human and animal diseases are 
pathologically similar and share some etiological similarities. TSE's 
are not officially considered zoonotic diseases, i.e., known to be 
naturally transmissible from animals to humans. The distribution of CJD 
in the world does not coincide with that of scrapie in sheep or of BSE 
in cattle. Human exposure to sheep or cattle has a low correlation with 
CJD. However, the recent report from the United Kingdom of nv-CJD, and 
its possible relationship to BSE, is causing scientists around the 
world including those at CDC to

[[<strong>Page</strong> 561]]

reevaluate whether BSE may be a zoonotic disease.
    This concern is further supported by the recent report of 
experimental BSE transmission to macaques, with the development of nv-
CJD-like plaques in these monkeys (see the following discussion in this 
section).
    The possibility of transmission of TSE's from animals to humans has 
been suggested, most recently in connection with the identification of 
nv-CJD in the United Kingdom. Scientists in the United Kingdom 
concluded that the nv-CJD cases may be unique to the United Kingdom, 
raising the possibility that they are causally linked to BSE. The 
scientists stated that ``the common neuropathological picture may 
indicate infection by a common strain of the causative agent, as in 
sheep scrapie in which strains of the disease have been identified * * 
* '' (Ref. 30). The United Kingdom Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory 
Committee (SEAC) stated that ``although there is no direct evidence of 
a link, on current data and in absence of any credible alternative the 
most likely explanation at present is that these cases are linked to 
exposure to BSE before introduction of the SBO [specified bovine offal] 
ban in 1989'' (Ref. 90). A WHO consultation in April 1996 concluded 
that ``a link has not yet been proven between v-CJD in the U.K. and the 
effect of exposure to the BSE agent. The most likely hypothesis for v-
CJD is the exposure of the United Kingdom population to BSE'' (Ref. 2). 
However, a second WHO consultation, in May 1996 concluded that ``the 
clinical and neuropathological features of the newly recognized CJD 
variant do not provide information which could be used to prove the 
possible link between this disease and BSE in cattle'' (Ref. 91).
    The recent finding of florid amyloid plaques in the brains of 
macaques inoculated with suspensions of BSE-infected cow brains 
increases suspicion that exposure to the BSE agent may be the source of 
nv-CJD. Amyloid plaques have never before been seen in monkeys with 
TSE's, and the florid plaques resembled those in nv-CJD patients (Ref. 
92). In a recent paper by Collinge, et al. (Ref. 93), it is stated that 
``strains of transmissible encephalopathies are distinguished by 
differing physicochemical properties of PrPsc, the disease-related 
isoform of prion protein, which can be maintained on transmission to 
transgenic mice. 'New variant' CJD has a strain characteristic distinct 
from other types of CJD and which resembles those of BSE transmitted to 
mice, domestic cat and macaque, and is consistent with BSE being the 
source of this new disease. Strain characteristics revealed here 
suggest that the prion protein may itself encode disease phenotypes.''
    The possible association between BSE and nv-CJD may be further 
clarified by results from studies that are under way (e.g., 
experimental inoculation of brain tissue from the nv-CJD patients into 
mice).

D. Infectivity of Specific Tissues

    The WHO in a recent publication has summarized the infectivity of 
various tissues from sheep, goat, and cattle (Ref. 94). Scientific 
studies are currently being conducted in which calves are fed 
homogenized brain tissue from United Kingdom cattle confirmed to have 
BSE, and then various tissues are collected from the calves at 4-month 
intervals (Refs. 56 and 95). The tissues from these calves are being 
analyzed for the presence of the BSE agent. The study has been in 
progress for 18 months and only brain, spinal cord, and retina have 
been shown to be highly infectious. Distal ileum has been shown to be 
infectious, but much less than the previously mentioned tissues. No 
other tissues, most notably, muscle meat, milk, or blood have been 
shown to be infectious. The results of these current experiments 
parallel the previous research as summarized by WHO. However, the 
agency notes that infectivity of other tissues that might be fed to 
ruminants has not been definitively determined. This is, in part, 
because of the lack of desired sensitivity in the available assay 
methods.
    In summary, meat, milk, milk products, and blood have not been 
shown to transmit BSE infectivity. These products are considered safe 
for human consumption by health authorities including the WHO.

E. Potential Risk of TSE's to the United States

1. Overview
    This proposed FDA action is designed to reduce the risk of a BSE 
epidemic in the United States and thereby protect the health of animals 
and possibly of people if there is, in fact, a zoonotic relationship 
between BSE and CJD. Risk is defined as the probability of an adverse 
effect to an individual or a population. The four steps that are 
typically involved in risk analysis are hazard identification, hazard 
exposure, dose response, and risk characterization.
    While BSE has not been found in the United States, the agency 
believes it presents a potential risk to the health of animals and 
people. There are incubational and symptomatic similarities (as well as 
several differences) among the TSE's. The scientific characterization 
of these diseases is incomplete. However, interspecies cross-infections 
have been scientifically demonstrated by parenteral injection and oral 
routes of exposure.
    The typically long incubation period and the potentially 
devastating effect that a BSE outbreak would have on animal health and 
U.S. agribusiness also supports a conservative regulatory approach 
aimed at prevention. While the current level of exposure to products 
derived from animals with a TSE is extremely low or absent, the 
potential consequences of such exposure and the apparent small intake 
of the agent needed to achieve infection in some animals further 
encourage a conservative regulatory policy.
    Dose response assessments will be difficult because of the lack of 
good exposure data and the possibility of different susceptibilities, 
e.g., age or genetic factors, in different subpopulations. Although the 
TSE's are generally transmissible to laboratory animals following 
intraperitoneal (ip) or intracerebral (ic) routes of administration, 
the limited data that are available following the oral route of 
administration suggests that this route is much less efficient than ip 
or ic. Currently, it is quite difficult to make an accurate dose 
response assessment for a TSE agent following oral administration.
    A number of actions, in addition to this proposed rule, have been 
taken to manage a reduction in risk that BSE will enter the United 
States cattle population. Restrictions have been placed on the 
importation of live cattle (July 1989) and ruminant products (e.g., 
meat and bone meal, bone meal, blood meal, offal, fat, and glands) from 
countries which have BSE. Live animals imported prior to the 
restrictions on imports have been regularly monitored by Animal and 
Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) veterinarians, and APHIS is 
currently in the process of purchasing the remaining live cattle for 
diagnostic research purposes. Histopathological examination of brain 
tissues has been carried out on more than 5,000 specimens from cattle 
that were disabled or that demonstrated neurological signs prior to 
slaughter or on the farm, e.g., nonambulatory or rabies-negative 
cattle. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the 
nonambulatory or ``downer'' cows has been carried out since 1993. There 
has been no finding of BSE in tissues from these animals. These animals 
represent the highest BSE risk in the country, however, they also 
represent an extremely small percentage of the cattle

[[<strong>Page</strong> 562]]

slaughtered in the United States. This active surveillance program is 
continuing and may be expanded. The expansion of this program was 
indirectly supported by a comment to the ANPRM that all ``downer'' cows 
should be examined for BSE.
    Voluntary actions by industry have reduced the feeding of rendered 
sheep proteins to ruminants and the rendering of adult sheep. A 
voluntary Scrapie Flock Certification Program was implemented in 1992. 
The program, a cooperative effort among industry, State animal health 
officials and APHIS, seeks to reduce the prevalence of scrapie in U.S. 
sheep. A considerable educational effort continues to increase the 
awareness of veterinarians, veterinary laboratory diagnosticians, 
livestock and related industry businesses, and producers to the early 
clinical signs of BSE. Videos of United Kingdom BSE affected animals 
have been distributed to USDA veterinarians to enhance their ability to 
clinically diagnose BSE in suspect live animals. CDC has recently 
published an update (Ref. 96) of its previous review of national CJD 
mortality and the results of active CJD surveillance in five sites in 
the United States. These reviews did not detect evidence of the 
occurrence of the newly described variant form of CJD in the United 
States. As an important complement to these other public health 
efforts, this proposed rule would declare that animal protein derived 
from ruminant and mink tissues is an unapproved food additive for use 
in ruminant feeds, and would establish enforcement procedures. These 
actions, individually and collectively, contribute to a greatly reduced 
risk of a BSE epidemic ever occurring in the United States.
2. Comparison With the U.K. Conditions
    Investigators have identified several major risk factors that 
apparently contributed to the emergence of the disease and the 
resultant epidemic in the United Kingdom. These are: (1) A large sheep 
population relative to the cattle population, (2) a large, 
uncontrolled, scrapie incidence rate, (3) the production of 
``greaves,'' an incompletely processed intermediate product in the 
rendering process, (4) changes in rendering processes, such as the 
reduced use of solvent extraction, and (5) the feeding of significant 
amounts, up to 4 percent of the diet, of meat and bone meal to young 
dairy calves.
    In addition to the risk factors described in section II.E.2. of 
this document, the practice of processing dead sheep and cattle in the 
United Kingdom likely contributed to the amplification of the TSE 
agent. In the United Kingdom, sheep which may have died of scrapie and 
cattle with BSE, were picked up by ``knackers'' for rendering into 
animal feed. This material was partially rendered into ``greaves,'' 
which might have contained large amounts of the scrapie/BSE agent, and 
was fed to dairy calves in large amounts. The spread of BSE appeared to 
be facilitated by the feeding of rendered BSE-infected cattle back to 
calves. The BSE agent is postulated to have recycled from cows to 
calves through ruminant-to-ruminant feeding until the practice ceased 
following the 1989 ban on the practice.
    In the United States, the cattle population is much larger than the 
sheep population, the incidence of scrapie is much lower and a scrapie 
control program is in place; renderers in the United States do not 
manufacture greaves; and the rendering processes used in the United 
States are thought to reduce the titre (level) of TSE agents if any. 
The lack of a practice of feeding large amounts of meat and bone meal 
to calves in the United States, and the comparatively younger average 
age of U.S. dairy cattle are also differences that are believed to be 
important in protecting the United States against a U.K.-type BSE 
epidemic. Nevertheless, scrapie does exist in the United States, sheep 
are rendered and included in ruminant feed, the rendering process does 
not totally inactivate TSE agents, and calves are fed meat and bone 
meal. Therefore the risk of a BSE epidemic in the United States, while 
much less, cannot be completely discounted.

F. Historical Efforts to Control TSE's

1. U.S. Actions
    a. FDA. FDA is the Federal agency responsible for the safety and 
effectiveness of a large number of products and commodities. Briefly, 
these include, drugs for use in people and animals, human biological 
products, medical devices, food, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and 
animal feeds. Each of these product groups provides the potential for 
the transmission of spongiform encephalopathies in man or animals. FDA 
formed a Working Group composed of the Deputy Commissioner for 
Operations and representatives from the Centers to consider TSE's in 
relation to FDA regulated products. As a result of the Working Group's 
deliberations, FDA has taken the following actions:
    &lt;bullet&gt; In 1992, letters were sent to manufacturers of dietary 
supplements asking those manufacturers to reformulate their products to 
be certain they do not contain materials from BSE or scrapie infected 
animals;
    &lt;bullet&gt; In 1993, letters were sent to manufacturers of drugs, 
biologics, and devices asking them not to use bovine-derived materials 
from countries with BSE; and
    &lt;bullet&gt; In 1996, letters were sent to manufacturers of drugs, 
biologics, devices, and animal feeds noting a possible relationship 
between BSE and nv-CJD and asking that they not use materials from BSE 
countries.
    In 1992, FDA conducted a survey of major sheep rendering plants to 
determine compliance with a 1989 voluntary industry ban on the use of 
adult sheep offal in ruminant feeds. The voluntary ban and results of 
the survey are described in section I.F.3. of this document. In the 
Federal Register of August 29, 1994 (59 FR 44584), FDA published a 
proposed rule proposing to declare that specified offal from adult 
sheep and goats is an unapproved feed additive in ruminant feed 
(hereinafter referred to as the August 1994 proposed rule). In the 
Federal Register of May 14, 1996, FDA published an ANPRM stating that 
FDA was considering whether to provide that the use of protein derived 
from ruminants in ruminant feed be prohibited.
    An international symposium entitled ``Tissue Distribution, 
Inactivation, and Transmission of Transmissible Spongiform 
Encephalopathies'' and cohosted by APHIS and FDA's Center for 
Veterinary Medicine (CVM) was held on May 13 and 14, 1996, in 
Riverdale, MD. The symposium participants engaged in discussion of 
findings from unpublished, recently completed, and in-progress 
scientific investigations on TSE's, and optimal approaches to managing 
any risk of TSE's to animal health.
    b. USDA. USDA policy has been both proactive and preventive. The 
Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) and APHIS have been active in 
taking measures in surveillance, prevention, and education about TSE's. 
In 1990, APHIS created a BSE Issues Management Team to analyze risks of 
BSE to the United States, disseminate accurate information about the 
disease, and act as a reference source for responding to questions 
about BSE. APHIS has also collaborated in the education of veterinary 
practitioners, veterinary laboratory diagnosticians, industry and 
producers on the clinical signs and pathology of BSE.
    APHIS has increased its surveillance efforts to verify that the 
United States is free of BSE and to detect the disease should it be 
introduced into the United

[[<strong>Page</strong> 563]]

States. As part of an ongoing active surveillance program, more than 60 
veterinary diagnostic laboratories across the United States, and the 
National Veterinary Service Laboratories (NVSL) of APHIS, continue to 
examine bovine brains from the following sources: (1) APHIS 
investigations in the United States where suspected encephalitic 
conditions in cattle are reported under the foreign animal disease 
investigation program; (2) CDC and State public health laboratories 
(specimens from bovine that were found negative for rabies); and (3) 
FSIS (specimens from ``downer'' cows or those exhibiting CNS 
abnormalities). More than 5,000 bovine brains have been examined, and 
none of these specimens contained lesions with the characteristics and 
distribution typical for BSE (Refs. 12 and 97). APHIS is currently in 
the process of purchasing the 69 living cattle (from a total of 496 
cattle) imported from the United Kingdom between 1981 and 1989. In July 
1989, the importation of live ruminants and ruminant products from all 
countries known to have BSE in native animals was banned.
    USDA continues to analyze and report epidemiologic findings and 
potential risks to the United States. In 1991, USDA issued two reports 
analyzing risk factors associated with BSE in the United Kingdom based 
on the British hypothesis of the disease occurring as a result of 
feeding scrapie-contaminated meat and bone meal (Refs. 98 and 84). 
Because of some similarities in the animal industries between the two 
countries, the possibility of BSE occurring in the United States could 
not be eliminated. However, the probability of occurrence was 
determined to be very low as the amount of sheep offal was found to be 
0.6 percent of all U.S. rendered product compared to the estimate of 14 
percent of all U.K. rendered product. Furthermore, the incidence of 
scrapie in the United States is much lower than in Great Britain; a 
scrapie eradication or control program has been in effect in the United 
States and rendered products are not routinely incorporated into calf 
diets as was the practice in the United Kingdom.
    Since 1991, USDA has closely followed scientific findings and has 
updated the BSE risk factor analysis, first in 1993 (Ref. 99) and as 
recently as February 1996 (Ref. 4). Changes within each of the risk 
factors have been evaluated, and because there has either been no 
change or a decrease in the magnitude of risk factors, the overall risk 
of BSE in the United States is believed to have decreased. The 
February, 1996 report estimated the maximum potential 1-year period 
prevalence of BSE to range from 2.3 to 12 cases per 1 million adult 
cattle. In other words, under the worst case scenario between 
approximately 115 and 600 adult cattle would become infected with BSE 
each year, in a U.S. population of nearly 50 million adult cattle.
    APHIS has had a scrapie control program in effect since 1952. 
Flocks that have been enrolled in the voluntary certification program 
for sheep for 5 years, and have not had a diagnosed case of scrapie 
within 5 years or a case traced back to the flock during that period, 
may apply for APHIS certification and be officially identified as such. 
This new control effort provides a mechanism to recognize flocks as 
scrapie-free in the absence of a live animal diagnostic test.
    There is no official USDA program on TME or CWD. Although the last 
TME case detected in the United States was in 1985, monitoring for this 
disease continues. APHIS cooperates with State wildlife and diagnostic 
officials in Colorado and Wyoming in the limited areas where CWD has 
been reported.
    In December 1991, APHIS placed a ban on importation of certain 
products of ruminant origin from countries known to have BSE (56 FR 
63865, December 6, 1991). These products include: Meat and bone meal, 
bone meal, blood meal, offal, fat, and glands. In addition to 
prohibiting the materials listed previously, the regulation requires 
that imported meat for human or animal consumption from bovines be 
deboned, with visible lymphatic and nervous tissue removed; that it be 
obtained from animals which have undergone a veterinary examination 
prior to slaughter; and that it be obtained from ruminants which have 
not been in any country in which BSE has been reported during a period 
of time when that country permitted the use of ruminant protein in 
ruminant feed. APHIS may allow the importation of the banned products 
under a special permit for scientific or research purposes, or under 
special conditions to be used in cosmetics. No bovine meat from the 
United Kingdom has been allowed to be imported into the United States 
by FSIS for human consumption since before the BSE epidemic occurred in 
the United Kingdom. The network of private veterinary practitioners 
that refers unusual cases to veterinary schools or State diagnostic 
laboratories around the United States provides an extensive 
surveillance system. FSIS performs both antemortem and post mortem 
inspections at all federally-inspected slaughter establishments, and 
inspectors condemn all animals with central nervous system disorders. 
State-inspected slaughter operations follow the same procedures.
    USDA also maintains a database on these and other conditions. The 
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory Reporting System (VDLRS) is a database 
of selected disease conditions submitted by 29 State and university 
veterinary diagnostic laboratories throughout the United States, and 
includes the results of histologic examinations for BSE. The VDLRS is a 
cooperative effort of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory 
Diagnosticians (AAVLD), the U.S. Animal Health Association (USAHA), 
APHIS' Veterinary Service Centers for Epidemiology and Animal Health, 
and the 29 laboratories mentioned previously.
    c. Public Health Service (PHS). i. CDC. CDC conducts surveillance 
for CJD through examination of death certificate data compiled by the 
National Center for Health Statistics, CDC, for U.S. residents for whom 
CJD was listed as one of the multiple causes of death (Ref. 100). These 
data indicate that the annual CJD mortality rates in the United States 
between 1979 and 1993 have been relatively stable, ranging between only 
0.8 case per million in both 1979 and 1990 and 1.1 cases per million in 
1987. In addition, CJD deaths in persons younger than 30 years of age 
in the United States remain extremely rare (&lt;5 cases per billion per 
year) (Ref. 101).
    CDC is working with the Council of State and Territorial 
Epidemiologists to consider expansion of current CJD surveillance. CDC 
is also working with its four established Emerging Infections Programs 
(Minnesota, Oregon, Connecticut, and the San Francisco Bay area, 
California), the Georgia Department of Human Resources, and the Atlanta 
Metropolitan Active Surveillance Program to pilot enhanced surveillance 
efforts for CJD (Ref. 101). This effort includes an active search for 
v-CJD as described in the United Kingdom (Ref. 30). On August 9, 1996, 
the results of this enhanced CJD surveillance effort was published; no 
evidence of the occurrence of the newly described variant form of CJD 
was found in the United States. No evidence of v-CJD has been found in 
the United States.
    ii. National Institutes of Health (NIH). A project of the 
Laboratory of Central Nervous System Studies of the National Institute 
of Neurological Diseases and Stroke is conducting investigations on 
slow, latent, and temperate viral infections associated with chronic 
degenerative neurological diseases. Important areas of study are the 
pathogenesis of slow infections and mechanisms of persistence in kuru 
and

[[<strong>Page</strong> 564]]

CJD. Also intensive molecular, biological, genetic, and immunological 
studies are being conducted on amyloid formation in the brain in 
Alzheimer's disease, normal aging, Down's syndrome, and slow viral 
infections, and the elucidation of the de novo generation of infectious 
amyloid proteins from normal host precursor proteins in kuru, CJD, GSS 
syndrome, scrapie and BSE. Research on TSE's has also been conducted by 
the NIH Laboratory of Persistent Viral Disease. FDA maintains close 
contact with scientists in the laboratories and expects to use their 
expertise in the evaluation of inactivation methods and transmission 
studies.
    iii. Other actions. On April 8, 1996, an interagency meeting at CDC 
including representatives from CDC, NIH, FDA, USDA, and the U.S. 
Department of Defense was held to disseminate conclusions from the WHO 
consultation regarding v-CJD and to coordinate preventive activities 
among these agencies to address the BSE and CJD issues.
2. International Actions
    a. United Kingdom. Regulatory controls taken to manage the BSE 
epidemic in the United Kingdom and to address public health concerns 
include: (1) An action in June 1988 to make the disease reportable; (2) 
a ban in July 1988 on the feeding of ruminant-derived protein 
supplements to other ruminants; (3) an order in August 1988 for the 
compulsory slaughter and incineration of BSE suspect cattle; (4) a ban 
in November 1989 on the inclusion of specified bovine offal (brain, 
spinal cord, thymus, spleen, tonsils, and intestines) for human 
consumption; and (5) a ban in September 1990 on use of specified bovine 
offal in any animal feed.
    A CJD Surveillance Unit was established to monitor CJD numbers in 
the United Kingdom. SEAC, consisting of experts in neurology, 
epidemiology, and microbiology from outside the British government, was 
established in 1990 to oversee all aspects of TSE's and human and 
animal health. USDA has a representative on this committee.
    Major regulatory actions occurring after the SEAC report on nv-CJD 
(Ref. 90) include legislation to ban the feeding of mammalian meat and 
bone meal to any farmed animal, and legislation to ban the use of 
cattle head meat for human consumption.
    b. WHO. WHO has held meetings on the spongiform encephalopathies in 
1991, 1993, 1995, and 1996, and a meeting in collaboration with the 
Office International des Epizooties (OIE) in 1994. The general purposes 
of these meetings were to review the existing state of knowledge on 
spongiform encephalopathies including BSE, to evaluate possible means 
of transmission, and to identify risk factors for infection. A specific 
purpose was to review the possible human public health implications of 
animal spongiform encephalopathies, with special emphasis on BSE. The 
group of international experts convened in April 1996 by WHO 
recommended that all countries should ban the use of ruminant tissues 
in ruminant feed. The WHO group also declared that milk and milk 
products, including such products from the United Kingdom, are safe for 
human consumption and that gelatin in the food chain is considered safe 
because its preparation effectively destroys BSE. Finally, the group 
concluded that tallow could be safe if effective rendering procedures 
are in place (i.e., rendered as protein-free) (Ref. 2).
    c. OIE. OIE has supported the U.K. ban on the use of specified 
offals and has recommended that the same action be taken in other 
countries with a high incidence of the disease (Ref. 102). OIE has held 
meetings in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1995, and 1996, and has developed 
guidelines concerning animals and animal products to prevent movement 
to unaffected countries.
    d. European Community (EC). The EC has held a series of meetings 
related to BSE. Following issuance of the U.K. SEAC statement 
suggesting a possible link between nv-CJD and BSE, the EC imposed a ban 
on British cattle, beef and bovine derivatives (Ref. 103).
3. Voluntary Measures by the U.S. Animal Industries
    a. Voluntary ban on rendering adult sheep. In 1989, the National 
Renderers Association (NRA) and the Animal Protein Producers Industry 
(APPI) recommended to their members that they stop rendering adult 
sheep or providing sheep offal for sale as meat and bone meal for 
inclusion in cattle feed (Ref. 104). Following the recommendation of 
the voluntary ban, FDA carried out a survey of current practices in the 
United States for rendering or otherwise disposing of adult sheep 
carcasses and parts, specifically head, brain, and spinal cord. Limited 
inspections of rendering plants were conducted in 1992 to: (1) Assess 
compliance by U.S. renderers with the voluntary ban; (2) identify 
rendering plant practices concerning adult sheep; and (3) determine if 
rendered adult sheep protein byproducts were being sold or labeled for 
use as feed or feed components for cattle. Of the 19 plants surveyed, 
15 rendered carcasses or offal of adult sheep. These 15 plants 
processed more than 85 percent of the adult sheep rendered in the 
United States. Eleven of the 15 plants rendered carcasses of adult 
sheep with heads, 7 of the 15 rendered sheep carcasses separately from 
other species, 6 of the 15 maintained meat and bone meal from adult 
sheep separate from meat and bone meal from other species, and 4 of the 
15 rendered sheep that had died of causes other than slaughter. Six of 
the 11 renderers processing adult sheep with heads had sold meat and 
bone meal to manufacturers of cattle feed. Thus, the rendering 
industry's voluntary ban on the rendering of adult sheep or providing 
sheep offal for use in cattle feed was not fully implemented at the 
time of the survey (Ref. 105).
    b. Voluntary ban on feeding ruminant proteins to ruminants. On 
March 29, 1996, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), the 
National Milk Producers Federation, the American Sheep Association, the 
American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Association of 
Veterinary Medical Colleges, and the American Association of Bovine 
Practitioners announced the recommendation of a voluntary ban on the 
feeding of ruminant-derived proteins to ruminant animals (Ref. 106). 
USDA, PHS, the American Society of Animal Science, and other 
organizations announced support for the voluntary ban (Refs. 107 and 
108). According to the NCBA (Ref. 109), a comprehensive communication 
strategy, seeking removal of ruminant-derived proteins from the rations 
of ruminants, was implemented in May 1996 by the feed industry, 
nutritionists, veterinarians, extension specialists, and dairy and beef 
producers. NCBA has not conducted a survey to assess the impact of its 
communication strategy; however, NCBA did point out that past requests 
for voluntary action by the cattle industry have been quite successful, 
approaching 90 percent compliance. In contrast, an anonymous comment to 
the ANPRM suggested a compliance level of less than 5 percent (Ref. 
110). FDA has not conducted a survey to ascertain the level of 
compliance with the voluntary ban.

G. Processing Animal Tissues for Feed Ingredients

1. Current Rendering Practices
    The following discussion on current rendering practices comes 
directly from comments supplied to FDA in response to the ANPRM from 
representatives of

[[<strong>Page</strong> 565]]

APPI and NRA. Knowledge about the four basic types of rendering systems 
that are most commonly used in the United States today may be crucial 
in dealing with the TSE issue in this country. Data on the inactivation 
of the BSE and scrapie agents following simulation of the most commonly 
used basic types of rendering systems in the United States could be 
quite useful, especially because some of these systems do not appear to 
have been used in the only published rendering study on BSE 
inactivation (Ref. 85).
    Rendering, the process of cooking raw material to remove the 
moisture and fat from the solid protein portion of animal tissues, has 
been practiced by humans for more than 2,000 years. The United States 
rendering industry has developed over the last 160 years. Modern 
rendering systems are high-technology recycling processes that 
efficiently convert animal byproducts (shop fat and bone, beef and pork 
slaughterhouse materials, poultry offal, fish, etc.) to stable protein 
and fat supplements for feed.
    Current technology consists of four basic types of rendering 
systems--batch cooker, continuous cooker, continuous multi-stage 
evaporator, and continuous preheat/press/evaporator. All systems 
consist of three basic steps: Grinding the raw material, cooking it to 
remove moisture, and separating the melted fat from the protein solids.
    Batch cookers are multiple units, each consisting of a horizontal, 
steam-jacketed cylindrical vessel with an agitator. Batch cookers are 
operated at atmospheric pressure. The cooked material is discharged to 
the percolator drain pan, which contains a perforated screen that 
allows the free-run fat to drain and be separated from the protein 
solids known as ``tankage.''
    Because ``tankage'' contains considerable fat, it is processed 
through a screw press to complete the separation of fat from solids. 
The fat discharged from the screw press usually contains fine solid 
particles that are removed by either centrifuging or filtration. The 
protein solids discharged from the screw press are known as 
``cracklings,'' which normally are screened and ground with a hammer 
mill to produce protein meal.
    The continuous cooker rendering system normally consists of a 
single continuous cooker, operating at atmospheric pressure. The 
discharge from the continuous cooker usually passes across either a 
vibrating screen or stationary perforated screen to allow the free-run 
fat to drain. The subsequent steps in the continuous cooker rendering 
process are similar to those described before for the batch cooker.
    In the continuous multi-stage evaporator rendering system, crushing 
is used as the first stage of size reduction of the raw material. A fat 
recycle stream is then used to deliver the material as a pumpable 
slurry through the secondary grinding step to reduce further the 
particle size. Particle size and fat ratios are important components of 
this system. The slurry discharge from the final stage of evaporation 
is pumped to a centrifuge which removes most of the fat and part of it 
is recycled back to the second stage of size reduction. The solids 
discharged from the centrifuge are conveyed to screw presses which 
complete the separation of fat from the protein solids.
    The continuous preheat/press/evaporator rendering system is known 
by a variety of names including the Stord dewatering rendering system 
and the Atlas low temperature wet rendering system. In either case, raw 
material is ground in two stages and passes through the preheater to 
raise the temperature to 180 to 190  deg.EF before entry to the twin 
screw press. The press separates this material into two phases: A 
presscake of solids containing moisture and a low fat concentration, 
and a liquid containing mostly water (stickwater) with fine solids, 
soluble protein, insoluble protein and melted fat.
    The press liquid is processed either by passing through a 
multistage evaporator system to remove the water before centrifuging to 
remove the fine solids from the fat, or by passing through a centrifuge 
to separate the fat before multistage evaporation of the remaining 
water/fine solids fraction. The liquid separation system consisting of 
two stages of centrifuges completes the separation of the melted fat 
from the solids and water. In this system, the screw press normally 
used to process the ``tankage'' is no longer needed. Longer drying 
times are needed with this system as compared to previous systems 
because of the early fat removal (less fat means less effective heat 
transfer).
    The agency encourages further research into methods of deactivation 
of the BSE agent during the rendering process.
2. Assay Methodologies for Proteins
    Enforcement of the proposed regulation would be facilitated if a 
test to detect and distinguish ruminant from nonruminant materials in 
feeds or feed ingredients was available. However, practical assays that 
could be used to enforce the proposed regulation are not available at 
this time. The test procedure would need to exhibit a high degree of 
sensitivity and selectivity; that is, the test must be able to detect 
the analyte of interest to the exclusion of other components. A test 
for acceptable rendered products in animal feed must therefore be able 
to discriminate and differentiate between permitted and prohibited 
animal derived proteins. Other factors of importance are the ruggedness 
of the test method, speed, and simplicity of design.
    An enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) based analytic method 
that is both sensitive (detects low levels of analyte) and specific 
(detects primarily the analyte of interest) is one possibility. ELISA 
is a relatively straightforward methodology. There are numerous 
commercial sources for antisera capable of binding to bovine, ovine, 
porcine, and caprine proteins. Antisera have also been generated from 
muscle extracts and validated for use in USDA-approved ELISA methods to 
determine the identity of raw and cooked meats (Refs. 111 and 112). 
However, rendered products present a unique problem because rendering 
causes the destruction of most of the antibody binding epitopes needed 
for an ELISA test. Therefore, detection of rendered proteins by a given 
antibody cannot be automatically assumed.
    Other potential methodologies include western blot analysis, 
capillary electrophoresis, and high pressure liquid chromatography. The 
applicability of these three methods to this issue has not been 
addressed. Furthermore, they require expensive, specialized equipment 
and a high degree of technical competence.
    The agency encourages research to detect and distinguish ruminant 
from nonruminant materials in rendered products and animal feeds.

III. Statutory Provisions Regarding Food Additives

    The term ``food'' as defined in the act includes animal feed. 
Section 201(f) of the act (21 U.S.C. 321(f)) defines food as ``articles 
used for food or drink for man or other animals'' and ``articles used 
for components of any such article.'' Furthermore, any substance whose 
intended use results or may reasonably be expected to result in its 
becoming a component of food is a food additive unless, among other 
things, it is GRAS or is the subject of a prior sanction. Section 
402(a)(2)(C) of the act (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)) deems food adulterated 
``if it is, or it bears or contains, any food additive which is unsafe 
within the meaning of section 409 * * *.'' Under section 409(a) of the 
act (21 U.S.C 348(a)), a food additive is unsafe unless

[[<strong>Page</strong> 566]]

a food additive regulation or an exemption is in effect with respect to 
its use or its intended use.
    A food additive regulation is established by the submission and 
approval of a food additive petition, as provided in 21 CFR 571.1, or 
on FDA's initiative as provided in 21 CFR 570.15. FDA on its own 
initiative or at the request of an interested party, also may propose 
to determine that a substance intended for use in animal feed is not 
GRAS and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act as 
provided in Sec. 570.38 (21 CFR 570.38). Subsequent to the publication 
of such a proposal and after consideration of public comments, FDA may 
issue a final rule declaring the substance to be a food additive and 
require discontinuation of its use except when used in compliance with 
a food additive regulation.

A. GRAS Determination

    A determination that a substance added directly or indirectly to a 
food is GRAS, is generally based on specific information regarding the 
composition of the substance, its use, method of preparation, methods 
for detecting its presence in food, and information about its 
functionality in food (21 CFR 570.35) as determined by experts 
qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety 
of such a substance. A substance added to food becomes GRAS as the 
result of a common understanding about the substance throughout the 
scientific community familiar with safety of such substances. The basis 
of expert views may be either scientific procedures, or, in the case of 
a substance used in food prior to January 1, 1958, experience based on 
common use in food (Sec. 570.30(a)) (21 CFR 570.30(a)). General 
recognition of safety through experience based on common use in food 
prior to January 1, 1958, may be determined without the quantity or 
quality of scientific studies required for the approval of a food 
additive regulation. However, substances that are GRAS based on such 
use must be currently recognized as safe based on their pre-1958 use. 
(See United States v. Naremco, 553 F.2d 1138 (8th Cir. 1977); compare 
United States v. Western Serum, 666 F.2d 335 (9th Cir. 1982).) A 
recognition of safety through common use is ordinarily to be based on 
generally available data and information (Sec. 570.30(c)). An 
ingredient that was not in common use in food prior to January 1, 1958, 
may achieve general recognition of safety only through scientific 
procedures.
    General recognition of safety based upon scientific procedures 
requires the same quantity and quality of scientific evidence as is 
required to obtain approval of a food additive regulation for the 
ingredient (Sec. 570.30(b)). (See United States v. Naremco, 553 F.2d at 
1143.) A substance is not GRAS if there is a genuine dispute among 
experts as to its recognition (An Article of Drug * * * Furestrol 
Vaginal Suppositories, 251 F. Supp. 1307 (N.D. Ga. 1968), aff'd 415 
F.2d 390 (5th Cir. 1969).) Further, general recognition of safety 
through scientific procedures must be based upon published studies 
(United States v. Articles of Food and Drug Colitrol 80 Medicated, 372 
F. Supp. 915 (N.D. Ga. 1974), aff'd, 518 F.2d 743, 747 (5th Cir. 
1975)), so that the results are generally available to experts. It is 
not enough, in attempting to establish that a substance is GRAS, to 
establish that there is an absence of scientific studies that 
demonstrate the substance to be unsafe; there must be studies that show 
the substance to be safe (United States v. An Article of Food * * * Co 
Co Rico, supra.)
    Conversely, a substance may be ineligible for GRAS status if 
studies show that the substance is, or may be, unsafe. This is true 
whether the studies are published or unpublished (50 FR 27294 at 27296, 
July 2, 1985). If there are studies that tend to support a finding that 
a particular substance is GRAS, but also studies that tend to support a 
contrary position, the conflict in the studies, just as a conflict in 
expert opinion, may prevent the general recognition of the safe use of 
the substance.

B. Prior Sanction

    Under section 201(s) of the act, the term ``food additive'' does 
not apply to any substance used in accordance with a sanction or 
approval granted prior to enactment of section 201(s) of the act and 
granted under the act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 
451 et seq.), or the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et 
seq.). Section 570.38(d) provides that if the Commissioner of Food and 
Drugs is aware of any prior sanction for use of a substance, he will, 
concurrently with a notice determining that a substance is not GRAS and 
is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act, propose a 
separate regulation covering such use of the substance.
    In the case of the materials subject to this proposed rule, FDA has 
determined that it is unaware of any applicable prior sanction. Any 
person who intends to assert or rely on such sanction is required to 
submit proof of the existence of the applicable prior sanction. The 
failure of any person to come forward with proof of such an applicable 
prior sanction in response to this notice will constitute a waiver of 
the right to assert or rely on such sanction at any later time.

C. Food Additive Status of Ruminant Tissues

    The agency recognizes that processed ruminant byproducts have a 
long history of use in animal feeds without known adverse effects. 
However, the evidence as discussed in sections I and II.A. through 
II.D. of this document, for the development of a new pattern of disease 
transmission, now indicates that these ingredients can no longer be 
categorically regarded as safe. The agency tentatively concludes that, 
based on this evidence, use of such products in ruminant feed is not 
GRAS. The agency is proposing this regulation in light of the findings 
and conclusions described in sections I and II in this notice. Nor is 
the agency aware of a prior sanction for any feed products that contain 
these tissues. Therefore, FDA is proposing that the addition of protein 
derived from ruminant tissues to ruminant feed would constitute the use 
of an unapproved food additive because no regulation is in effect 
providing for such use. Any ruminant feed that contains protein derived 
from ruminant and mink tissues would be adulterated. Accordingly, FDA 
is proposing to list protein derived from ruminant tissues in part 589.

IV. Comments

    FDA's May 1996 ANPRM requested public comment and information on 
all aspects of TSE's, including BSE, and the potential consequences of 
a prohibition on the feeding of ruminant protein to ruminants. The 
agency received nearly 600 comments, including many that were submitted 
long after the comment period ended. The agency has attempted to 
address the comments in this proposal. If there are any significant 
concerns that the agency has not addressed, these concerns should be 
brought to the agency's attention in timely comments on this proposal. 
Comments that were specific to the topics covered by the other sections 
of this preamble were considered in the preamble as written. Comments 
are discussed in the text of some of these sections. The following is a 
general discussion of the comments received.
    Many comments, especially from renderers, meat packers, feed 
companies and farmers, opposed the prohibition of ruminant protein 
being fed to ruminants. The main reasons offered were the lack of 
evidence of BSE in the United States, lack of scientific data to 
support the proposal in the absence of

[[<strong>Page</strong> 567]]

BSE, environmental concerns, lack of an assay or other practical means 
to support enforcement, and the economic hardship that would fall upon 
the animal producers, slaughter facilities, renderers, feed 
manufacturers, and packers. Support for such a prohibition from 
consumer groups, pharmaceutical firms, scientists and veterinarians, 
and some livestock organizations, emphasized a potential effect on 
human health, the experience and data from the United Kingdom, and 
significant economic detriment if a BSE epidemic were to occur in this 
country. Other comments described a need to ensure that exported U.S. 
bovine-derived products met international standards and guidelines, and 
to maintain consumer confidence in the beef and dairy industries even 
though those comments acknowledged that there is a minimal potential 
risk of infectivity to animals and humans.
    The agency requested scientific information regarding the 
occurrence, transmission, etiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and 
inactivation of TSE agents. Many comments were received that contained 
useful scientific information that was considered in the preparation of 
this proposed rule, as described in this preamble and supporting 
documents.
    Three comments suggested that the documented existence of nonBSE 
TSE's, and the presence of ``downer'' cows (cows unable to walk) in the 
United States is evidence that BSE is present in this country. Three 
comments stated that the BSE surveillance in the United States provides 
sufficient assurance that BSE does not exist in this country. A number 
of persons commented on whether specific tissues, such as milk, blood, 
and gelatin, should be excluded from any prohibition, with nearly all 
supporting such exclusion.
    The agency requested information on the economic impact of the 
described action. Numerous comments provided data on volume of product 
impacted, potential economic benefits, and cost of compliance to 
affected persons. The data were used to develop the preliminary 
economic assessment supporting this proposed rule.
    The agency requested information on the environmental impact and 
potential mitigating factors of the described action. Many comments 
stated that alternative disposal of the prohibited carcasses would be 
less environmentally safe than rendering. These and other comments were 
considered in the development of the environmental assessment.
    Numerous comments were received regarding the need to prohibit only 
tissues that have been demonstrated to be infective. Generally, the 
comments stated that tissues that have been proven to be noninfective 
should be exempted. Although the agency is proposing a rule that would 
prohibit the use of all ruminant-derived protein in ruminant feeds, the 
agency will, as explained elsewhere in this document, consider a 
partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition as well as a mammalian-to-
ruminant prohibition.
    Many comments supported establishment of Hazard Analysis Critical 
Control Points (HACCP) for the rendering industry, often with 
concurrent support for current good manufacturing practices (CGMP's) 
for animal-derived proteins. For example, the American Feed Industry 
Association proposed a specific set of Good Manufacturing Practices for 
the producers of animal protein products, and the National Renderers 
Association proposed a specific HACCP regulation for rendering 
operations. The agency agrees that the need for HACCP, perhaps 
supported by CGMP's, for animal-derived proteins could be considered in 
future rulemaking. Several comments were received regarding labeling 
requirements for animal-derived proteins. The majority of the comments 
supported a statement of the origin of animal-derived protein. The 
agency has included a labeling requirement in the proposed rule.

V. Analysis of Alternatives

A. Overview

    In addition to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant rule, the agency 
is considering alternative approaches. The alternatives include: (1) 
excluding from ruminant feed all ruminant and mink materials except 
those that have not been found to present a risk of transmitting 
spongiform encephalopathy (partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition); 
(2) prohibiting the use in ruminant feed of all mammalian protein 
(mammalian-to-ruminant prohibition); (3) prohibiting the feeding of 
materials from species in which TSE's have been diagnosed in the United 
States (sheep, goats, mink, deer, and elk); (4) prohibiting the feeding 
of specified sheep and goat offal, as proposed by the agency in 1994; 
(5) other alternatives that might be proposed by the comments; and (6) 
no action.
    Analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of the options 
follows. Analysis of costs and benefits, including detailed economic 
analysis, also appears in section IX. of this document. Environmental 
consequences are discussed in section VIII. of this document.
    In determining the scope of the final rule, the agency will weigh 
carefully the comments received, along with material contained in the 
administrative record for this proposal and the comments submitted in 
response to the ANPRM. Comments regarding the scope of the rule, 
including those comments supporting other options other than the 
proposed option, should be addressed accordingly.

B. Ruminant-to-Ruminant Prohibition

    Advantages of this option, compared with the ``no action'' option, 
are discussed in detail in section I. of this document. The advantages 
of this option that are discussed in that section would apply if BSE 
were to occur in this country. As discussed in separate sections that 
follow, there would also be environmental and economic advantages to 
the ruminant-to-ruminant option, if BSE were to occur in this country. 
Disadvantages of the ruminant-to-ruminant option, compared to the ``no 
action'' option, would be relevant primarily if BSE did not occur in 
the United States. These disadvantages would include the time and 
expense required to comply with the provisions of the regulation, and 
the limited, short term environmental effects described in section 
VIII. of this document.
    Compared with the mammalian-to-ruminant option, the ruminant-to-
ruminant option has the advantages of being tailored more precisely to 
the identified scientific concerns, and less burdensome on the affected 
industries. Economic and environmental costs would be less. The major 
disadvantage is that the ruminant-to-ruminant option results in more 
complexity for the regulated industries, and thereby provides less 
assurance of compliance. This is explained further in the discussion of 
the mammalian-to-ruminant option, in section V.D. of this document.
    Compared to the other remaining options, which are less 
restrictive, the ruminant-to-ruminant option provides greater assurance 
of protection of the public health and, if BSE were to occur in the 
United States, lower economic and environmental costs. The 
disadvantages relate generally to the greater economic and 
environmental costs that would be incurred if BSE did not occur in the 
United States.

C. Partial Ruminant-to-Ruminant Prohibition

    As an alternative to the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition, 
the agency is considering a partial

[[<strong>Page</strong> 568]]

ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition which would exclude from ruminant feed 
all ruminant and mink materials except those that have not been found 
to present a risk of transmitting spongiform encephalopathy. The 
exclusions would be in addition to milk products, gelatin and bovine 
blood, which are excluded in the proposed rule. Possible exclusions 
include slaughter byproducts from bovine that have been inspected and 
passed in inspected slaughter facilities, except the brain, eyes, 
spinal cord, and distal ileum. The four named tissues would be 
prohibited because they have been shown through experimental trials and 
bioassays to transmit spongiform encephalopathy. The remaining tissues 
have not been demonstrated to transmit spongiform encephalopathy.
    This option has the advantage of having its prohibitions based 
primarily on scientific information related to infectivity of specific 
tissues. A number of persons who commented on the ANPRM urged the 
agency to base its regulation entirely on such scientific information. 
In addition, this option would likely involve lower lost sales revenues 
to the affected industries, and could have fewer adverse economic 
effects, than would the other options.
    However, the agency has three concerns with regard to the adequacy 
of this option in providing sufficient protection for the public 
health. First, FDA recognizes that it may be impractical in the 
slaughter and rendering processes to segregate and exclude the bovine 
tissues that have not been found to present a risk. For example, USDA 
has expressed reservations that separating the distal ileum from the 
other intestinal offal could jeopardize a slaughter plant's ability to 
meet pathogen reduction goals required under USDA's HACCP regulations. 
Furthermore, regulatory enforcement of a prohibition affecting only 
specified bovine tissues may be impractical in the absence of specific 
diagnostic methods for identifying protein derived from such tissues. 
If a partial prohibition were adopted, it would be based on a finding 
that practical methods can be implemented for segregating, processing, 
storing, and identifying feed materials derived from tissues that have 
not been found to present a risk.
    Second, this option would be inconsistent with actions taken in a 
number of other nations. For example, CDC has commented that any 
prohibition of lesser scope than a ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition 
would place the United States out of step with the international public 
health community.
    Third, limiting the prohibition of tissues to those that have been 
shown to be infective would not address the risk that may be presented 
by other tissues. Definitive assays using methods more sensitive than 
currently available methods might identify such additional tissues as 
infective. The possibility of undetected low dose exposure cannot be 
eliminated, particularly for tissues such as lymph nodes and spleens 
which would be expected to be infective (Ref. 1).
    These issues raise a substantial question as to whether the tissues 
could be GRAS. To achieve the highest level of public health 
protection, the agency believes that it may be reasonable to assume 
that, in the absence of scientific data definitively establishing that 
each tissue does not transmit spongiform encephalopathy, all ruminant 
tissues present a risk of infectivity.
    The agency nevertheless welcomes comments on this alternative to 
the proposed ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition and especially invites 
comments on possible practical means of separating the distal ileum in 
compliance with USDA and industry standards, as well as the 
practicality of the removal of brain, spinal cord, and eye and the 
segregation of these tissues from others in the slaughter plant.

D. Mammal-to-Ruminant Prohibition

    The agency received comments in support of a rule that would 
prohibit the use in ruminant feed of all mammalian-derived protein. For 
instance, the American Feed Industry Association, NRA, and APPI 
expressed concerns that segregating certain mammalian derived proteins 
from others would not be feasible because of regular commingling of 
protein products at feed mills and rendering facilities. A mammalian-
to-ruminant prohibition would provide greater assurance of industry 
compliance than either a partial or total ruminant-to-ruminant 
prohibition because practical analytical methods exist for 
distinguishing mammalian from nonmammalian proteins. Implementation of 
a mammal-to-ruminant prohibition by the regulated industries would be 
less complex, and would reduce the potential for contamination of 
cattle feeds with material intended for feeding monogastric animals. 
Contamination of cattle feeds with material intended for feeding 
nonruminants was the primary reason that the United Kingdom has 
prohibited mammalian proteins in the rations of cattle. A mammal-to-
ruminant prohibition would enable the continued use of Association of 
American Feed Control Officials definitions for the purpose of 
identifying and labeling products covered by the prohibition, and would 
not require additional or new labeling. Finally, concerns were 
expressed that allowing certain products containing meat and bone meal 
to be used in ruminant feeds while prohibiting others would lead to 
instability in financially sensitive commodity markets for animal 
protein.
    On the other hand, the agency is not aware of any scientific data 
that establish or suggest TSE infectivity in nonruminant mammals except 
in mink. Thus, excluding nonruminant tissues from ruminant feed would 
be based primarily on the view that the possibility of infection of 
nonruminant tissue through cross-contamination or commingling with 
ruminant tissue is sufficient to preclude GRAS status for the 
nonruminant tissue. However, FDA is aware that some portions of the 
affected industries would prefer to segregate ruminant from nonruminant 
tissues, and believe that such separation is practical. Accordingly, 
the agency invites comments on the relative merits and disadvantages of 
a mammal-to-ruminant prohibition compared with a total or partial 
ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition.

E. Prohibition of Materials From U.S. Species Diagnosed With TSE's 
(Sheep, Goats, Mink, Deer, and Elk)

    This option would involve requiring that ruminants not be fed any 
proteins derived from any U.S. animal species in which a TSE has been 
diagnosed. This includes sheep, goats, mink, deer, and elk. This 
approach would eliminate the scrapie agent, along with TME and CWD, 
from ruminant feed, and thereby reduce the risk of BSE in cattle caused 
by TSE transmission from other species. However, it would not prevent 
the spread of BSE among cattle if BSE occurred for some other reasons, 
e.g., by a spontaneous mutation in cattle or importation of animals 
with BSE, and the animals were processed and subsequently included in 
ruminant feed. As explained in section IX. of this document, this 
option involves lower economic costs than the three options previously 
described, in the absence of a BSE outbreak.

F. Sheep-Specified Offal Prohibition

    The option of prohibiting only protein from specified offal from 
sheep and goats for use in ruminant feed would eliminate the scrapie 
agent from bovine feed. However, it would not prevent the spread of BSE 
among cattle if BSE occurred for some other reason, e.g., by

[[<strong>Page</strong> 569]]

a spontaneous mutation in cattle or importation of animals with BSE, 
and the animals were processed and subsequently included in ruminant 
feed. The agency notes that if it were to select this option, it would 
reconsider its statement in the 1994 proposed rule that sheep less than 
12 months of age presented a minimal risk. Cases of scrapie in sheep as 
young as 7 months have been reported (Ref. 113). Although the risk 
presented by young animals may be minimal, excluding them may provide 
inadequate protection to the public health. As explained in section IX. 
of this document, this option involves lower economic costs than the 
options described previously, in the absence of a BSE outbreak.

G. No Action

    The advantages and disadvantages of this option, in relation to the 
other options, are discussed in detail in section I. of this document 
and in the preceding subsections of this section, as well as the 
environmental and economic sections. In general, this option offers 
lower economic and environmental costs if BSE does not occur in the 
United States, and higher such costs (in addition to public health 
implications) if BSE does occur.

VI. Description of the Proposed Rule

A. Introduction

1. Regulatory Alternatives
    Typically, FDA regulates products that are of public health concern 
through a combination of regulatory tools including: labeling for 
appropriate use; CGMP regulations and, recently, HACCP regulations; 
specifications for the product or its manufacture; and testing to 
determine the presence or level of the agent of concern. Use of two or 
more of these means provides for appropriate reinforcement to ensure 
that the public is protected.
    The agency's choice of readily available approaches for regulating 
animal protein products derived from ruminant and mink tissues is 
limited. For example, there are no practical tests for the presence of 
the TSE agent or of ruminant protein in animal feed. No commercial 
method of deactivating the TSE agent in animal protein products has 
been scientifically validated as effective. None of the agency's CGMP 
or HACCP regulations apply to this situation. Labeling requirements can 
be used but, by themselves, do not meet the agency's regulatory 
objectives.
2. The Regulated Industry
    Often, the industry that manufactures and distributes an FDA-
regulated product is fairly easily characterized. This facilitates 
regulation. That is not the case for animal protein products, as the 
following brief overview makes clear.
    Renderers collect animal tissues from a variety of sources, and 
process these tissues into both protein and nonprotein products. The 
renderers may be specialized (packer/renderer) or independent. The 
packer/renderer, which involves a renderer associated with a large 
slaughter operation, specializes in one species--primarily cattle, 
swine, or poultry. Thus, whether the packer/renderer handles ruminant 
materials is fairly easily determined. The independent renderer, on the 
other hand, obtains a variety of raw materials ranging from restaurant 
scraps to byproducts from multi-species slaughtering operations to dead 
animals obtained from farmers. Typically, the independent renderer does 
not have a practical method to separate incoming ruminant from 
nonruminant materials, and thus commingles both ruminant and 
nonruminant materials in the rendering process. The rendered product is 
typically designated ``meat and bone meal,'' but rendering operations 
produce a variety of other products. Renderers sell their products to 
animal protein blenders, animal feed manufacturers or pet food 
manufacturers. Virtually all rendered material at present is used 
ultimately for pet food or the feed of livestock or poultry.
    Animal protein blenders mix animal and plant protein materials to 
meet a protein guarantee stated on the label, and to make a balanced 
nutritional product. Typically, the blender does not separate ruminant 
from nonruminant animal protein in its blending operation, although it 
may keep mammalian, poultry, fish and soybean meal protein separate at 
least in the initial stages. The blender sells its products to feed or 
pet food manufacturers. Some renderers also blend animal protein 
products.
    Feed manufacturers use the protein material to make a complete feed 
(ready to be feed to animals), or a concentrated feed that needs to be 
further diluted (blended) before it can be fed to animals. The feed may 
be manufactured by an off-farm miller, or on the farm. Feed that is 
manufactured off-farm may be sold to one or more persons (for blending 
and/or further distribution) before reaching the farm.
    Farmers that feed animals typically raise one species, but may have 
more than one (including both ruminants and nonruminants). Only about 
10 percent of all animal protein products are fed to ruminants (mainly 
cattle) but approximately half of all animal protein products comes 
from ruminants.
3. Enforcement Considerations
    The industry scenario described in the preceding section presents 
unique enforcement challenges. The agency is aware, from the comments 
to the ANPRM and other sources, of concerns that the regulatory impact 
be minimized. The agency is also aware of the need to provide incentive 
for innovation, e.g., in testing methodology and manufacturing 
technology, that would reduce the need for regulation. Finally, the 
agency is aware of the need, in designing a regulatory program, to 
acknowledge the different circumstances that exist in the industries 
previously described.
    Therefore, the agency has designed a proposed regulatory scheme 
using the following principles. First, the agency has identified 
minimally necessary requirements to meet its regulatory objectives. The 
agency's goal is to apply risk management principles that minimize 
risk. Second, the proposed regulation applies greater restriction where 
the risk is greater--for example, where a firm handles both ruminant 
and nonruminant materials and intends to keep them separated. Third, 
the agency intends to rely on normal business records for much of the 
documentation it needs.
    A fourth and most important principle concerns the related 
objectives of flexibility and providing incentives to reduce 
recordkeeping and labeling requirements. The proposed regulation 
provides for the reduction or elimination of recordkeeping and labeling 
requirements, upon the development of methods for detection, 
deactivation, or verification of product identity. These provisions are 
described further in the discussion that follows.
    Industry-wide adoption of scientific advances including, or in 
addition to, those specified in the regulation, could ultimately lead 
to amendment or revocation of any final regulation. An example of an 
additional method would be the development of a practical method to 
detect the presence of ruminant protein in animal protein products or 
feed, which could be used for quality control by firms that separate 
ruminant from nonruminant protein, and by firms downstream from 
renderers.
    Similarly, research leading to identification of the TSE causative 
agent and the etiology of BSE, and the characterization of the zoonotic 
nature of animal TSE's, could also lead to amendment or revocation of 
any final regulation.

[[<strong>Page</strong> 570]]

    The agency has tentatively decided not to place any record keeping, 
labeling or other specific requirement on firms that handle only 
protein materials from nonruminant sources. An example would be a 
rendering operation that is part of a swine slaughter operation. 
However, if these firms would use or intend to use animal protein 
products containing ruminant tissues in ruminant feed, or caused such 
use or intended use, the feed would be adulterated under the act.
    The agency has also tentatively decided to require farmers (those 
responsible for feeding ruminant animals) only to make available copies 
of invoices and labeling for feed purchases. Farmers would not be 
required to maintain written procedures for handling animal protein 
products. These minimal requirements would apply even if the farmers 
were feeding both ruminant and nonruminant animals. Purchase records 
would be used primarily for traceback purposes. Because only minimal 
requirements would be placed on farmers, the proposed rules require 
that labeling for the animal protein and feed products caution against 
feeding the products to ruminants. Comments on these two tentative 
decisions are encouraged.

B. Outline of the Proposed Regulation

    The proposed regulation places two general requirements on persons 
that manufacture, blend, process, and distribute animal protein 
products and feeds made from such products. The first requirement is to 
place cautionary labeling on the protein and feed products. The second 
is a requirement to provide FDA with access to sales and purchase 
invoices, for compliance purposes. For example, an invoice obtained 
from a feed manufacturer for a protein product not labeled with the 
cautionary statement could be used to trace back to the supplying 
renderer to ensure that it manufactures and distributes animal protein 
product from nonruminant sources.
    Firms (renderers, blenders, and feed manufacturers and 
distributors) that handle animal protein products from both ruminant 
and nonruminant sources, and that intend to keep the products separate, 
would have certain additional requirements related to their source of 
nonruminant material; the need for separate facilities or cleanout 
procedures; and the need for SOP's. The same requirements would apply 
to firms that handle feeds containing animal protein products from both 
ruminant and nonruminant sources, and that intend to keep the feeds 
separate. Requirements would be greater for these operations because of 
the greater risk they would present for the possibility of ruminant 
protein being fed to ruminants.
    The proposed rule provides that some or all of the regulatory 
requirements would not apply if innovations such as development of test 
methods and deactivation processes for TSE agents were scientifically 
validated and put into commercial use. Provisions for use of such 
methods do not imply that the agency believes that such agents are or 
will be in the animal protein products. The objective is to minimize 
the risk that the agent would occur in the products, regardless of the 
level of risk. Certain minimal but additional requirements would be 
imposed in such circumstances. For example, because the innovations 
likely would be applied by renderers, the renderers would need to 
certify to downstream customers that the methods were being utilized.
    Section 589.2000(a) presents definitions of certain words used in 
the regulation. The definition of ``protein derived from ruminant and 
mink tissues'' excludes blood from bovines, milk proteins, and 
gelatins. Thus, those products are not subject to the regulatory 
provisions of the regulation. The proposed rule does not apply to any 
nonprotein animal tissues such as tallow or other fats. ``Renderer'' 
includes firms, not traditionally considered to be included within the 
definition of that term, but that collect animal tissues from various 
sources and subject them to minimal processing before offering the 
materials for use in animal feed. Also, ``feed manufacturers'' is 
defined to include both off-farm and on-farm feed manufacturing 
operations.
    Section 589.2000(b) declares that protein derived from ruminant and 
mink tissues is not GRAS when intended for use in the feed of ruminant 
animals. The use or intended use of such material in ruminant animal 
feed causes the feed to be adulterated.
    Section 589.2000(c) establishes regulatory requirements for 
renderers that manufacture products that contain or may contain protein 
derived from ruminant and mink tissues. (``May contain'' allows for the 
fact that the renderer may not be able to determine the species of some 
incoming material). These renderers typically process both ruminant and 
nonruminant materials, but do not attempt to separate ruminant from 
nonruminant materials. Section 589.2000(e) covers renderers that intend 
to separate such materials. As mentioned, renderers that process 
exclusively nonruminant materials are not covered by the specific 
requirements of the regulation. Section 589.2000(c) applies to animal 
protein products intended for use in animal feeds, as well as animal 
feeds containing such products.
    Two requirements would be placed on renderers covered by 
Sec. 589.2000(c). First, they would be required to label their products 
to indicate that they contain (or may contain) protein derived from 
ruminant and mink tissues, and that the materials should not be fed to 
ruminant animals or used to manufacture feed for ruminants. Second, the 
renderers would be required to maintain copies of sales invoices for 
all their animal protein products, and to make those copies readily 
available for inspection. As an example, FDA would use the invoices to 
follow up with customers to verify that the customers are not using the 
products to manufacture ruminant feed. Because sales invoices are 
normal business records, the agency believes that the additional burden 
imposed by this requirement would be minimal.
    Section 589.2000(c) renderers would be exempted from the labeling 
and record requirements if they used a manufacturing method that 
deactivates the agent that causes TSE's, or a test method that detects 
the presence of the agent that causes TSE's. Both methods would have to 
be validated by FDA, and made available to the public. The regulation 
would require ``routine'' use. That is, renderers would be required to 
use the test method on all incoming material or in each batch it 
manufactures.
    Section 589.2000(c) renderers would be exempted from the record 
requirements (but not the labeling requirement) if they used a safe 
method to mark the presence of the materials. The marking could be 
visible to the naked eye, e.g., through use of a dye, or by a nonvisual 
means. One ANPRM comment recommended use of a colored uniform fine iron 
product to identify specific feed ingredients. If the marking is not 
visible, the marking agent must be detectable by a method that has been 
validated by FDA, and made available to the public. The mark must be 
permanent, i.e., it must be visible in mixed feed as used on the farm.
    Section 589.2000(d) establishes regulatory requirements for persons 
other than renderers and persons responsible for feeding ruminants that 
handle animal protein products or feeds containing such products. This 
includes protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors. 
However, as in the case of renderers, those firms that would otherwise 
be included in Sec. 589.2000(d) but that handle both ruminant and 
nonruminant

[[<strong>Page</strong> 571]]

materials and intend to separate the materials would be covered by 
Sec. 589.2000(e) instead. Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and 
distributors, that handle only nonruminant materials are excluded from 
the regulatory requirements of the proposed rule.
    Persons covered by Sec. 589.2000(d) would be subject to the same 
requirements as renderers, i.e., labeling and records. The records 
would include invoices both to cover purchases and sales of animal 
protein products and feeds containing those products. For on-farm 
mixers, production records could be substituted for sales invoices.
    Section 589.2000(d) firms would be exempt from the labeling and 
record requirements if they purchased materials from renderers that 
certified the use of deactivation or detection methods as described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c). They would also be exempt from the labeling and 
record requirements if they purchased materials from persons other than 
renderers who certified that they purchased materials from renderers 
who certified the use of deactivation and detection methods as 
described in Sec. 589.2000(c). Paragraph (d) firms would also be exempt 
if they used the deactivation or detection methods described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c), where use of such method is appropriate for the 
particular firm.
    Paragraph (d) firms would be exempt from the record requirements if 
they purchased visibly-marked materials, or purchased from renderers 
that certified the use of marking methods as described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c). They would also be exempt from the record 
requirements if they used the marking methods as described in 
Sec. 589.2000(c).
    Section 589.2000(e) establishes regulatory requirements for 
renderers, protein blenders, feed manufacturers and distributors, and 
independent haulers that handle both ruminant and nonruminant 
materials, and intend to keep the products separate. Section 
589.2000(e) establishes four kinds of requirements. First, the firms 
would have the same labeling and recordkeeping requirements as 
specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of Sec. 589.2000, except that the 
labeling requirement would apply only to the ruminant and mink 
materials. Second, a renderer's source of nonruminant protein materials 
would be limited to single-species facilities, i.e., facilities 
slaughtering only swine. A renderer could purchase nonruminant protein 
from more than one single-species facility. The agency believes that 
this restriction is necessary because of its understanding that it is 
not likely to be feasible for mixed species slaughterhouses to 
undertake the additional compliance costs, and possibly additional 
facility costs, that would be required to assure separation of ruminant 
and nonruminant materials. The restriction would therefore help assure 
that enforcement of Sec. 589.2000(e) would be practicable. However, the 
agency specifically requests comments on this provision.
    Third, the firms would be required to establish separate equipment 
and facilities for the two kinds of materials, or cleanout procedures 
to prevent cross contamination. Fourth, the firms would need to 
establish written SOP's specifying the cleanout procedures, if used, 
and specifying procedures for separating the materials from the time of 
receipt until the time of shipment. Although Sec. 589.2000(e) applies 
to several different kinds of firms, the agency's preliminary 
expectation is that only feed manufacturers and distributors will find 
it feasible to separate ruminant and nonruminant materials. As an 
example, a feed manufacturer might obtain ruminant materials from an 
independent renderer and swine materials from a packer/renderer, and 
use these materials to manufacture feed both for ruminants and 
nonruminants. The feed manufacturer would be required to meet the 
criteria listed previously, including the use of separate equipment and 
facilities or cleanout procedures, and the establishment of SOP's. The 
requirements of Sec. 589.2000(e) would be applicable in the 
transportation process, whether the material is hauled by the feed 
manufacturer or another party such as an independent hauler. The 
requirement for separate facilities, procedures or SOP's would not 
apply to a firm, e.g., a feed mill or hauler, that handles only 
nonruminant materials, or only ruminant materials. Nor would it apply 
to a firm that handles both ruminant and nonruminant materials but does 
not attempt to separate the two kinds of materials.
    The paragraph (e) firms would be exempted from the labeling and/or 
record keeping requirements, and the requirements related to sourcing, 
facilities and SOP's, if they meet the appropriate criteria for 
exemption. That is, renderers covered by Sec. 589.2000(e) would be 
exempt from the labeling and recordkeeping requirements if they used 
deactivation or detection methods, and from the recordkeeping 
requirements if they used marking methods. Blenders and feed 
manufacturers and distributors would be exempt in a similar manner.
    Section 589.2000(f) establishes requirements for those who are 
responsible for feeding ruminant animals. The only requirement 
contained in this paragraph is that those persons make available to FDA 
copies of purchase invoices and labeling for all incoming feeds. 
However, Sec. 589.2000(f) does not apply to the feed manufacturing 
portion of farms and feedlots that have on-farm feed manufacturing 
operations. Section 589.2000 (d) and (e) would apply in those 
instances. Furthermore, persons who feed or intend to feed ruminant 
protein to ruminant animals would be subject to regulatory action for 
using or intending to use an unapproved feed additive as established in 
Sec. 589.2000 (b).
    Section 589.2000(g) establishes that violations of Sec. 589.2000 
(c) through (f) would cause animal protein products or feed containing 
animal protein products to be adulterated under sections 402(a)(4) or 
402(a)(2)(d) of the act, or misbranded under section 403(a)(1).
    Section 589.2000(h) establishes inspection and records retention 
requirements for persons covered by section 589.2000 (c) through (f). 
Records that are required under those paragraphs would need to be kept 
for a minimum of 2 years. The agency believes that this time period is 
adequate for purposes of verifying compliance with the regulation's 
procedural requirements. The agency invites comments on the need for a 
longer retention period related to the BSE incubation period, 
especially the practicality of using such records for epidemiologic 
investigation.
    Section 589.2000(h) also requires that written procedures required 
by the regulation be made available for inspection and copying by FDA. 
The written procedures referred to are those specified in 
Sec. 589.2000(e)(3). Affected firms would be required to have a copy of 
the current procedures available at all times.

VII. Specific Protein Sources

    A number of comments discussed the exemption of certain tissues, 
including fluids, from any prohibitory rule. Most commentors favored 
the exemption of one or more tissues, including milk products; blood 
products; skeletal muscle and gelatin; and a variety of other tissues 
including both protein and nonprotein materials. Most of the comments 
cited published studies as well as positions taken by the European 
Union, European Commission, WHO and the government of France. The 
agency's comments on the status of milk, gelatin and blood follow. In 
addition, we discuss a comment on the use of canine and feline derived 
protein.

[[<strong>Page</strong> 572]]

A. Milk Proteins

    Data available to the agency suggests that milk proteins do not 
transmit the TSE agent. Research with oral exposure, intracerebral, and 
intraperitoneal administration of milk or mammary glands from BSE-
infected bovine to normal and BSE-sensitive mice has not demonstrated 
the development of TSE's (Refs. 42 and 52). An expert group under the 
auspices of WHO recommended that all countries prohibit the use of 
ruminant tissues in ruminant feed. The WHO expert group also declared 
that milk and milk products, including such products from the United 
Kingdom, are safe for human consumption. In addition, OIE has 
recommended, because of lack of infectivity, that restriction of import 
or transit of milk products from healthy animals from BSE countries 
need not be instituted. Therefore, the proposed rules provide that 
protein derived from ruminant tissues does not include milk proteins 
derived from bovine, ovine, caprine, and cervine.

B. Gelatin Proteins

    Data available to the agency suggest that gelatin does not transmit 
the TSE agent. The WHO has concluded that gelatin in the food chain is 
considered to be safe, as the conventional manufacturing process for 
gelatin has been demonstrated to significantly inactivate any residual 
infective activity that may have been present in source tissues (Ref. 
2). FDA concurs with this statement and the scientific information on 
which it is based. Thus, the proposed rule excludes gelatin from 
protein derived from ruminant tissues.

C. Blood Meal Proteins

    Data available to the agency suggests that bovine blood components 
do not transmit the TSE agent (Refs. 56, 78, and 94). Therefore, the 
proposed rule does not include blood meal from bovine as a protein 
derived from ruminant tissues.

D. Canine and Feline Derived Proteins

    One comment suggesting that canine- and feline-derived proteins 
should not be fed to ruminants because of the finding of FSE in 
domestic cats in the United Kingdom. The agency is also aware of an 
ethically-based objection by some to the rendering of the carcasses of 
pet animals. TSE has not been diagnosed in dogs or other canines. FSE 
has not been diagnosed in the United States. The agency has considered 
the information provided by the comments and the published scientific 
literature (Refs. 26 and 27), and has preliminarily determined that 
there is no measurable risk of the spread of TSE's from canine- or 
feline-derived proteins to ruminants in the United States. However, the 
agency is inviting further comment on this issue.

VIII. Environmental Impact

    FDA has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of 
this proposed rule and of five possible alternative actions. In doing 
so, the agency reviewed ANPRM comments submitted by a number of 
organizations and individuals. The comments were mostly concerned with 
the volume of material (e.g., dead animals and slaughter byproducts) 
that would be affected, and the nonrendering or rendering alternative 
means by which these materials could be disposed of, or utilized, 
safely. Comments suggested a number of uses for the processed 
materials, other than ruminant feed, including use in nonruminant 
animal feed and fertilizers, and disposal methods such as on-farm 
burial, landfilling, and incineration.
    In the environmental assessment that accompanies this proposed 
rule, FDA evaluated the environmental consequences of six different 
options. These included: No action; ruminant and mink-to-ruminant 
prohibition (the proposed action); partial ruminant and mink-to-
ruminant prohibition; mammalian-to-ruminant prohibition; prohibition of 
feeding tissues from any animal species in which TSE has been detected 
in the United States; and sheep and goat specified offal prohibition.
    The environmental assessment considered each of the alternatives in 
the context of two scenarios. The first assumes that BSE does not occur 
in the United States, regardless of the alternative selected. The 
second scenario assumes that BSE does occur in the United States, again 
regardless of the alternative selected. In the first scenario, the 
assessment considered environmental impacts related to on-farm 
disposal, landfill, incineration, and industry wastes produced. The 
second scenario considered environmental impacts related to production 
losses and impacts, wildlife exposure, on-farm disposal, landfill, and 
incineration.
    In the first scenario (no BSE), the ``no action'' alternative does 
not have environmental consequences because it is the ``status quo'' or 
baseline alternative. Environmental impacts for the other alternatives 
ranged from slight to moderate increases in environmental effects. For 
the proposed option (ruminant-to-ruminant) there would be moderate 
increases in environmental effects from on-farm disposal and landfill 
use, and slight increases in the other effects. Increases in waste 
disposal (on-farm, landfill, etc.) are anticipated to be temporary, 
however, as the markets are expected to adjust quickly to the more 
restricted uses of the ruminant materials.
    In the second scenario (occurrence of BSE), the greatest negative 
environmental effect would occur in the case of the ``no action'' 
alternative. This is because the likely spread of the BSE agent through 
animal feed before the first BSE case is diagnosed would result in 
disposal of large numbers of animals by means other than rendering. 
Similar large impacts would occur with the sheep and goat, and TSE 
animal, options. Minimum environmental consequences would occur with 
the proposed option (ruminant-to-ruminant), because the spread of the 
BSE agent would have been controlled. Minimum to small effects would 
result from the remaining two options, partial ruminant prohibition and 
mammalian-to-ruminant prohibition.
    The agency has concluded that the proposed rule will not have a 
significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental 
impact statement is not required. FDA's finding of no significant 
impact (FONSI) and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in 
an environmental assessment (EA) prepared under 21 CFR 25.31, may be 
seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. 
and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FDA invites comments and submission 
of data concerning the EA and FONSI.

IX. Analysis of Impacts

    FDA has examined the impacts of the proposed rule under Executive 
Order 12866, under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612), 
and under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (Pub. L. 104-4). Executive 
Order 12866 directs agencies to assess all costs and benefits of 
available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to 
select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including 
potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other 
advantages; and distributive impacts and equity). The Regulatory 
Flexibility Act requires agencies to analyze regulatory options that 
would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. The 
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires that agencies prepare an 
assessment of anticipated costs and benefits before proposing any rule 
that may result in an annual expenditure by State, local, and tribal 
governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of 
$100,000,000 (adjusted annually for inflation). FDA

[[<strong>Page</strong> 573]]

concludes that this proposed rule is consistent with the principles set 
forth in the Executive Order and in these two statutes.
    A study of the impacts on industry of the proposed rule (on file 
with the Docket Management Branch (Ref. 114)) conducted for FDA by the 
Eastern Research Group (ERG), a private consulting firm, and the 
discussion in the remainder of this section, demonstrate that the 
proposed rule constitutes an economically significant rule as described 
in the Executive Order. The agency has further determined that the 
proposed rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of 
small entities. The proposal makes no mandates on government entities 
and is estimated to result in aggregate net annual costs ranging from 
$21.4 to $48.2 million to the private sector.

A. The Need for Regulation

    Although BSE has not been diagnosed in the United States, the need 
for regulatory action is based on a need to protect U.S. livestock from 
the risk of contracting BSE. In its guidelines for the preparation of 
Economic Impact Analyses, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
directs Federal regulatory agencies to determine whether a market 
failure exists, and if so, whether that market failure could be 
resolved by measures other than new Federal regulation. In this 
instance, private incentive systems for both suppliers and purchasers 
may fail in markets for cattle, rendering, and ruminant feed. The 
potential for market failure among the suppliers in these sectors 
results from the externality that could be created by individual 
suppliers imposing economic hardships on other suppliers within the 
industry. The potential for market failure among the purchasers results 
from the inadequate information that would be available to purchasers 
of potentially infective products.
    Any renderer, feed manufacturer, or cattle producer that permits 
animal protein derived from ruminants and mink to be placed in ruminant 
feed increases the risk that other renderers, feed manufacturers, or 
cattle producers will suffer the severe economic consequences that 
would follow an outbreak of BSE in the United States. The industry is 
aware of this risk, as evidenced by the existence of voluntary programs 
aimed at reducing the transmission of the infectious agent. These 
include an adult sheep rendering ban recommended by the NRA, a 
recommended ban on the feeding of rendered ruminant protein to 
ruminants by the NCBA and others, and scrapie-free certification 
programs by individual sheep producers. Although the benefits of such 
programs--the reduction or elimination of the risk of an outbreak of 
BSE and the increased consumer confidence in the safety of the 
industries' products--accrue to all members of these industries, 
compliance with these measures is incomplete, because individual 
noncomplying members can avoid the costs of risk reduction measures 
while still enjoying the benefits of compliance by others in the 
industry.
    If purchasers could easily identify the risks of infective agent 
contamination associated with products from specific suppliers, they 
could more easily take defensive actions to reduce these risks (e.g., 
refusing products from cattle known to have consumed specified ruminant 
proteins). Purchasers are unlikely to obtain the information they need, 
however, for several reasons. First, the long incubation period for BSE 
creates a lag between the actual onset and the recognition of the 
disease and could lead to a suboptimal level of risk prevention by the 
concerned parties during the incubation period. By the time the first 
signs of disease are observed, many animals may have been already 
exposed. Moreover, renderers sell their product to feed manufacturers 
who frequently combine proteins from many different plant sources and 
animal species to produce cattle feed. Ruminant producers, therefore, 
have no sure way of knowing whether a particular batch of feed is free 
from potentially infective proteins and cannot easily avoid purchasing 
risky feed. Finally, if renderers or feed manufacturers do not believe 
that BSE is an important threat they may choose not to take preventive 
action, regardless of the risk levels perceived by epidemiological 
experts or consumers.

B. Benefits

    The proposed rule would reduce the risk of an outbreak and 
subsequent proliferation of BSE disease in the United States. It may 
also forestall the loss of consumer confidence in the U.S. beef market 
due to concerns about BSE and its implications. Thus, the benefits of 
this proposal would include the value of reduced risks to human and 
animal health and to the economic stability of the U.S. livestock and 
livestock dependent industries compared to the ``no action'' option. In 
technical terms, these benefits measure the expected value of the 
future disease-related costs that might be averted by the proposed 
rule. Specifically, they are calculated as a product of three factors: 
(1) The probability that, in the absence of this rule, BSE would be 
introduced and proliferate in the United States, (2) the costs, both 
direct and indirect, that would be associated with the spread of BSE in 
the United States, and (3) the extent to which the proposed rule would 
reduce the likelihood of BSE proliferation.
    BSE has not been detected in the United States and the probability 
that it currently exists is remote. Nevertheless, it is possible that 
BSE could develop in the future. Once developed, BSE could remain 
undetected for several years because of its long incubation period and 
because, at present, it can be diagnosed reliably only by microscopic 
brain examination after death. During the period between introduction 
and diagnosis, the disease could spread as it apparently did in the 
U.K. via intake of infective feed. If regulation was delayed until 
after discovery, the costs would be substantial. By addressing the 
central risk factors associated with BSE, FDA believes that the 
proposed rule would eliminate the vast majority of the BSE-related 
risks and costs.
    BSE was first detected in the U.K. in November 1986, and a ban on 
ruminant offal in ruminant feed was imposed in the U.K. in July 1988 
(Ref. 115). An analysis of cattle born before and after the feed ban 
went into effect suggests that the feed ban significantly decreased 
disease transmission (Ref. 116). This analysis found that the incidence 
of confirmed BSE roughly doubled each year for animals born between 
July 1985 and July 1988, but declined precipitously in animals born in 
August 1988 compared to the previous year and continued to fall 
thereafter. Because BSE has a long incubation period, however, a 
decrease in the incidence was not evident until several years after the 
initial feed ban was implemented. The incidence of BSE peaked in 1992 
at 36,681 detected cases, or approximately 0.3 percent of the UK's 11.5 
million cattle. Despite a sharp decrease in the incidence rate since 
then, by the end of 1996, more than 165,000 cases of BSE will have been 
detected, with one-third of all U.K. cattle herds infected (Refs. 115 
and 117).
    The likelihood that BSE will someday be developed in the United 
States cannot be estimated with any confidence, although U.S. risk 
factors are believed to be significantly smaller than existed in the 
United Kingdom of the early 1980's. As described previously, the 
various remaining modes include transmission from scrapie-infected 
sheep or other animals with TSE, e.g., through meat and bone meal; 
introduction via imported

[[<strong>Page</strong> 574]]

animals; and spontaneous introduction (which in some TSE's has been 
hypothesized to occur at a rate of about 1 case per million per year). 
USDA import controls and the voluntary bans on sheep offal and ruminant 
tissues in ruminant foods reduce the risk of disease introduction but 
cannot completely eliminate it.
    Although FDA cannot quantitatively estimate the risk of a 
significant BSE outbreak in the United States, the agency has used the 
U.K. experience, modified to account for major differences in 
circumstances, to assess the consequences of the potential spread of 
the disease within the United States. If BSE were introduced in this 
country, the pattern of disease spread would presumably be similar to 
that in the United Kingdom, with most symptomatic disease appearing in 
older cattle (the average time for BSE symptoms is approximately 5 
years after infection (Ref. 115)). The rate of spread of symptomatic 
disease would probably differ, however, because compared with the pre-
BSE U.K. dairy industry, U.S. dairy cows are younger and are exposed to 
meat and bone meal in feed later in life than was true in the United 
Kingdom (Ref. 118). United Kingdom dairy animals were historically fed 
meat and bone meal as calves, whereas U.S. dairy cows ingest meat and 
bone meal primarily as adults.
1. Methodology
    To develop an illustrative estimate of the number of cattle that 
might be lost to BSE infection if the disease were to occur in the 
United States in the absence of regulation, FDA extrapolated from the 
experience in the United Kingdom, but adjusted for the differences in 
cattle age and potential age of exposure to meat and bone meal. This 
extrapolation assumes that the detection of BSE in this country would 
quickly lead to a ruminant-to-ruminant feed prohibition but that, as in 
the United Kingdom, BSE incidence would nonetheless continue to 
increase for 6 years due to the disease's long incubation time (hence 
several years of disease spread before the diagnosis of the first 
case). To account for the difference in cattle age-related risk 
factors, FDA assumed that, if BSE occurred in the United States, the 
affected animals would be predominately dairy cows of age 4 or more, 
rather than age 3 and up as in the U.K. (due to the differences in age 
of exposure.) The difference of 1 year is based on the agency's 
estimate that U.S. cattle are first exposed to meat and bone meal 1 
year later than U.K. cattle. Therefore, the onset of the clinical 
disease is estimated to start 1 year later. Accordingly, only 47 
percent of U.S. dairy cows are age 4 and up (about 4.8 million cows), 
while 90 percent of United Kingdom cows are age 3 and up (about 2.6 
million cows). Thus, a lower percentage of U.S. cattle were assumed to 
be at risk of symptomatic BSE, and the projected rate of death was 
proportionately lower. Based on the relative size of the U.S. and U.K. 
dairy cattle populations, these projections suggest that if BSE were 
introduced in the United States and spread in a similar manner, the 
disease would destroy 299,000 U.S. cattle over 11 years (4.8 x 2.6 x 
162,000 U.K. BSE deaths). (These calculations assume that a feed 
prohibition would be implemented very soon after the first case is 
diagnosed, and that the prohibition would immediately begin to affect 
the underlying rate of new infection. If a feed prohibition were not 
implemented at that time, the number of cattle deaths would be much 
higher.)
    Other adjustments could be made to this estimate, but their effect 
on the direction of the results would be uncertain. For example, 
compared with U.K. practices before 1988, U.S. dairy cattle consume a 
higher proportion of concentrated feed that contains meat and bone 
meal. On the other hand, most U.S. concentrate contains a lower 
percentage of meat and bone meal (and a higher percentage of vegetable-
based proteins). If BSE infectivity in feed is highly dose-dependent, 
these factors could cause FDA's cost estimate to be either too high or 
too low, if one of the factors is dominant over the other.
    The risks and costs associated with BSE when it occurs are 
primarily of three types. First, there is the possible risk and 
associated cost of ruminant-to-human transmission of TSE disease. The 
proposed rule would reduce this risk by eliminating the main routes by 
which ruminants might acquire transmissible TSE, greatly reducing any 
risk incurred by the human consumption of ruminant-derived products. 
Thus, the proposed rule would reduce the risk of future mortality, 
morbidity, and health care costs due to human TSE. Second, there is the 
risk of livestock losses. These losses include not only the deaths of 
BSE-infected animals, but also the loss and disposal costs of other 
animals that would be destroyed, either to contain the immediate spread 
of disease or to restore consumer confidence in the safety of beef and 
dairy products. Third, there are the costs associated with decreased 
domestic sales and exports of beef and other bovine-derived products 
until consumer and international confidence could be restored.
2. Reduced Risk to Public Health
    As discussed earlier, scientists believe that the nv-CJD cases 
identified in the U.K. may have been associated with the BSE epidemic. 
If indeed there were such an association, and if BSE were to occur in 
this country, there would be a risk of spreading BSE-related human TSE 
in the United States The proposed rule therefore might avert human 
deaths in the United States, although the number of deaths cannot be 
estimated. The proposed rule would also save the health care and other 
costs associated with treating individuals with the disease.
3. Reduced Risk of Direct Livestock Losses
    For estimating the present value of livestock losses if BSE 
occurred in the United States, FDA assumed that the first case of BSE 
would not be detected--even in the absence of the proposed rule--for 4 
years. Based on an estimated value of $502 per animal (Ref. 119) and 
disposal costs of $4 per animal, direct losses from the death of 
299,000 BSE-infected cattle would reach $151 million over 11 years 
(starting 4 years from now). At a discount rate of 7 percent, the total 
present value of these losses is $75 million.
    In addition to the animal losses from direct infection, a 
significant outbreak would probably lead to the eradication of high-
risk animals to restore consumer confidence. Switzerland, for example, 
has proposed slaughtering all cattle born before that country 
implemented a feed ban, or approximately one-eighth of its national 
herd (Ref. 120). The United Kingdom has begun a program to destroy and 
incinerate all animals over age 30 months as they reach the end of 
their useful life, or about 1 million animals in 1996 and a total of 
4.7 million over 6 years. In addition, the United Kingdom has a program 
to slaughter some unmarketable male dairy calves (126,000 had been 
slaughtered as of August 1996) and up to 147,000 additional ``high-
risk'' animals (Refs. 115 and 121). Even if the U.K. eradication of 
animals were limited to a one-time total of 1 million cattle (about 8.7 
percent of their cattle stock), similar measures in the United States, 
if they occurred immediately upon detection of the disease, would 
result in the one-time destruction of $4.58 billion worth of cattle, 
with a present value of $3.49 billion.
4. Costs of Future Regulation
    Moreover, the ability to control a BSE outbreak once it occurred 
would require putting in place restrictions on the use

[[<strong>Page</strong> 575]]

of ruminant proteins in ruminant feeds that would be at least as 
restrictive as the measure under this proposed rule. Presumably, the 
total costs of implementing a ruminant-to-ruminant feed prohibition at 
that point would be at least as great as the low estimates for this 
proposed rule, or $21.4 million per year. The present value of these 
future regulatory costs would total approximately $240 million. 
Moreover, this estimate may vastly understate the economic impact 
because the market value of ruminant-derived proteins could disappear 
if there were an actual outbreak.
5. Reduced Risk of Losses in Domestic Sales and Exports
    If BSE were to emerge in the United States, the news could greatly 
reduce both domestic sales and exports of bovine products. In the 
United Kingdom, domestic consumption fell by more than 20 percent 
between 1988 and 1990 and has not yet fully recovered (Ref. 122), 
presumably due to continuing concerns about possible links between BSE 
and CJD. If U.S. consumers acted similarly, U.S. producers of beef 
products could lose over $9 billion in annual sales (Ref. 123). 
Alternatively, U.S. consumers might demonstrate considerably less 
concern, as the U.K. experience may have improved the ability of U.S. 
risk managers to communicate both the extent of the risk of contracting 
CJD from the consumption of beef and the responsiveness of the 
government's safety policies. Nonetheless, it remains probable that the 
uncertainty surrounding a serious BSE outbreak would lead U.S. 
consumers to reduce their consumption and spending on beef by a 
significant amount. Also, at the same time that U.K. domestic sales of 
beef were declining due to the fear of BSE, the volume of U.K. exported 
beef fell by nearly 16 percent (Ref. 122). Based on U.S. beef exports 
in 1994 of approximately $2.2 billion (Ref. 109), a proportional 
decline of this magnitude would reduce U.S. exports by up to $0.3 
billion per year.
    While the values of such lost domestic and international sales 
would reduce the profits of the U.S. beef industry and the enjoyment of 
some U.S. consumers of beef, they do not provide an accurate measure of 
societal costs, because competitor industries, such as poultry, pork, 
and seafood, would gain new profits. Thus, the net costs that would 
result from such potential shifts in consumer spending cannot be 
precisely discerned without extensive economic modeling. While FDA 
examined a partial equilibrium model for projecting the approximate 
losses of consumer and producer surplus within the market for beef 
products, the agency could not adequately quantify the likely effects 
on the markets for substitutes of beef. Consequently, FDA could not 
estimate the net economic cost of these lost sales. Nevertheless, the 
magnitude of these potential costs could be substantial and the agency 
requests public comment on how the appropriate measurement 
methodologies could be developed and applied.
    Finally, even in the absence of evidence of BSE in the United 
States, consumer concern about BSE could affect beef consumption and 
expenditures. Thus, one benefit of implementing the proposed rule now 
is that it might prevent a loss of consumer confidence in the beef 
market, irrespective of the actual risk of BSE. FDA did not attempt to 
quantify this potential loss, but believes that it also may be 
substantial, particularly in light of the recent increased U.S. 
publicity of BSE and its hypothesized links to CJD.
6. Total Losses Averted
    In summary, the losses averted by the proposed rule include the 
expected value of the costs associated with BSE itself, and the 
potential value of forestalling a drop in domestic and international 
demand for U.S. beef due to BSE-related causes. The first component 
largely reflects the statistical probability that BSE could occur and 
spread within the United States and the potential $3.7 billion cost of 
destroying BSE-exposed livestock. The second primarily measures the 
expected loss to U.S. consumers and producers that would result from 
reduced sales. While FDA has not quantified these latter costs, 
plausible scenarios indicate that they could reach billions of dollars. 
Moreover, these figures have not included the possibility of lost lives 
and treatment costs associated with treating human TSE.
    Finally, the expected benefits of the proposed rule are slightly 
lower than the sum of the expected value of all the costs associated 
with BSE, because the rule would not totally eliminate all of the 
related risk (e.g., due to the possibility of spontaneous introduction 
of disease and the possible incomplete compliance with the rule). FDA 
believes, however, that any remaining risk would be extremely small. In 
addition, because the rate of BSE infection and the associated costs 
would probably vary geographically (as scrapie does now) (Ref. 98) , 
the benefits would vary across regions of the country.
7. Comparison of Alternatives
    As described elsewhere in this document, FDA is considering five 
alternatives to the proposed rule, in addition to other options that 
might be offered in the comments. The first three of these alternatives 
are: (1) No action (relying on voluntary industry activities), (2) 
prohibit only materials from U.S. species in which TSE has been 
diagnosed, and (3) a prohibition on proteins from specified sheep and 
goat offal in ruminant feed. Compared with the proposed action, 
prohibiting proteins from all U.S. TSE species provides similar 
reductions in the risk that BSE might be introduced, with a sheep/goat 
specified offal protein ban and no action providing progressively less 
risk reduction. The TSE species alternative, however, would be 
significantly less effective in limiting the spread of BSE (e.g., after 
spontaneous introduction) until BSE was diagnosed and cattle were added 
to the list of TSE species. Likewise, the two other alternatives would 
be significantly less effective in inhibiting the spread of ruminant-
to-ruminant transmission of disease once BSE is introduced. Thus, the 
expected value of the benefits of each of the three rejected options is 
substantially lower than the proposed rule, although the amount of 
difference cannot be estimated precisely.
    The agency is also considering two other alternatives: (1) A 
mammalian-protein-to-ruminant prohibition, and (2) a partial ruminant-
to-ruminant prohibition which would exclude all ruminant and mink 
tissues except certain bovine tissues. Compared with the proposed rule, 
both alternatives offer similar benefits in substantially inhibiting 
the initial introduction of BSE. The extent of inhibition of the spread 
of disease (and associated costs), however, would be different.
    The mammalian protein alternative would further reduce the spread 
of disease compared with the proposed rule, by reducing the risk of 
cross-contamination within rendering and processing plants. Thus, this 
alternative would bring the expected value of the BSE-related costs 
even closer to zero than would the proposed measure. However, the 
incremental benefit is small if cross- contamination under the proposed 
measure does not pose a substantial risk.
    The partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition would be less 
effective than the proposed measure, because it would be more 
administratively difficult to enforce. Thus, this alternative would not 
reduce the expected value of the

[[<strong>Page</strong> 576]]

BSE-related costs as much as the proposal. Again, however, the exact 
difference cannot be estimated, but would vary depending on the likely 
level of compliance under the alternative.

C. Industry Impacts

    The ERG study examines the composition, size, and scale of economic 
activity for the various affected industry sectors and provides 
estimates of the cost and high and low market impacts (depending on the 
size of the price change for restricted meat and bone meal of five 
regulatory options (see Table 1).

1. The Proposed Rule
    The proposed alternative would prohibit the use of ruminant and 
mink protein in ruminant feeds. Currently, only about 10 percent of the 
meat and bone meal supply is used in ruminant feed, but over 80 percent 
of the meat and bone meal contains some ruminant material. ERG forecast 
that because no mixed-species slaughtering or rendering establishments 
would find it profitable to separate ruminant from nonruminant offal, 
most would continue to contain ruminant material. ERG estimated that 
affected renderers and feedmills would incur total direct compliance 
costs ranging from $10.2 to $27.6 million per year. Renderers would 
bear annual costs of about $6.3 million and feed mills would bear 
annual costs of from $3.8 to $21.3 million. Arrayed by compliance 
category, transportation costs were estimated at $7.6 million; 
documentation costs for activities to ensure control of ruminant feed 
constituents ranged from $1.5 to $1.8 million; and capital costs and 
operating costs ranged from $1.0 to $8.2 million and $0.1 to $10.1 
million, respectively, due primarily to the need for some feedmills to 
expand their capacity to offer both ruminant and nonruminant feed 
products under a high market impact scenario.
    Because consumer response to the rule is uncertain, ERG could not 
develop a precise projection of future meat and bone meal prices. ERG 
estimated, however, that the regulatory prohibition of marketing 
ruminant meat and bone meal to ruminants would lower the price of this 
product by from $25 to $100 per ton, decreasing rendering industry 
revenues by from $63.2 to $252.8 million per year. In contrast, a lower 
MBM price would increase sales of meat and bone meal to the nonruminant 
sector and the resulting increased profits for that sector would 
offset, at an aggregate level, most revenue losses. Although ERG did 
not quantify this effect, FDA determined that the assumption of a fixed 
supply of meat and bone meal and a linear demand for nonruminant feed 
implies that purchasers of mixed-species meat and bone meal for 
nonruminant uses would save from $60.0 to $240.2 million annually, 
because of the lower meat and bone meal costs. This estimate assumes a 
total meat and bone meal supply of 2.5 million tons, changes in price 
ranging from $25 to $100 per ton, and an increase in nonruminant 
consumption of meat and bone meal of about 250,000 tons. In addition, 
manufacturers of ruminant feed would incur higher costs if they could 
not use ruminant proteins. In an analysis prepared for the feed 
industry, protein substitutes, such as soybean meal and other minerals 
necessary to provide the same nutritional level as that provided by the 
meat and bone meal, were estimated to cost approximately $31.75 per ton 
more than meat and bone meal (Ref. 125). FDA believes that this 
estimate is overstated, because it assumes that soybean meal alone 
sells for $20 per ton more than meat and bone meal. In fact, their 
respective market prices are currently similar. Nevertheless, FDA used 
the reported $31.75 per ton differential to estimate that the higher 
price of alternative proteins would increase ruminant feed costs by 
about $8.0 million per year.
    As a result, FDA estimates that the aggregated annualized costs of 
this proposal, comprised of both the direct compliance costs and the 
various indirect gains and losses, would total

[[<strong>Page</strong> 577]]

from $21.4 to $48.2 million. Although the greatest initial burden would 
fall on the rendering and feed manufacturing sectors, ERG noted that 
the final distribution of these impacts would shift; renderers would 
pass back the economic impacts to slaughterers, who, in turn, would 
pass them back to cattle producers. FDA judged, however, that of the 
small renderers dependent upon farmers' and ranchers' dead stock for 
their raw materials, 20 to 25 would be likely to close. ERG also 
forecast that these impacts would cause a decline in prices for 
slaughter-weight cattle of $1 to $5 per head. In the long run, ERG 
foresaw a modest reduction in the size of the U.S. cattle herd.
    In response to its ANPRM, FDA received comments on the possible 
impacts of the proposal from both individuals and industry. The 
submission from the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA) contained 
an analysis of the animal feed market that was based on the assumption 
that the proposal would taint the safety of all meat and bone meal 
(both ruminant and nonruminant), to the extent that even nonruminant 
animal producers would refuse to purchase the product. This loss of 
wholesale value was estimated at $523 million. Further, the AFIA 
comment estimated the cost for disposing of this meat and bone meal at 
$349 million and for substituting to higher priced feeds at $74 million 
annually.
    FDA questions the conclusions of the AFIA report, largely because 
the proposed rule does not prohibit the use of ruminant proteins in 
nonruminant feeds and there is no evidence that this market would 
disappear. As noted earlier, nonruminant feed use currently constitutes 
about 90 percent of the meat and bone meal market. While some 
nonruminant producers may be wary of ruminant MBM after the proposal 
becomes final, the broad media coverage of BSE in the United Kingdom 
and the voluntary prohibition of ruminant MBM in ruminant feeds have 
already provided nonruminant producers with substantial information on 
the relevant risks. The implications of the ERG study are that most of 
the major nonruminant sectors that use ruminant meat and bone meal in 
their feeds would continue this practice, particularly at sharply lower 
MBM prices. Because ERG believed that all stocks of meat and bone meal 
would find a commercial outlet within the nonruminant feed sector, they 
projected no additional disposal costs and far smaller revenue losses 
than AFIA.
2. Partial Ruminant-to-Ruminant Prohibition
    ERG also estimated the economic impact of a partial ruminant-to-
ruminant prohibition, which would prohibit only the use of proteins 
from designated ruminant tissues in ruminant feeds. ERG projected that 
cattle packer/renderers and approximately one-half of the large cattle 
packers would choose to separate the designated and nondesignated 
tissues. As shown in Table 1, this change in processing would lead to 
increased costs from capital investments, increases in operating and 
transportation expenses, training, and documentation activities. 
Further, ERG projected, under the high market impact scenario, that 
some feedmills would expand their facilities to offer both restricted 
and nonrestricted meat and bone meal. They estimated the annualized 
direct compliance costs for this option at from $23.5 to $27.9 million. 
In addition, ERG projected that this option would cause price declines 
of from $25 to $100 per ton for the meat and bone meal derived from 
designated tissues, leading to decreases in renderer revenues of from 
$28.8 to $115.4 million per year. As discussed previously, FDA again 
assumed a fixed supply of meat and bone meal and a linear demand for 
nonruminant feed to calculate that purchasers of mixed-species meat and 
bone meal for nonruminant uses would save from $27.4 million to $109.6 
million annually because of the lower meat and bone meal costs. Adding 
additional protein substitution costs of $3.7 million and other 
indirect costs raises the estimated net aggregate costs for this 
alternative to $28.6 to $37.4 million.
3. Mammalian-to-Ruminant Prohibition
    The third option assessed was the prohibition of mammalian protein 
in ruminant feeds. ERG projected that slaughtering and rendering 
establishments would have no reason to separate offal because very few 
of these establishments process both mammals and nonmammals. They 
estimated annualized direct compliance costs for this option at $31.6 
million. ERG forecast that, regardless of the size of the price decline 
for restricted meat and bone meal, some feedmills would expand their 
capacity to offer both restricted and nonrestricted meat and bone meal, 
resulting in increased capital and plant operating costs. The majority 
of the remaining regulatory costs are composed of documentation costs. 
Assuming that a regulatory prohibition on marketing restricted meat and 
bone meal to ruminants would cause the price of the restricted meat and 
bone meal to fall by from $25 to $100 per ton, ERG projected that this 
option would reduce renderer revenues by from $76.4 to $305.6 million 
per year. Alternatively, under the same assumptions as applied above, 
FDA found that purchasers of mixed-species meat and bone meal for 
nonruminant uses would save from $72.6 million to $290.3 million 
annually, because of the lower meat and bone meal costs. Adding 
additional protein substitution costs of $9.7 million and other 
indirect costs raises the estimated net aggregate costs for this third 
option to from $45.1 to $56.6 million.
4. Other Regulatory Alternatives
    FDA also considered two less restrictive options for controlling 
the spread of an outbreak of BSE in the United States: A prohibition of 
all sheep, goat, mink, deer, and elk proteins in ruminant feed; and a 
prohibition of sheep and goat proteins in ruminant feed. The first of 
these alternatives would require that ruminants not be fed proteins 
from any species in which a TSE was diagnosed in the United States, 
which includes sheep, goats, mink, deer, and elk. ERG anticipated 
minimal regulatory impacts for sheep, lamb, and goat producers because 
most renderers already require that sheep, lamb, and goat offal be 
excluded from mixed species meat and bone meal. ERG estimated that this 
alternative could restrict the use of up to 34,150 tons of offal 
annually from the various species, or about 0.3 percent of all 
mammalian offal rendered. Using an estimated cost of $150/ton for 
landfill disposal, ERG calculated that the disposal costs for this 
alternative could equal $5.1 million. Furthermore, ERG estimated that 
the meat and bone meal and tallow manufactured from offal generates 
revenues of about $500/ton of processed material. Under this option, 
meat and bone meal production would fall by 8,450 tons per year, 
reducing industry revenues by an estimated $4.2 million annually.
    The final alternative would restrict only sheep and goat protein 
from use in ruminant feed. This alternative is similar to the agency's 
1994 proposal, which pertained only to adult sheep and goats. Most 
sheep and goats are currently excluded by renderers from being rendered 
into mixed species meat and bone meal. ERG estimated that this 
alternative would restrict the use of up to 1,200 tons of offal, or 
about 0.01 percent of all mammalian offal rendered. At $150/ton for 
landfill disposal, the disposal costs would equal $0.2 million. ERG 
calculated that

[[<strong>Page</strong> 578]]

production of meat and bone meal under this option would be restricted 
by only 300 tons per year, leading to revenue losses of about $0.1 
million.
    ERG noted that the disposal costs presented for the latter two 
alternatives are high-end estimates because of the likelihood of onsite 
disposal for deer and elk taken by hunters. Further, these alternatives 
were not expected to have a measurable effect on the price of meat and 
bone meal because they would affect only 0.3 percent and 0.01 percent 
of the meat and bone meal markets, respectively. In contrast to the 
first three options, these rules would not change the demand for meat 
and bone meal, but would restrict the supply of meat and bone meal. Any 
postregulation increase in price, therefore, would increase revenues of 
renderers and costs of purchasers of meat and bone meal by an almost 
equal amount. ERG reported that this decrease in supply would have a 
negligible effect on meat and bone meal prices.

D. Small Business Impacts

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to prepare a 
regulatory flexibility analysis if a rule would have a significant 
impact on a substantial number of small entities. The discussion in 
this section, as well as in other sections of this document, and the 
ERG report, constitute the agency's compliance with this requirement.
    The Regulatory Flexibility Act asks for a succinct statement of the 
purpose and objectives of the rule. As explained previously in this 
document, FDA is proposing this measure to address the risk to U.S. 
livestock associated with feeding ruminant proteins to ruminants. 
Existing epidemiological evidence suggests a link between an outbreak 
of BSE in the United Kingdom and the practice of feeding products to 
cattle that included ruminant proteins. This rule would prohibit that 
practice. Thus, the need for regulatory action is based on the need to 
prevent the spread of BSE and thereby to protect the health of animals 
and to minimize any risk that might be posed to humans from BSE.
    The Regulatory Flexibility Act also requires a description of the 
affected small entities. The ERG study includes counts of entities in 
each class of industry that are involved in ruminant production and 
meat preparation. The vast majority of all of these firms are 
considered small businesses according to size standards set by the 
Small Business Administration. There are 282 rendering plants, of which 
204 have fewer than 500 employees, including all of the 152 independent 
renderers. ERG also estimated that 30,000 feedmills, all with fewer 
than 500 employees, could be affected by this rule. An estimated 1.4 
million enterprises are engaged in ruminant production. These include 
businesses engaged in the production of beef and dairy cattle, 
including farmers and ranchers, stocker operators, and cattle feeders, 
and other ruminant producers. The slaughtering industry contains more 
than 4,000 establishments. Of this total, however, only 130 are packer/
renderers that could have compliance requirements and about 52 of these 
establishments have fewer than 500 employees. ERG estimated that almost 
300,000 small establishments are engaged in meat processing. These 
businesses would have no direct compliance activities, but could be 
affected indirectly by altered renderer practices. Also, about 150,000 
small producers of nonruminant animals could gain from lower feed 
costs.
    The RFA also requires a description of the recordkeeping 
requirements of the proposed rule. The ERG report presents detailed 
estimates of these costs. ERG found that the rule would require certain 
feed manufacturers to develop new written operating procedures. In 
addition, affected firms would have to retain invoices but FDA believes 
this activity is already generally accepted business practice.
    Finally, the Regulatory Flexibility Act asks for an evaluation of 
any regulatory overlaps and regulatory alternatives that would minimize 
costs to small entities. FDA is unaware of any significant regulatory 
conflicts with other Federal rules. FDA examined five regulatory 
alternatives in addition to no action: (1) The ruminant-to-ruminant 
prohibition; (2) the partial ruminant-to-ruminant prohibition; (3) the 
mammalian-to- ruminant prohibition; (4) the prohibition of all sheep, 
goat, mink, deer, and elk proteins in ruminant feed; and (5) the 
prohibition of specified sheep and goat proteins in ruminant feed. The 
ERG report provides a detailed comparison of the respective impacts of 
these alternatives and found that the estimated direct compliance costs 
are lower under the proposed rule ($10.2 to $27.6 million) than under 
two of the alternative rules ($23.5 to $27.9 million for the partial 
ruminant-to-ruminant option, $31.6 million for the mammalian-to-
ruminant option). The other alternatives would not be nearly as 
effective at reducing the risk of an outbreak and spread of BSE, but 
are considerably less costly. As many of the above projections are 
uncertain, FDA particularly invites additional data or comment on the 
effects of the proposed and alternative rules on any group of small 
businesses.

E. Unfunded Mandates Analysis

    Based on the ERG study, FDA estimated that aggregate expenditures 
by the private sector that result from the proposed rule, issued under 
21 CFR 589.2000, will range from $10.2 to $27.6 million per year. As 
described in section IX.B. of this document, the benefits of this 
measure accrue both to the general public (through decreased risks to 
health) and to the livestock and associated industries. The costs of 
the measure are borne by the private sector, primarily the rendering 
and animal feed industries. Because FDA anticipates no significant 
additional costs to State, local, or tribal governments, this 
regulatory action does not require an assessment under the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act.

X. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995

    This proposed rule contains recordkeeping requirements that are 
subject to public comment and review by OMB under the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-13). Therefore, in accordance with 5 
CFR part 1320, a description of reporting requirements is given in 
Table 2 of this document, with an estimate of the annual collection of 
information burden. Included in the estimate is the time for reviewing 
instructions, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing 
and reviewing the collection of information.
    With respect to the following collection of information, FDA is 
soliciting comments on: (1) Whether the proposed collection of 
information is necessary for proper performance of FDA's functions, 
including whether the information will have practical utility; (2) the 
accuracy of FDA's estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of 
information, including the validity of the methodology and assumptions 
used; (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the 
information to be collected; and (4) ways to minimize the burden of the 
collection of information on those who are to respond, including 
through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of 
information technology, when appropriate.
    Title: Substances Prohibited from Use in Animal Food or Feed; 
Animal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed.
    Description: The proposed rule (Sec. 589.2000) provides that 
protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues is not GRAS for use in 
ruminant feed and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the act. 
Proteins derived from

[[<strong>Page</strong> 579]]

animal tissues contained in such feed ingredients in distribution 
cannot be readily determined by recipients engaged in the manufacture, 
processing and distribution, and use of animal feeds and feed 
ingredients. To achieve the public and animal health objectives of this 
proposed rule, the agency believes that manufacturers, processors, 
distributors, and users must be responsible for ensuring and 
appropriately maintaining the identity of the specific nature of the 
components of animal protein products and animal feeds containing these 
products.
    Thus, under the agency's authority in section 701(a) (21 U.S.C. 
371(a)) of the act to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement 
of the act, this proposed rule places three general requirements on 
persons that manufacture, blend, process and distribute products that 
contain or may contain protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues, 
and feeds made from such products. The first requirement is for 
cautionary labeling of these products with direct language developed by 
FDA. The second requirement is for these establishments to provide FDA 
with access to their purchase and sales invoices for compliance 
purposes. FDA believes that maintenance of such records is a usual and 
customary part of normal business activities for such firms. These two 
requirements are not within the scope of the Paperwork Reduction Act. 
The third requirement is recordkeeping which requires that the firms 
develop standard operating procedures if they intend to keep ruminant 
and mink material separate from nonruminant material. The agency is 
aware that the certification procedures provided in Sec. 589.2000(d) of 
the regulation could be interpreted as imposing a paperwork burden on 
certain industry segments. However, the agency notes that the 
certification procedures apply only where new technology (e.g., a 
deactivation method) is developed. The agency was unable to estimate 
when such technology might be developed, what its characteristics and 
costs would be, and other essential information needed to make 
realistic estimates of any paperwork burden. Therefore, such costs are 
not included in this proposed rule. However, the agency specifically 
requests comments and information related to the factors that would 
determine the extent of any paperwork burden.
    The recordkeeping burden in Table 2 has been estimated using the 
typical average size establishment that is expected to handle animal 
protein from both ruminant and nonruminant sources, or feeds containing 
these products, and intend to keep them separate. FDA's preliminary 
estimate is that only a fraction of feed manufacturers and distributors 
will separate their products. Independent renderers were excluded from 
the burden estimates based on information provided for the economic 
estimate. Packer/renderers were excluded because they are single 
species processors.
    Under these recordkeeping requirements, for which records must be 
made available for FDA inspection, an estimated 2,000 feed mills would 
handle both restricted and nonrestricted products and would develop 
standard operating procedures for keeping ruminant and mink material 
separate from nonruminant material from the time of receipt to time of 
shipment. The estimate in the burden chart is based on the time 
required to develop and establish the written procedures and is a one 
time requirement. The 2,000 firms will also incur annual operating cost 
estimated at $10 million, because of the flushing, sequencing and other 
procedures that will be required. It is estimated that 1,000 of the 
firms may incur capital cost for the construction of separate 
facilities. These costs have been annualized for 10 years, at $7.119 
million per year. The remaining firms are expected to be able to meet 
the regulation's requirements without incurring capital cost.
    The agency has submitted copies of the proposed rule to OMB for its 
review of these requirements. Interested persons are requested to send 
comments regarding this collection of information by February 18, 1997, 
but not later than March 4, 1997 to the Office of Information and 
Regulatory Affairs, OMB (address above), Attn: Desk Officer for FDA.
    Description of Respondents: Distributors, feed manufacturers, 
blenders and renderers.

List of Subjects in 21 CFR Part 589

    Animal feeds, Animal foods, Food additives.

    Therefore, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and under 
authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, it is 
proposed that 21 CFR part 589 be amended as follows:

PART 589--SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED FROM USE IN ANIMAL FOOD OR FEED

    1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 589 continues to read as 
follows:

    Authority: Secs. 201, 402, 409, 701 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 342, 348, 371).

    2. New Sec. 589.2000 is added to subpart B to read as follows:


Sec. 589.2000  Animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed.

    (a) Definitions. (1) Protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues 
means any protein-containing portion of ruminant animals or mink, 
excluding blood from bovines, milk proteins and gelatin.
    (2) Renderer means any firm or individual that processes slaughter 
byproducts, animals unfit for human consumption, meat scraps or food 
waste. The term includes persons who collect such materials and subject 
them to minimal processing, or distribute them to firms other than 
renderers whose intended use for the products may include animal feed. 
The term includes renderers that also blend animal protein products.
    (3) Blender means any firm or individual which obtains processed 
animal protein from more than one source or from more than one species, 
and subsequently mixes (blends) or redistributes an animal protein 
product.
    (4) Feed manufacturer and distributor includes manufacturers and 
distributors of complete and intermediate feeds intended for animals, 
and includes on-farm in addition to off-farm feed manufacturing and 
mixing operations.
    (5) Nonruminant protein includes protein from nonruminant animals 
and from vegetable sources.
    (b) Food additive status. The Food and Drug Administration has 
determined that protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues is not 
generally recognized as safe for use in ruminant feed because it may 
contain transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE)-infective 
material, and is a food additive subject to section 409 of the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act). In the absence of a regulation 
providing for its safe use as a food additive under section 409 of the 
act, the use or intended use in ruminant feed of any material that 
contains protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues causes the feed 
to be adulterated and in violation of the act, unless it is the subject 
of an effective notice of claimed investigational exemption for a food 
additive under Sec. 570.17 of this chapter. The Food and Drug 
Administration has determined that ruminant and mink derived protein is 
not prior sanctioned for use in ruminant feeds.
    (c) Requirements for renderers that are not included in paragraph 
(e) of this section. (1) Renderers that manufacture products that 
contain or may contain protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues 
and that are intended for use in animal feed shall take the following 
measures to ensure that materials identified in paragraph (b) of this 
section are not used in the feed of ruminants:
    (i) Label the materials as follows: ``Contains (or may contain) 
protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues. Do not feed to ruminant 
animals, and do not use to manufacture feed intended for ruminant 
animals''; and
    (ii) Maintain copies of sales invoices for the materials, and make 
the copies available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug 
Administration.
    (2) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section will be 
exempted from the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section if they:
    (i) Use exclusively a manufacturing method that has been validated 
by the Food and Drug Administration to deactivate the agent that causes 
TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public; or
    (ii) Use routinely a test method that has been validated by the 
Food and Drug Administration to detect the presence of the agent that 
causes TSE's and whose design has been made available to the public. 
Products found to contain the agent that causes TSE's shall be labeled 
``Not for Use in Animal Feed.'' Records of the test results shall be 
made available for inspection by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (3) Renderers described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section who are 
not exempted under paragraph (c)(2)(i) or paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this 
section will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) 
of this section if they use a permanent method, approved by FDA, to 
mark the presence of the materials. If the marking is by the use of an 
agent that cannot be detected on visual inspection, the renderer must 
use an agent whose presence can be detected by a method that has been 
validated by the Food and Drug Administration and whose design has been 
made available to the public.
    (d) Requirements for protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and 
distributors, that are not included in paragraph (e) of this section. 
(1) Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors, that 
manufacture, blend, process and distribute products that contain or may 
contain protein derived from ruminant and mink tissues shall:
    (i) Comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and
    (ii) Maintain copies of invoices for purchase of animal protein 
products or feeds containing such products, and make copies available 
for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (2) Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors, 
shall be exempt from paragraphs (d)(1)(i) and (d)(1)(ii) of this 
section if they:
    (i) Purchase animal protein products from renderers that certified 
compliance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section or purchase such 
materials from parties

[[<strong>Page</strong> 583]]

that certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that 
certified compliance with paragraph (c)(2); or
    (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this 
section where appropriate.
    (3) Protein blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors, 
shall be exempt from paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section if they:
    (i) Purchase animal protein products that are marked or purchase 
such materials from renderers that certified compliance with paragraph 
(c)(3) of this section, or purchase such materials from parties that 
certify that the materials were purchased from renderers that certified 
compliance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; or
    (ii) Comply with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this 
section where appropriate.
    (4) Copies of certifications as described in paragraphs (d)(2) and 
(d)(3) of this section, shall be made available for inspection and 
copying by the Food and Drug Administration.
    (e) Requirements for persons that intend to separate ruminant/mink 
and nonruminant/mink materials. (1) Renderers, protein blenders, feed 
manufacturers and distributors, haulers and others that manufacture, 
process, blend and distribute both protein products derived from 
ruminant and mink tissues or feeds containing such products, and 
protein products from other animal tissues or feeds containing such 
products, and that intend to keep those products separate shall:
    (i) Comply with paragraphs (c)(1) or (d)(1) of this section as 
appropriate except that the labeling requirement shall apply only to 
products derived from ruminant and mink tissues or feeds containing 
such products;
    (ii) In the case of a renderer, obtain nonruminant (excluding mink) 
materials only from single-species facilities;
    (iii) Provide for measures to avoid commingling or cross-
contamination:
    (A) Maintain separate equipment or facilities for the manufacture, 
processing, or blending of such materials; or
    (B) Use clean-out procedures or other means adequate to prevent 
carry-over of ruminant and mink derived protein into animal protein 
products or feeds that may be used for ruminants; and
    (iv) Maintain written procedures specifying the clean-out 
procedures or other means, and specifying the procedures for separating 
ruminant and mink materials from nonruminant materials (excluding mink) 
from the time of receipt until the time of shipment.
    (2) Renderers, blenders, and feed manufacturers and distributors 
will be exempted from appropriate requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of 
this section, if they meet the appropriate criteria for exemption under 
paragraphs (c)(2) or (c)(3), and (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section.
    (f) Requirements for establishments and individuals that are 
responsible for feeding ruminant animals. Establishments and 
individuals that are responsible for feeding ruminant animals shall 
maintain copies of purchase invoices and labeling for all feeds 
received, and make the copies available for inspection and copying by 
the Food and Drug Administration.
    (g) Adulteration and misbranding. (1) Animal protein products, and 
feeds containing such products, that are not in compliance with 
paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section, excluding labeling 
requirements, will be deemed adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) or 
402(a)(4) of the act.
    (2) Animal protein products, and feeds containing such products, 
that are not in compliance with the labeling requirements of paragraphs 
(c) through (f) of this section will be deemed misbranded under section 
403(a)(1) of the act.
    (h) Inspection; records retention. (1) Records that are to be made 
available for inspection and copying, as required by this section, 
shall be kept for a minimum of 2 years.
    (2) Written procedures required by this section shall be made 
available for inspection and copying by the Food and Drug 
Administration.

<CENTER><H3>The Gibbs Principle</H3>
</CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Gibbs Principle states that <B>TSEs are inherently endemic and non-eradicatable</B>, with all species of mammals contracting prionic spongiform encephalopathies through germline mutation and sporadic processes at a rate of roughly one per million per year. More broadly, the Gibbs Principle asserts that basically all human genetic diseases have TSE counterparts in basically all vertebrates.
<P>
In other words, scrapie can never be eradicated from sheep by breeding, <B>"BSE-free country" is oxymoronic</B>, and TSE will always be endemic everywhere, with all species from chickens to sharks to humans endogenously at risk. The best that can be done is reduce dietary amplification, use of pooled products, and lateral transmission,  to asymptotically approach the basal de novo mutational level, rather than attaining eradication. Whatever steps are taken, there will always be a non-zero expectation value for the basal level of infectious prion titre arising from new mutations within the curent generation.
<P>
The rate is based on the incidence of sporadic and familial CJD in humans, experience with other genes, and general precepts from modern molecular biology. Overall, the Gibbs Principle is on solid ground, though accurate experimental estimation of the rate component could take years. The mutational rate in mammals is given in standard texts (Creighton, <I>Proteins, </I>1993 2nd ed. pg.111) as one per 100 million nucleotides per generation, thus about 60 per round of replication.  In the US, where there are conveniently 100 million cows, this says (ignoring hot spots) that <B>essentially every one of the 750 nucleotides in the prion gene sees a germline or neuronal stemline mutational change every year.</B>  Some of these, unfortunately, cause TSE in cattle by the Gibbs Principle
<P>
Now this disease does not typically emerge in humans until age 60 or so; the question arises of whether the Gibbs Principle is applicable to shorter-lived mammals.  Note first that the rate in humans is under-reported because most cases may be lost within Alzheimer's and other dementias.  Secondly, it seems likely that the process of infectivity titre and neural death begins many years before symptoms are explicitly recognized; as with prostate cancer, many more die with CJD than from it.  Disease onset may also be calibrated by basal metabolism rate and higher body temperatures in smaller mammals, compensating for  shorter lifespan.
<p><CENTER><IMG  SRC="colorbar_anim.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="1"></CENTER><p>
To what extent <B>does transmissability recapitulates phylogeny</B>?  This notion seems imperfect experilmentally in two respects: adjacency and reciprocity.  That is, transmission between two closely related species can be less efficient than to a more distant species, and efficiency from species A to species B need not be the same as from B to A (eg, mouse and hamster)  In other words, the species barrier matrix is neither off-diagonally sparse nor symmetric, except perhaps in an overall statistical sense.  In short, the species barrier is hard to predict.

<p><CENTER><IMG  SRC="colorbar_anim.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="1"></CENTER><p>
Just as genes are organized into <A NAME="superfamilies">superfamilies</A> by homology, so too are <B>human genetic disorders ordered by paralogy</B>.  In other words, we might speak of paralogous anaemias associated with mutations in prothrombin and clotting facter X,  or paralogous alpha and beta hemoglobinopathies, etc.  The point of organizing disorders this way is to predict from the well-studied case that similar mechanistic opportunities may exist for disease in the paralogue case.   Here we wish to bootstrap off our knowledge of mainstem prion disease.   
<P> 
For prion disease,  the suite of paralogous diseases is predicted to include those arising from same normal to rogue conformational shift.  This is because the 3d properties of proteins are 'the last thing to go' in evolutionary divergence, long after the original primary sequence appears as single copy in hybridization.  If other proteins do exist with prionic properties, the paralogues are the first place to look for them. 
<P>
In order to validate and broaden the idea of prionic diseases,  there is interest in finding other diseases of this type in humans.  A rational way to do this is as follows:  push back the prion gene to the early vertebrates and beyond, until such time that the gene doubling is found that originally gave rise to the prion lineage.  This requires determining prion homologues in ostriches, turtles, xenopus, zebrafish, dogfish, lamphries,  amphioxus, tunicates, echinoderms, etc., until a gene divergence is found.   There could be complications from gene fusion, unequal crossing over and the like, but we are 'certain' that the prion gene is not sui generis. <A HREF="http://www.cyber-dyne.com/~tom/chickens.html">Chicken 'prion'</A> may be such a protein already.
<P>
Having found the paralogue, we then push it forward back to humans, using degenerate probe from the lower organism (or look in GenBank, etc.).  In the best case scenario, the paralogue gene is known in humans with various disease states already assigned to it, but the local experts have not yet tested them for transmissibility, etc.

[Over 50 house cats have died from FSE in England.There is an issue on the extent of the infection, maternal trnasmission, passage by fleas, early onset, geography of infection, whether US and Canadian cats have been getting it as well.]<p>

"Paul Brown recently commented on the
cat situation.  [] The situation is probably underrecorded because of the
nature of cats.  If one's cat does not return it is presumed to have gone
astray or hit by a car.  If one brings their cat to the vet with ataxia,
it's automatically diagnosed as Feline Vestibular Disease and put down.  The
situation could be far more extensive than it is and as a result of our
current veterinary practices, we would not know.  Special attention to the dairy states might
prove interesting.<HR>

The brains from 18 cats were examined for the presence of the fibrils and
modified PrP protein which are molecular diagnostic markers for scrapie-like
diseases. Thirteen cats were referred with clinical neurological signs
potentially indicative of feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE). Of these, 5
had histopathological changes of FSE, 5 had other lesions of the central
nervous system, and in 3 the brain was normal. The remaining 5 cats had no
clinical neurological signs and were selected as controls. Fibrils and modified
PrP protein were found in the brains of the 5 cats with FSE and in one of the
cats with neurological signs but no histopathological changes in the central

A 6-year-old female domestic shorthaired <B>cat</B> from the Oslo area was presented
with ataxia of gait with dysmetria and hypermetria of the extremities,
hyperaesthesia was a constant feature. The neurological signs progressed
despite treatment and the cat was humanely destroyed. At PM examination no
gross lesions were found. Histopathological examination revealed spongiform
change in the brain and spinal cord grey matter. Neuronal vacuolation was
present in the spinal cord and the red nucleus of the midbrain. Immunostaining
using the mouse monoclonal anti-hamster PrP antibody, 3F4 demonstrated
extensive immunolabelling in the grey matter neuropil of the head of the
caudate nucleus, putamen and the cerebral cortex as obtained previously in
cases of feline spongiform encephalopathy (FSE). This appears to be the first
case of FSE in a domestic cat outside the UK. The cat had been fed several
imported commercial dry cat food products. There was no genetic link or any
form of contact with FSE cases in the UK.<p>

A 5-year-old neutered male Siamese <STRONG>cat</STRONG> was presented with a 6-week history of
progressive forelimb and hindlimb ataxia. Hypermetria of the forelimb and
hindlimb gait and postural difficulties were noted. After a few days the cat
became quiet and depressed and there was no response to treatment. Euthanasia
was carried out. There were no macroscopic post mortem changes.
Histopathological examination revealed a spongiform encephalopathy
characterised principally by grey matter neuropil spongiosis, vacuolation of
neuronal perikarya and an astrocytic response. There were no significant
changes in liver, kidney, lung or spleen. This is the first report of a
naturally occurring disease in a domestic cat with microscopic changes
consistent with the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies due to
unconventional viruses.<p>

Between April 1990 and February 1992, a total of 24 cases of <b>feline</b>
spongiform encephalopathy (FSE) was reported in the UK. Most affected cats were
between 4 and 9 years of age. There were more males than females but this
finding is not significant due to small number of involved individuals. Most
cats were non-pedigree and came from a wide range of geographical locations
throughout the UK. Clinical signs developed gradually over several weeks in all
cases. The first signs to be noted were often changes in behaviour. These were
either manifested with unprovoked attacks on family members or other household
pets or as increased timidity with cats, with a tendency to hide and avoid
contact. Locomotor abnormalities developed in all cases and generally affected
hindlimbs before forelimbs. The cats became ataxic and often further developed
a rapid, crouching, hypermetric gait. Other signs included hyperaesthesia to
touch and sound, decreased grooming behaviour. The cats were killed on humane
grounds. Significant gross lesions were not observed. Changes were found only
in the central nervous system and consisted of vacuolation of grey matter
neurophil and neuronal perikarya with neuronal loss and gliosis. Similar
lesions were also found in the spinal cord of some cats. All affected cats have
been fed a variety of foods ranging from proprietary cat foods to table scraps.
So far no cases of FSE have been reported in domestic cats outside the UK. <p>

In 1990 a 7.5 year-old <STRONG>cat</STRONG> which developed a change of temperament, with muscle
tremors, ataxia and pupillary dilatation was suspected and later confirmed
histopathologically to have a spongiform encephalopathy. The cat had been fed
throughout life on a proprietary canned diet, supplemented with dry cat food
and fresh cooked chicken and had never been boarded in a cattery. This is the
fourth case of spongiform encephalopathy in a British cat which has been
confirmed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory. The case is of special interest
in view of the widespread concern about spongiform encephalopathies as a result
of the recent epidemic of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.<p>

An eland (Taurotragus oryx) born at a zoo in England in April 1987 and kept on
the zoo premises on a grass enclosure developed clinical signs on 12 December,
1989 when the animal was 3 months pregnant. Initially the disease was
characterized by high stepping of the hind limbs, fine muscular tremors and
loss of weight. Three to four days later signs of circling and head pressing
were seen. The animal became increasingly dull, developed a clear nasal
discharge, hypersalivation, became recumbent and died on 20 December, 1989. No
significant lesions were evident on gross PM examination but histopathological
examination of the brain revealed a spongiform encephalopathy. The animal may
have been exposed to the causal agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy or
scrapie through processed animal protein fed in the diet. This appears to be
the first report of a spongiform encephalopathy in an eland.<p>

A 5.5-year-old <b>cheetah</b> at the Broome Zoo was observed to be ataxic and
disorientated during December 1991. Blood samples showed a strong positive
titre to toxoplasmosis. The animal was killed 4 weeks after the onset of
clinical symptoms when it exhibited falling, locomotory weakness and distress.
PM examination showed no visible lesions. Histopathology showed widespread
axonal degeneration and demyelination of all tracts in the spinal cord. Severe
spongiform change was visible in the grey matter of the neuroaxis, especially
in the corpus striatum, midbrain and thalamic areas. On the basis of
neuropathology, a diagnosis of spongiform encephalopathy was made and samples
were forwarded to the reference laboratory in Weybridge, UK. The presence of
fibrils was confirmed by electron microscopy. Meanwhile, a quarantine order was
placed on the zoo and the previously buried carcasses were disinterred and
incinerated. The cheetah was born at Marwell Zoo in England on 16 June 1986 and
imported together with 2 littermates to Australia on 9 May 1989. Marwell Zoo
practised a 'feeding in' of culled carcasses to other zoo animals, particularly
felids and canids. The cheetah probably ingested the infective agent while
still in England. This is the first diagnosis of spongiform encephalopathy in a
cheetah and of spongiform encephalopathy in a zoo animal outside the UK.<p>

strain variation and the species barrier. Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences 1994 343 1306 405-411<p>
<p>
Results from various transmission experiments are reviewed. Transmissions of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from 7 unrelated cattle sources gave
remarkably uniform disease characteristics in mice, differing from over 20
previous and contemporary transmissions of sheep and goat scrapie.
Transmissions to mice of spongiform encephalopathy from 6 species (including
sheep and goats) experimentally or naturally infected with BSE gave similar
results to direct BSE transmissions from cattle. It is concluded that the BSE
agent has retained its identity when passaged through a range of species and
the 'donor' species has little specific influence on disease characteristics in
mice, adding to evidence for an agent-specific informational molecule. On
transmission of BSE or scrapie to mice the incubation periods are long compared
with subsequent mouse-to-mouse passages (the 'species barrier'). Contributing
factors include a low efficiency of infection on interspecies transmission, the
apparent failure of intracerebrally injected 'foreign' inoculum to establish
infection directly in mouse brain and the selection of variant strains of agent
which replicate most readily in the new host species. <p>

Hamsters developed scrapie 100-160 days after eating either scrapie-infected
hamsters or infected brain. The clinical signs and neuropathology of scrapie
transmitted by cannibalism were identical to those observed after intracerebral
or intraperitoneal inoculation of the agent. Oral transmission of scrapie
appears to be extremely inefficient. Cannibalism requires a dose of the scrapie
agent about 10&lt;sup(9)&gt; times greater than that needed to produce the
disease by intracerebral injection for comparable periods of incubation. These
results provide evidence for oral transmission of scrapie and may explain the
spread of kuru by cannibalism. The inefficiency of oral infection with scrapie
might also have implications for understanding the sporadic occurrence and
worldwide distribution of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.<p>

<p>
Transmission from 4 cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) to mice
resulted in neurological disease in 100% of recipient animals, after incubation
periods of between 265 and 700 days after injection. The results from the 4
cases were very similar to one another. There were major differences in the
incubation period between the 4 inbred strains of mice tested, and even between
strains of the same Sinc genotype, and the incubation periods of Sinc
heterozygote mice were much longer than those for any of the inbred strains.
Transmission from a case of natural scrapie differed in two important respects:
there were no differences in the incubation period between mouse strains of the
same Sinc genotype, and that of the heterozygotes was between those of the Sinc
homozygotic parental strains. The distribution of vacuolar degeneration in the
brains of mice infected with scrapie also differed from those infected with the
BSE isolates. Transmission was also achieved from formol-fixed BSE brain. The
results show that the same strain of agent caused disease in the BSE cases, and
that the relationship of BSE to scrapie in sheep is unclear.<p>

of spongiform encephalopathy transmitted to <b>mice</b> from three species of
bovidae. Acta Neuropathologica 1992 84 5 559-569<p>
<p>
The ultrastructural neuropathology of mice experimentally inoculated with brain
tissue of nyala (Tragelaphus angasi; subfamily Bovinae), or kudu (Tragelaphus
strepsiceros; subfamily Bovinae) affected with spongiform encephalopathy was
compared with that of mice inoculated with brain tissue from cows (Bos taurus;
subfamily Bovinae) with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). As fresh brain
tissue was not available for nyala or kudu, formalin-fixed tissues were used
for transmission from these species. The effect of formalin fixation was
compared with that of fresh brain in mice inoculated with fixed and unfixed
brain tissue from cows with BSE. The nature and distribution of the
pathological changes were similar irrespective of the source of inoculum or
whether the inoculum was from fresh or fixed tissue. Vacuolation caused by loss
of organelles and swelling was present in dendrites and axon terminals.
Vacuoles were also seen as double-membrane-bound and single-membrane-bound
structures within myelinated fibres, axon terminals and dendrites. Vacuoles are
considered to have more than one morphogenesis but the structure of vacuoles in
this study was nevertheless similar to previous descriptions of spongiform
change in naturally occurring and experimental scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and kuru. Other features of
the ultrastructural pathology of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
including dysytrophic neurites and scrapie-associated particles of
tubulovesicular bodies were also found. Neuronal autophagy was a conspicuous
finding. It is suggested that excess prion protein (PrP) accumulation, or
accumulation of the scrapie-associated protease-resistant isoform of PrP, may
lead to localised sequestration and phagocytosis of neuronal cytoplasm and to
neuronal loss. <p>

Journal of Virology 1988 62 5 1558-1564 <p>
There is evidence that prions contain protease-resistant sialoglycoproteins,
designated PrP&lt;sup(Sc)&gt;, encoded by a cellular gene. The prion protein
(PrP) gene also encodes a normal cellular protein designated PrP&lt;sup(C)&gt;.
Clonal cell lines were established which support the replication of mouse
scrapie or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions. Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were
exposed to mouse scrapie prions and cloned. After limited proteinase K
digestion, three PrP-immunoreactive proteins with apparent molecular masses of
20-30 kilodaltons were detected in extracts of scrapie-infected N2a cells by
Western (immuno-) blotting. The identity of these PrP&lt;sup(Sc)&gt; molecules
was confirmed using monospecific antiserum raised against a synthetic peptide
corresponding to a portion of the prion protein. Those clones synthesizing
PrP&lt;sup(Sc)&gt; molecules possessed scrapie prion infectivity as measured by
bioassay; clones without PrP&lt;sup(Sc)&gt; showed no infectivity. Detection of
PrP&lt;sup(Sc)&gt; molecules in scrapie-infected N2a cells supports the

Groups of weanling female (57B1 and CRH) mice were fed minced brain tissue
collected from 4 advanced clinical cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE). The brain tissue was fed at night when the mice were also given pooled
cerebrospinal fluid diluted in water to replace normal drinking water.
Commercial rodent nuts containing only vegetable protein were fed during the
day; control mice received only the nuts. The onset of neurological signs was
insidious and progressed to paresis with remissions in 4 to 6 weeks. The first
5 cases in C57B1 mice were killed 15-18 months after the start of feeding at
which time no neurological disease was evident in the CRH mice. Histological
examination of the brains of the clinically affected mice revealed vacuolation
of neurones and neuropil in the medulla and midbrain together with prion
protein aggregates in the neuropil. These features, considered to be diagnostic
of subacute transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, were absent from control
mice killed at the same time. Mice fed various other tissue pools from the 4
cases of BSE will be kept for their lifespan and should allow an assessment to
be made of the relative infectivity of the various tissues.<p>

Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a progressive neurological disorder of captive
mule deer, black-tailed deer, hybrids of mule deer and white-tailed deer and
Rocky Mountain elk, is characterized by widespread spongiform change of the
neuropil, intracytoplasmic vacuolation in neuronal perikarya and astrocytic
hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The topographic distribution of amyloid plaques
reactive to antibodies prepared against scrapie amyloid in CWD-affected captive
mule deer is described. Scrapie amyloid-immunoreactive plaques were found in
the cerebral gray and white matter, in deep subcortical nuclei, in isolation or
in clusters in areas of vacuolation, and perivascularly, in subpial and
subependymal regions. In the cerebellum, immunoreactive amyloid plaques were
observed in the molecular, pyramidal and granular layers. Scrapie
amyloid-immunoreactive deposits were also seen in neuronal perikarya.
Furthermore, amyloid plaques in CWD-affected captive mule deer were
alcianophilic at 0.3 M magnesium chloride indicating the presence of weakly to
moderately sulphated glycosaminoglycans. These results confirm that CWD in
captive mule deer belongs to the subacute virus spongiform encephalopathies.<p>

The pathology of the central nervous system of 9 mule deer and 6 elk with
chronic wasting disease, a spongiform encephalopathy of mule deer and elk, was
studied by light microscopy. Lesions were similar in both species and were
characterized by spongiform transformation of gray matter, intracytoplasmic
vacuolation of neurons, neuronal degeneration and loss, astrocytic hypertrophy
and hyperplasia, occurrence of amyloid plaques, and absence of inflammatory
response. Distribution and severity of lesions were evaluated at 57 locations;
there were only minor differences between deer and elk. Consistent, severe
lesions occurred in olfactory tubercule and cortex, hypothalamus, and the
parasympathetic vagal nucleus of deer, and sections examined from these regions
would be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of chronic wasting disease.
Lesions were milder in these locations in elk but were sufficiently apparent to
be diagnostic. Other differences included increased severity of lesions in some
thalamic nuclei in elk in contrast to deer, the occurrence of amyloid plaques
detected by haematoxylin and eosin and histochemical stains in deer in contrast
to elk, and the presence of milk white matter lesions in elk but not in deer.
Lesions of chronic wasting disease were qualitatively comparable to those of
scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, transmissible mink encephalopathy,
and the human spongiform encephalopathies. Topographical distribution and
lesion severity of chronic wasting disease were most similar to those of
scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Duration of clinical disease did
not affect lesion distribution or severity in either species.<p>

C. Ultrastructural neuropathology of chronic wasting disease in captive <b>mule
deer</b>. Acta Neuropathologica 1993 85 4 437-444 USA<p>
Chronic wasting disease (CWD), a progressive uniformly fatal neurological
disorder, is characterized neuropathologically by intraneuronal vacuolation,
spongiform change of the neuropil and astrocytic hyperplasia and hypertrophy.
Ultrastructural neuropathological findings consist of extensive vacuolation in
neuronal processes, within myelin sheaths, formed by splitting at the major
dense lines or within axons; dystrophic neurites (dendrites, axonal
preterminals and myelinated axons containing degenerating mitochondria and
pleomorphic, electron-dense inclusion bodies); prominent astrocytic gliosis;
amyloid plaques; and giant neuronal autophagic vacuoles. Other findings include
activated macrophages and occasional spheroidal structures containing densely
packed fibrillar material of unknown origin, abundant structures suggestive of
degenerating microtubules entrapped in filamentous masses, vacuoles and myelin
figures. Similar findings have been previously observed in scrapie-infected
hamsters and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)-infected mice, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, and CJD indicating that CWD in captive mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus hemionus) belongs to the subacute spongiform encephalopathies
(transmissible brain amyloidoses)<p>

Recently, scrapie amyloid-immunoreactive plaques have been detected in brain
tissues of chronic wasting disease (CWD) affected captive mule deer. Rocky
Mountain elk and hybrids of captive mule deer and white-tailed deer. Abnormal
fibrils were isolated from brain tissues of Rocky Mountain elk using
negative-stain electron microscopy. These fibrils resemble those found in
scrapie-infected hamster brain. Protein bands with relative molecular masses of
26 to 30 kilodaltons were shown to be immunoreactive to antibodies raised
against scrapie amyloid by Western immunoblotting. Immuno-dot blot showed
similar reactivity. These results support the clinical and pathological
diagnosis of the disease and provide further evidence that CWD belongs to the
subacute spongiform encephalopathies<p>

Review of Genetics 1990 24 115-132<p>
This paper reviews the genetic control of neurodegenerative diseases that
affect animals (scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, transmissible mink
encephalopathy and chronic wasting disease of <b>deer</b> and <b>elk</b>) and
humans. Studies on the influence of the host's genetic background on the
susceptibility and incubation time of these diseases are discussed with data,
not only on domestic animals and humans, but also on mice, including
transgenics. Consideration is also given to work on recombinant DNA and
restriction fragment length polymorphism studies on the host gene for prion
protein (Prn-P), and to properties (host range, thermal stability, variability
in lesions and strain differences) of the disease agents. It concludes that the
host plays a significant role in determining the pattern of infection and
incubation time for these diseases. Incubation time appears to be a stable
property of the agent-host combination, and is not a stable property of the
agent strain alone. Studies on gene transfer in transgenic mice strongly
suggest that scrapie and the human diseases are probably all genetic diseases,
and that the transmissible factor is host encoded. The host gene for prion
protein is responsible for (1) the variation in the host response to the
infecting material, (2) the incubation time, (3) the pathology of the brain and
the deposition of amyloid, and (4) the host range of the resulting
transmissible agent. In addition to Prn-p, another gene, Pid-1, may be involved
in the control of incubation time, but its identity is obscure. <p>

Clinical, pathological and epidemiological details of scrapie-like
encephalopathies are described in an Arabian oryx and a greater kudu in a zoo
in London, UK. Clinical signs included ataxia and loss of condition with a
short, progressive clinical course (22 and three days, respectively).
Histopathological examination of the brains revealed spongiform encephalopathy
characteristic of that observed in scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE). It seems probable that these cases have a common aetiology with BSE.
Scrapie-like spongiform encephalopathies have now been described in five
species of exotic artiodactyls in Britain indicating a, hitherto inapparent,
wider range of ruminant species as natural hosts for these diseases.<p>

A small herd of greater kudu, derived from 3 individuals, has been maintained
at the Zoological Society of London since 1970. Spongiform encephalopathy has
been diagnosed in 5 out of 8 of the animals born in this herd since 1987. With
the possible exception of the first confirmed case, none of these is thought to
have been exposed to feeds containing ruminant-derived protein. The pattern of
incidence suggests that greater kudu are very susceptible to the disease and
that natural lateral transmission may have occurred among them.<p>

A 39-month-old female greater kudu, which had been transferred to Regent's Park

neurological signs consistent with spongiform encephalopathy for 8 weeks.
Spongiform encephalopathy was confirmed histologically. The kudu which had been
born at Marwell Zoological Park, UK where no cases of the disease have been
detected in the kudu herd, had apparently not eaten feeds containing
ruminant-derived protein although her dam had been exposed to such feeds. The
kudu had had contact with 2 other kudu at Regent's park in which the disease
had been diagnosed; one had died 4 months after the kudu had been introduced
and the second was found to have the condition when examined post mortem in
February 1992. The possible modes of transmission are discussed.<p>

Three further cases of spongiform encephalopathy in greater kudu at the
Zoological Society of London none of which was thought to have access to feed
containing ruminant-derived protein are reported. The first case was male, born
in May 1988 which developed rapidly progressive neurological signs when 37
months old. It was humanely slaughtered and spongiform encephalopathy was
diagnosed on histopathological examination of the brain. The other 2 cases both
males and born in October 1988 and August 1990 were slaughtered when 36 and 18
months old, respectively, because only one male can be kept in a kudu herd.
Both were clinically normal at the time of slaughter and histological
examination of the brains revealed sparse neuronal vacuolation with a
bilaterally symmetrical and strictly localised distribution in the medulla
oblongata. Sections of medulla immunostained with antiserum to PrP detected the
protein principally in association with vacuolation, thus immunostaining was
discrete in the subclinical cases and widespread in the clinical case. These
cases provide further evidence that transmission of spongiform encephalopathy
may have occurred in greater kudu.<p>

Epidemiological investigation of a new incident of transmissible mink
encephalopathy (TME) in Stetsonville, Wisconsin, USA, in 1985 showed that the
mink rancher had never fed sheep products to his mink but did feed them large
amounts of products from fallen or sick dairy cattle. To investigate the
possibility that this occurrence of TME may have resulted from exposure to
infected cattle, two Holstein bull calves were injected intracerebrally with
mink brain from the Stetsonville ranch. Each bull developed a fatal spongiform
encephalopathy 18 and 19 months after inoculation, respectively, and both
bovine brains passaged back into mink were highly pathogenic by either
intracerebral or oral inoculation. These results suggest the presence of a
previously unrecognized scrapie-like infection in cattle in the United
States.<p>

Spongiform encephalopathies in captive wild animals in the British Isles

<pre>Kirkwood JK; Cunningham AA

Vet Rec, 135: 13, 1994 Sep 24, 296-303 
</pre>
Since 1986, scrapie-like spongiform encephalopathy has been diagnosed in 19 captive wild animals of eight species at or from eight zoological collections
in the British Isles. The affected animals have comprised members of the family Bovidae: one nyala (Tragelaphus angasi), four eland (Taurotragus oryx),
and six greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), one gemsbok (Oryx gazella), one Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx), and one scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx
dammah), and members of the family Felidae: four cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) and one puma (Felis concolor). In addition, three cases of a spongiform
encephalopathy of unknown aetiology have been reported in ostriches (Struthio camellus) from two zoos in north west Germany. Three features suggest
that some of these cases may have been caused by the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). First, they have been temporally and
geographically coincident with the BSE epidemic. Secondly, in all the ungulates for which details are available, it is possible that either the affected
animal itself, or the herd into which it was born or moved, had been exposed to proprietary feeds containing ruminant-derived protein or other
potentially contaminated material, and all the carnivores had been fed parts of cattle carcases judged unfit for human consumption. Thirdly, the
pathological results of inoculating mice with a homogenate of fixed brain tissue from the nyala and from one greater kudu were similar to the results of
inoculating mice with BSE brain tissue.

"While the disease is similar, there never has been a link found between it and any human health problems," said Mike Miller, a Colorado Division of Wildlife veterinarian.  <I>[No such studies has ever been conducted - webmaster]</I><P>

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy recently was linked in Britain to brain disorders, blindness and loss of nerve control in humans, although Miller says he is not convinced one causes the other.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Canadian">Canadian</A> Statement on CWD in Elk:<P></CENTER></H3>


In early 1996, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) confirmed a
case of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in a single elk located on a small
game farm facility in southern Saskatchewan.  The affected animal was
imported as a yearling, in 1989, as part of a small shipment of elk
originating from Soout Dakota, U.S.<P>

We don't the feeding history of the elk in question before it was imported
to Canada.  However, we know that on the game ranch in
Saskatchewan, she and her herdmates were fed a diet of high-quality
alfalfa hay and other home-grown grains.  The only commercial products
fed to the herd consisted of vitamins and mineral supplements.<P>

<I>[Rendered livestock protein supplement may have been fed to the elk back in South Dakota;  CWD also showed up in 1967 in a captive mule deer herd in Colorado. The odds of 'familial' or sporadic CWD, if it is a prion disease, showing up in a herd of 24 elk is essentially zero. --webmaster]<P></I>


In 1990, Canada imposed a prohibition on the
importation of cervids (such as deer and elk) and camelids (notably,
llamas and alpacas) from the U.S.  The ban was a reaction to the
presence of sporadic outbreaks of tuberculosis among some captive
ungulate herds in the U.S.  The ban has been extended (by regulation)
until December 31, 1997.<P>

The game farm in question is not located near other (alternative or
conventional) livestock operations.  No animals on this farm have died,
nor have any animals moved off the premises, for any reason, since the
elk herd was established.<P>

Following the confirmation of CWD, the carcass of the affected elk was
incinerated and the following actions took place:<P>
 
1) AAFC carried out an inventory of all elk on the farm;
2) no 'movement permits' for the elk were issued to the owner; (All
captive ungulates in Canada require numbered permits to allow their
movement anywhere within the country, including farm-to-farm)
3) all animals that were part of the original shipment from the U.S. were
traced and located; and
4) the affected herd was put in isolation. <I> [On 4.30.96, Dr. George Luterbach  in  Canada stated all 23 elk will be  destroyed -- webmaster]</I><P>

Chronic Wasting Disease is not a "reportable disease", and the Office
International des ?pizooties (OIE) (the organization that establishes
international animal health guidelines), does not require notification its
presence.<P>
 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has developed a policy for the
eradication of CWD in ranched deer and elk, and in the case of a
confirmed case of CWD, we will order the destruction of all animals
considered to be at risk.<P>

CWD, like BSE of cattle and scrapie of
sheep, belongs to the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
disease group.  According to the available scientific literature, it affects
the mule deer family (including mule deer, black-tailed deer, and
mule/white-tailed hybrids) and elk.  White-tailed deer have not developed
the disease, to date.<P>
 
The cause of CWD is unknown, there is no treatment, and no test for the
disease in live animals.  CWD was first seen in Colorado (U.S.), in 1967,
in deer belonging to research facilities.  Since then, the disease has been
diagnosed in captive and wild deer and elk in northern Colorado and
southern Wyoming.

Elk and deer farms threaten Montana's wild herds and there is too much at stake to let the industry continue, said state Sen. Terry Klampe, who is sponsoring a game-farm moratorium and phaseout bill. The two main issues are tuberculosis being spread to wild animals and cross-breeding of commercial and wild game. Tuberculosis has been found in elk at six Montana game farms since 1991 and cross breeding of game farm animals with elk in the wild could bring greater susceptibility to disease, said Herb Johnson, chairman of the Montana Wildlife Federation's committee on game farms.

<H3><CENTER>A <A NAME="wasting">wasting</A> syndrome in moose in Sweden</CENTER></H3>


Since 1985, moose have been found dead or dying of a syndrome in an area of
southwestern Sweden, northeast of the city of Gothenburg. The core area for
affected animals has been and still is southern Cavsborg county, although
a spread is noted to the closest counties and individual cases with the
syndrome have been reported from the entire country. At last count, more
than 1400 animals are reported to have died in the sickness. Both sexes and
all age class animals have been found with the syndrome, although animals
more than 4 years are more prone to the syndrome.<P>

The research has shown that the moose population in this area initially was
in good condition, with a high reprodutive capability. However, the
population has been on the decline during the end of the 1980's due to an
increased harvest, and locally due to the disease. From the very beginning
there seemed to be no indication of a general overbrowsing in southern
=C4lvsborg county, but now there is indications of reduced browse. Moose
shot in the areas with a high frequency of sick animals have initially shown
better body condition, higher reproductive capability/output, and even a
higher density than in control areas, which seems to be indicative of a
higher carrying capacity in the affected areas. But now it seems that the
body condition is detoriating. Lastly, it is known that the entire 
=C4lvsborgs county is one of the most acidified areas in all of Sweden, with 
high amounts of heavy metals in wild-life.<P>

None of the research carried out thus far would indicate that the browse
situation in the investigated areas, qualitatively, is or has been such that
this could cause a strong reduction in animals' condition and in turn make
them more susceptible to infection. The analyses carried out thus far on
moose browse in these areas has not revealed any exceptionally low amounts
of trace elements. Higher amounts of bark stripping on spruce has been found
to occur in spruce stands on the most productive areas. However, bark
stripping could not be related to any other particular forest variables
investigated thus far. Lastly, analyses of spruce bark as a moose browse
have not indicated that such bark has particularly high nutrient contents or
contain exeptionally high amounts of any essential minerals. However studies
of trace elements and metals in moose organs indicates that moose have low
content of certain trace elements, while others have increased.<P>


 As the number of animal deaths has increased, so
has the interest to discover the origin and spread of the disease, explain
the mechanisms underlying the cause, and if possible take measures to reduce
or minimize it's spread. Thus, in 1989 a research program was initiated to examine the problem: why were so many dead or dying moose found during a relatively short time
interval and to a great extent within the same geographic area? and what was
the cause?<P>


A number of factors had been suggested to explain the above phenomenon
including environmental changes, lack of browse, abnormal behavior in
browsing and different agents in conjunction with the syndrome. 
The following is a brief summary of the results thus far within the four
research areas:<P>

Approximately 200 moose of the 1400 reported cases of the syndrome have been
necropsied at the lab. and in the field. Initially, many domestic livestock
disesases were checked for, including BVD, herpes virus, and mad cow disease
(BSE). All results were negative. A previously unknown retrovirus belonging
to the family Retroviridae has been isolated from the sick moose.
Additionally antibodies against a pestvirus have also been detected in
diseased moose.<P>

<H3><A NAME="SCRAPIE">SCRAPIE</A> and CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE  in REINDEER</H3>

Europe's largest wild reindeer herd occupies a large (&gt;8000 km2) 
mountain plateau in central Norway. Much of the area is also grazed 
by sheep in the summer. Recently, several cases of scrapie have been 
reported among herds which may have come in contact with reindeer on 
the summer range. Upon positive diagnosis, infected herds are no 
longer permitted to be released onto the range. However, due to 
scrapie's long incubation period, it is impossible to know just how 
many sheep/herds are infected before symptoms become apparent.<P>

Concern has been raised as to whether scrapie-infected sheep may 
pose a threat to the reindeer herd. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) in 
cervids is a prion-disease, as is scrapie (see Prusiner 1995), and 
since trans-specific infection of prion diseases is, at least in the 
laboratory, possible, I have asked whether there appears to be any 
connection between CWD in cervids and scrapie in sheep; i.e. can 
cervids contract CWD from scrapie-infected sheep in an open range 
situation?<P>

From: <A HREF="mailto:<jerryt@bio.uio.no"><A NAME="Tom">Tom Warren</A>, Biol. Inst., U of Oslo<BR>
Subject: Re: Scrapie/reindeer investigation<P>

We have been investigating problems related to sheep grazing on alpine 
ranges which are used by wild reindeer. So far, the main problem seems 
to be between sheep owners and reindeer hunters, rather than between 
the animals themselves. It is important to mention that sheep/livestock 
grazing is in no way new in the area and summer grazing is abundant; 
winter habitat is the bottleneck for the reindeer.<P>


Private and public concern over the possible negative effects of
sheep and sheep grazing on wild reindeer is not new; there has been
competition for access to grazing resources/hunting for years. Since 
it is difficult on this particular range to argue that sheep 
"out-graze" reindeer, other possibilities such as disease/parasite 
transmission (from sheep to reindeer) have been advanced. When 
reports of scrapie among flocks of sheep which graze sympatrically 
with reindeer surfaced in 1994, concern for the reindeer was again 
voiced. <P>


Last year, after a short review of existing literature, we concluded
that there "seemed to be" a sufficient species barrier between
sheep and reindeer, such that contraction of chronic wasting disease
by the latter was unlikely. Inter-species transmission of prion
diseases is apparently possible only through ingestion of infected 
tissue, especially brain/nerve tissue, which would not (likely) occur 
on the open range. This seems to be the concenses among reseachers working
on CWD in the US. There is apparently no corelation between
the occurence of CWD and sheep grazing. (Based on work in Colorado
and Wyoming)<P>
We found scrapie and the other prion disease so interesting that we
wrote a popular account/description of scrapie and prions for the
Norwegian Sheep and Goat Association's magazine. This article, 
written in Norwegian, appeared in February before the latest events
in England. Since then, we have been inundated, locally, by requests 
for more information.<P>
We still maintain that in an open range situation the chances of 
reindeer contracting CWD due to scrapie-infected sheep are, at best,
remote. (Once scrapie is diagnosed, the flock is destroyed
and no longer grazes on the open range. Uncertainty arises due to 
the long incubation times associated with prion diseases.) Our 
interest was, and remains, in the range management/ecolgy aspects of 
livestock/reindeer interactions; we are neither pathologists or 
veterinarians. We are currently following the debate here in Europe on
BSE/CJD with great interest, however. Various theories circulate 
from week to week. Of greatest interest to us (and many others) is 
the question of the species barrier, and its role/function in 
extensive grazing situations.<P>

To clarify
the situation here in Norway: Since 1994, the number of flocks 
with (confirmed) scrapie have increased from 0 to a total 12, at last
count. All flocks are located in the SW part of the country, and are
primarily of 1 breed. The source is likely (an) illegally imported 
animal(s) from Britain. A few of these infected flocks, and probably other
flocks not yet diagnosed or confirmed, graze (very extensively) 
on summer range that is also used by wild reindeer. Contact between
sheep and reindeer on the range is "casual". The range is vast, 
though flocks of sheep and of reindeer may frequent the same grazing
areas during the summer; closest contact likely occurs around 
saltlicks.<P>
We have no known cases of CWD among the wild reindeer. What possible dangers to reindeer
may scrapie-infected sheep  represent in the extensive summer grazing
situation we have in Norway? I might add that upon confirmation of
scrapie, the flock is destroyed, and other flocks which have had direct
contact with that which is destroyed are quarantined?<P> 
The information I have received so far (<A HREF="mailto:<jerryt@bio.uio.no>">new info. welcomed</A>) has
indicated possible dangers associated with situations in which
animals, either sheep, deer or both, have in <B>some way be confined
and/or have grazed in or been fed from areas where infected sheep 
have been held</B>.<P>
My question remains: Are wild reindeer at risk in areas where they
share an extensive open range with scrapie-infected sheep? The 
pathology, genetics and epidemiology of scrapie and the other prion
diseases are fascinating, though our concern is more from a range 
management/conservation standpoint.<HR>

<B>ListServe Response:</B><P>
Thanks for a helpful note on recent history of scrapie and grazing practises in Norway.  I would say get rid of the saltblocks immediately as a precaution.  CWD is showing up mainly in captive animal / animals confined on sheep range situations.  Of course, it could easily pass unnoticed in wild populations.  The zoos are getting it too in  elands, oryx, kudu, etc.,  from something they ate, I would guess.<P>

We _do_ have it now in populations of wild deer and elk.  I have no information as to whether captive animals were ever released into this area.  You can be sure that all of northern  Colorado and southern Wyoming are sheep and cattle range.<P>

For me, it sounds like a replay of brucellosis.  The disease is brought to wild animals by domestic livestock, gets established, and later there is a big hue and cry to exterminate the wildlife as a subsidy to an economically bogus livestock industry.  Native subsistence people who depend on the wildlife get screwed as usual.  It makes more sense to exterminate the livestock [which are an economic frivolity for oil-rich Norway or US], or at least keep them out of the wildlands.  Is it worth taking the chance that your wild reindeer will get the disease?  Do Laplanders tradiltionally eat brain and spinal tissue from reindeer?

Have you seen the note from Joel Stone before? It seems to conflict with a Norwegian claim about a US consensus  -- the informal consensus seems the other way around even.  Note CWD cannot reasonably be 'familial'  or 'sporadic' in these captive herds because prion alleles are lethal autosomal dominants  of rare frequency, and the herds in Colorado and Canada were tiny. <P>

Also, a new letter to Lancet says hay mites may be capable of transmitting the disease horizontally.  It has not helped here with scrapie in Oregon or England to eradicate a sheep flock and then wait a couple of years before reintroduction.  The agent has been shown to survive in soil for 2-3 years by Gujdushek.<P>
I predict if you sequence the open reading frame from your sick reindeer, that the animals will all be homozygous wild type in their prion gene.  And yet, fluorescent antibody to prion plaque will be positive.<P>
I further predict that although this is cheap and easy to do [$5,000 by outside contract?], the Norwegian gov't will have no interest whatsoever in funding this study, despite many millions for reindeer studies.  <P>
The situation in Norway is just like the US or Britain -- whenever there is a conflict between public land ranchers and wildlife or public health, the government errs [or lies] on the side of the economic interest.  We have a flat-out cover-up going on over here on CWD, BSE, and CJD as far as I can see.<HR>

              reactive to antibodies prepared against scrapie amyloid in CWD-affected captive
              mule deer is described. Scrapie amyloid-immunoreactive plaques were found in
              the cerebral gray and white matter, in deep subcortical nuclei, in isolation or in
              clusters in areas of vacuolation, and perivascularly, in subpial and

              observed in the molecular, pyramidal and granular layers. Scrapie
              amyloid-immunoreactive deposits were also seen in neuronal perikarya.
              Furthermore, amyloid plaques in CWD-affected captive mule deer were
              alcianophilic at 0.3 M magnesium chloride indicating the presence of weakly to

              The pathology of the central nervous system of 9 mule deer and 6 elk with
              chronic wasting disease, a spongiform encephalopathy of mule deer and elk, was
              studied by light microscopy. Lesions were similar in both species and were
              characterized by spongiform transformation of gray matter, intracytoplasmic
              vacuolation of neurons, neuronal degeneration and loss, astrocytic hypertrophy
              and hyperplasia, occurrence of amyloid plaques, and absence of inflammatory
              response. Distribution and severity of lesions were evaluated at 57 locations;
              there were only minor differences between deer and elk. Consistent, severe
              lesions occurred in olfactory tubercule and cortex, hypothalamus, and the
              parasympathetic vagal nucleus of deer, and sections examined from these regions
              would be sufficient to establish a diagnosis of chronic wasting disease. Lesions
              were milder in these locations in elk but were sufficiently apparent to be
              diagnostic. Other differences included increased severity of lesions in some
              thalamic nuclei in elk in contrast to deer, the occurrence of amyloid plaques
              detected by haematoxylin and eosin and histochemical stains in deer in contrast
              to elk, and the presence of milk white matter lesions in elk but not in deer.
              Lesions of chronic wasting disease were qualitatively comparable to those of
              scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, transmissible mink
              encephalopathy, and the human spongiform encephalopathies. Topographical
              distribution and lesion severity of chronic wasting disease were most similar to
              those of scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Duration of clinical
              disease did not affect lesion distribution or severity in either species.<HR>

              Mountain elk and hybrids of captive mule deer and white-tailed deer. Abnormal
              fibrils were isolated from brain tissues of Rocky Mountain elk using
              negative-stain electron microscopy. These fibrils resemble those found in
              scrapie-infected hamster brain. Protein bands with relative molecular masses
              of 26 to 30 kilodaltons were shown to be immunoreactive to antibodies raised
              against scrapie amyloid by Western immunoblotting. Immuno-dot blot showed
              similar reactivity. These results support the clinical and pathological diagnosis

 Commentary:<P>
The spongiform encephalopathies are normally thought of as occuring in mammals.  However, homologues of the prion gene is found much more widely in nature and its study in other organisms  may yield insight  into its normal biological function and evolution.<P>

 The warble fly and hay mites have been mentioned as possible insect vectors for transmitting BSE.  However, these species are not convienent experimentally, in contrast to the well-studied fruit fly.  The study here shows that a mammalian prion gene can be expressed in the fruit fly; while surprisingly it gets covalently anchored correctly to the cell membrane, its outer surface is incorrectly formed.<P>

Molecular biologists didn't believe in infectious prion proteins -- the "not-invented-here" syndrome --  until a comparable situation [involving a non-homologous protein] was found.  It is far easier to do detailed biochemical genetic studies in yeast than in a mammal.  The entire yeast chromosome has been sequenced.  Possibly some other yeast gene is weakly homologous to mammalian prion protein.<P>

The best understood of all animal nervous systems is the nematode.  Every neuron and every neural connection has been mapped by electron microscopy.  Fifty per cent of the chromosome has been sequenced and many neurological mutations have been located and studied.  If a prion analogue exists, it could be most rapidly studied in this animal model.<P>

Chickens are of interest because rendered beef offal has been diverted to them as a feedstuff, over 100,000 tons a year in California alone.  One might suppose there would be an insurmountable  species barrier -- however, 3 zoo ostriches in Germany have died from a spongiform encephalopathy, possibly from their feed.

transgenic lines were isolated; induction of transgenes that had been placed under the control of the Drosophila heat shock promoter resulted in the synthesis of full-length SHaPrP. The relative molecular weight of the recombinant protein was lower than that of
authentic SHaPrP due to<B> incomplete processing of Asn-linked carbohydrates.</B> <P>

Cellular localization: heat shock induced SHaPrP was anchored to the surface
of cells by a glycolipid, demonstrating that the carboxy-terminal glyco-lipidation signal of hamster prion protein is recognized by this evolutionarily distant host. No difference
in fruitfly lifespans compared with controls was detected. <B>No disease phenotype or protease-resistant product</B> was associated with expression of hamster prion protein over the entire lifespan of transgenic flies.

Masison DC; Wickner RB <BR>
Science 270: 93-5 (1995)<P> 

The genetic properties of the [URE3] non-Mendelian element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that it is a prion (infectious protein) form of Ure2p, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism. <P>

In extracts from [URE3] strains, Ure2p was partially resistant to proteinase K
compared with Ure2p from wild-type extracts. Overexpression of Ure2p in wild-type strains induced a 20- to 200-fold increase in the
frequency with which [URE3] arose. Overexpression of just the amino-terminal 65 residues of Ure2p increased the frequency of [URE3]
induction 6000-fold. <P>

Without this "prion-inducing domain" the carboxyl-terminal domain performed the nitrogen regulation function of Ure2p, but could not be changed to the [URE3] prion state. Thus, this domain induced the prion state in trans, whereas in cis it conferred susceptibility of the adjoining nitrogen regulatory domain to prion infections.

From: <A HREF="mailto:<iaotb@INET.UNI-C.DK>">Torsten Brinch</A><BR>
<A HREF="#Pesticide">Mark Purdey's account</A><P>

It was the peculiar geographical distribution of BSE in the UK which made
Mark Purdey put forward the hypothesis, that warblecide could be involved
in the causation of BSE. Obviously a comparison of the epidemiological
features in time and space of BSE with the timing and
geographical distribution of warblecide treatments would
be the most promising possibility to disprove Mark Purdey's hypothesis.<P>
 
In one of the initial epidemiological studies on BSE
(Vet Rec 1988 123, 663-644), Wilesmith et al. specifically
state the range of pharmaceutica examined, and excluded as common factors.
"These included the use of vaccines, hormones, organo-
phosphorous fly sprays, synthetic pyrethroid sprays and ear tags and
anthelminthics".
Also on-farm use of herbicides and pesticides were examined and excluded.
Warblecide pour-on treatments are not mentioned in
the 1988 Wilesmith et al. study.<P>
 
The necessity for excluding these factors stems from
the epidemiological features of the disease which are compatible
with a causative agent spread by human intervention, like foodstuffs,
medical treatments or agrochemicals. At the time of the initial study
the association between the time of onset of clinical symptoms
and calendar month or stage of pregnancy could not be perceived.
An association would be expected if medical treatments or
agrochemicals were involved. The apparent lack of any association
contributed to the selection of the working hypothesis
that the causative agent is spread with feedstuffs. This
hypothesis has guided research ever since.<P>
 
The seasonal variation became apparent and was noted by Wilesmith et.al
(Vet.Rec. 1992, 130 90-94) "the apparent seasonal variations ...  are being
studied in relation to the potential seasonality of exposure, given the
seasonality of calving and the feeding of calves with concentrate rations."
 This seems to suggest that seasonal exposure (to calves) are responsible.<P>
 
It has been suggested that the seasonality of farming practices,
housing, calving and opportunities for inspecting could explain the
seasonality. This may well be the true cause.
The seasonality is clearly present, the ratio between numbers of clinical
onset at maximum (Dec-Jan) and minimum (May-Jun) is appr. 1.3.<P>
 
The strongest disproof of this hypothesis would be inconsistency between
which cows (or unborn calves) were exposed to warblecide,
and which cows contracted the disease. Warblecide treatments
are given in the autumn (August AFAIK) when the adult warble
fly has stopped propagating eggs. The treatment cannot be delayed
much, because the larvae in November-December reaches the spinal
chord, and treatment at this stage can lead to serious fatal
adverse reaction to larvae dying in the vertebral canal.<P>
 
Treatments with warblecide thus coincide with or slightly
predecess the peak calving season (August-October) in the UK.
Although treatment of pregnant and dairy cows with OP's are
generally not recommendable, they do not seem to have been excempted
from treatment in the UK warble eradication campaign 1978-81 and
in the following years.<P>
 
Voluntary treatments commenced, presumably
to the largest extent in regions which were still warble-infested
in the late eigthies. The MAFF
1989 surveillance report recognizes that voluntary treatments
were  used in prophylaxis, and have probably been a key factor
in the virtual eradication of warbles in most areas of UK
by 1990. Experience from eradication campaigns in Ireland
shows that infestation with warbles may spread quickly a few years
after a successful campaign unless prophylactic treatments
are continued. The OP treatments that were employed in the
late eighties were predominantly phosmet treatments --
other OP's (mainly fenthion) were used during the compulsory
eradication campaign 1978-1981.<P>
 
The MAFF 1989 surveillance report mentions the widespread use of
ivermectin anthelminthics as a contributing factor. Ivermectin
is also warblecidal. Serious adverse drug experiences with ivermectin
are not uncommon, and the drug has teratogenic properties --
Ivermectin should be looked at very carefully in order to exclude it as a
contributing factor to BSE, if this has not been done already.<P>
 
The large majority of BSE-cases were born
in the 1986-1988 calving seasons.
*Maybe* the cases in these cohorts were not treated
with warblecidal products, maybe not. If this can be demonstrated,
warblecides can be excluded as causative agent for BSE.
There does not seem to be any published
studies.  If warblecide treatments are involved
at all  exposure in utero (last trimester)
or in early calfhood is the most likely timing scenario. If this
is not recognized by the (hypothetical) study or trial, they
are of limited value. Studies must focus on *specific treatments*
in *specific circumstances* with a *specific OP*.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"A comparison of the 1989 results with those of the more limited
1988 survey shows that, despite the greater number of sera tested
fewer seropositive herds were found in the northern and eastern counties,
the eastern half of the country being now virtually free of serological
evidence of the disease. Contributory factors to this result probably
include continued voluntary treatments, and the use of ivermectin on a
wide scale for helminth control"<P>

"On the other hand, the counties in mid and west Wales reveal an apparent

Chief Vet Officer's Report 1981 (UK) stated:<P>
 
A large scale serological survey showed in 1978 that 20% of cattle in the UK had had
an infection of warble fly. Warble fly compulsory treatment zones were for farms within a 3km radius
of an infected farm. So a zone in Oxfordshire would not be some huge
area, but a very small local zone of 3km radius. The number of farms that were placed under order in 1982 was 1589.<P>
 
The number of British cattle visually reported infected [less sensitive than serological detection] since
1985, and two infected importations (total
cattle population of about 12,000,000):<P>

 <A NAME="Listserve">Listserve</A> item 27 May 96:<P>

"Recent survey from Germany (where it is apparently the law that infected
cattle should be treated) in Rheinland gave 30% of herds infected with
warbles. In France any herd with more than 5% warbles are by law obliged
to treat the whole herd. Apparently this is done by Department and 'some
police this more than others'.<P>
 
So it is quite clear that treatment for warbles is not confined to the
UK in the three years of the eradication scheme. There were, and are,
very significant usages of these products in the continental EC which
continue to this day. At least some countries have laws requiring
treatment, and I would expect the majority of welfare conscious farmers
would treat anyway. The minority who don't spreading the problem to
those that do.<P>

One should also note that only one product can be used on milking cows
with an acceptable milk withdrawal period (I believe Phorate), which is
indeed an OP. Ivermectin is rather persistent, so cannot practicably be
used on dairy cows.<P>

Generally Phosmet wasn't used except in areas with lots of mites, typically
upland areas. About 1/3 of the UK used Tiguvon for example.
Spraying for warble fly  eradicated the disease. Our operation has not treated any
cattle with insecticides since 1981; this would be typical of the
majority of farmers."<P><HR>

<EM>Listserve item, 28 May 96:</EM><P>
 The warblefly larva makes its way near/into the spinal column,
so a good way (200,000x better than oral route) to innoculate
CSF/CNS with prions.  Are there already studies/data which
show no obvious relation between warbles being in an animal and it
having BSE?<HR>

<EM>Listserve item, 27 May 96:</EM><P>
The warble fly is similar to the screw fly [or heel fly] of America. It lays its eggs
on the legs of cattle. When they hatch they burrow under the skin and
deep into the body and munch their way (over a year) through the cows
body until they are just under the skin over the spine. Eventually they
chew their way out and drop to the ground, a legless grub about (from
memory) 25+mm x 10mm. They then pupate and hatch on the ground.<P>
 
There was a suggestion that BSE was directly caused by the once-annual
treatment against this pest with the organophosphate, Phosmet, when the UK sought to eradicate it.
The case against this proposal is pretty solid.<P>
 
Organophosphates are used on cattle the continent, America, Australia and many
other places without BSE appearing. Indeed in hot climates they may be
used several times a year. The amount of pour-on OP's used on the
continent was many, many, times greater than the UK 82-90 since the UK
rarely identified more than the low hundreds per annum in these years
(except for the odd batch of imported cattle). Why has BSE not appeared
in these other places?  Politically it would be nice to blame it on OP's, a simple ban on
OP's should stop the problem in it's tracks.<HR>

<H2><A NAME="Pesticide">Pesticide</A> linked to Britain's Mad Cow epidemic</H2>
ENN Daily News -- April  8, 1996<P>

Excessive use of an organo-phosphate pesticide more than 10 years ago could have caused Britain's epidemic of Mad Cow disease, a farmer-researcher told the Edinburgh International Science Festival Saturday. Organo-phosphate chemicals are widely used as pesticides in agriculture, horticulture, fish farming, forestry and veterinary medicine and in the home for medicated shampoos, fly-sprays and flame retardant clothing or bedding, Mark Purdey said. <P>

Purdey said farmers were forced to use phosnet -- a blend of organo-phosphates and base of the drug thalidomide -- in the 1980s to combat warble fly infestation. Massaging it into a beast's rump to ensure it penetrated hide, flesh and muscle and reached deep-burrowing larvae meant OP toxins affected the animal's nervous system.  Purdey  successfully defended himself against an Agriculture Ministry prosecution for refusing to use phosnet. He then began to study organic chemistry to back his practical experience with scientific knowledge. <P>

In the process he lost his farm, was shot at, blockaded in his home to prevent him giving a lecture, and saw a new farmhouse go up in flames the day he was due to move in. Purdey says it was significant that Switzerland, the only other European country to insist on the use of phosnet is the only other European country with large-scale BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) outbreaks.  OPs readily cross body barriers and bind with crucial nerve enzymes, disrupting pathways of the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems, Purdey said.

Endo T; Groth D; Prusiner SB; Kobata A <BR>
Biochemistry 28: 8380-8 (1989) <P>

Prion proteins from humans and rodents contain two consensus sites for asparagine-linked glycosylation near their C-termini. The asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of the scrapie isoform of the hamster prion protein  were considered. Structural studies  revealed that the outer chain moieties contain a mixture of bi-, tri-, and tetra-antennary complex-type sugar chains with their core:<P>

 Man alpha 1--6(GlcNAc beta 1--4)(Man alpha 1--3)Man beta 1--4GlcNAc
beta 1--4-(Fuc alpha 1--6)GlcNAc <P>

Variation is produced by the different combination of the oligosaccharides:<BR>
 Gal beta 1--4GlcNAc beta 1--<BR>
 Gal beta 1--4(Fuc alpha 1--3)GlcNAc beta 1--<BR>
 GlcNAc beta 1--, Sia alpha 2--3Gal beta

Sia alpha 2--6Gal beta 1--4GlcNAc beta 1-- <P>

When both asparagine-linked consensus sites are glycosylated, the diversity of oligosaccharide structures yields over 400 different forms of the scrapie prion protein. Whether these diverse asparagine-linked oligosaccharides participate in scrapie prion infectivity or modify the
function of the cellular prion protein remains to be established.

Lehmann S; Harris DA <BR>
J Biol Chem 270: 24589-97 (1995) <P>

Inherited forms of prion disease have been linked to mutations in the gene encoding PrP, a neuronal and glial protein that is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor.
<P>
One familial form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is associated with a mutant PrP containing six additional octapeptide repeats. We report here our analysis of cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a
murine homologue of this mutant PrP. We find that, like wild-type PrP, the mutant protein is glycosylated, GPI-anchored, and expressed on the cell surface. <P>

Surprisingly, however, cleavage of the GPI anchor using phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C fails to release the mutant PrP from the surface of intact cells, suggesting that it has an additional mode of membrane attachment. The phospholipase-treated protein is still hydrophobic.... Our
results suggest that alterations in the membrane association of PrP may be an important feature of prion diseases.

Chen SG; Teplow DB; Parchi P; Teller JK; Gambetti P; Autilio-Gambetti L <BR>
J Biol Chem 270: 19173-80 (1995) <P>

The cellular form of the prion protein (PrPc) is a glycoprotein anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety. An aberrant form of PrPc that is partially resistant to proteases, PrPres, is a hallmark of prion diseases, which in humans include Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia. <P>

We have characterized the major forms of PrP in normal and pathological human brains. A COOH-terminal fragment of PrPc, designated C1, is abundant in normal and CJD brains as well as in human neuroblastoma cells. Sequence analysis revealed that C1 contains alternative NH2 termini starting at
His-111 or Met-112. Like PrPc, C1 is glycosylated, anchored to the cell membrane, and is heat-stable. Consistent with the lack of the NH2-terminal region of PrPc, C1 is more acidic than PrPc and does not bind heparin.<P>

 An additional fragment longer than C1, designated C2, is present in substantial amounts in CJD brains. Like PrPres, C2 is resistant to proteases and is detergent-insoluble. Our data indicate that
C1 is a major product of normal PrPc metabolism, generated by a cleavage that disrupts the neurotoxic and amyloidogenic region of PrP comprising residues 106-126. This region remains intact in C2, suggesting a role for C2 in prion diseases.

harmless -- but altered forms adopt the role of an infectious agent. Like a rotten apple, once 

inside the brain, the mutant form of prion protein turns the native protein into more copies of 

the deviant, infectious form. The end result is a characteristic loss of motor coordination, 

dementia and death, and a brain full of holes, like a sponge. Nobody understands the 

connection between prions and the particular pattern of symptoms that seem to be associated 

with them, nor why the brains of infected people or animals become spongy.<P> 

As all mammals produce prion protein, it would seem likely that it serves some useful 

purpose but, to everyone's surprise, mice without the prion-producing gene seem to grow up 

normally into healthy adult mice. Only after seventy weeks (which is late middle-age for a 

mouse) do things start to go wrong, according to Dr Suehiro Sakaguchi and his colleagues 

from the Nagasaki University School of Medicine in Japan, who report their findings in the 

11 April issue of <i>Nature</i>.<P>

The prion-free mice were resistant to scrapie, the sheep equivalent of BSE. Just as a single 

rotten apple can do no harm in an empty barrel, a brain without prion protein cannot be taken 

over by the rogue form. But no-one could guess why these mice should live for so long 

without feeling the deficiency of the normal prion protein.<P>
<B>The researchers noticed that their seventy-week-old prion-free mice were not as healthy as 

they first seemed. They developed an odd, uncoordinated gait. Their back legs began to 

tremble as they tried to walk, they took short tentative steps and were unable to keep a 

straight path. As they got older, their coordination became progressively worse, and they 

frequently collapsed. By ninety weeks, the mice had deteriorated even further. Hardly able to 

stand, most had developed spasmodic arching of their backs.</B><P>


These crippling symptoms are similar to those of BSE and CJD, leading the researchers to 

suppose that the loss of  the natural form of prion protein is to blame -- and may be the cause 

of at least some cases of these diseases, even in the absence of an infectious agent. There are 

two main ways in which the progressive take-over of the brain by the rogue prion might cause 

disease -- either the rogue prion itself causes damage, or the loss of normal prion means its 

usual beneficial function is not felt. <B>The cerebellum, the 

part of the brain responsible for movement and coordination, had shrunk by almost one-third </B>

in the specially bred, prion-free mice. <P>

One particular type of brain cell was particularly notable by its absence -- the <STRONG>Purkinje cells</STRONG>. 

Young mice, which had not yet succumbed to illness, had healthy numbers of these cells, so 

Dr Sakaguchi and his colleagues venture that prion prevents these cells from dying. After all, 

old people, whose brain cells are gradually dying off, also become progressively less 

coordinated in their movements. And loss of coordination is typical of many brain-wasting 

diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. These Purkinje cells, it seems, can 

survive for a while without any help, but they will soon die without the support of prion. 


Even with it they will eventually die, but prion certainly prolongs that inevitable moment.<P>

This latest research may also shed some light on the inherited form of CJD, a persistent 

(though rare) disease. The recent frenzy in Europe came only after the reporting of several 

cases of a new form of CJD. The latest victims are young people, with apparently no family 

history of the disease, raising fears that the disease had been caught by eating beef infected 

with BSE.<P> But the inherited form of CJD has long been known, affecting about one in every 

million people each year. One possibility might be that those susceptible to the disease have a 

faulty prion gene, so that they either do not produce enough prion, or produce it in a less 

effective form.<P>

But Dr Sakaguchi is cautious. His mice were not the first to be bred as prion-free, and those 

first mice were still healthy at 93 weeks of age. Slightly different breeding techniques may 

account for these differences, but until further analysis is brought to bear on prion-free mice, 

researchers cannot be confident in their understanding of the prion protein. Whatever the 

outcome, it will be too late to have any effect on the current economic crisis gripping Europe.<P>

<H3>Mad cow protein may <A NAME="regulate">regulate</A> sleep, study finds<HR></H2>

<P>    LONDON (Apr 17, 1996 4:53 p.m. EDT) -- The prion protein believed by many scientists to be responsible for mad cow disease and the related human version may also help regulate sleep, researchers reported Wednesday.<P>


    Irene Tobler of the Institute of Pharmacology at the University of Zurich and colleagues said mice bred to produce no prion proteins showed sleep disturbances and seemed unable to tell night from day properly.<P>

    "We provide evidence that the prion protein may...be involved in the regulation of sleep and that loss of this function may result in neurodegeneration in one of the prion diseases, fatal familial insomnia," they wrote in the science journal Nature.<P>

    "In mice devoid of prion protein there is an alteration in both circadian activity rhythms and sleep patterns." Circadian rhythm governs the night to day cycle of the body. Most experts think Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) is caused by mutated prions, proteins found in the brain. Related diseases like scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, kuru and fatal familial insomnia in humans are also prion- related.<P>

    The diseases are all marked by loss of memory, followed by loss of muscle coordination, weakness, and death.<P>

    Earlier this month scientists reported that mice bred to produce no prions seemed normal at first, but lost coordination and muscle control later in life.<P>

    They said this added to evidence that prions are needed for normal brain cell function.<P>

Pigs and poultry could be harboring BSE and passing it on th humans, says one of the world's leading authorities on spongiform encephalopathies.   Paul Brown of the National Institutes of Health in the US has studied CJD for three decades:<P>

"it's speculation, but I am perfectly serious.  Experimental work has shown that pigs are especially sensitive to the disease.  How ironic if 11 million British caslle should be slaughtered in a pre-emptive strike to eliminate CJD, only to find belatedly that the real villains were pigs or chickns which were also fed contaminated nutritional supplements," Brown wrote in a letter to the British Medical Journal.
<P>
Until late March, 996, pigs and chickens could be legally fed rations made from sheep infected with scrapie.  The animals are normally slaughtered so young that they would be unlikely to manifest clinical symptoms of the disease.  However,  sub-clinical infection coul provide a massive titre of infectious agent to people eating tainted meat.<HR>

Briltish Medical Journal editorial ... 30 Mar 96<P>


<P>The identification of 10 cases of a highly stereotyped clinicopathological
variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in adolescents and young adults
occurring in Britain within the past 24 months (R G Will, J Ironside, <I>et
al</I>,
personal communication) is cause for serious rethinking about the possibility of
human infection from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

<P>Typically, "sporadic" (idiopathic) cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease begin in
the sixth or seventh decade of life with a loss of memory or, less commonly, with
behavioural changes or higher cortical function deficits such as dysphasia or
dyslexia. Over several weeks the mental deterioration progresses to frank
dementia in association with abnormalities of vision or coordination, rigidity,
and involuntary movements (especially myoclonic jerks), which often occur in
synchrony with periodic spike waves on electroencephalography.[ii] Death usually
occurs within six months, and at necropsy the brain shows a pathognomonic
spongiosis with neuronal loss and gliosis in the cortex, deep nuclei, and
cerebellum. Amyloid plaques are found in only about 5% of cases.[iii]
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease contracted from infected growth hormone also begins in
a stereotyped way but with ataxia or other abnormalities of coordination.

<P>By contrast, the newly reported variant syndrome is characterised clinically
by
onset with psychiatric symptoms and progressive neurological deficits with an
unusual neuropathological profile (R G Will, I Ironside, <I>et al</I>, personal
communication). This syndrome vividly recalls kuru, the epidemic spongiform
encephalopathy in the eastern highlands of Papua New Guinea, which is thought to
have been orally transmitted through the practice of ritual cannibalism,
particularly the eating of brain tissue.[ii] All types of human and animal
spongiform encephalopathy, including kuru, scrapie, and bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, are experimentally transmissible in animals.

<P>The ill defined early emotional and behavioural symptoms of the new variant
will
obviously open the floodgates to hundreds if not thousands of suspected cases of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease over the next few years, and it will be a matter of
enormous practical importance to be able to screen real from imagined cases. A
soon to be reported spinal fluid test has shown itself to be both sensitive (97%)
and specific (98%) for diagnosing the disease in even its early clinical stages
and should prove extremely valuable in evaluating suspect cases (G Hsich, K
Kenney, C I Gibbs Jr, <I>et al</I>, personal communication.)

<P>Last November, the <I>BMJ</I> published a debate about the possibility of a
link between
bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, to which I
submitted a short article entitled "The jury is still out. "[iii] Despite this
even handed title, I must confess to having felt that the available evidence
favoured the idea that bovine spongiform encephalopathy constituted a negligible
risk to humans. It now appears I was wrong. I am still astonished, in view of all
of the earlier negative epidemiological and laboratory evidence concerning the
risk of human infection from scrapie (the analogous disease in sheep), and from
the failure to detect infectivity in the muscle of cattle with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, that human infection might be occurring from the ingestion of
beef (or, even more improbably, from milk).

<P>Especially distressing is the fact that no unusual dietary history
characterises
these cases - for example, the regular ingestion of calf brain, black puddings,
sausage, or tripe because of the implication that a "normal" British diet has
been sufficiently contaminated to have caused their infections. It is possible,
of course, that these cases are not related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy,
but it must be confessed that no better explanation is presently forthcoming.
However, it must also be emphasised that the link to cattle products is itself
only a presumption; how ironic, for example, if 11 million British cattle should
be slaughtered m a preemptive strike to eliminate the risk of zoonotic
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, only to find belatedly that the <B>true villains were
pigs or chickens</B> which were also fed contaminated nutritional supplements but
were brought to market at such a young age that the disease had not had time to
become manifest.

<P>A good deal of work remains to be done in order to establish the link between
bovine spongiform encephalopathy and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, much of which has
already been initiated. None of it will be of any help to those who may have been
exposed to the infectious agent in the 1980s before precautionary measures were
put in place to minimise the risk of human disease. Nor will it remedy the
possible failure of the scientific pundits (including me) to foresee a potential
medical catastrophe.

<h3><center>TAINTED FEED IS INFECTING BRITISH PIGS WITH <A NAME="TB">TB</A></center></h3>

<blockquote>Chicago Tribune (CT) - MONDAY, April 1, 1996<p>

LONDON - Britain's food inspectors have warned slaughterhouses of a
potentially dangerous outbreak of tuberculosis in pigs, linked to animal
feeding practices, The Observer newspaper reported Sunday.
   Scientists believe the increase in pig tuberculosis is due to breeders
feeding the animals peat contaminated with bird droppings, the newspaper
said. The peat is used to bulk out the animals' food.<p>

   The Observer quoted from a Meat Hygiene Service memor
andum written in
January--well before the scare over evidence of a new human strain of mad
cow disease--drawing attention to "evidence of a new problem."
  <b> Up to half the animals in two large pig slaughterhouses had been
infected.</b><p>
   The bacterium infecting pigs is common in wild birds, where it causes
avian tuberculosis. It also can be passed to people.
   The Observer said it has been known to cause enlargement of the lymph
glands in the neck  or cause lung infection in people prone to lung
disease.<p>
   Agriculture ministry officials told the newspaper it is different from
the bacteria that cause tuberculosis in humans.
   They said humans with the bacterium, microbacterium avium complex,
normally would show no symptoms. The bacterium is destroyed by normal
cooking.<p>
   The animal feed manufacturers' association told The Observer that peat
was used for a short period until six months ago.<hr>

<h3><center>'Right place, right time' for <A NAME="ostrich">ostrich</A> meat</center></h3>


USA TODAY (US) - THURSDAY April 11, 1996<BR>
By: Shannon Tangonan<P>

 A  North Carolina company expects to cash in on ostrich meat it's shipping
to England, where citizens are wary of tainted beef.
 Oro  Verde  Farms International, based in Raleigh, will ship 40,000 pounds
of  ostrich meat next week for distribution in supermarkets, pubs and inns,
company president Jim Kirk says.<P>

 The  company  started marketing in England eight months ago, but the going
was slow until British citizens began avoiding beef for fear of contracting
Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease,  a  condition  in humans similar to ``mad cow''
disease.<P>
 Ostrich  shipments  will  increase  to  about 100,000 pounds a month, Kirk
says. Britons can expect to pay from $14 to $16 a pound for the meat.
 Tender cuts of ostrich have the same flavor as a beef filet, Kirk says.
 ``I don't like to look at myself as gaining on someone else's hardships,''
he  says. ``But now that mad cow disease is here, we are at the right place
at the right time.''<P>
 Oro  Verde gained approval to sell ostrich in England, Wales, Scotland and
Ireland.
 Kirk  expects to enter other world markets, including Singapore, Japan and
Taiwan.
 ``Those are on the back burner -- cooking slowly,'' he says.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H3><CENTER>Macaque study <A NAME="finally">finally</A> published</CENTER></H3>

  LONDON  -- A study showing monkeys can develop a new strain of the human version of mad cow disease after being injected with brains from infected cattle was published on Wednesday.


    A Swiss specialist called the study worrying but said many more questions needed to be answered.<P>

    The French scientists who conducted the study held a news conference earlier this month to publicise their findings, which they wrote up in a letter to the science journal Nature. Nature published their letter on Wednesday.<P>

    British scientists said in March they had identified a new strain of the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the human form of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease), and said it was likely the victims had caught it from eating infected beef.<P>

    Corinne Lasmezas, a neuro-virologist at the Atomic Energy Commission, and colleagues at the French army health service said they had injected brain material from BSE-infected cattle into the brains of two adult macaques and one newborn.<P>

    Nearly three years after inoculation "the two adults developed abnormal behavioural signs including depression for the one, edginess and voracious appetite for the other." They also started to show the difficulty in moving and tremors that typify the disease.<P>

    The baby monkey showed signs even sooner. All three were killed and their brains examined -- currently the only way to positively diagnose BSE or CJD.
They had deposits of the abnormal prion protein, a mutated brain protein that most scientists think causes the disease.<P>

    The pattern was "strikingly" similar to that seen in the new CJD cases but different from the pattern seen in the brains of macaques that had been infected with normal CJD.<P>

    Although the monkeys were injected with CJD the researchers said there was probably no difference between having the infectious agent injected and eating it. Other tests have shown the abnormal prions survive very high temperatures and would likely make it through the digestive system unscathed.<P>

    Adriano Aguzzi, a neuropathologist at University Hospital of Zurich, said it was worrying that the small amounts of cow brain material used in the experiment infected the monkeys.
    "It is unsettling that these amounts are well within the range of brain tissue present in commerical food products for human consumption until a few years ago," he wrote in a commentary in Nature.
    "On the other hand, however spectacular (and worrying) these findings are...we can hope that the oral route of administration will be considerably less efficient."<P>

    Aguzzi said the study left many questions unanswered, such as whether the monkeys could get the new CJD variant from eating infected cattle brains and if so, what was the minimal infectious dose. He also said it could be doubtful whether macaques were a good model for human disease.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>French scientists see mad cow-CJD link in monkeys</CENTER></H1>
   PARIS (Jun 13, 1996)<P>
French government scientists said on Thursday they had found the first experimental evidence of a link between mad cow disease and its human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in work on monkeys.<P>


    Two neurologists working for the Atomic Energy Commission and the French army health service said their research showed striking similarities between brain lesions in monkeys injected with the crushed brains of cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and a new form of CJD observed in humans.<P>

    Their study, to be published by the British scientific journal Nature, lends new weight to the theory that BSE can be passed to humans, although they stressed it did not prove that.<P>


    Scientists Corinne Lasmezas and Jean-Philippe Deslys said they had injected the brain concentrate into two adult macaque monkeys and a newly-born one in 1991.<I>[[These are described in the NY Times as rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulata--webmaster]]</I>

    Three years later, all three began to show behavioural disorders -- anxiety, nervousness and depression -- and had developed identical brain lesions and died.

    "This is the first experimental evidence supporting a link between BSE and the new form of Creuzfeld-Jakob disease in man," Lasmezas told a news conference.<P>

    The scientists, who had been studying BSE, said they had only been alerted to the possible link with CJD by the British announcement and had then compared their results with new cases of the human disease observed in Edinburgh, Scotland in mid-May in sufferers under the age of 40.<P>

    Deslys said the brain lesions were "very close, strikingly similar" and constituted "a first experimental argument for a causal link between the bovine illness and the new form of CJD in the British patients."<P>

    He said the lesions were flower-shaped patches surrounded by cavities.

    The researchers said they injected the concentrate directly into the monkeys' brains rather than giving it to them orally.

    They declined to say firmly whether BSE can be transmitted to humans but said their findings called for further research.<P>

    In March, British scientists said they had identified a new form of CJD that was probably caused by eating beef infected with BSE. The new strain shows a slightly different pattern from earlier forms, first identified early in the century.<P>

    British government experts say BSE was caused by feeding cows the remains of sheep that had been infected with scrapie, their own version of the disease.<P>

The Times: Britain:June 15 1996
<P>

BRITISH scientists plan to look again at experiments in which "mad cow" disease was transmitted to marmosets <I>[[New World monkeys of the famil Callithricidae --webmaster]] </I>  in the early 1990s. A French team has reported that brain lesions seen in macaque monkeys infected with BSE bear a close resemblance to those in young people who have developed Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).

<P>

At the time the marmoset experiments were carried out, the new form of CJD had yet to be identified or described. Gerald Wells of the Central Veterinary Laboratory, one of the team responsible, said that at first sight they appeared to conflict with the French findings: "So far, I haven't seen a full version of the French data but, on the assumption that their material is very like the new variant of CJD, our results are not similar."

<P>

The team has already looked again at the distribution of prion protein in preserved material from the brains of the marmosets, and found that it is not the same as in the CJD cases. Now there is a proposal to use the material for further experiments to infect mice, with identical experiments using material from CJD patients. If both cause identical symptoms in mice, it would demonstrate a common origin.

Human prion diseases are characterized by the accumulation in the brain of an abnormal form of the prion protein. Prion protein
polymorphisms seem to play a key role in the pathogenesis of these diseases, probably by enhancing the amyloidogenic properties of the
protein. We performed prion protein gene (PRNP) coding sequence analysis in 57 French subjects with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
and found a mutation of the PRNP coding sequence in nine subjects (15.8%); the mutation corresponded with a known family history of CJD
in only three of these subjects. In 41 definite and probable cases without known PRNP mutations, codon 129 genotyping revealed an excess
of the homozygous 129Met/Met genotype corresponding to a 3.4-fold increased risk of developing CJD when compared with the two other
genotypes. We also found that the 129Val/Val genotype, which mainly governs susceptibility to iatrogenic CJD, does not seem to predispose
to sporadic CJD.

Prion diseases are manifest as genetic, sporadic or infectious neurodegenerative disorders in humans and animals. The prolonged incubation
times that accompany the transmission of prions between species are due, at least in part, to differences in prion protein (PrP) sequence.
To examine the species barriers between non-human primates and humans, we sequenced the open reading frames (ORF) of 25 PrP genes
from apes and monkeys. Comparison of the PrP genes of these animals with that of humans showed amino acid identities ranging from 92.9
to 99.6%.  [[There are some 250 amino acids in the prion protein, so this translates to 1-18 amino acid differences -- webmaster]]
<P>
While phylograms of primate PrP sequences revealed a novel branching pattern for the apes, the genomic organization of all the
primate PrP genes was similar, with the entire ORF contained within a single exon. Alignment of variant residues in primates, rodents and
domestic animals showed no concordance with the mutations that segregate with human prion diseases or with polymorphisms that modulate
disease in humans, mice and sheep. Most substitutions were conservative and, characteristically, clustered outside the four putative
alpha-helical regions that are thought to form a four-helix bundle in the cellular isoform of PrP (PrPC). <P>
<P>
Deletion of one of five Gly-Pro
rich octarepeats from the N-terminus of PrP was seen in some species, while squirrel monkeys had an additional octarepeat; squirrel
monkeys have been frequently used as experimental hosts for transmission of human prions. Alignment of primate and other mammalian
PrP sequences suggests that codons between 90 and 130 have a profound influence on the transmissibility of prions from one species to
another.

<CENTER><H3>New link found between <A NAME="human">human</A> and cow diseases</H3></CENTER>

<P>    LONDON (Apr 24, 1996 4:12 p.m. EDT) -- Scientists working in Britain published evidence Wednesday that could show mad cow disease and its human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, are closely related. They said brain proteins linked with both diseases show very close genetic similarities.<P>


    Writing in the science journal Nature, David Krakauer and colleagues at Oxford University's zoology department said <B>this could explain why people could develop CJD from eating meat</B> from cows infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease). 

    It could also explain why people never got CJD from eating sheep infected with scrapie, the ovine version of the disease.<P>

    The British government said last month that people might possibly get CJD from eating beef after scientists identified a new strain of CJD, which is always fatal, in 10 victims.<P>

    No one knows for sure what causes either disease. But a naturally occurring protein called a prion is known to be involved.

    Recent studies have indicated that normal prions are important to the function of brain cells. In diseases like BSE and CJD the prions somehow become mutated and brain cells die off, creating the typical spongelike appearance of the brain.<P>

    Krakauer and colleagues decided to find out if there were any similarities between prions in cows and in humans.

    "Scrapie, which has been around for 200 years, has never been shown to transmit to human populations," Krakauer said in a telephone interview. "BSE may have. If that's the case, what we need to find is a similarity we share with cattle that we don't share with sheep. That's what we have found."<P>

    Krakauer, an evolutionary biologist, looked at the prion gene and closely examined the sequence, or order, of the amino acids on the gene.

    They compared cow prion genes and human prion genes to those found in other animals such as sheep, rodents and monkeys and found two striking similarities in the sequence for cows, humans, chimpanzees and gorillas. No other animal shared these similarities, they said.<P>

    Looking back at the evolution of the gene, they found that people, apes and cattle had independently evolved the change.

    "It sort of popped up at the terminal branches of this evolutionary bush," said Krakauer. "Therefore, we have to take it quite seriously...It is the first data that uniquely links us and cattle."<P>

    In addition, the difference was in a region of the gene that other studies show may be involved in the acquisition of BSE, CJD and other spongiform encephalopathies.

    The changes could be there for a number of reasons. But, they said: "As an incidental consequence...these changes might also have predisposed humans toward a strain of prion disease occurring in (cattle)."<P>

    Krakauer said more study was needed, especially into whether these amino acid sequences were indeed involved in development of the deadly brain diseases.<P>

<A NAME="Commentary">Commentary</A> on molecular evolution result of Krakauer et. al
[Listserve 5.15.96 -- webmaster]: <P>

Krakauer et. al have a fairly good case for an unfortunate happenstance of
convergent evolution of prion protein secondary structure of cows  and
higher primates. There are 11 hot spots on the human prion
gene for familial CJD that give rise to the rogue catalytic conformer.  The
critical areas are matched in the cow, even though the cow differs overall
from human at 30 amino acids.  So the argument is that the species barrier
is less than what it otherwise might have been.<P>


Tthe thesis could have been expanded to explain why zoo
felids get the disease but not the canids.  [But that still leaves us with
the 3 spongiform German ostriches.]<P>

Will et. al sequenced the entire open reading
frame for prion protein from the  young v-CJD victims and found them all
(8/8) homozygous normal, ruling out familial CJD.<P>

Basically, for proof of cow to human transmission, someone is going to have to demonstrate by
immunofluorescence that traces of the rogue cow protein is present in human
victims.  Note that this need not be an abnormal sequence -- it could have
been normal but converted in the cow from a rogue scrapie or rogue bovine
sequence.<P>
 
In this scenario, the cow has intermediated the passage of scrapie from
sheep to humans [which apparently does not aoccur otherwise].  Thus some
sheep somewhere had the scrapie mutation.  The problem is passed on to a
normal sheep [whether by hay mite or offal], then to a normal cow [whether
by hay mite or offal], and then to a genetically normal person [through
diet or cosmetics].<P>

It is a dead certainty that "familial" BSE  occurs naturally in cattle etc.
all over the world.  If, repeat if, the rate is similar to familial CJD in
humans [say, 1 per 1,000,000 per year], then the US, for example, with
103,000,000 cattle, would have 103 cases each year.  The FDA is careful and
correct to say that these haven't been observed [yet];  APHIS makes a PR
blunder by saying point-blank it doesn't occur.  This is biological rubbish
that will damage their credibility later.  Just look at those Medline
mutant bovine sequences.

<I>Feedstuffs Magazine, April 10, 1995</I><P>



Cattle that act normally on the farm or ranch may go 
<B>"bonkers"</B> during transit or in the packing plant due to a 
genetic predisposition that prompts them to "take flight" 
during stressful situations. For some of these critters, it 
doesn't take much to "light their 
fire, "according to 
Temple Grandin, a livestock-handling consultant of Ft. 
Collins, Colo.<P>



European-U.S. crossbred animals are more likely to express 
the <B>"crazy cattle" syndrome</B>, and heifers tend to be worse
than steers. Grandin often refers to these malcontents as 
"heifers from hell." She told a group of midwestern cattlemen 
recently, "I have seen cattle so wild they will panic like 
horses. They will <B>beat their brains out</B>, tear their hooves 
off in a gate and cause chaos during unloading or in 
pre-slaughter facilities."<P>


The <B>problem of flighty market cattle has accelerated in the 
past two years</B>. The bottom line? These animals tend to 
produce dark-cutting meat. That's bad for packers and beef 
merchandisers. In addition to genetics and poor handling 
techniques, implants can exacerbate the problem, one that 
costs the top packers millions of dollars per year. "Docking 
producers is the only way to stop the problem," she concluded.<P>


<B>Downer beef cows</B> are another <BLINK>increasing</BLINK> problem. Grandin 
reported that <B>1% of beef cows are downers</B>. In fact, 50% of 
all downer cows now are beef, not dairy, as has been the case 
traditionally. "<B>Most cow killers will not touch a downer</B>," 
she commented.<HR>

BRITISH BEEFEATERS ARE BACKING  OFF  THEIR STEAK AND KIDNEY PIES.<BR>

Charlotte Observer (CO) - March 30, 1996
By: ALISA MULLINS, Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service

  
Last  week, British Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell finally bit the bullet
and  announced  that  bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy, commonly known as
``mad  cow  disease'' or BSE, can be transmitted to humans. This about-face
came  after a decade of stonewalling by the British government. The disease
was  first  discovered  in  British cattle in 1986, yet as recently as last
October,  British Prime Minister John Major was still claiming that ``there
is no evidence that BSE can be transmitted to humans.''<P>

   British  officials  finally  realized  they  could  no longer ignore the
opinions  of  leading  scientists  and  the  increasing  number of cases of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), an affliction similar to BSE, which humans
may  contract  if  they  eat  cattle  with mad cow disease. British doctors
diagnosed  55  new  cases of CJD in 1994 - 13 more than the year before and
double the rate of a decade ago.<P>

   BSE  and  CJD  are  hideous  diseases. They eat away the nervous system,
destroying  the brain, essentially turning it into a sponge. Victims suffer
dementia,  confusion,  loss of speech, sight and hearing, convulsions, coma
and  death.  Spongiform  encephalopathies  are always fatal and there is no
treatment.<P>

   British  beefeaters  who  have  not yet lost their minds are backing off
their  steak  and  kidney pies in droves. McDonald's chains in Britain have
announced  they will not sell hamburgers until a non-British source of beef
can  be  found. More than 2,000 schools have removed beef from their menus.
France  and  Belgium  have  suspended  the  importation of British beef and
Germany  is  pushing  for  a  Europe-wide  ban.  A panicked Britain is even
considering  killing its entire national herd - more than 11 million cattle
- and starting over from scratch.<P>

   Trouble  is,  much  of  this  damage control may be too late. CJD has an
incubation  period  of  10  to 40 years. Many falling victim to the disease
today may have contracted it a decade ago when the BSE epidemic began.<P>

   Americans, too, should think twice before throwing burgers on the grill.
Why? Because BSE may already be here, even though the U.S. has not imported
beef or cattle from the British since 1989.<P>

   In  1985,  7,000 minks in Stetsonville, Wis., died of transmissible mink
encephalopathy  after  being  fed a consistent diet of so-called ``downer''
cows  -  cattle  who  collapse  on  the  arduous  journey  from  feedlot to
slaughterhouse.  Scientists  believe  that some downer cows suffer from mad
cow  disease. It's hard to tell, because it can take up to eight years from
the  time of infection for symptoms to show - and most U.S. cattle are dead
before their fifth birthdays.These  animals  are  never tested for BSE. They are ground up and fed to somebody - humans, dogs, cats, minks and other cattle.<P>

   Since the BSE outbreak in England was traced to protein supplements that
included  scrapie-infected  sheep - scrapie is the sheep version of mad cow
disease  -  Britain has banned the use of ruminant parts in animal feed. No
such ban is in effect here. Cows and sheep are still being fed to cows. BSE
could be a sleeping dinosaur.<P>

   Physicians   and  scientists  already  know  that  some  Americans  with
Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease  were  incorrectly diagnosed with Alzheimer's, a
disease  with  similar symptoms. Did the CJD originate in the cattle served
up for supper?<P>

   It is grossly unnatural to feed other animals to cattle, who are natural
vegetarians.  But  the  demands made upon cows by today's ``factory'' farms
aren't natural either. Animals crammed into warehouses and feedlots must be
shipped  off to slaughter quickly, before the hellish conditions kill them.
Consequently  they are forced to grow ever bigger, ever faster, through the
use  of  growth  hormones,  antibiotics  and high-protein feeds. As Rutgers
University   biology   professor   Dr.   David  Ehrenfeld  recently  wrote:
``Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease  . . . has not been listed as a side effect of
factory farming.  . . . Maybe it should be.''

<H3><CENTER>MAD COWS ON THIS SIDE OF THE <A NAME="ATLANTIC">ATLANTIC?</A>?</CENTER></H3>

St. Paul Pioneer Press ... May 7, 1996

<STRONG>Q. </STRONG> Concerning mad cow disease, is it true that animal protein derived from
rendered cows still shows up in U.S. cattle feed?<P>

  <STRONG> A.</STRONG>
   It's true. Experts are quick to point out, however, that there have been
no  cases  of  mad  cow disease in this country, so the practice of feeding
cows to cows is safe. Others disagree, saying the practice is unsound.
   Mad  cow  disease  is  believed  to  have  originated in sheep, which it
afflicts  in  a  form  known as scrapie. Britain banned animal protein from
rendered sheep as an additive to cattle feed in 1989.
   The United States has forbidden beef imports from Britain since 1989.<P>

<STRONG>Q. </STRONG>   So, what's the beef?
  <STRONG> A.</STRONG> Simply  stated,  the  beef is that on March 20, 1996, British scientists
linked  a  deadly new form of brain disease in humans with mad cow disease.
The  disease agent is believed to be a prion protein - a lot harder to deal
with  than  bacteria or virus. If the people got the disease from something
they  ate, and the cattle got the disease from something they ate, it would
stand to reason that what cattle eat is a matter of some importance.

<P>
<B>Q.</B>  A  few  weeks  ago, WCCO-TV did a story on sick cows in Minnesota. They
looked  very  much  like  the sick cows in Britain we've seen on TV. Is our
government trying to hide something?<P>

   <B>A.</B>  The sick Minnesota cows shown on television supposedly suffered from
bovine  viral  diarrhea, a scourge unique to cattle and not transferable to
other   species,   says   Jackie  Renner,  spokeswoman  for  the  Minnesota
Agriculture  Department.  The outbreak of ``mad cow disease'' in the United
Kingdom  involves  a disease called bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which
may  be  linked  to  a  brain disease in humans. The U.S. government, which
banned  meat imports from the United Kingdom in 1989, is not trying to hide
something,  but  it  is  trying  to  keep mad cow disease from reaching our
shores.<HR>

<H4><CENTER><A NAME="VET">VET</A> SAYS PROTEIN FEED PUTS U.S. CATTLE AT RISK</CENTER></H4>

St. Paul Pioneer Press ... March 28, 1996
By: ROBERT IMRIE, Associated Press


WAUSAU,  Wis.  - Cattle in the United States are at risk of contracting mad
cow  disease  unless the federal government bans the feeding of cow protein
to cows, a University of Wisconsin professor warned Wednesday.
   ``We  need  to  prevent it from happening here. I don't think we need to
scare  the public in order to do this. We just need to stop feeding cows to
cows.  That's  how  it  got  started  in  Britain,''  Richard  Marsh,  a UW
veterinary scientist said in a telephone interview from Madison.<P>

   Marsh  said  the  U.S.  Food  and  Drug Administration should ban animal
protein  from  cows  and  sheep from being put into feed that's then fed to
cows.
   Meat  and bone meal from other species, perhaps pigs, should be used for
the protein supplement in cattle feed, he said.<P>
  Dairy  animals  are at more risk of getting mad cow disease because they
live longer, Marsh said.
   It  takes  the  disease five to six years to incubate, he said. The only
way  to diagnose the infection is to take out an animal's brain and examine
it, he said.
   ``We  should look for it in our oldest animals that have been fed animal
protein for the longest time,'' Marsh said.<P>

 Jan.  1  surveys  indicated  there were 3.8 million cattle in Wisconsin,
including  1.47  million  milk cows, said Laura Mason, a dairy statistician
for the Wisconsin Agricultural Statistics Service within USDA in Madison.
   Throughout the United States, there were 103.8 million cattle, including
9.41 million milk cows, she said.<P>
   The   Washington,   D.C.,-based   International  Center  for  Technology
Assessment said Wednesday that it had filed petitions with FDA and the U.S.
Agriculture   Department  threatening  legal  action  unless  the  agencies
immediately  banned  the feeding of protein-derived animal feed supplements
from rendered mammals, including cattle and sheep, back to cattle and other
animals.<P>
 
   But  Perry  Clark, a professor of animal science at UW-River Falls, said
such  a  ban  was unnecessary and premature, given there was no evidence of
any infected cattle in the United States.
   <B>A  ban would unnecessarily reduce the profitability</B> of dairy farmers who
use the feed supplement to get their cows to produce more milk, he said.

   ``If  you  want  to  live in a perfectly risk-free world you ban it. But
that  is  not  my  idea,''  he said. ``I don't think (Marsh) speaks for the
majority of animal scientists in the country.''<P>


   Clark  estimated  that  no  more  than  one-third  of  the dairy cows in
Wisconsin  are  fed animal byproduct protein supplements, mainly the higher
producing herds that generally tend to be the larger herds, he said.
   The  protein  supplements  are  labeled  as  meat  and bone meal but the
species used isn't identified, Clark said.The supplement is rarely used in beef cows, he said.<P>
 
   Dave  Atwell,  a  dairy nutritionist for Cenex Land O'Lakes in St. Paul,
Minn., an agricultural cooperative that sells feed and other goods to Upper
Midwest  farmers, said generally hogs and cattle are used to make byproduct
protein supplements, which are sold by the ton to many farmers.
   ``I  don't  believe  anybody  in  the  feed  industry  is using rendered
material from sheep,'' he said.<HR>

<H4>U.S. CATTLE PRODUCERS <A NAME="WARY">WARY</A> OF MAD COW CRISIS</H3>

STATE  (COLUMBIA) (CS) - Tuesday, March 26, 1996<BR>
By: The Associated Press<P>

DALLAS - U.S. cattle raisers are hoping Britain's mad cow disease will lead
European  countries  to  relax  restrictions  on American beef imports, but
they're  also  concerned  the  scare  could  send domestic consumers to the
chicken counter.<P>

   Britain's  $6  billion  beef industry has been in crisis since Wednesday
when   the   British   government   acknowledged   that  Bovine  spongiform
encephalopathy,  better  known  as  BSE or mad cow disease, may be the most
likely source of a similar brain disease in humans.<P>
   Thad  Lively, director for analysis and evaluation for the Chicago-based
U.S.  Meat  Export  Federation,  said Monday there is no danger to the U.S.
beef  supply  because of stringent controls on domestic cattle and imports.
He said American consumers should not be afraid.<P>
   ``We  want  to  highlight  that  we've never had a report of BSE in this
country. We have controls in place,'' Lively said.
   Mad  cow  disease broke out in Britain's herds 10 years ago. In the past
decade,  the  U.S.  Department  of Agriculture has examined more than 2,660
specimens from 43 states and detected no evidence of the disease.<P>
   The  USDA's  Food  Safety  Inspection  Service  said  there  has been no
imported  processed  beef or cattle from the United Kingdom since 1989, and
stringent  restrictions have been in place for imports from other countries
where the disease exists.<P>
   But  the  possibility  of Americans turning away from beef could further
hurt  a cattle industry that has already watched wholesale beef prices drop
35  percent from a peak of $1.03 a pound in 1993 to 68 cents a pound at the
end of 1995, according to the National Cattlemen's Association in Colorado.<P>
   The  decline  was  caused by a glut of meat on the market. More ranchers
are selling their cattle because an ongoing drought has raised the price of
corn  feed  and, at the same time, the devaluation of the peso has prompted
Mexican ranchers to sell off their herds.
   Now,  U.S.  cattle  raisers  will have to contend with the beef scare in
Britain.<P>
   ``Any  time  you have a question about the meat supply, be it pork, beef
or  chicken,  it  causes  concern,''  said Murray Edwards of Abilene Cattle
Feeders, one of the largest cattle feed lots in Texas.
   If  U.S.  consumers  get  scared,  cattle prices could weaken even more,
Edwards said.<P>
   Still  some industry insiders hope to find good news in the bad reports.
Although  U.S.  beef  can't  be  exported  to Britain or the European Union
because  of  a  ban on hormone additives, there is a possibility that there
will be a second look at the restrictions.<P>
   ``There's   no  reason  that  the  hormone  ban  continues.  If  it  was
eliminated,  we  could  ship beef there,'' said Gary Weber, a specialist in
cattle  health and beef safety with the National Cattleman's Association in
Washington.<P>
   Still Lively, of the Meat Export Federation, remains nervous.
   ``In  no way is this good news to anyone in the business,'' Lively said.
``It's  asking a lot of consumers to say `British beef is bad, but American
beef is OK.' ''<HR>


<H4><CENTER><A NAME="KENTUCKY">KENTUCKY</A> BEEF PRICE, SUPPLY LIKELY TO REMAIN
STABLE</CENTER></H4>

Lexington Herald-Leader (LH) - WEDNESDAY, March 27, 1996<BR>
By: Stephen Trimble Herald-Leader Staff Writer<P>

The  price  and supply of beef in Kentucky won't be affected -- at least in
the short-term -- by the mad cow disease scare in Great Britain.
That's  largely  because  the  European  Community in 1989 banned U.S. beef
imports  containing  growth  hormones,  said  Lee Meyer, a livestock market
specialist  and  agricultural  economics  professor  at  the  University of
Kentucky.<P>

 Several  European  countries  have banned British beef recently because of
the disease.
That  could  have been an opportunity for two local beef producers to start
an international market -- but they weren't interested.
Kentucky  Homegrown Beef L.L.C., based in Georgetown, and Laura's Lean Beef
Co.  in  Lexington  are part of a handful of beef producers nationwide that
don't put growth hormones into their cattle.<P>
That  makes  them exempt from the EC's ban and attractive to eager European
beef distributors.
Laura's  owner  Laura  Freeman  said  she's  received  calls  from European
distributors interested in buying her beef.
''The  domestic  market  has  been so good for us that we really don't need
it,'' said Freeman, whose company distributes beef nationwide.<P>
Homegrown  owner  John Sharpe said his company, which is only about 8 years
old, is too small for an international market.
The  situation  in  Europe could have an effect on all of Kentucky's 40,000
beef producers if the ban is lifted because of a beef shortage, Meyer said.
Meyer  said  the  ban  also  protects  U.S.  herds  and  consumers from the
degenerative disease.<P>
Only 499 British cattle were imported by the United States between 1981 and
1989,  according  to  the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Of those, 116 are
alive and 34 are unaccounted for. The imported cattle are used for breeding
stock only.<P>
The  British  Ministry  of  Health reported March 20 that bovine spongiform
encephalopathy   could   cause   a   fatal   disease   in   humans   called
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which sparked a panic in Europe.
No cases of the disease have been detected in the United States.
Nonetheless,  Meyer  expects  consumer  fears  of  the  disease locally and
nationwide to become a long-term liability for U.S. beef producers.<P>

TIMES UNION 3.20.96<P>

Cobleskill, NY -- In the words of John Huntley, farmers such as John and Pat Adams
are ``doing one for the flag.''
   By  giving  up their two rare Scottish Highlander cows even though there
is only a slim chance the cattle have mad cow disease, Huntley, the state's
official  veterinarian,  said  the couple may help save this country's beef
industry from earning a tarnished reputation.<P>

   Huntley  confirmed  Tuesday  that all three farmers in the state who own
cattle  of  British origin have agreed to allow them to be destroyed, which
will happen starting today. The state Department of Agriculture and Markets
and  the  U.S.  Department  of Agriculture will compensate the farmers at a
total cost of about $90,000.<P>
   There  are  more  than  100  head  of  cattle in the nation targeted for
destruction   because   of  the  mad  cow  disease,  or  bovine  spongiform
encephalopathy,  scare.  The  cattle  are  of  13  different breeds and are
located  in  many  states, but all are condemned because they were imported
from Britain between 1983 and 1989.<P>
   While  they  were  in  Britain, the animals could have been fed sheep or
cattle  offal.  Eating the offal of a diseased animal is the only confirmed
way for the disease to be spread either to other animals or to humans.
   The other New York cattle, coincidentally of the same breed, are located
in  Stormville,  near  Poughkeepsie, and Holcomb, near Rochester. The state
Agriculture  Department  is  not releasing the names of the farmers who own
them.<P>
   John  and  Pat  Adams said they regard their two condemned cows as pets,
not  just  investments. The couple has owned the cows for about three years
and hoped to raise the rare breed of cattle.
   They recently acquired a bull for the purpose who is safe because he was
not imported.
   John  Adams  points  out  that his cattle, who have been in this country
since  1985,  have  not  shown  any  signs  of the disease, even though the
disease only has a maximum incubation period of about 8 years.<P>
   But  Huntley  confirmed that the Adams' had little choice but to give up
their cattle.
   ``We  were  encouraged  to come up with the price,'' Pat Adams said. ``I
think they would have taken them whether we negotiated a price or not.''<P>
   Britain's  beef  industry  has  suffered  miserably  since  the disputed
linkage  between  mad cow disease and a human brain disease was established
recently,  Huntley  said.  The  United  States,  which  has  a much larger,
multibillion  dollar  beef  industry,  cannot  afford  consumers  to harbor
discomfort, either stateside or in the huge export market.<P>
   Before the scare broke in Europe several weeks ago, the USDA was content
to  monitor and quarantine the cattle, Huntley said. But now that the world
is  banning  British beef exports, the Agriculture Department is taking the
surest precaution possible.
   Holly  Cheever,  a  Guilderland veterinarian and animal rights activist,
questioned  why  the quarantine could not continue, at least for the cattle
kept as pets.<P>
   Even  cattle kept for milk production or breeding are almost always sent
to a slaughterhouse once they have passed their prime, she said.
   She acknowledged there is little point in opposing the more humane death
the department has planned. But she questioned killing pets who might never
be slaughtered for meat and therefore never endanger the food supply.<P>
   Bruce  Krug,  a farmer near Utica and state coordinator for the National
Farmers Union, called Tuesday for further precautions against the potential
spread of mad cow disease.
   He  noted  that  feeding  tallow to other cattle is common in the United
States  and  he noted that there is evidence that cows can pass the disease
to  their  calves  in utero. Some British breeding stock, he said, may have
been imported into the U.S. in embryonic form.<P>
   But  Huntley  said  the  U.S.  does  not  have the same flawed rendering
process  for producing tallow that is fed to cattle. This country also does
not  have  the occurrence of the sheep disease that translates into mad cow
disease in cattle.<P>
   He added that there is only a little mention of in-utero transfer of the
disease  and  that  the  research may be flawed because the calves and cows
studied ate the same potentially tainted feed.

<H3>Is BSE confined to Britain?</H3></CENTER>


No. It had spread 11 other countries by 1992 including France, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and the U.S. <STRONG>Sporadic outbreaks </STRONG>have occurred in the
USA and Canada from 1993 as a result of British farm animal exports. Some 471 British cattle were imported into the US before they were
outlawed in a 1989 ban. Of these possibly infectious animals, 188 were rendered down into animal feeds and at least 66 couldn't be traced.<P>


<STRONG>Scrapie</STRONG> is endemic in 39 US states which doesn't explain several outbreaks of Mink Spongiform Encephalopathy (TME) at US fur farms. These
animals cannot be infected with scrapie... but they had been<STRONG> given feeds made from 'downer' dairy cattle</STRONG>. 'Downers' is the American term for
cows which fall down and cannot stand up again because of sickness. <P>
Richard Marsh, a veterinary scientist at the University of Wisconsin,
has carried out experiments which suggest that some 'downer' cows may be infected with a type of BSE. And in America, the land of beef- and
burger-eaters, there are 100 million cattle of which <STRONG>300,000 die due to unexplained causes</STRONG> every year. <HR>

<I>Additional Background and Commentary  provided by Webmaster:</I><P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Authorities from UDSA-APHIS have been hunting down some of the several hundred cattle imported from Britain that escaped the 1989 ban on live imports.Politically, this is very significant to the meat and dairy industry. However, these animals are utterly insignificant scientifically in view of endemic <STRONG>sheep scrapie</STRONG> and <STRONG>300,000 'downer cows'</STRONG> annually entering the US food chain and <STRONG>continuing use</STRONG> of imported British protein and dietary supplements from infected animals.  Cattle in US definitely have BSE  [however we call it DCS -- downer cattle syndrome].  This disease has been transmitted to mink farms, as per numerous peer-reviewed publications of U. Wisconsin veterinary scientist R.F. Marsh, and quite possibly to two recent youngish human victims in Oregon.<P>
<P>
BSE is a disease that naturally occurs in cattle at low frequency just as scrapie occurs naturally in sheep as mutant alleles of a normal PrP gene, so of course it is present in the U.S.  The question is whether these basal levels have been exacerbated by feeding rendered infected sheep and cattle from either U.S. or British sources.

<title>Interview with Michael Greger</title>
</head>
<body>
<blockquote>6 May 1996
<h3><center>Interview with Michael Greger !!!</center></h3><hr>

<b>Background:</b> Michael Gregor was one of the first scientists to speak out strongly about the presence of mad cow disease in the US cattle populations, the risk of transmissions to humans, and the on-going  government  and media cover-up.<p>

His  <a HREF="http://envirolink.org/arrs/AnimaLife/spring94/madcow.html">influential 1994 Web page</a> asserted that, as a public health risk, bovine-CJD  was a "worse threat than AIDS," a seemingly radical view that was quickly affirmed upon reading his meticulously documented essay.  Two years later, Greger's views are widely shared  within the biomedical community.  However, the media blackout continues as before.<p>Greger has <a HREF="#Public"><b>just published</b></a> a major update to his original article.<p>



Michael Greger is interviewed below by Dr. Thomas Pringle, scientific advisor to the Sperling Biomedical Foundation.
<hr>

<b>Question 1:</b><p>

Michael, how was it possible for you as a junior at Cornell to know more about the dangers
 of BSE and prion disease than full time experts at <A HREF="http://www.ncanet.org/industry_research/usda_own.html">USDA</A>, <a HREF="http://info.aphis.usda.gov/cgi-bin/lwgate/BSE/">APHIS</a>, and <a HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a>?<p>


<b>Answer 1:</b><p>


I didn't do anything but bring together work that was already done.  It 
was all there; it was in the literature, it was in the British press 
weekly and perhaps monthly in the world press.  it just wasn't available 
to the American public.  The US officials knew it all they just didn't 
think it necessary, I gather, to invite public debate on the subject.  
Look at Marsh's findings.  They were like a decade ago.  They were just 
ignored; all I had to do was some digging.  This is important because by 
taking credit (one editor called it the "Greger Theory"; it's not a 
theory and it certainly isn't mine), it would undervalue the people in 
this field like >Dr. Richard Lacey (the microbiologist, not the <a HREF="http://www.ncanet.org/cattlemen.html">National Cattlemen's 
Beef Association</a> President!) who were the real pioneers and truly deserve 
the recognition.<p>
<hr>


<b>Question 2:</b><p>


 
 As a medical student at Tufts, have you learned anything that would lessen
 your public health concerns vis-a-vis transmission of BSE to humans in
 America?<p>

<b>Answer 2:</b><p>

The first two years of medical school are basic science, most of which 
I've had in undergrad.  If anything, it's just given me a better 
understanding of some of the underlying pathology, anatomy, 
biochemistry.  I'm going to be speaking at the medical school this 
Wednesday.  I am hopeful that it will stimulate heated debate in the 
medical and veterinary complex here.  The only news of late that would 
seem to minimize the threat is the as-of-yet-inconclusive transgenic mice 
experiments.
<hr>
 
<strong>Question 3:</strong><p>

 
 Over the next 7-10 years, do you see the CJD incidence in the US  from all
 causes staying at the alleged 1 per 1,000,000 per year?<p>


<b>Answer 3:</b><p>
It was never 1 per million per year and everybody knows it.  As I go into 
in my article CJD is seriously underdiagnosed/underreported.  Since we 
don't even know what the rate is now it would be hard to discern future 
trends.  This NY woman is puzzling/troubling.  British cutlets in 1987, 
symptoms in 1991?  Pretty short.  The question, though, is do I think 
there's going to be a rise in incidence.  I think it is inevitable *if* 
indeed BSE is causing CJD and we don't change the way the industry does 
business (how about first taking the WHO's recommendation of a ruminant 
to ruminat feed ban).  YEs I know the FDA promised one (like it did years 
ago).  But how about an *immediate* ban (not 12-18 months) with some 
strict enforement.  Is it too late already?  No one knows.  What are the 
chances anyone is in danger from eating BSE infected tissue?  No one 
knows.  And that's the scary part.  And the public is not being provided 
with the information people need to make their own risk assessments while 
the respective governments keep their fingers crossed.
<hr>
<hr>
[[The transgenic mouse experiment is one way of testing whether the infectious bovine agent can cross the species barrier into humnas.  Because it  is medically unethical to experiment on humans with an incurable lethal disease [unless you are a government agency or beef producer!], a strain of mice has been constructed genetically whose prion genes have been replace by the human sequence.  After inter-cerebral injection of infected bovine brain tissue, the mice are watched for up to 700 days to see if they acquire the disease.  They are at day 300 now.  The experiment, in the last analysis, is on mice, not humans.<p>
Oxford scientists just published a study based on molecular evolution, concluding that bovines <strong>can</strong> infect humans. -- clarification by webmaster]]

             <h3><center>The <a NAME="Public">Public</a> Health Implications of Mad Cow Disease</center></h3>
by <a HREF="mailto:mgreger@opal.tufts.edu">Michael Greger</a> <p>
Peter Hall showed the first signs of depression around Christmas, 1994. In five months he was in a wheelchair. He died at age 20 of Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, a relentlessly progressive and invariably fatal dementia [95] which usually attacks people in their sixties[33]; cases under 30 are exceedingly rare[112]. Around the next Christmas, an uproar ensued when leading British neuropathologist Sir Bernard Tomlinson refused to feed his children burgers out of fear that they might contract this disease f rom infected beef[102]. His fears were realized on Wednesday, March 20, 1996, when the British government announced that the most likely explanation of Peter's death and 9 other recently diagnosed cases of Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease among English young pe ople [41] was exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy(BSE)[71]. <p>

'Very unhappy' were the words British vet Colin Whitaker used to describe the dairy [12] cow who became the world's first documented case of BSE on a fine spring morning in 1985[123]. Dubbed Mad Cow Disease by the British press[53], BSE has by now a dec ade later stricken over 150,000 cattle [106]. The fear now is that through the consumption of infected beef Britain may be on the brink of the largest public health calamity since the Black Death[121] with worst case scenario estimates involving the deat hs of millions of people[101].<p>

Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) is a human spongiform encephalopathy[70] whose standard clinical picture involves weekly deterioration[67] into blindness and epilepsy[59] while one's brain perforates like swiss-cheese[105]. The World Health Organizatio n recently agreed with the British government's conclusion that there is a new variant of CJD whose appearence is best explained by the BSE epidemic in cows because of a number of consistent unusual features.[136]. Other than being extraordinarily young[ 41], the human victims also had atypical EEGs[96] and took twice as long to die[33]. The real clincher came, though, when their brains were autopsied[108]. Along with unusual psychiatric symptoms[80], the brain pathology was found to be vividly reminisce nt[69] of Kuru, a disease found in a New Guinea tribe of cannibals which ate the brains of their dead[46a]. In the words of Germany's leading expert on CJD "everything suggests that BSE is the cause..."[93]. <p>

The probable [107] link between BSE and CJD, viewed by Britain's Chief Medical Officer as "cause for serious concern", came as a complete reversal of the position the government held for a decade[58]. The next day 5 European countries banned the importa tion of British beef[37] and 10,000 British schools dropped beef from their menus[30]. That Friday McDonald's stopped serving British beef[29] and by Monday, Burger King[119] and Wendy's[125] stopped too. And Tuesday, less than a week after the announc ement was made, the European Union decided to quantantine the island, voting an immediate and indefinite worldwide ban on the export of British beef[87]. The same day in one of the biggest operations in decades, Ireland deployed extra police with troop s on standby to seal off its border to prevent cattle smuggling [94]. Finally, two days later, British beef was banned in Britain, but only from cattle considered to be higher at risk[117]. <p>

The debatedly [70] novel[3] infectious agents that cause spongiform encephalopathies like CJD and BSE evoke no immune response [50] and consequently may slowly accumulate[14] for an invisible latency period of up to 30 years.[60] No one knows how many people have already been infected. John Pattison, Dean of the University College of London Medical School and Chairman of the British government's Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), thinks there could be 500,000 people already incubatin g CJD[27]. "At this stage," he adds," we have to say it's totally unpredictable."[88] Needless to say, he does not feed beef to his grandson[82]. Microbiologist Steven Dealler, secretary of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Research Campaign, places the po ssible death count at 2 million people[118]. Professor Pattison reportedly agreed with this worst case scenario assessment.[118] This could mean up to a half million deaths a year as the epidemic peaks into the next century according to Richard Lacey[64] , a microbiology consultant for the World Health Organization and child health specialist.[68] <p>

Called the "most intriguing, unsolved puzzle in modern biology"[141] it is now close to being generally accepted that the cause of both the disease in humans and cows isn't a virus or a bacteria, but a "prion", an infectious protein.[78] Not only is it not known how they replicate[6], the whole concept challenges the basic tenets of biology.[45] Because of their unique makeup, they are practically invulnerable. They are not adequately destroyed by cooking[13], canning[14], nor freezing.[40] Chemicals or enzymes which degrade nucleic acids[55], proteolytic enzymes of the digestive tract[49], and usable doses of UV or ionizing radiation[40] are all ineffective in destroying their infectivity. Even heat sterilization[40], domestic bleach[59a], and formal dehyde[14] sterilization have little or no effect. In fact, the only way to ensure that one's burger is safe is to marinate it in Drain-O (or other concentrated alkali).[59] They are the smallest[9], most lethal self-perpetuating biological entities in th e world.[74]
In six years, BSE has gone from the most serious threat ever posed to British agriculture[44] to what the Prime Minister calls the worst crisis to confront the government in general, since the Falklands War.[72] Widespread fear first struck in 1989[19]. Only months after the government concluded that the disease probably wouldn't spread to other species[1], Max, someone's pet Siamese, died of a hitherto unknown feline spongiform encephalopathy[68]. BSE-infected pet food was "overwhelmingly the most li kely explanation."[36] And then zoo animals started dropping dead.[4] Together, this sparked a public uproar[19] with unprecedented media attention.[50] Fearing its spread into the human population, hospitals[34], nursing homes[34], and over 2000 schools[ 21], affecting over 750,000 school children[7], stopped serving beef or restricted its consumption. By May 1990, a quarter of the population reportedly refused to eat beef.[38] In six months beef prices dropped 10[5]-25%[3], devastating the cattle indust ry. The final blow came when Australia[43], Israel[43], and a dozen other countries[24] banned the importation of British beef because of the BSE epidemic. <p>

After a $6.5 million advertising campaign touting red-meat consumption, from Britain's Meat and Livestock Commission[34], though, and the Minister of Agriculture munching burgers with Cordelia[100], his four-year-old daughter for the TV cameras[16], the schools put beef back on the menu[50] and beef consumption regained semi-normal levels.[38] Despite continued warnings from scientists like Lacy, the European community had lifted its ban and most other countries had greatly relaxed their trade restricti ons[7] until news of these first human deaths recently broke.[90] <p>

Now with the worldwide ban in effect, Britain has been forced to agree to kill and incinerate[26] (or perhaps mince and bury)[103] millions of cattle[75] at a total cost of billions of dollars[11]. The decision is supported by the Minister of Agricultur e[119] and the National Farmer's Union[119], while admitting the mass slaughter would be 'too horrific to contemplate.'[120] In response to the proposed slaughter, an Hindi group in India offered the afflicted cows sanctuary while a Cambodian newspaper s uggested that the cows be used to detonate the country's buried landmines.[145]. The extermination may not have eliminate the epidemic, though, as evidence exists that prions can remain infectious for years in the soil[61] and/or may be harbored by insec ts.[76] A better solution would seem to be to finding out which cows were actually infected instead of just indiscriminate killing. Such a test for detecting BSE in live cattle was offered to the British government seven years ago by Harash Narang, a cl inical virologist with the public health service[85]. Dr. Narang was subsequently fired, and reportedly had his tires slashed five times, his home broken into, and his brakes tampered with[126]. Critics presume the government did not want the public to know how much infected beef was entering the food chain[126] and therefore discouraged such tests to protect the $4.6 billion beef industry[85] In fact Dr. Lacey claims that the British government has at all stages concealed facts and corrupted evidence beyond much reasonable doubt[68].<p>

The Labor Party charged the government with a "reckless disregard for public health"[119], "seriously complacent decisions"[121] historically and a "pathetic"[90] response to the current crisis. Others echoed similar charges of procrastination and delay [85]. A New Scientist editorial explained how the British government "tried to push scientific advice aside when it did not suit them."[106] An editorial in The Lancet criticized the government for making the error of equating the absence of evidence 
of risk with evidence of little or no risk.[82] Statements like "There's no way of predicting..." seemed to transform in the halls of government into "There is no evidence..."[107]. British agriculture minister Angela Browning's January pronouncement that her government's stance was "ultra precautionary" [115] bears a certain resemblance to similar statements now coming from the United States government.[116] Six months ago Britain's Prime Minister was still asserting that there was absolutely no co nnection between BSE and CJD[115] and still attempts to reassure the public that beef is safe to eat to this day[82]. Likewise the USDA continues to adamantly parrot day after day that there is no BSE in the USA[130]. <p>

The United States has the highest per capita beef consumption in the world.[65] and 100,000,000 cattle[8] Traditional bovine spongiform encephalopathy hit North America in 1993.[15] The first cow discovered to be infected, one of many imported from the UK before both Canada and the US banned the importation of British cattle, was found on a ranch in Alberta, Canada.[8] Of the 499[116] British cattle imported into the US before the 1989 ban, 188 of them have been melted down into lard and protein[8] (pre sumably for other livestock to eat) and 35 remain unaccounted for.[116] One of the imported bulls slaughtered had a "central nervous system abnormality" of which the USDA reported, "There is no definitive evidence that [the bull] either had or did not hav e BSE."[8] Although the importation of British beef has been banned from the US for a decade due to an unrelated disease[7], over 13 tons of meat and bone meal, which has been implicated in the birth of the British epidemic, has come into the US from Engl and between 1982 and 1989.[2]<p>

"BSE was 'almost certainly'[10] caused by feeding cattle ground up, dead, diseased sheep"[18] infected with an ovine spongiform encephalopathy known as scrapie.[20] In modern agribusiness, cows are no longer herbivores. "Protein concentrates" (or meat an d bone meal, both euphemisms for mashed- up bits of other animals left over from the slaughterhouse) are fed to dairy cows[22] to improve milk production,[65] for example. The real problem now, though, is not that we've made cows meat eaters but that we'v e turned them into cannibals as well; the recycling of the remains of infected cows into cattle feed[60] has probably led to the epidemic's explosive spread.[42] An editorial in the British Medical Journal described BSE as resulting "from an accidental e xperiment on the dietary transmissibility of prion disease between sheep and cows."[57] A subsequent experiment of this kind, with humans, probably occurred in England in the late 1980's when meat contaminated with BSE entered the food chain.[57] The res ult of this experiment is awaited "as we live through the incubation period" over the next decades.[57] <p>

Indigenous conditions here conducive to a BSE outbreak include the presence of scrapie in 39 states.[54] The 40-year[52] USDA Scrapie Eradication Program has been deemed a "dismal failure"[63] and even implicated in the recent rise of scrapie-infected sh eep.[54] Admitting defeat, the USDA scrapped the Scrapie Eradication Program 2 years ago and replaced it with an "entirely voluntary" control program.[21] The proportion of sheep to cattle in the US is dramatically smaller than in the British Isles though , which helps minimize the risk of an outbreak.[65] This is a moot point, however, if BSE is already here. 
Since 1947 there have been 25 outbreaks of Mink Spongiform Encephalopathy (also called TME) on US fur farms.[22] This perplexed researchers who were unable to orally infect mink with scrapie-infected sheep brains.[49] A clue came in 1985 when TME wiped o ut a population of minks in Wisconsin who hadn't eaten any sheep.[35] Their diet consisted almost exclusively of dairy cattle called "downers,"[54] an industry term describing a syndrome in which cows mysteriously drop down and are too sick to get up. <p>
The 
possibility, then, that US dairy herds were harboring some form of BSE intrigued University of Wisconsin veterinary scientist Richard Marsh.[65] To test this, Marsh inoculated US cattle with the infected mink brains.[49] As predicted, they died.[49] And when he fed the brains of these cows to healthy mink they too died of a spongiform encephalopathy[54] providing what he thought was the missing link.[66] Marsh hypothesized that the proposed BSE strain indigenous to the US manifests itself as more of a do wned cow disease than a mad cow disease.[49] With about 300,000 cows going down for unexplainable reasons every year in the US[65], this has frightening implications on a grand scale. The downer cow is then melted down in a process called rendering into feed and her bones are boiled[128] (along with her skin and cartilage)[77] to make gelatin, a main ingredient in Jell-O and marshmallows. The critical experiment came when Marsh inoculated scrapie infected sheep brain into US cattle.[63] If you do this i n England the cows go mad, twitching[16] and kicking into a rabid frenzy.[12] But in America, cows instead stagger to their deaths like downer cows do[65], supporting the belief that a form of BSE is already here in the United States. <p>

By 1990 the USDA had 60 labs monitoring US cattle herds for BSE.[7] In 1991 APHIS, the governmental agency which ensures the health of the nation's livestock, concluded that the "possibility of BSE appearing in US cattle is extremely low."[21] The assump tion made by APHIS and others[2], however, was that "scrapie infected sheep were the only source of the BSE agent."[21] This is certainly questionable in light of the evidence for an indigenous BSE agent. Likewise, the USDA surveillance program (described 
as slow, clumsy, and ineffective)[66] began looking for the rabies-like symptoms of the traditional British strain of BSE[52], in effect ignoring Marsh's findings.[21] In June 1992 a USDA consultant group continued to disregard the available evidence, de ciding that changes in the research program to accommodate the possibility that BSE was already present in the US were "not appropriate at this time."[21] No surprise really, when one realizes that this panel included representatives of the National Milk Producers Federation, the National Renderers Association, The American Sheep industry Association and the National Cattleman's Association.[21] According to a newspaper report, though, in 1993 the USDA finally backed down and started testing downer cows[6 5].<p>

In all, 2,660 brains from 43 states have been examined by APHIS[116] with plans to increase the number[92]. They report that no evidence for BSE has been found[116]. Unfortunately they were evidently relying on standard techniques used by British offic ials[129]. As reported in the April 1994 issue of the Journal of Infectious Diseases not only does the suspected American version of BSE differ in outward appearance, the affected brain also looks different than the British variety. Reportedly only a sm all percentage of the few thousand brains are therefore even being properly tested.[131] Even, however, if the more sensitive techniques were utilized in all the cases, Marsh feels that this number would be insufficient to impart a sense of security[129] . There is also suspicion that the USDA might try to cover up any suspected cases in an attempt to protect the $36 billion[129] beef industry from collapse.[47] <p>

In Germany, for example, scientists have admitted that there have been many cases of BSE that were not reported[124]. When the monetary compensation given to the British farmer whose infected cows were incinerated by the government rose from 50% of mark et value to full compensation, the number of reported cases shot up 73%.[59] Presumably, the earlier economic disincentive persuaded farmers to overlook a few mad cows. In general in fact British BSE cases have been severely underreported with as few as 60% of clinical cases reaching UK government statistics. It was reported in the Sunday Telegraph that "British officials believe that some European countries concealed or ignored evidence of 'mad cow disease' for fear of the consequences for their own farming industries."[124] The problem, as many English pundits saw it, is that the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food represents the interests of both consumers and the beef industry.[78] A similar conflict of interest exists in the United States. <p>
The mandate of the USDA is to promote agricultural products but also to protect consumer health. In Britain, at least, it would seem that the government's attempt at protecting the beef industry by concentrating more on PR crisis management than on d oing anything substantial ended up not only hurting the industry, but consumers, farmers, and the government as well.[98] 
With scientists like Marsh saying "The exact same thing could happen over here as happened in Britain,"[35] and with beef consumption already at a thirty-year low,[34] the USDA is justifiably worried. There was even a complaint filed with the FDA concern ing a woman with CJD who had been taking a dietary supplement containing bovine tissue.[4] Like England, we have been feeding dead cows to living cows for decades.[7] In fact, here in the US a minimum of 14% of the remains of rendered cattle is fed to oth er cows[49] (another 50% goes on the pig and chicken menu).[2] In 1989 alone almost 800 million pounds of processed animals were fed to beef and dairy cattle.[115] Partly because of this, the USDA has conceded that "the potential risk of amplification of 
the BSE agent is much greater in the United States" than in Britain.[8]<p>

 To make things worse, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of animal protein in commercial dairy feed since 1987.[35,49] The recent introduction of bovine growth hormone will only increase the need for rendered animal proteins in the rations of dairy cattle--of whom we eat 2.6 billion pounds of annually[8]. 
According to top encephalopathy expert Joseph Gibbs, one out of every million cattle naturally develops BSE.[65] A single teaspoon of ingested high infectivity meat and bone meal is thought to be enough to cause BSE in a cow[80]. Between this and eviden ce that prions may be able to adapt to their hosts and become more virulent with time[22], it would seem absolutely necessary to enact the ban and stop recycling this disease through US cattle. In June 1993 the Foundation on Economic Trends, a Washington public interest group[191], petitioned the FDA to ban all feeding of ruminants (cows, sheep) to other ruminants as the European Commonwealth had done three years before[23]. The legal petition was largely ignored[115]. The next year the FDA did propose to at least stop feeding sheep offal to cows, but it was blocked by vehement protests from the rendering and livestock industries[83]. A week after the Britain's recent admission that people m ay be dying from eating burgers, another public interest group, the International Center for Technology Assessment, filed a similar legal petition[115]. Leading consumer group Public Voice for Food and Health Policy has since also called for a ban[[135]. <p>

Three days after the latest petition was filed the meat industry announced a "voluntary" ban on feeding cows to cows[115]. In Britain they tried a similar voluntary ban; it failed miserably[115]. In the US the same rendering industry promised to stop feeding sheep brains to cows years ago; the FDA confirmed that this failed also[84]. On April 3, 1996 the World Health Organization called for a worldwide ban on feeding animal tissues to livestock[134] The FDA has promised to "expedite" such regulation s.[132] This is expected to mean that putting a formal ban in place will take 12 to 18 months[132]. Even with the law in Britain, though, surprise random inspections last year showed half of the English slaughterhouses in violation of the cow to cow ban 
regulations[91], but it is better than no law at all[105]. <p>

US officials admit that it is "very difficult" to verify compliance with the current voluntary ban[32]. In fact weeks after the "voluntary" ban was announced by the industry the feeding of rumi nant protein was still continuing at rates of million of pounds a day[115], supporting the director[104] of the Center for Media and Democracy John Stauber's contention that the oxymoronic voluntary ban was just a "worthless PR sham".[132] <p>

A spokesperson for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA), admitted 3 years ago that his industry could indeed find economically feasible alternatives to feeding rendered animal protein, but that the NCBA did not want to set a precedent of be ing ruled by "activists"[Food Chemical News, July 5, 1993]. Another NCBA spokesperson, Gary Weber, appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show this April[131]. Clearly alarmed and disturbed by the fact that cows in the US are forced to eat cattle remains, Oprah swore she would never eat another burger again[131]. Our government knew that the such feeding practices would be "vulnerable to media scrutiny" as portrayed in an internal PR crisis management document.[115] After Oprah tried to remind the audience tha t cows were supposed to be herbivores, Dr. Weber defended the practice by stating "Now keep in mind, before you--you view the ruminant animal, the cow, as simply a vegetarian--remember that they drink milk."[131] <p>

Cattle prices plummeted after the show aired.[97] The president of the National Cattlemen's beef Association called Oprah "a cheerleader for...anti-beef propaganda."[203] "We're not going to sit back and let trash TV trash a vital industry..." said the Texas Agriculture Commissioner in a prepared statement.[97] Texas agriculture officials are planning to bring a lawsuit against the opposing guest on the show, Howard Lyman, a cattle rancher turned vegetarian under a 1995 state law that prohibits unfoun ded comments about perishable food items[97]. These are among the same Texas officials that responded to the tragic news of the human deaths in Britain by staging a mocking April 4 publicity stunt cook-out.[115] On the show was Beryl Rimmer, whose 16 yea r old granddaughter lay in a coma, blind and dying, one of the ten diagnosed with the new variant of CJD[131]. A doctor from the government's CJD surveillance unit reportedly told her not to make her granddaughter's plight public; she should "think of the economy and the Common Market."[68]<p>

In the same show Weber asserted that no animal could ever enter a US packing plant displaying BSE symptoms[131]. Even if this is true, the majority of infected and infectious cattle become beef before clinical symptoms arise.[58] In fact, for every "mad " cow incinerated in the UK, there may be hundreds slaughtered and sold to butchers before any overt symptoms develop.[51] Narang estimates that a third of all English cattle going into the food chain are infected with BSE.[133] Because of this, it is estimated that every adult in the UK has eaten on average 50 meals containing tissue from infected cattle[126]. In the Journal of Public Health Medicine, Dealler, the microbiologist, wrote that in all probability most humans who have consumed British bee f since the start of the BSE epidemic will have been exposed to the infection.[58] In America it may be even harder to stop infected cattle from entering the food supply since it has been argued that dairy cattle are routinely culled earlier than in Britain.[135]<p>

Within a week the National Cattlemen's Beef Association prepared a position statement which stated that "Scientific evidence indicates that beef (meat) and milk do not present a risk as there is no evidence that the agent that causes BSE is present in me at and milk"[114] First of all, even the USDA has stated that "the safety of British beef cannot be demonstrated for 20 or more years."[21] As retired professor of clinical neurology WB Matthews put it, "Claims that British beef is entirely safe to eat.. .are scarcely scientific when the question has not been tested and is, perhaps, untestable."[28] The NCBA is probably attempting to refer to a study based solely on mice in which no detectable infectivity was found in muscle, but beef is not just muscle; 
it's laced with peripheral nerves and lymphoid tissue[39] which have both been shown to be infectious.[39] <p>

And it is possible that muscles do in fact harbor sufficiently deadly numbers of prions; spongiform encephalopathies of goats, minks, and hamsters can be transmitted through muscle alone.[55] No tissue, though, concentrates the pathogens more than brain or spinal cord.[46] In the slaughterhouse, beef is recovered by mechanically sawing down the corpse, which may imbed brains (which at this stage h ave the consistency of pudding)[59] throughout the meat.[55] In addition, the prions are thought by some to continuously accumulate in one's system, so that even small doses could build up with time.[14] Milk, however, is safe according to the World Heal th Organization[62]. So although BSE is more prevalent in dairy cows, the potential danger is probably in their quick retirement into hamburger, not their milk[48]. <p>

There is a cluster of CJD in eastern Pennsylvania, however, which was linked to cheese consumption and there is a case description published in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrating that milk from a Creutzfeldt-Jacob diseased woman was indeed infectious[25]. <p>

Just because someone consumes an infectious dose of BSE, though, does not mean that they will necessarily get the disease. There is still no direct proof that BSE can even cause CJD in humans.[112] The recent deaths in Britain may turn out to be unrela ted to beef consumption. One experiment which is currently underway is to do further studies of the autopsied brains called strain typing which could provide strong empirical evidence of a BSE-CJD link[86] Results will not be forthcoming for at least 18 
months, though, and may not even then provide definitive answers[112]. The preliminary results from another study involving mice genetically engineered to express human proteins seem to minimize the risk to humans, but are not yet conclusive[102]. Simi larly it will be a year and a half before firm conclusions can be drawn[112]. <p>

BSE has been able to infect and (therefore) kill cats, antelopes, and even ostriches from presumably eating infected protein, though.[1] Eighty cats have now since followed Max to the grave[101]. Experimentally, one can give BSE to monkeys[56], pigs, ch impanzees [8] and thirteen other species[58]. There really is no reason to believe that BSE will not similarly infect humans.[8] So far, in fact, BSE has proven more infectious than most other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.[39] The latest dat a has come from the comparing of the cow and human prion proteins. Two striking similarities were found between gorillas, chimpanzees, humans and cows which might have "predisposed" higher primates to cattle prion infections[97], a finding that "can onl y be interpreted as worrying."[102]. This could explain why people could develop CJD from eating meat[97]. So what are the odds that humans are susceptible? No one knows. When Dealler was recently asked by a member of the British Parliament what the c hances of any particular person contracting CJD from BSE-infected meat were he replied "Between zero and 100 percent." <p>

Incidentally, cows aren't the only possible source of prion disease. Paul Brown, medical director of the NIH neurological disorders institute with the US Public Health Service[17], believes that pigs and poultry could be harboring BSE and passing it on to humans, adding that pigs are especially sensitive to the disease.[103] "It's speculation", he says, "but I am perfectly serious."[103] On March 20, the British government banned farmers from feeding processed cattle blood, bones, fat, and offal to pigs and poultry.[31] A week and a half later they even halted the use on meat and bone meal as agricultural fertilizer[113] and we in the United States can't even get them to stop feeding cows to other cows. <p>

If indeed a form of BSE is in the United States and causing disease among American meat eaters, one would expect to see an increase in Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease incidence. CJD, however, is not a reportable illness in this country[131]. Because the Cen ters for Disease Control (CDC) does not actively monitor the disease [32] a rise similar to the one in Britain could be missed[32]. Other than the cheese-associated five-fold expected rate in the Lehigh Valley[139], a striking increase in CJD was reporte d in Florida[143], and there is anecdotal report of an cluster in Oregon[144]. An analysis of death certificates in a number of states, though, showed a stable and typical CJD incidence rate from 1979 to 1993[81]. Just recently the CDC initiated an ext ensive study of death certificates in four states[138]. Death-certificate diagnoses are well known to be not always accurate, though.[140] <p>

CJD is seriously underdiagnosed at present[70]. The most common misdiagnosis of CJD is Alzheimer's disease[70]. Both diseases show overlapping symptoms and pathology[70]. There can be spongy changes in Alzheimer's and amyloid plaques in CJD.[70] In f act the brains of the young people who died from the new CJD variant in Britain look like Alzheimer's brains[83]. Stanley Prusinger, the scientist who coined the term prion, believes Alzheimer's may even turn out to be a prion disease[115].The true prev alence of prion diseases in this or any other country remains a mystery[70]. An informal survey of neuropathologists registered a theoretical range of 2-12% of all dementias as actually CJD[70] whereas the official rate in this country is less than 1 cas e in a million per year. Compounding the situation, autopsies are rarely even performed on atypical dementias[70], because medical professionals are often unwilling out of fear of infection[68]. <p>

Four million Americans are affected by Alzheimer's[115]; it is the fourth leading cause of death among the elderly in the US.[142] Epidemiological evidence suggests that people eating meat more than four times a week for a prolonged period have a 3 time s higher chance of suffering a dementia than long-time vegetarians[79]. A preliminary 1989 study at the University of Pennsylvania showed that over 5% of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's were actually dying from a human spongiform encephalopathy.[21] That means that as many as 200,000 people in the United States[21] may already be dying from mad cow disease each year. <p>

In an examination of the risk of a major CJD epidemic in Britain, one of the government advisors wrote "I can't imagine it will just stop at ten cases..." It seems he was right. By the end of March the number was revised to an unconfirmed 12[27] Then came two women in their 30's dying in Germany[48]. A 26-year old man just died in France[109]; French authorities concluded it was "exactly identical" to the ten in Britain after consulting with health officials there[114]. The latest suspected victim i s a 24 year old woman in New York who may have contracted the disease years after receiving a Christmas gift of British beef cutlets[137]. And by the end of April another English girl was diagnosed with CJD[110]. At age 15 she is thought to be the world 's youngest victim of the disease[113]. <p>

After the diagnosis of BSE pattern CJD was confirmed, leading neurologist Peter Behan made the controversial announcement that she "picked it up through hamburgers."[113] Assuming a ten year incubation period, all 
of the young people dying of this disease in Britain over the last few months were presumably infected when there were but only a few hundred infected cows being turned into beef. In the year 1990 alone, it is estimated that 250,000 BSE-infected cows we re eaten, which of course begs the question how many people might be dying at the turn of the century[111]. <p>

In the United States we are left with an industry that continues to risk public safety and a government protecting that industry's interests over those of the consumer. A clue as to why the government has been so stubborn in enacting a ban on feeding co w and sheep remains to cows and sheep can be found in a 1991 internal USDA document entitled "BSE: Rendering policy" retrieved through the Freedom of Information Act.[21] It weighed the costs and benefits of a number of preventative measures including a t otal ban on feeding ruminants to ruminants.[21] The supporters of this option felt that this minimized the risk to public health.[21] <p>

APHIS, however, goes on to explain that the "disadvantage" of this approach is "that the cost to the livestock and rendering industries would be substantial"[115] The lost revenue to cattle producers of such a ban is estimated at a dollar per cow[89]. The document continues, asserting that such a policy "could pose major problems for the US livestock and rendering indust ries."[21] After all, the rendering, feed, and cattle industries do rack up annual sales of only $1.2 billion, $20 billion, and $60 billion, respectively.[8] The Archbishop of York recently blamed the BSE epidemic on greed and profit.[127]. Other than simply corporate profiteering, I think this crisis shows to what length governments will go to prevent financial harm to powerful lobbies in general, and in doing so risk immeasurable harm to those they claim to represent.<p>

Oprah Winfrey
P.O. Box 909715
Chicago, IL 60690

Dear Oprah:
                               
     DENVER, April 17, 1996 -- Cattlemen today condemned the
"scare-mongering" and damaging statements in an Oprah Winfrey TV
Show on food safety.  The criticism came in a letter responding
to the April 16 show which included a misleading discussion of
BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy), an animal disease in
British cattle, and the safety of American beef.<P>


     John Lacey, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association (NCBA), told Ms. Winfrey that the "irresponsible and
biased show has done great damage to the million American farm
and ranch families who raise cattle.  The show, in giving anti-
meat activists a platform for biased and unsubstantiated claims
against beef, also has done a tremendous disservice to millions
of American consumers.  The show was one of beef-bashing -- not a
responsible discussion of BSE and the safety of the American beef
supply.  You took a complex technical issue and turned it into an
hour of unjustified scare-mongering."<P>

     "Scientific authorities overseas as well as in the U. S.
agree that American beef is the safest in the world," Lacey said.
... Even if a BSE-human
disease link were found, beef would not present risks.  The BSE-
causing agent is not found in beef or milk.  Furthermore, ten
years of data from an agressive USDA surveillance program
confirms there is no BSE in U.S. cattle."<P>


     Lacey said the Winfrey Show producers apparently consider
anti-meat activist Howard Lyman a more qualified spokesman than
respected scientists like Dr. Koop.  "You became a cheerleader
for the anti-beef propaganda.<P>



     The National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a result of the
merger between the National Cattlemen's Association and the
National Live Stock and Meat Board, is a 
producer-directed organization representing all segments of the
beef industry.

Here is a transcript of what Lyman actually said on the Oprah show of April 16. 1996.  Transcripts can be ordered from 1-800-777-8398.<P>
Texas ordinances are subordinate to protection of free speech under the First Amendment to the US Constitution.  Daily cattle futures on CBOE are  volatile in the best of times, making it hard to attribute cause to temporary swings.<P>Plus, Lyman's remarks seem factually on target, even an understatement!

<B>Lyman</B>: "Absolutely."<P>

<B>Oprah</B>: "That's an extreme statement , you know."<P>

<B>Lyman</B>: "Absolutely.  And what we're looking at right now, is that we're following exactly the same path that they followed in England: 10 years of dealing with it as public relations rather than doing something substantial about it.  On hunderd thousand cows per year in the US are fine at night, dead in the moring.  The majority of those cows are rounded, ground up, turned into feed and fed back to other animals....We should have them eating grass, not other cows.  We've not only turned them into carnivores, we've turned them inot cannibals.... We've had a ban in the US of feeding sheep to cows for a long time, but when they went out and looked, 25 percent of the renderers admitted that they were paying no attention to it.  Voluntary bans do not work....<P>

<B>Oprah</B>: "Because I have to just tell you ... that this is alarming to me."<P>

<B>Dr. Weber</B>: "Yeah"<P>

<B>Oprah</B>: "Dr. Hueston, you think mad cow's a threat to US cattle?"<P>

<B>Dr. Hueston</B>: "...there's no evidence at all that we have BSE in the US."<P>

<B>Oprah</B>: " What else are they going to say" Are they goint to say, 'Public, you are at risk.  some of you may die and the cows are going to go crazy.'  They couldn't have said that."<P>

<B>Lyman</B>: "Why are we skating qround this when we know that [cease feeding cows to cows] would be the safest thing to do? Why is it?  Becasue we have the greedy that are getting the ear of government instead of the needy, and tha's exactly why we're doing it....<P>
Well, what it comes down to is about half the slaughter of animals is non-salable to humans.  They either have to pay to put it into the dump or they sell it for feed, <B>they grind it up, ... add to it all of the animals that died unexpectedly, all of the road kills and the euthanized animals</B> -- add it to them, grind it up and feed it back to other animals.... <P>
We ended up feeding downed cows to mink; the mink come down with the disease, transfer it to animals.  The animals came down with it.  And you're sitting here, telling everybody that it's safe. Not true."

<h4><center>WINFREY WILL <A NAME="STOP"></A> EATING HAMBURGER  DUE TO FEAR OF MAD-COW DISEASE</center></h4>

<blockquote>Buffalo News (BN) - Wednesday, April 17, 1996<p>

WASHINGTON  -  Talk-show  host  Oprah  Winfrey  took  on  the beef industry
Tuesday,  saying  she  would  stop  eating hamburgers because of fears over
mad-cow disease.
   Winfrey  said  on  her show that she was shocked after a guest said meat
and  bone  meal made from cattle was routinely fed to other cattle to boost
their meat and milk production.<p>

    The camera showed members of the studio audience gasping in surprise as
vegetarian  activist  Howard Lyman explained how cattle parts were rendered
and fed to other cattle.
   Scientists have said the practice likely helped spread Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy,  or  mad-cow disease, to thousands of cows in Britain until
it was outlawed in 1989.<p>
   The  European  Union imposed a ban on British beef last month after that
government  said  it  was  possible  people could develop the brain-wasting
Creutzfeldt-Jakob  Disease  after  eating  meat  from animals infected with
mad-cow disease.<hr>

<h3><center>CATTLE GROWERS HAVE A <A NAME="BEEF">BEEF</A> WITH OPRAH'S SHOW</center></h3>

Arizona Republic (AR) - Thursday, April 18, 1996<br>
By: George Gunset, Chicago Tribune<p>

CHICAGO  - The fat is in the fire between U.S. beef producers and talk-show
host Oprah Winfrey.

   In  Chicago,  Winfrey's  gabfest  is seen at 9 a.m., five minutes before
trading in live-cattle futures begins at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.<p>


   The two daily events had never been linked before.   On  Tuesday,  however,  the  show's subject was "Dangerous Foods," which
partly explored "mad-cow disease," or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and
its  suspected  link  with  a  fatal  human  disease,  a  concern  that has
devastated the cattle industry in Britain.<p>

   Reports  of  the show spread on the trading floor, along with fears that
the industry's side of the story had been given short shrift. Cattle prices
sank  in  the belief that consumers watching the popular nationwide program
would cut back on beef purchases.<p>

   The April futures contract sank the daily allowable limit of 1.5 cents a
pound,  to  close  at 58.925 cents. On Wednesday, it was down an additional
0.45 cent, closing at 58.45.

   "The  program  exacerbated  what was already a negative situation in the
market," said Charles Levitt, a livestock analyst with Alaron Trading Corp.
"Meatpackers  had lowered bids, and cash sales in the wholesale market werefar from brisk."<p>

   Levitt  noted that cattle prices are about $8 per hundred pounds below a
year ago because of slack consumer demand.

   "I  think demand is off more because of the late spring than food-safety
concerns from the mad-cow reports," Levitt said.<p>

   Contacted  in Washington, Alisa Harrison, a spokeswoman for the National
Cattlemen's  Association,  said  that  she  had been at the Winfrey program
taping  last Thursday at Harpo Studios in Chicago, and that Gary Weber, the
trade group's animal-health and food-safety expert, had been interviewed at
the same time as Howard Lyman, a vegetarian activist.<p>

   "We  knew  it  was  a  tough  situation,  that the deck might be stacked
against  us,  but we had a good story to tell on food safety, that there is
no BSE (mad-cow disease) in the U.S." Harrison said. "I think Gary held hisown during the taping."

   After viewing the program Tuesday afternoon, Harrison blasted it.<p>

   "We've  been hearing from our members all over the country who are angry
about  the  show,"  she  said. "I have never seen such biased editing. They
seem  not  to  want to tell our story, that we have been ahead of the issue
for 10 years."

   She said that perhaps three-fourths of Weber's comments were edited out.<p>

   Winfrey replied in a statement:<p>

<blockquote>   "I am speaking as one concerned consumer for millions of others.

   "Cows  eating  cows  is  alarming,"  she said of the practice of feeding
processed  cow  byproducts  to cattle. "Americans needed and wanted to know that. I certainly did.<p>

   "We think we were fair. I asked questions that I think that the American
people  deserve  to have answered in light of what is happening in Britain.
We gave them a chance to respond."</blockquote><hr>

<H3><CENTER>USDA Chief took bribes, indictment says</CENTER></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Deseret News Publishing Co. and AP<BR>

Published 14 June, &copy; 1996 <P>

WASHINGTON (AP) -- An indictment against a California agribusiness company says its former chief lobbyist gave a $2,400 luggage set, trips to Greece, $5000 in illegal campaign contributions, tennis tickets and limos worth $2300, meals, crystal and artwork to former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.
 Espy resigned as head of USDA at the end of 1994 because of the investigation.<P>
The USDA frequently reassured consumers about US beef safety during Espy's tenure and is the lead agency investigating the safety of the $40 billion dollar beef industry.
<P>

The federal indictment Thursday against Sun-Diamond Growers of California says Espy's girlfriend, who was not named, and his brother, Henry, also benefited from the company's largesse from early 1993 through March 1994.

<P>

The nine-count indictment says Mike Espy received $9,000 in gratuities, including $3,100 for his girlfriend to accompany him to a conference in Greece. The company also illegally contributed $5,000 to help retire Henry Espy's debts from a failed congressional race, the indictment says.


<P>


The indictment is the first in the investigation by Smaltz to allege that the former Clinton Cabinet member received gifts from anyone. The investigation was sparked by such allegations, but earlier indictments focused on alleged fraud by farmers and illegal corporate contributions to retire Henry Espy's campaign debts.

<P>


The indictment alleges five counts of illegal gratuities and wire fraud, each punishable by fines of up to $500,000, and four counts of illegal campaign contributions punishable by fines of up to $200,000 each. 

<P>
the company which grows figs, walnuts, hazelnuts, prunes, and raisins, had combined 1995 sales of $672 million.  It received money from USDA under an exports program.  It also sought to slow a ban on methyl bromide, a fungicide implicated in ozone thinnning and testicular cancer.<P>


Attorneys for the company and the former lobbyist, Richard Douglas, disputed the charges. Only the company was charged, but Douglas' attorney called the indictment an attempt by independent counsel Donald C. Smaltz to smear Douglas and Sun-Diamond.''Sun-Diamond Growers categorically denies all charges brought by the independent counsel,'' the company's attorney, Eric Bloom, said.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<H4><CENTER>USDA, FDA <A NAME="DISCUSS">DISCUSS</A> BRITISH BEEF CRISIS</CENTER></H4>

Wisconsin State ... March 23, 1996
By: JENNIFER SERENO, BUSINESS EDITOR
<P>

As  European  officials scrambled to reassure consumers about the safety of
beef,  U.S.  industry  leaders  met  in Maryland Friday to talk about ``mad
cow'' disease and its link to a fatal illness in humans.<P>

   Officials  from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and
Drug  Administration  called  the  meeting  with  meat  industry leaders to
discuss  an  announcement  by  the British government Wednesday that linked
bovine  spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. <STRONG>The
meeting was closed to the public</STRONG>.<P>

    Erica  Smith,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  National  Meat  Association in
Oakland,  Calif., said the meeting was called to address concerns about the
European  developments.  On  Wednesday, the British government acknowledged
that  10  people  who  died  of the incurable brain disease probably got it
after eating infected beef.
   ``There  were <B> no  real  decisions  made</B> or conclusions reached,'' Smith
said.<P>

   Smith  <B>would  not  comment</B>  on  whether  beef industry leaders suggested
altering  feeding practices that some say contributed to the cattle disease
in  Europe.  Researchers believe cattle contracted the disease after eating
feed  supplements  containing  tissue  from  sheep  infected with a similar
disease called scrapie.
   ``All  we're  saying right now is we're supporting what the USDA has put
out,''   said   Smith,   whose   group   represents   600  meatpackers  and
slaughterhouses in this country.

  <H4><CENTER>INDUSTRY: <A NAME="NO">NO</A> `MAD COW DISEASE' IN U.S.</CENTER></H4>

Wisconsin State ... March 26, 1996<P>

U.S. meat inspectors have tested more than 2,600 U.S. cattle since `mad cow
disease' began spreading in British herds in the late 1980s, a state cattle
industry leader said Monday.
   And  so  far, no trace of the disease has appeared in this country, said
R.F. Hauser, executive director of the Wisconsin Cattlemen's Association.
    ``We  have  been on the lookout for it in this country,'' he said. But,
``our food system is definitely clear of it.''
 Hauser  said the industry wants to avoid a problem similar to the historic
<B>epidemic of hoof and mouth disease -- a contagious viral infection that can be  passed  to  humans</B>.  Outbreaks  of  the disease forced the slaughter of
thousands of cattle in the 1940s, Hauser said.

   ``We  just don't want our animal population infected'' with anything, he
said.<P>

   Jacque  Knight, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said more than <B>90 percent of cattle rejected
for  slaughter</B>  will  now  be  tested  for  a variety of illnesses. Federal
inspectors already check all cattle brought to slaughterhouses for signs of
neurological disorders including <B>rabies, milk fever and mad cow disease.</B>
   Animals exhibiting any symptoms cannot be used for human food.

<H4><CENTER>GOVERNMENT  ATTEMPTED <A NAME="COVER-UP">COVER-UP</A> OF "MAD COW'</CENTER></H4>

Fresno Bee ... March 24, 1996<BR>
By: London Observer Service<P>


LONDON  - Senior Cabinet ministers <B>tried to suppress the public alert</B> about
the  possible  spread  of  ''mad cow'' disease to humans and downplayed the
alarming  new  evidence  from  their  chief scientific advisers, the London
Observer has learned.<P>

   New  measures  to  protect  the  public from infected meat have not been
implemented,  despite  repeated  ministerial  assurances this past week. At
emergency  meetings  early  in  the  week,  Deputy  Prime  Minister Michael
Heseltine  and  Conservative  Party  Chairman Brian Mawhinney, according to
sources,  led  a  group  of ministers <B>arguing strongly against going public</B>
about  the suspected link between BSE-infected meat and a new strain of the
human brain affliction Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease.<P>

   Professor  John  Pattison,  head  of  the  BSE  advisory  committee, was
summoned  to a meeting chaired by John Major before Wednesday's Cabinet and
subjected  to  two  hours  of  grueling  questions  by skeptical ministers.
According  to  well-placed  Whitehall sources, they argued that because the
number  of  CJD  victims  was  not rising, the scientists might have got it
wrong.  They  were finally overruled by Health Minister Stephen Dorrell and
Agriculture  Minister  Douglas Hogg who argued that the public health risks
called for an immediate statement.<P>

   ''There  was a degree of reluctance with going public,'' said one senior
source.  ''We had some quite awkward meetings with ministers trying to tell
Pattison  he  had  got it wrong. <B>They wanted to test whether the government
really had to act on the scientists' advice.</B>''<P>

   The  revelations  of  an  11th-hour attempt at a cover-up will undermine
further  the  government's battered reputation over its handling of the BSE
epidemic.  The  crisis will escalate this week with the European Commission
set to recommend a Europe-wide ban on ''unsafe'' beef products and pressure
mounting  for  the slaughter of at least a quarter of the 11 million-strong
national  herd.<HR>






<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Glickman">Glickman</A> says U.S. could help repopulate British cattle herds</CENTER></H3>

Nando.net and  Associated Press
3-25-96<P>



   WASHINGTON (Bloomberg) -- Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the U.S. could help rebuild the United Kingdom's cattle herd if some or all of the animals are eventually destroyed to contain "mad cow" disease.<p>



   "I think it would be possible for us to help," Glickman said in a brief interview. "It would be done mostly by U.S. cattlemen, their organization."<p>



   Glickman's comments, though, came before U.K. officials said they saw no reason to order the slaughter of any of Britain's 11 million cattle stock. The announcement, made after government officials met with scientific advisers, confounded expectations that some of the nation's herd would be destroyed. Separately, the European Union's Agricultural Commissioner, Franz Fischler, is scheduled to report at 5:30 p.m. today in Brussels on whether the EU plans to recommend tighter controls on British beef, including the possibility of an EU-wide ban. A group of EU veterinary scientists recommended tighter curbs on Friday, without spelling out details. In France today, a herd of cattle was slaughtered after one steer was found to have the disease, Associated Press reported.<p>



   The U.K. government said last week that 10 people who died of an incurable brain disorder called Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease probably got it after eating beef infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.<p>



   Glickman said the idea of U.S. help to repopulate British cattle herds "hasn't been discussed" at the USDA.<p>



   He said if herds were destroyed, "they'd need everybody's help, including ours. We want to make sure they get over their problems."<p>



   The U.S. is free of BSE, or mad cow disease, and hasn't imported processed beef or cattle from the U.K. since 1989.<p>



   Of 499 cattle imported from Britain between 1981 and 1989, the USDA said 109 animals are still alive and are monitored regularly. No traces of BSE have been found.<p>



   Many U.S. analysts said that if the U.K. had decided to destroy some or all of the country's herd, beef imports from New Zealand, Australia and Argentina could soar.<p>



   The European Union has blocked U.S. beef imports since 1989 because they are treated with hormones. The ban has cost the U.S. cattle industry about $100 million a year or more in lost exports, the USDA said.<p>



   The U.S. has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization to overturn the ban as an unfair trade barrier. A EU scientific panel last December concluded U.S. beef treated with hormones poses no threat to human health.<p>



   Even before today's announcement in London, analysts voiced skepticism that British officials would order a total slaughter. "I doubt very strenuously that the U.K. would liquidate their entire herd" because of the enormous expense, said Chuck Levitt, livestock analyst at Alaron Trading Corp., in Chicago.<p>



   Though if herds were fully destroyed, "they might ask us" to help repopulate foundation herds, Levitt said.<p>



   The U.S. has a record 103 million head of cattle on hand, up 1 percent from last year. Of that number, about 20 million are animals of 500 pounds or more meant for beef or milk cow replacement.<p>



   Levitt said he thought it was more likely that the British government would begin an education campaign to promote U.S. beef as safe to eat, he said.<p>



   U.K. analysts said the cost of slaughtering all or part of the U.K.'s 11 million cattle herd to contain "mad cow" disease would widen the government's budget deficit.<p>



   In addition, it could increase retail price inflation, boost the cost of other meat products and imported beef and milk, hurt economic growth and trade and curb plans to cut taxes.<p>



   "It would have quite a detrimental effect on trade, growth and the deficit" if the entire stock of 11 million cattle is put down," said David Mackie, a U.K. economist at JP Morgan in London.<p>



   If the government had opted for slaughtering all cattle over the age of three years, amounting to some 4.5 million cows, the cost to the government of compensating farmers could have run to between 6 billion and 10 billion pounds (US $9.1 billion and $15.2 billion), estimates James McKay, a U.K. economist at PaineWebber.<p>



   However, in the case of the slaughtering of all 11 million heads of cattle, "you have exposure of up to 20 billion pounds," or about $30.4 billion, said McKay.<p>



   Economists also pointed out that a U.K. decision to slaughter its cattle could have other fallout: Increased unemployment benefit costs to workers who'd lose their jobs in the 500,000-worker dairy and beef industries could push up government spending and the deficit.<p>



   The European Union could decide to compensate the U.K. if an all-out ban on British beef is announced.<p>



   "If the European Union helps out on compensation, the impact ... would be lessened," said James Barty, the chief U.K. economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.<p>



   A possible European Union ban on British beef imports is seen costing some 4 billion pounds in export income, or $6 billion, said McKay at PaineWebber.<HR>

Press Release<BR>
USDA: Will Hueston<BR>
FDA:  Larry Bachorik<BR>
CDC:   Bob Howard<P>


<P>WASHINGTON, March 29, 1996--The United States Department of Agriculture and

the United States Public Health Service today expressed support for the

voluntary measures announced by the livestock industry in the ongoing effort to

ensure the United States remains free of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or

BSE.</P>

<P>USDA has been monitoring for BSE for 10 years and has never identified a

single case.  In addition, no beef from England has been imported into the

United States since at least 1985.  The measures announced today will provide an

additional level of assurance that the United States remains free of BSE.</P>

<P>Both agencies stressed that the additional measures announced today were

designed to provide the American public with the continued assurance that the

U.S. food supply remains among the safest in the world.</P>

<P>The industry announcement includes a voluntary program to ensure that

ruminant products are not used in ruminant feed.  Ruminant animals include

cattle, sheep, and goats.</P>

<P>In addition, USDA and United States Public Health Service are undertaking a

number of initiatives, including:</P>

<UL>

<LI>The Food and Drug Administration's Center for Veterinary Medicine will

expedite regulations prohibiting ruminant protein in ruminant feeds;

</LI>

<LI>USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service will expand surveillance

efforts in conjunction with the Food Safety Inspection Service, producers and

private veterinary practitioners.  This increase is supported by the Centers for

Disease Control;

</LI>

<LI>FSIS will increase the training of veterinarian inspectors in charge to

help them further identify BSE signs in livestock;

</LI>

<LI>USDA's Cooperative State Research Education Service and Extension Service

will work with APHIS and the livestock industry to enhance education about BSE

to producers, animal nutritionists, and veterinarians.

</LI>

</UL>

<P>In addition, the CDC emphasized that since they began monitoring

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease mortality data, the number of cases in the United

States has remained stable at about one case per million per year since 1979.

The age distribution of these cases has not changed significantly in contrast to

those recently described in Great Britain.

<BLOCKQUOTE>BRITAIN cannot be trusted to carry out its cattle cull without independent checks by European
officials, Karel Pinxten, Belgium's agriculture minister, said yesterday. <P>

In an interview with the French newspaper Le Soir, Pinxten said: "I don't want to depend on
checks made by British veterinarians. You cannot forget that this disease has been around for
10 years. For all this time there have been checks. What makes me think that one day things
will change? Nothing." <P>

Pinxten's remarks came as it emerged that many European countries have failed to identify
hundreds of cases of their "mad cow" disease over the past five years, fuelling concern of a
widespread cover-up in reporting BSE abroad.
<HR>
 
<CENTER><H3>The case of the 1668 Missing <A NAME="Cases">Cases</A> of BSE</H3></CENTER>

An international team of scientists has estimated that <B>there should have been 1,668 cases of
BSE reported in European Union countries after the export of 57,900 British breeding
cattle [[or 2.8%]] between 1985 and 1990. In fact, the total was just 29. </B><P>
The scientists are preparing a report to be  published later this year which will identify France and Portugal as being at the highest risk from indigenous BSE. <P>

Their report says the figures show that "not many countries can maintain claims that they
have never had BSE or, at least, that they had never imported it . . . these results clearly
indicate that BSE cannot be considered a British problem alone". <P>

Bram Schreuder, one of the authors of the report and Holland's leading expert on BSE,
said the chances of some countries having indigenous BSE was very realistic. "There is a
risk that if a local rendering plant is not fully effective, countries that were continuing to feed
meat and bonemeal to cattle were creating their own indigenous BSE," he said. <P>

Although Britain banned the manufacture of meat and bonemeal made from cattle remains in
1988, many other countries in Europe continued the practice until recently. <P>

Officially there have been 413 cases of BSE in the world outside Britain, of which 384
were in cattle born outside the United Kingdom. Switzerland has reported 218 cases, Portugal
39 (six of which were imported from Britain) and France 20. Although France and other
countries with BSE have blamed imported British meat and bonemeal for their infected
cattle, it appears possible that feed made in those countries had become infected with recycled
cattle remains.<P> </BLOCKQUOTE>

Excerpts from an <A HREF="http://envirolink.org/arrs/AnimaLife/spring94/madcow.html">article by Michael Greger</A><P>


 With 100,000,000 cattle and
the highest per capita beef consumption in the world. Traditional bovine spongiform encephalopathy hit North
America in 1993. An infected dairy cow, one of many imported from the UK before both Canada and the US banned the
importation of British cattle, was found on a ranch in Alberta, Canada. Of the 471 British cattle imported into the US
before the 1989 ban, 188 of them have been melted down into lard and protein (presumably for other livestock) and at
least 66 are untraceable. <P>

One of the imported bulls slaughtered had a "central nervous system abnormality" of which
the USDA reported, "There is no definitive evidence that [the bull] either had or did not have BSE."Although the
importation of British beef has been banned from the US for a decade due to an unrelated disease, over 13 tons of meat
and bone meal, (which, if you remember, was implicated in the birth of the British epidemic) has come into the US from
England between 1982 and 1992.<P>
 
Conditions conducive to a BSE outbreak include the presence of scrapie in 39 states.The 40-year
USDA Scrapie Eradication Program has been deemed a "dismal failure" and even implicated in the recent rise of
scrapie-infected sheep. Admitting defeat, the USDA scrapped the Scrapie Eradication Program 2 years ago and
replaced it with an "entirely voluntary" control program.<P>


<B>Since 1947 there have been 25 outbreaks</B> of Mink Spongiform Encephalopathy (also called TME) on US fur farms.
This perplexed researchers who were unable to orally infect mink with scrapie-infected sheep brains. A clue came in
1985 when TME wiped out a population of minks in Wisconsin who hadn't eaten any sheep.[35] Their diet consisted almost
exclusively of dairy cattle called "downers," an industry term describing cows who fall down and are too sick to get
up. <P>

The possibility, then, that US dairy herds were harboring some form of BSE intrigued University of Wisconsin
veterinary scientist Richard Marsh. To test this, Marsh inoculated US cattle with the infected mink brains.[49] As
predicted, they died. And when he fed the brains of these cows to healthy mink they too died of a spongiform
encephalopathy providing what he thought was the missing link. Marsh hypothesized that the proposed BSE
strain indigenous to the US manifests itself as more of a downed cow disease than a mad cow disease. <P>

With about
300,000 cows going down for unexplainable reasons every year in the US, this has frightening implications on a
grand scale. The critical experiment came when Marsh inoculated scrapie infected sheep brain into US cattle. If you
do this in England the cows go mad, twitching and kicking into a rabid frenzy. But in America, cows instead
stagger to their deaths like downer cows do, supporting the notion that a form of BSE is already here in the United
States. <P>


<B>By 1990 the USDA had 60 labs monitoring</B> our country's cattle herds for BSE. In 1991 APHIS, the governmental
agency which ensures the health of the nation's livestock, concluded that the "possibility of BSE appearing in US cattle is
extremely low."The assumption made by APHIS, however, was that "scrapie infected sheep were the
only source of the BSE agent." This is certainly questionable in light of the evidence for an indigenous BSE agent.
Likewise, the USDA surveillance program (described as slow, clumsy, and ineffective) began looking for the
rabies-like symptoms of the traditional British strain of BSE[52], in effect ignoring Marsh's findings.] <P>

In June
1992 a USDA consultant group continued to disregard the available evidence, deciding that changes in the research
program to accommodate the possibility that BSE was already present in the US were "not appropriate at this time."
No surprise really, when one realizes that this panel included representatives of the National Milk Producers Federation,
the National Renderers Association, The American Sheep Industry Association and the National Cattleman's
Association.] According to newspaper reports last year the USDA has finally backed down and started testing downer
cows, but some doubt their resolve.<P>


<B>The USDA knows all
too well</B> that a positive diagnosis in a single cow could put the entire dairy and beef export business in jeopardy In
Wisconsin alone this would mean a loss of a half a billion dollars a year.
With scientists like Marsh saying "The exact same thing could happen over here as happened in Britain,"and with
beef consumption already at a thirty-year low, the USDA is justifiably worried. There was even a complaint filed
recently with the FDA from a woman with CJD who had been taking a dietary supplement containing bovine tissue. <P>

Like
England, we have been feeding dead cows to living cows for decades. In fact, here in the US a minimum of 14% of the
remains of rendered cattle is fed to other cows (another 50% goes on the pig and chicken menu). Partly because of
this, the USDA has conceded that "the potential risk of amplification of the BSE agent is much greater in the United States"
than in Britain. To make things worse, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of animal protein in commercial
dairy feed since 1987. The recent introduction of Bovine Growth Hormone will only increase the need for
rendered animal proteins in the rations of dairy cattle, of whom we eat 2.6 billion pounds annually.<P>


<B>The Foundation on Economic Trends</B> a national consumer advocacy organization, petitioned the FDA in June 1993 to ban all
feeding of ruminants (cows, sheep...) to other ruminants, because they felt that transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies "pose a serious potential health risk to both the nation's cattle herds and meat-eating consumers."
Although the European Commonwealth took this advice four years ago, the U.S. Government still refuses.<P>


<B>According to top encephalopathy expert </B>Joseph Gibbs, one out of every million cattle naturally develops BSE. And
because evidence exists that prions are able to adapt to their hosts and become more virulent with time, it is, in my
view, absolutely necessary to enact the ban and stop recycling this disease through US cattle. To make things worse, a
preliminary 1989 study at the University of Pennsylvania showed that over 5% of patients diagnosed with Alzheimers are
actually dying from a human spongiform encephalopathy. That means that maybe 200,000 people in the US are
already dying from BSE each year. <P>


<B>Why doesn't the government enact the ban? </B>An answer can be found in a 1991 internal
USDA document entitled "BSE: Rendering policy" which was recently retrieved through the Freedom of Information
Act.] It weighed the costs and benefits of a number of preventative measures including a total ruminant to ruminant
ban.The supporters of this option felt that this minimized the risk to public health.<P>

 APHIS, however, goes on to
explain that the "disadvantage" of this approach is "that the cost to the livestock and rendering industries would be
substantial" and that such a policy "could pose major problems for the US livestock and rendering industries."After
all, the rendering, feed, and cattle industries do rack up annual sales of only $1.2 billion, $20 billion, and $60 billion,
respectively. And since when does public health ever take precedence over corporate interests anyway? I just hope
that, in the end, the profits are worth it.<HR>


<CENTER><H3>Stealth Attack on U.S. Food Safety</H3></CENTER>
April 3, 1996 ... Editorial.. NY Times<P>


An 11th-hour amendment, sneaked into the 
farm bill last week, threatens to complicate and 
clog the nation's meat and poultry safety system. 
The White House opposes the amendment but is 
unlikely to veto the bill, which has many admirable 
provisions. Given the controversies over possibly 
contaminated beef in England and the rejection of 
U.S. chickens in Russia because of high salmonella 
levels, though, this is no time to trifle with food 
safety. Congress should correct its own mistake. <P>

Pushed at the last minute by Representative 
Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, and inserted in 
conference committee, the amendment would establish a Safe Meat and Poultry Inspection panel -- 
a part-time, voluntary group of seven experts 
drawn mainly from the food, meat and poultry 
science fields. Those experts generally have more 
training in animal health than in human health. 
Protecting human health is the main purpose of 
meat and poultry inspections. 

<p>  The panel would evaluate any rule or procedure 
related to meat inspection suggested by the Agriculture Department's under secretary for food safety. 
The panel would not have veto power, but the extra 
layer of review would surely slow down an inspection process that already suffers from inadequate 
resources. It is also likely to complicate plans to 
modernize inspections, including sophisticated testing for microbes and other new controls. Modernization was recommended by the National Academy of 
Sciences a decade ago and has the support of 
industry and consumer groups. 

<p>   Some after-the-fact counterattacks are under 
way. Two Democratic Representatives, Nita Lowey 
of New York and  Richard Durbin of Illinois, will 
push the House Appropriations Committee not to 
finance the new safety panel. The Administration, 
expressing "serious concerns" about the panel, will 
try to have it repealed, possibly through the process 
of making technical corrections on the bill. Another 
way to fix the damage would be a new law to make a 
majority of panel members experts in public health 
and narrow the scope of their authority.

<p>  These measures are late, but they are being 
discussed openly, which is more than can be said 
about Congress's effort to fiddle with food safety.<HR>


<CENTER><H2>How <A NAME="Safe">Safe</A> Is Our Food?</H2>
<H3> Lessons from an Outbreak of Salmonellosis</H3></CENTER>
May 16, 1996 New England Journal of Medicine editorial by Martin J. Blaser, M.D.

<P>
The microbiologic hazards of food present an issue of increasing concern.  In the not-so-distant past, most food was produced and consumed locally. In the 20th century, however, the production and distribution of food in the developed countries of the world have become increasingly industrialized. Small farms are being replaced by feedlots, local dairies supplanted by industrial plants, farmers' markets displaced by supermarkets, and local restaurants edged out by huge national chains. The relations among agricultural workers, food processors, and distributors have become increasingly complex and distant<P>
The food chain and steps in food production are being varied in ways that stretch the imagination. From an economic standpoint, modern agribusiness offers many benefits, including the wide choices and apparently low costs of food available to the consumer. The development of national standards has improved food safety, yet certain microbial pathogens persist, the scale of foodborne transmission is increasing, and new hazards are being recognized. Many of these phenomena are exemplified in this issue of the Journal, in the clear and comprehensive report by Hennessy and colleagues of a massive outbreak of salmonellosis.
<P>
Salmonellosis -- with the notable exception of typhoid fever -- is a disease of civilization. The animals we use for food production frequently carry salmonella, thus contaminating meat, dairy products, and eggs. Salmonellosis is rare in developing countries, where sanitation is poor and diarrheal diseases are endemic, but where food production and consumption are local.  In contrast, in the United States the reported incidence of salmonellosis has been increasing over the past 50 years, and approximately 1 percent of the population becomes infected each year. Outbreaks are becoming larger and, as shown by Hennessy and coworkers, may affect hundreds of thousands of people.
<P>
Most cases of salmonellosis (and foodborne illness) are considered to be endemic (or sporadic) because they are not clustered. The usual explanation for endemic cases is the inappropriate handling in kitchens and restaurants of contaminated food (including improper storage, undercooking, or cross-contamination). This is a plausible hypothesis because so many of the farm animals in the United States are colonized with salmonella and products derived from these animals subsequently become contaminated. <P>
Alternatively, sporadic cases of disease may occur when a widely distributed food has low levels of contamination, a situation that leads to a low attack rate diffusely distributed over a large geographic area, so that no one realizes that an epidemic is occurring. The investigation by Hennessy and colleagues illustrates this second pattern. Despite substantial publicity, fewer than 600 of the more than 200,000 estimated cases of salmonellosis in this outbreak (only 0.3 percent) were actually reported to public health departments. The epidemic both highlights the deficiencies in our nationwide system of passive surveillance for salmonellosis  and illustrates the value of field epidemiology that uses current surveillance data to detect outbreaks and prevent further transmission and disease. The cooperation of state and federal agencies and the speed with which they worked to solve the puzzle and protect the public safety make this a model for future investigations.
<P>
However, this epidemic probably reflects only the tip of the iceberg. The low surveillance rate suggests that smaller outbreaks are regularly missed. That the incidence of salmonellosis among persons with AIDS is many times that among the general public  is also consistent with the view that widely distributed foods are contaminated by low doses of a pathogenic agent, leading to low attack rates in normal hosts but higher rates in compromised hosts. Such sentinel populations teach us much about the distribution of particular agents. This model also may be applicable to other foodborne illnesses, in which detection of the agent and surveillance are even less efficient than for salmonella. The high incidence of Campylobacter jejuni infections in persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus points to the widespread transmission of low levels of this foodborne agent as well.
<P>
Modern food production is often so complex that many points at which contamination could occur are simply not recognized. Thus, in the outbreak of salmonellosis the use of tanker trailers to ship both pasteurized and nonpasteurized products represents a classic cross-connection that was not identified until the investigation was undertaken. The bulk transport of nonpasteurized liquid eggs provides an efficient means of amplifying the impact of even a single salmonella-contaminated egg  so that it affects large numbers of consumers. This outbreak underscores the fact that to minimize risk from unrecognized hazards, pasteurization -- one of the most powerful tools against bacterial pathogens in the public health armamentarium -- should be undertaken at the latest possible step in food production.
<P>
Manifestations of foodborne disease are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, as illustrated by the etiologic role of <A NAME="Escherichia"><B>Escherichia</A> coli O157:H7</B> in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, <B>C. jejuni</B> in Guillain-Barre syndrome, and <B>Listeria monocytogenes</B> in fetal morbidity,  nor are the ramifications always obvious. The most pernicious threat may be the spread of antibiotic resistance by foodborne organisms,  because of the promiscuous use of subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics as food supplements for farm animals, or the <B><A NAME="potential">potential</A> foodborne spread of the scrapie agent</B>. New opportunities for foodborne diseases result from the increasing internationalization of our food supply, with the importation of foodstuffs from all parts of the globe, the introduction of new and sometimes uncooked items into our diets, and the preparation of food in restaurants and households by people who may be carrying unusual pathogens. 
<P>
Food is not sterile, and eating cannot be made risk-free. Because of the standardization and quality-control measures that are part of industrialized food production, the safety of our food from many microbial hazards has probably never been greater. Yet because of the potential for amplification of a pathogen that is implicit in large-scale food production, the opportunities for the foodborne transmission of disease seem to be increasing. <P>
The grim implications of <B><A NAME="bovine">bovine</A> spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease) for cattle and possibly humans </B>point to the unanticipated problems that can arise from a breach in basic ecologic relations (cows, which are herbivores, were fed animal offal). Since new hazards are emerging from both familiar pathogens such as salmonella and previously unrecognized microbial threats, improved surveillance for foodborne infections is essential. Careful medical detective work similar to that reported by Hennessy et al.  should highlight the basic ecologic imbalances underlying endemic and epidemic foodborne hazards and lead to their correction.

<CENTER><H3> FDA overhaul <A NAME="legislation">legislation</A> criticized<HR></H3></CENTER>

<P>   WASHINGTON (Jun 3, 1996) -- Legislation moving through Congress would <STRONG>eviscerate the FDA's power to protect Americans</STRONG> from harmful food, drugs and medical devices, critics in several activist groups said today.<P>

 The legislation would "take the FDA back down to a level where it was 25 years ago," said Sidney M. Wolfe, a physician who is director of the Public Citizen health research group.<P>

   The legislation amounts to "a Christmas wish list for food and chemical companies" that would "substitute Betty Crocker for Uncle Sam" in regulating food safety, said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.<P>
 The critics charged that if the legislation becomes law, companies could add small amounts of cancer-causing additives to processed food, something that present law forbids. That would mean "dirtier food, more dangerous additives, and confusing labels" confronting customers in supermarkets, said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety with the Center for Science in the Public Interest.<P>

   The House Commerce Committee prepared to approve the legislation later this month. To speed up the review of news products, the legislation would overhaul FDA regulations to allow the use of third-party reviews of new drugs and foods, relax limits on the use of certain additives and reduce the requirements necessary to prove a new drug is safe and effective.<P>

   A less sweeping FDA overhaul was approved by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, but has yet to reach the Senate floor. With time running out, and with the Clinton administration opposed to many provisions, supporters face an uphill battle in getting the plan enacted this year.<P>

 
 Statements by critics amount to "a very large collection of alarmist rhetoric," said Patrick S. Korten, deputy vice president for communications with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.<P>

  

   The legislation  provides that drug companies could have their applications to market new drugs or medical devices avoid review by formal FDA advisory panels, critics said. Pharmaceutical companies instead could opt to hire private companies to review their applications. It would be in the financial interests of a private review company to give favorable reviews to those drugs and devices, and recommend that the FDA approve them, Wolfe said. That way, drug companies would be more likely to use the private review company in seeking approval of other products in future.<P>

   That new procedure would amount to "a complete privatization of the drug review process," Wolfe said.
The situation is "fraught with conflicts of interest." 

   The bill would shift the burden of proof from companies having to show their new drugs are safe, to having the FDA prove that a drug recommended by a private drug-review company was unsafe, Smith DeWaal said.<P>

   Another provision in the legislation would permit drug companies to sell a drug approved for treating one patient disorder for a different disorder without having to go through a full review process, Wolfe said. The legislation would authorize the new use of the drug if physicians tell each other it is safe and effective for that purpose, constituting drug approval "on the hearsay of doctors," Wolfe said.<P>

<H3><CENTER>USDA to offer <A NAME="Bounty">Bounty</A> on Mad Cows?</CENTER></H3>


An idea developed by   Dr. John Duncan of
APHIS/VS in South Dakota, section Veterinary
Medical Officer (VMO):  a <B>'bounty'</B>
for bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United States.  Duncan's idea has
 been submitted through established channels for official USDA
consideration.<P>

Basically, the idea is to offer a monetary incentive (award) for the submission of
bovine brain tissue that is subsequently diagnosed as positive for BSE (or other
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy) and which can be successfully traced
to its herd of origin in the United States.  The money would be paid to the
original submitter of the tissue, whether a veterinary practitioner, slaughter
plant inspector, VMO, or veterinary researcher.  Although the amount of this
'bounty' is open to discussion, it would probably be most useful if it were on a
sliding scale such that the first BSE case (if there ever is one) would receive a
much larger amount than would any subsequent cases. <P>


Such an award should be widely publicized.  USDA and cattle industry emphasis
of this award would demonstrate an earnest intent to find BSE if it exists and
would create greater consumer and trade partner confidence in regulatory and
industry efforts related to BSE.  Cattle industry organizations would be
encouraged to participate in the sponsorship and promotion of the award.<P>


The award would have several advantages including: <BR>
<UL>
<LI>1.  Encourage the submission of cattle brains to diagnostic laboratories.  Even if
no positives are ever found, our confidence in the statistical likelihood that BSE
does not exist in the United States can be increased if a large number of brains
are sampled.
<LI>2.  Indicate the seriousness of the USDA and the cattle industry to find BSE if it
exists in the United States.  It would be difficult to suggest that there is no
interest in finding BSE if a significant monetary award is out on the table for the
first case found.
<LI>3.  If no positive brains are ever submitted, no award money will need to be
paid.
<LI>4.  If a positive is found, it will likely be found sooner (at least a little, and
maybe a lot) than if no award had been offered.  Finding a case early will put
everyone concerned in a better position to respond to the problem. 
</UL><P>


Potential problems with an award:<UL>
<LI>1.  False positive results.  These would seem unlikely, based on the diagnostic
methodologies currently being used.  Maybe a laboratory diagnostician with
more knowledge in this area would like to comment on whether this is likely to
be a problem.

<LI>2.  Fraud.  With a large award, someone may be tempted to try smuggling a
positive brain in from the U.K. or something similar.  Of course, no award would
be paid unless a thorough investigation of the case found no evidence of fraud. 
I believe it would be a federal offense to defraud the USDA.

<H3>Litters of new pups swell population of <A NAME="Yellowstone">Yellowstone</A> wolves<HR></H3></CENTER>


<P>   BILLINGS, Mont. (May 11, 1996 10:00 p.m. EDT) -- Around Yellowstone National Park, five wolf dens are alive with new litters, leading biologists to predict that the wolf packs introduced into the park from Canada during the last year and a half will thrive on their own, without more imports.<P>


   "Wolf reintroduction is done, unless something unusual happens," said Ed Bangs, a biologist with the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service who helped to coordinate the airlifts of gray wolves from Canada over the last two winters.<P>

   When Yellowstone opens fully on May 15, wildlife watchers will find that the population of wolves has tripled from that of last year. In addition to 17 adult wolves that were added in January, biologists have counted eight new pups in two litters and are confident that three more females gave birth in late April.<P>

   "There are 15 to 30 new pups on the ground, making a total of 50 to 65 wolves," Mike Phillips, head of the National Park Service's wolf restoration project, said by telephone from his office in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyo.<P>

   The wolves now in Yellowstone are the first to roam the park since the 1920s, when the last of that era's population were killed off by a government eradication program favoring livestock. Three-quarters of a century later, the species has been brought back to Yellowstone, and to locations in Idaho and western Montana, by the federal restoration project, which sprang largely from an overpopulation of elk.<P>

   In their new habitat, the wolf packs of Yellowstone have proved to be voracious eaters, killing an elk about every five days as well as an occasional mountain sheep, mule deer or moose.<P>

   The <A NAME="consolidation">consolidation</A> of the park's new wolf packs has defied not only court challenge and hostile politicians but also misadventure. Of late, gunfire or nature has killed at least one adult wolf a month. In February, one was killed by a mountain lion in western Montana, and another, which had wandered 80 miles south of the park, was shot by a passer-by. In March, a rancher shot a wolf that was roaming through a calving pasture 50 miles west of the park. And on April 14, an adult female fell into a Yellowstone thermal pool and was scalded to death. A necropsy showed that she had been just two weeks short of delivering six pups.<P>

   For all that, Bangs said, the program is doing well. "Over all," he said, "we expected a 30 percent mortality rate. Instead, we have a 15 percent mortality rate."<P>

   It is the wolves' propensity to foray beyond their Yellowstone base that makes the park's neighbors nervous. Two packs have established dens in Montana at sites about 35 miles northeast of the park. In April, one wolf roamed even farther north, to the town of Reedpoint, only 50 miles west of here. Already a federal judge in Wyoming is considering four lawsuits, backed largely by ranching groups, to reverse the wolf restoration program.<P>

   And, in an election year, some Western politicians are now accusing one another of being "soft on wolves."<P>

   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., recently traveled to the heart of his state's cattle country and denounced the multimillion-dollar program for "Cadillac expenditures." In retort, his Republican challenger, Dennis Rehberg, cited a "dramatic election-year conversion." Noting the senator's earlier support for wolf reintroduction, Rehberg accused him of having joined forces with Washington politicians "that don't give a hoot about Montana ranchers and farmers."<P>

<h3><center>Meat <a NAME="Inspections">Inspections</A> Face Overhaul, First in Nearly a Century</center></h3>

>By TODD S. PURDUM<br>
July 7, 1996 NY Times
<p>   
WASHINGTON  --  President Clinton on Saturday announced the most
sweeping changes in the government's meat inspection system since
it was created nearly a century ago, outlining new rules that
would, for the first time, impose scientific tests for
disease-causing bacteria.
<p>   The new rules call for more inspection and controls by the meat-
and poultry-processing industry itself and new testing by the
Department of Agriculture. Drafted over the last two years, the
rules will be final upon their publication in the Federal Register
next week. They are to take effect in stages, some immediately and
some over the next two to three years, officials said.
<p>   "These new meat and poultry contamination safeguards will be
the strongest ever," Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
<p>   "Parents should know that when they serve a chicken dinner,
they are not putting their children at risk," Clinton said.
<p>   Since the federal Meat Inspection Act was passed in 1907  --  after
the publication of Upton Sinclair's muckraking expose of the
industy, "The Jungle"  --  inspectors have relied on the "sniff and
poke method" to certify that carcasses are safe to eat as they
pass along a conveyor belt. But inspectors cannot always detect
contaminated meat just by quickly smelling or looking for the
obvious signs of decay.
<p>   The government had wanted processors to perform microbial tests
for the presence of the deadly salmonella bacteria, which kills
more than 4,000 people a year and sickens as many as 5 million, and
for E. coli bacteria, which indicates fecal contamination and can
be deadly in some forms. But in a compromise, processors will test
for E. coli. and federal inspectors will conduct tests for
salmonella at various stages in the process.
<p>   Consumer groups have been pressing for change since a virulent
strain of E. coli bacteria traced to undercooked hamburgers at Jack
in the Box restaurants killed several children in the Pacific
Northwest in 1993 and sickened hundreds of others. Saturday, such
groups joined industry representatives in praising the new rules.
<p>   "This rule is a landmark in improving meat and poultry
safety," said Caroline Smith De Waal, director of food safety for
the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group.
"While it may need some fine-tuning, nonetheless it provides the
blueprint. They're giving more responsibility to the industry,
while at the same time providing adequate government oversight."
<p>   Gary M. Weber, director of animal health and meat inspection for
the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, an industry group, said:
"We're very pleased that after a 10-year struggle to redesign the
meat inspection system, we're at the first stages of implementing a
modern, scientific-based prevention system."
<p>   Inaugurating these new rules in an election year, the president
gave credit to consumer groups, especially the parents of the young
victims of the Pacific Northwest outbreak, who pressed for these
changes.
<p>   "The parents of many of the E. coli victims turned their grief
into a determination to help others," Clinton said. "In the face
of this unspeakable tragedy, they had one insistent question: How
could this have happened?"
<p>   Under the new rules, packers and slaughterhouses will be
required to establish a system known as hazard analysis and
critical control points, identifying each point and potential
problem in the process  --  such as cutting, grinding and overheating
 --  where contamination can occur and developing steps to prevent it.
The bacterial tests are intended to assure that the new safety
steps work, officials said.
<p>   Companies will have as long as 42 months to set up hazard
control systems, with smaller companies having the longest time to
comply. Eventually, plants will be required to reduce their
salmonella contamination to below the prevailing national average
for the type of meat they process. For example, 20 percent of
broiler chickens are contaminated with salmonella.
<p>   Within six months, companies will also have to set up new
sanitation systems to insure cleanliness.
<p>   Just months ago, when it became clear that the government would
not require processors themselves to test for salmonella, consumer
groups were sharply critical. But they participated in negotiations
over the final rules and now seem content to claim victory.
<p>   Ms. Smith De Waal of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest said that even though the industry will not be required to
conduct its own salmonella testing, companies will undoubtedly have
to test for the bacteria as part of their efforts to prove their
safety systems are effective.
<p>   "We didn't get everything we wanted," she said. "We wanted
mandatory salmonella testing by industry. But we did get it wrapped
into the initial validation work the industry will have to do."
<p>   The Republicans responded to Clinton's announcement by raising
questions about his behavior toward the meat industry when he was
governor of Arkansas, saying his actions then "left more than half
the streams in his home state too polluted for drinking, swimming
or fishing."
<p>   "As usual, Bill Clinton's past raises questions about his
credibility, even on an issue as nonpartisan as food safety," said
a news release from the Bob Dole for President committee. "After
waiting three years to take action, Bill Clinton today didn't
explain how his new election year 'get-tough with the meat
industry' attitude squares with his old 'easy-come, easy-go'
treatment of the same industry in Arkansas."
<p>   Some congressional Republicans tried to block the new rules, and
threatened to withhold appropriations for new inspectors and
training, arguing that they might be too onerous for the industry.
But administration officials said the new rules were intended to
grant the industry new flexibility in exchange for its assuring the
safety of its own processes.
<p>   "For years, we have had the government doing the work, the
inspectors in the plants, and you hear stories of cursory checks
and that's it," said Sally Katzen, administrator of the office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and
Budget.
<p>   "This is an attempt to get away from government micromanaging
the process and instead saying to the regulated entity, 'You figure
out how to do it, you're responsible, and we'll do some testing to
make sure there are performance standards.'"
<p>   The regulations build on similar standards for seafood
inspection issued nine months ago, Ms. Katzen said.<br>

The <a NAME="New">New</a> Meat Inspection Program</center></h3>

By NEIL A. LEWIS<BR>
7 July 96 NY Times<p>

WASHINGTON  --  The new inspection system announced Friday by the
Clinton administration provides for the government and the industry
to share responsibility for monitoring and testing meat and poultry
all along the processing chain from slaughter to the grocery shelf.
<p>   There are four major components of the program, which
Agriculture Department officials say is a profound change from the
current system that is based largely on sensory testing  --  the
"poke and sniff" test  --  that varies from plant to plant.
<p>   "Meat and poultry inspections now are subjective tests based on
seeing, feeling, touching," Dan Glickman, the secretary of
agriculture, said in an interview Friday. "What these rules do is
basically say we are moving to a science-based system."
<p>   Glickman described the current system as "catch as catch can."
Some companies, especially the larger ones, have already put in
place many of the changes that will become mandatory under the new
rules. But, he said, there is no modern, systematic monitoring of
the industry.
<p>   The main elements of the program are:
<p>    --  The federal government will set standards for contamination by
salmonella bacteria, and the Agriculture Department, for the first
time, will be responsible for conducting tests for that
disease-causing contaminant. Beginning this summer, no plant will
be allowed to exceed the current average contamination. Twenty
percent of chicken products currently show a trace of salmonella
contamination; for turkey products the level is 49 percent. Plants
not meeting that standard face penalties and ultimately could be
closed. The Department plans to tighten those standards in 16
months.
<p>    --  The processors will be required to test all their products for
the bacteria E. Coli, which is considered a reliable indicator of
fecal contamination. The department will not require the total
elimination of all such bacteria but will require plants to keep
contamination below a minimum level.
<p>    --  Each plant that processes meat and poultry will be required to
identify a series of critical points along the chain during which
the product could become contaminated, similar to what the
Agriculture Department required of fish processors last year. The
plants would have to check for contamination at each of the
checkpoints from when the product is received from the farm to when
it goes out to the grocery.
<p>   The Department of Agriculture will have to approve each plant's
program of checkpoints. Michael R. Taylor, the acting
undersecretary of agriculture for food safety said Friday that only
a minority of the nation's processing plants currently have such
programs.
<p>    --  All processing plants would have to adopt a written plan
within three months to keep them free from contamination. This
would include items such as what the plant does to ensure that
surface bacteria from an animal's skin is not carried into the meat
when it is slaughtered.
<p>   Taylor estimated the cost to the industry at $80 million
annually and said it would cost consumers a tenth of a cent per
pound on meat products. The government is planning to carry out the
program using current funds.
<p>   Carol Tucker Foreman, a former agriculture secretary and now the
head of the Safe Food Coalition, said the program was a major
change in how the government views meat contamination. She said the
program will not only save the lives of thousands of people each
year but will also save billions of dollars in annual health
costs.

<hr><h3><a NAME="Lessons">Lessons</a> Are Sought In Outbreak of Illness From Tainted Meat</h2>
By  LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.<br>
Public health officials around the country are pondering the lessons of the
outbreak of illness from undercooked hamburgers sold by the Jack in the Box
fast-food chain. The outbreak was the largest and most serious of a dangerous
bacterium that has struck before and will surely strike again.
<p>   After the initial outbreak, which caused the death of a 2-year-old boy, the
total number of confirmed and probable cases has risen to 400, Dr. John M.
Kobayashi, the Washington State epidemiologist, said in an interview yesterday. 
<p>    The tainted hamburger was voluntarily removed from sale on Jan. 18, and
there have been no new primary cases since then. To minimize a second wave of
the outbreak -- transmission from those who ate the tainted hamburger to others
in their homes, day care-centers and workplace -- health officials warned people
to wash their hands frequently. Whether or not for that reason, the number of
secondary cases is coming in less than feared, with only 35 in Washington State.
A few cases have also been reported in Nevada and Idaho.
<p>   "It's pretty encouraging," Dr. Kobayashi said, adding that his team continued
to be cautious.
<p>   Nevertheless, one measure of the seriousness of the Washington outbreak was
that 125 people had to be admitted to a hospital, Dr. Kobayashi said.
<p>   The tainted meat has led to kidney failure in at least 29 people and forced
21 to undergo kidney dialysis, said Dr. Ellis D. Avner, a kidney expert at
Children's Hospital in Seattle. Seven children with kidney damage caused by the
ailment were still in the hospital and three of the four undergoing dialysis
were in critical condition yesterday.
<p>   A 2-year-old girl also died in the outbreak in Washington, but health
officials have not been able to link her case to Jack in the Box hamburgers or
to any other case. They are still investigating.
<p>   Public health officials have many reasons to be concerned about E. coli
0157:H7, the bacterium that causes the illness involved in the outbreak. It can
crop up anywhere from municipal water and apple cider to rare hamburgers, one of
Americans' favorite foods. Doctors have not yet decided on the most effective
treatment and in most cases at present can do little more than let the disease
take its course. Antibiotics do not seem to help and may even make the disease
worse. The symptoms can range from mild to extremely violent, leading
occasionally to death, especially among children and the elderly.
<p>   E. coli 0157:H7 is a variant of one of the most common bacteria that live
harmlessly by the billions in the human gut.
<p>   The bacterium can cause diarrhea that is often bloody, severe bleeding,
anemia and kidney failure that requires dialysis. The bacterium can also produce
a wide variety of baffling symptoms, even fooling doctors into performing
unnecessary surgery.
<p>   The bacterial illness was unknown until 11 years ago, when it was linked to
tainted hamburger and added to the small list of potentially fatal food-borne
ailments.
<p>   Now the ailment is an important and growing public health problem. But
Federal health officials say that the true scope of the problem cannot be
measured because laboratories do not routinely test for the particular bacterium
because of time and cost.
<p>   Many experts have urged that more laboratories use the special culture medium
that is needed to identify E. coli 0157:H7 because identifying the organism can
affect therapy, eliminate the need for expensive unneeded diagnostic procedures
like barium enemas and colonoscopies, and can lead to recognition of outbreaks.
<p>   Epidemiologists have found that many cases go undetected unless there is a
cluster of kidney failure cases, or because large numbers of people are
hospitalized simultaneously with severe diarrheal illness.
<p>   Washington is one of the few states where E. coli 0157:H7 is a reportable
illness. More active surveillance is needed in other states to detect cases and
prevent further outbreaks, said Dr. Patricia M. Griffin, an expert in the
ailment at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
<p>   She and other experts have urged studies to determine the risks and benefits
of antibiotic therapy for the ailment.
<p>   Outbreaks can be particularly difficult to avoid because cattle are a key
reservoir of the bacterium. Dr. Griffin and other experts said there was a
critical need for studies of the mechanism by which meat becomes contaminated
with E. coli during slaughter and processing and of ways to reduce such
contamination. They suspect that most meat is contaminated at the time of
slaughter and that undercooked hamburger is the chief means of spread.
Undercooking is believed to be a greater problem than contamination by an
infected food handler.
<p>   E. coli 0157:H7 differs from other members of the E. coli family in that it
clings to the wall of the cell in the bowel and produces a toxin that can cause
bleeding. Precisely how the toxin damages tissues throughout the body is not
known, and it might be this factor that makes antibiotics ineffective.
<p>   Doctors and individuals can recognize the infection by its spectrum of
symptoms, which in addition to bloody diarrhea can include abdominal cramps and
vomiting, but often without fever. The illness usually resolves itself in about
a week. But complications can develop at any time, most commonly in the very
young and in the elderly.
<p>The most feared complication is hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which is the
leading cause of acute kidney failure in children. Many children may need to
undergo dialysis. Although most soon recover, about 15 percent go on to need
permanent dialysis or a kidney transplant.
<p>   "It always hits healthy kids," said Dr. Howard Trachtman, a specialist in
kidney diseases of children at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park,
L.I. He is working with Robert Galler, who has established a foundation to
increase awareness and support research for a cure for the ailment that killed
his daughter, Lois Joy Galler, last July.
<p>   The ailment can easily be misdiagnosed. Severe abdominal pain and intestinal
bleeding from E. coli 0157:H7 infection has led surgeons to operate
unnecessarily and remove sections of the bowel and to mistakenly diagnose
inflammatory bowel disease.
<p>   E. coli's newly recognized role in human disease resulted partly from
happenstance in 1982 through an investigation of two outbreaks of a distinctive
bloody diarrheal illness among those who ate tainted hamburgers, including
customers at a McDonald's in Oregon and Michigan.
<p>   Laboratory workers, suspecting another microbe, were surprised to detect E.
coli 0157:H7 in cultures from a few cases. Because the particular type had never
been linked to human infection, though E. coli has been known for about a
century, proof of its causal role required further investigation. Even then, E.
coli 0157:H7 was thought to be a medical oddity.
<p>   Then came a link to the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, which had been a puzzle
since it was first reported in 1955 in Switzerland. Because such cases occurred
in clusters, scientists had theorized that it was caused by a microbe. But the
many microbial candidates fell by the wayside as researchers ran into many dead
ends before E. coli was suspected.
<p>   Now, epidemiologists are finding that the ailment can strike anyone at any
age, with the highest rates in children under 5, especially for the kidney
complications. Adults may develop a bleeding disorder known as thrombocytopenic
purpura, or TTP.
<p>   The ailment has been reported throughout the world. Canada has noted a
problem with it, and for unknown reasons most of the cases in the United States
have been in states like Washington and Minnesota that border on Canada and that
have active surveillance programs.
<p>   Limited surveillance has shown that outbreaks in restaurants can occur at any
time but that sporadic cases occur most frequently in the summer.
<p>   Hamburger seems to pose the greatest risk because such meat is ground and
mixed, providing a large surface area for growth of the bacteria. Little risk of
illness from these bacteria exists if hamburger has been thoroughly cooked, as
pork usually is. But if hamburger is undercooked, bacteria inside a hamburger
patty may escape destruction. If the bacteria are on the surface of steak and
rib meat, they are generally killed when the outside is cooked even though the
inside may be rare, health officials said.
<p>As a result of the investigation of the Washington outbreak, the Food and
Drug Administration has recommended that the Federal minimum cooking temperature
for ground beef be raised to 155 degrees from 140.
<p>   Mike Espy, the Secretary of Agriculture, has also pledged to tighten Federal
meat inspection standards.
<p>   But some critics contend that only irradiation of meat will eliminate the
hazard of infection from E. coli 0157:H7 and other dangerous microbes because no
meat is sterile and most contains millions of bacteria.<hr>


<h3><center><a NAME="Tainted">Tainted</a> Hamburger Raises Doubts on Meat Safety</center></h2>
By  TIMOTHY EGAN<br>
Jan. 27, 1993 NY Times<p>

At Children's Hospital here, a 9-year-old girl is hanging on to life by a
thread after eating tainted hamburger. A 2-year-old boy has already died, and 16
other children are being treated for severe illness brought on by the same
contaminated meat.
<p>   Federal officials say the cries of these children are raising alarms across
the nation about how meat, particularly hamburger, is processed, inspected and
cooked. In the last two weeks, more than 200 people in the Pacific Northwest and
a handful of people in other Western states have been stricken with E. coli
0157:H7, a bacterium that has killed 16 people nationwide since it was first
identified 10 years ago.  
<p>    The hamburgers in the most recent outbreak came from the Jack in the Box
food chain, which has 1,170 restaurants, all west of the Mississippi. In an
interview today, Robert Nugent, president of company, said the chain cooked its
meat below a standard set by Washington State. 
 
More Illness Expected
<p>    "This is a catastrophe," Mr. Nugent said. "It has become clear that we were
not cooking our meat in compliance with Washington State standards." The company
has 60 restaurants in the state.
<p>   He added: "This has opened up a lot of people's eyes. We know all meat has
bacteria, but how much of that bacteria will kill somebody?"
<p>   He said the company was in violation of the safe-cooking regulations because
it was unaware that last May Washington had set a higher temperature requirement
of 155 degrees inside the meat, a level that normally produces a medium
hamburger. That required temperature is the highest in the nation.
<p>   This state's chief epidemiologist, Dr. John Kobayashi, said he expected the
toll of serious illnesses to continue to climb for the next few days. Although
the tainted meat was recalled last Monday, the illness has an incubation period
of up to nine days, he said.
<p>   "This has been a nightmare for the parents," said Dean Forbes, a spokesman
for Children's Hospital, whose doctors first alerted health authorities about
the outbreak. "To think that something as benign as hamburger could kill a kid 
is just startling to most people."
<p>   In the wake of the food poisoning outbreak, Federal officials say they are
considering raising the minimum guidelines for cooking processed beef to
something above the current level of 140 degrees. That is the standard most
states follow and close to the level at which Jack in the Box was cooking the
meat that has been traced to 200 cases of severe food poisoning.
 
Batch Was Contaminated
<p>    But it is not just the cooking of meat that has come under criticism. After
laboratory analysis by state and Federal health scientists, Jack in the Box last
Monday recalled about 28,000 pounds of frozen hamburger patties from a batch of
meat found to have been heavily contaminated with the strain of bacteria that
health officials say caused the outbreak. Another 40,000 patties were consumed,
officials said, in Washington, Nevada and parts of Southern California.
<p>   The fact that so much contaminated meat could be shipped to retail outlets
without being detected has called attention to the meat safety process itself.
Federal officials say that 7,400 inspectors examine the carcasses of 120 million
animals a year and that very little contaminated meat gets through. But the
inspections are limited to visual examinations, for discolored meat, rather than
laboratory analysis of certain samples.
<p>   "It's unbelievable that such a low level of inspection exists in a society so
advanced," said Joseph Dolan, whose two young daughters suffered kidney failure
after eating contaminated cheeseburgers from Jack in the Box. "No matter where
you buy ground beef, you're susceptible to getting sick."
<p>   Federal officials say about 6,000 cases of illness caused by E. coli 0157:H7
are reported each year. The strain, first discovered in 1982, is a particularly
virulent form of a bacteria found in the intestines of warm-blooded animals. In
about 10 percent to 15 percent of the reported cases, it will cause hemolytic
uremic syndrome, an illness that can lead to a failure of the kidneys and heart,
and to death. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable.
<p>   Washington raised its meat-cooking standards last May in response to a
previous outbreak of E. coli here, in 1986, when two people were killed.
<p>   Roughly four million cases of some type of food poisoning are reported
annually, but the strain of bacteria that caused this outbreak is one of the few
kinds that can kill people. "In terms of severity, this is one of the worst,"
said Dr. Douglas Archer, director of the Federal Government's Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition.
<p>   Dr. Archer, like other food inspection officials interviewed, emphasized that
the nation's food supply might be the safest in the world. "How many billions of
hamburgers are consumed annually with no resulting illness?" he said. "People
should put this case in context."
<p>   But many food experts, in and out of Government, say this outbreak in the
Northwest has pointed to a need to upgrade the inspection system and cooking
process. Despite the elaborate system of inspections, the safety of meat
depends, ultimately, on whether it is cooked adequately enough, officials say.
<p>"Raw meat is flesh -- tissue -- and all tissue contains bacteria," said Jim
Greene, a spokesman for the Food and Safety Inspection Program of the United
States Agriculture Department. "You're never going to get sterile meat."
 
Sampling Begun
<p>    The Government is starting to examine samples from selected meat processing
plants to see whether E. coli and other dangerous bacteria are widespread. If
they find a high level of contamination, they may change the inspection process
to include more laboratory sampling, officials said.
<p>   The tainted meat from Jack in the Box was processed by Vons Companies of
Arcadia, Calif., from cattle slaughtered in California, Colorado and Michigan.
Julie Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the meat processor, said the company was in
compliance with all Federal regulations and, like other plants, has Federal
inspectors who work on the premises.
<p>   "We are confident the contaminated meat did not occur as a result of
processing from Vons," Ms. Reynolds said.
<p>   Other officials have speculated the meat was contaminated at the time it was
slaughtered, but Government investigators have yet to confirm where it was
tainted.
<p>   Even though the meat was badly contaminated, the bacteria could have been
eliminated had the meat been thoroughly cooked to reach the temperature of 155
degrees or above, Federal officials said.
<p>   But Mr. Nugent, the company president, said he questioned whether cooking the
meat at the Washington threshold would have killed the bacteria.
<p>   "I think there is a responsibility at both ends of the food chain," he said.
"How do you explain the fact that for more than 30 years we've been selling
hamburgers without a problem then all of a sudden -- Bam! -- this happens."
 
Higher Cooking Temperature
<p>    The company has since raised the minimum temperature for cooking hamburgers
in all its outlets to 155 degrees, Mr. Nugent said, and has apologized in
full-page newspaper advertisements in the Seattle area.
<p>   Jack in the Box's parent company, Foodmakers Inc., lost 30 percent of its
value in the stock market last week. It has since regained much of the loss. The
company had $1.29 billion in earnings last year; nearly two-thirds of the
revenue came from Jack in the Box outlets, Mr. Nugent said.
<p>   The McDonald's Corporation, the leader in fast-food hamburger sales
nationwide, has long cooked it burgers to a temperature of at least 157 degrees,
said Rebecca A. Lewis, a customer relations representative at the company's
headquarters in Oakbrook, Ill.
<p>   Federal officials said most food poisoning from meat comes from home cooking,
particularly on outdoor grills. The Government recommends that people cook
hamburger to a temperature of 160 degrees.
<p>The death and illnesses in Washington has caused some parents here to
question the safety of fast food. But other parents say they believe that the
incident is a freak occurrence.
<p>   "I don't want to steal my children's joy at going to McDonald's," said Mr.
Dolan, who lives in the Seattle suburb of Kent. "It's part of growing up. My
daughters really enjoy eating there. And I don't want them punished for this
episode."

by the major producer and feed groups involved.<P>
 
<B>National Renderer's Association</B> (NRA) recognizes the complexity
of the issue and offered a mandated HACCP approach as an
alternative to a ruminant to ruminant ban (R-R ban).  One
attachment is a 27 page booklet on HACCP guidelines for the
rendering industry.  NRA offers assistance to the FDA in the
area of HACCP compliance; suggests an industry based program
which can be verified by the FDA through spot inspections.<P>
 
Another section of NRA's comments deals with the economic
impact of a R-R ban. Three scenario's are given, the first
being loss of the ruminant feed market only [ie, pigs and chickens are not ruminants] at $289
million/year.  The 2nd scenario is the cessation of the
rendering of ruminant raw materials which would cost the cattle
(beef & dairy) industry at least $1.6 billion each year in
addition to environmental costs. Segragation of ruminant
materials from non-ruminant materials in the rendering stream
is scenario 3.  This last scenario would require a $760 million
capital investment and $156 million in additional operating
expenses/year.<P>

 <B>National Milk Producers Federation</B> (NMPF), like the NCBA, asks
that HACCP be implemented to reduce any risk.  They support the
interim voluntary R-R ban until either the FDA regulates or the
rendering industry addresses two issues; 1) Removal of all CNS
suspect animals from rendering stream (done), 2) "Specified
Offal" (brain, eyes, spinal cord) from 4-D animals (dead,
dying, diseased, disabled) be removed from materials destined
for ruminant feed.  NMPF asks for immediate implementation and
enforcement of this restriction.<P>

<B>American Feed Industry Association</B> (AFIA) is against R-R ban
and suggests GMP's or HACCP as an alternative.  Alternative
regulation should set acceptable sources of raw materials and
minimum time and temp processing conditions.  AFIA, like NRA,
asks for immediate ban on rendering of sheep over 1 year age and
a mandated scrapie eradication program.  AFIA also suggests
increased monitoring of all TSE diseases and tighten control
over the importation of all ruminant animals and products.<P>
 
<B>National Cattlemen's Beef Association</B> (NCBA) supports a risk
based multi-layered HACCP approach instead of a regulated
R-R ban.  Potential control points suggested are 1) Exclusion
of infectious material from rendering, 2) Inactivation of the
agent through time and temp controls, and 3) Prohibit feeding
products to susceptible classes of livestock.  NCBA states that
in the past the voluntary ban on rendering sheep material was
very successful.  They support their voluntary R-R ban in the
interim until the FDA can provide HACCP regulation.<P>
 

 
<B>American Sheep Industry Association</B> (ASI) wants HACCP and GMP
approach and recommends that the FDA consult the research
community on the details.  Suggests that alternative uses for
"high risk" materials such as sheep can be utilized.<P>
 
From what I understand the <B>veterinary groups (AABP) did not
submit detailed comments</B> (personal communication).  Many other
groups and company's submitted comments.  You should contact
individual animal protein suppliers for their comments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4><CENTER>MAD COW DISEASE SHOWS <A NAME="DANGERS">DANGERS</A> OF LAX REGULATION</CENTER></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>CINCINNATI POST - Tuesday, March 26, 1996<BR>
By: Kevin Matthews<P>

LONDON  -  You  know  the  world's turned upside down when McDonald's stops
selling hamburgers.
   Yet that is what happened in Britain this weekend and, as this column is
written, it is impossible to buy a Big Mac or a Quarter Pounder with Cheese
anywhere between Land's End and the tip of Scotland.<P>

   The  immediate  cause is something called ''mad cow disease'' or, if you
want  to  be  technical, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. In humans, it is
called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
   In  cows  and  humans,  the  effect  of the disease is the same. After a
lengthy incubation period, the disease produces holes in brain tissue.<P>
   In  humans,  the  incubation  period  lasts roughly 15 years. First, the
victim  shows  signs  of  depression.  Then, he can't walk. Memory loss and
speech  impairment  come  next, followed by blindness, inability to control
bodily functions, and then death. There is no cure for this disease once it
infects your body.<P>
   Although  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease  was around before mad cow disease,
scientists were able to link them for two reasons.
   First,  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease  usually  strikes the elderly. But at
least  10  cases have been diagnosed in patients younger than 42. Moreover,
in  all  of  these cases, the breakdown of brain tissue was similar, if not
identical, to that found in cows.<P>
   The  evidence  was  enough to convince government scientists who, only a
month  ago,  still  claimed  there  was  only a ''remote theoretical risk''
linking  the  two.  For humans, an epidemic is possible which, according to
one  newspaper,  will  rival  AIDS.  As  many  as  100,000  people might be
infected, according to some reports.<P>
   The  origins of mad cow disease stretch back to the 1970s when Britain's
beef  industry  began feeding cattle a diet based on animal carcasses. ''In
practice,''  according  to  a Parliamentary report, ''this meant that cows,
which  are  herbivores,  were  eating sheepmeat, some of which was infected
with scrapie, a disease which has been known for 250 years.''<P>
   Shortly  before  the 1979 election, the country's last Labour government
was  told there was a ''problem'' and moved to tighten controls on the beef
industry.
  <B> Then,  Margaret  Thatcher  came  to  power.</B>  Within  four months a Royal
Commission  warned  that feeding animal waste to cattle risked transmitting
new  diseases  to humans. But this was at a time when the Conservatives had
promised  massive  deregulation of industry. <B>Thatcher relaxed hygiene rules
at the behest of beef producers.</B><P>
   Britain  has  nothing  like  the  U.S.  Food  and Drug Administration to
protect  consumers.  That  job  is  left  to  the  Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food.
   <B>In  any  contest between consumers and producers, MAFF consistently came
down  on  the  side  of the beef industry.</B> The reason was simple: Britain's
agricultural  businesses  are closely linked to the Conservative Party. So,
Thatcher  and her ministers left it to the beef industry ''to determine how
best to produce a high quality product.''<P>
   Within  five  years, the first cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy
were  being  reported.  Even  so,  the  government  consistently refused to
consider any evidence that they were facing a potential calamity.

   Offered  a  same-day test making it possible to determine if cattle were
infected with the disease, MAFF said <B>no</B> due to the cost to the industry.
   The  use of sheep entrails as feed was banned in 1989. But by then, much
damage  had  apparently  been  done. To this day, concern remains that some
British herds are still infected.<P>
   Even  if mad cow disease and its human equivalent does not make the jump
across  the  Atlantic,  this  episode  ought  to send a powerful message to
everyone,  but <B> especially  to  politicians,  who have made a fetish out of
bashing America's regulatory agencies.</B><P>

   There  are  examples  galore of times when these agencies go beyond what
anyone  would  call  common  sense.  But  before  junking  every  rule  and
regulation safeguarding the food we eat, the water we drink, and the air we
breathe, consider what happens when profit is put above safety.<P>

   The  lesson  isn't  a new one. Nearly two centuries ago, a British peer,
Lord  Thurlow,  asked:  ''Did  you  ever  expect  a  corporation  to have a
conscience, when it has no soul to be damned, and no body to be kicked?''<P>

   The  marriage  of  free  enterprise  with advanced technology has worked
wonders.  But if the advantages are great, so are the risks. Without a soul
to  be  damned,  or  a body to be kicked, the next best way of ensuring the
welfare  of  every citizen is to see that business plays by the rules. That
has  not  happened  in  Britain;  now  everyone who ate British meat in the
mid-1980s could pay a very high price.

<H3><CENTER>EU countries <A NAME="fail">fail</A> to report BSE</CENTER></H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>By Charles Clover, Environment Editor ... Electronic Telegraph ... June 24
<p>


BEEF from many EU countries is now more likely to be contaminated with BSE than British beef, European vets have concluded from evidence that thousands of cases in Europe have not been reported. The Federation of Veterinarians in Europe will call on Franz Fischler, Agriculture Commissioner, this week to impose a British-style ban on specified beef offals throughout the EU. It will also seek tighter monitoring of farms, abattoirs and butchers. This follows evidence from Swiss experts of gross under-reporting of BSE by many EU countries.<p>

 Prof Marc Vandervelde, head of the Institute of Animal Neurology at the University of Berne, believes that France ought to be declaring around 200 BSE cases a year - instead of the 22 it has so far declared - given the amount of contaminated feed it has imported. It was "astonishing", he said, that France had not had more cases. He is also openly incredulous of Holland, Luxembourg and Belgium which also imported thousands of tons of contaminated feed from Britain in the 1980s but had declared no cases of BSE. Prof Vandervelde joked: "In some countries BSE is banned."<p>

 Until common standards are imposed on European beef production, The Daily Telegraph's research indicates that consumers have some justification for refusing to buy beef. British and Swiss beef appears to be the safest in terms of the controls imposed to prevent contaminated material being consumed by humans.<p>

 Switzerland has the highest number of reported cases of BSE outside Britain [ 218 ] and is also the most open about the number of cattle at risk. Prof Vandervelde added: "BSE stops at the Swiss border. Some spill-over would be expected but the surrounding countries will not admit it."<p>

His colleagues have calculated that the whole Swiss dairy herd, some 800,000 cows out of a total herd of 1.7 million, was at risk of exposure to contaminated feed imported from Britain, through France.  Of these, 200,000 dairy cows, mostly the older ones, are estimated to have been exposed to around 10,000 tons of contaminated feed. Experts believe that all the Swiss cases of BSE arose from these animals. Swiss cases of BSE are no longer increasing, thanks to the same controls used in Britain.<p>

There was a danger that the French could be recycling their own BSE in other animal food
Nature recently reported that contaminated feed from Britain, could have been fed to cattle in France until this year.  Prof Vandervelde said: "We would expect to see a couple of hundred cattle a year with BSE. It wouldn't be wrong to say that at least a couple of hundred thousand cattle had been exposed. Most of our imported feed came from France. It would be difficult not to find a similar incidence of the disease as in Switzerland."<p>

 The French herd is 11 million cows, more than 10 times the total Swiss herd. If the food was distributed evenly the number of cases might be expected to be significantly higher. "If you have a bad surveillance system, you are not going to see it. If you make the disease notifiable but provide no compensation for farmers the cases will not be reported," Prof Vandervelde said.<p>

 France has a ban on "specified offals" but this applies only to cattle born before 1991. As a result, said Prof Vandervelde, there is no way of knowing if French beef is safe for human consumption. It was also unclear whether French rendering processes were safe. There was a danger that the French could be recycling their own BSE in other animal food. <p>

 We may never know the full extent of the missing cases of BSE, says Prof Vandervelde, because the factors affecting the distribution of the contaminated feed are not understood. "One would have to have an army of detectives to answer these questions," he said. The European Commision neither has, not intends to deploy such an army.<p>

 Greater certainty may come from tracing the 57,900 pure-bred breeding cattle exported from 1985 to 1991. A report by European scientists last week said that around 1,668  [or 2.9%] of these might be expected statistically to have contracted BSE.  One of the authors, Prof Otto Christian Straub, said that a list of countries most at risk could be compiled, based on those who had imported the most dairy cattle.<p>

The figures are still being analysed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey. British vets believe that the "at risk" list will be topped by Portugal (which imported 12,000 head of cattle and has so far declared only seven cases of BSE), followed by Spain (which has declared none) and the Netherlands (none).<p>

Francis Anthony, president of the Federation of Veterinarians in Europe, said: "We are calling on Commissioner Fischler to insist on full surveillance of European herds. We want 100 per cent removal of specified offals and proper verification to ensure that countries are doing it. "If our beef is suspect, theirs is potentially lethal."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Prescription">Prescription</A> for Disaster</CENTER></H3>

<blockquote>
The Washington Post, April 22, 1996<br>
By: Edward M. Kennedy<p>


Republican   legislation   in  Congress  to  "reform"  the  Food  and  Drug
Administration  would  dramatically weaken the FDA's ability to protect the
public  health. The assault on the FDA is particularly serious, because the
agency  is  responsible  for the safety of a quarter of all the products in
the  American  economy  --  especially the food we eat and the prescription
drugs we take.<p>

The  Republican  bills  would  water down requirements that guarantee theseproducts  are  safe  and  effective. They would turn over many of the FDA's
most  important  functions  to private industry, with built-in conflicts of
interest.  They  would  give  preference to products approved in Europe and
other  foreign countries, where the public is less well protected. And they
would  saddle  the agency with so many new bureaucratic requirements and so
much  red  tape  that  it  would be unable to do its job. If the Republican
proposals  are  enacted, Americans can expect many more drug disasters like
thalidomide and DES, medical device failures like the Dalkon shield, lethal
vaccines  like  the  Cutter  polio vaccine, threats to the blood supply and
even  threats  to the food supply, such as the "mad cow disease," which has
rocked the British beef industry.<p>

   The  Republican proposals, by eliminating essential FDA oversight of the
production  of  medical  products,  threaten  the  safety of drugs, medical
devices,  blood  and vaccines. A minor manufacturing change that alters the
solvent  used  to  kill viruses in blood products can result in ineffective
sterilization  of the blood, risking the transmission of AIDS or hepatitis.A  change  in  the  filters  used to produce vaccines can turn a protective
vaccine into a killer. A change in filters used to produce the Cutter polio
vaccine  resulted  in  200  cases  of  polio  in  the 1950s, before the FDA
required  more  rigorous  standards. Under the Republican bills, the agency
would  no  longer  be  permitted  to  review  such manufacturing changes in
advance to ensure that the public is protected.<p>

   The  House  Republican bill eliminates existing requirements for the FDA
to  approve certain products that can be dangerous to public health -- such
as  leaky  surgical  gloves or faulty diagnostic tests. In recent weeks, it
was  revealed  that  a  defective  new  AIDS  test kit was distributed to 2
million  patients abroad. American consumers, however, were spared exposure
to this dangerous product.<p>

   The  Senate  bill  gives the FDA only 90 days to review certain new food
additives,  even  though  these  additives  can  result  in the involuntary
exposure of millions of Americans to potentially harmful substances.   The  Dalkon  shield,  used  to  prevent  pregnancy, injured 90,000 women
because of a design flaw. This tragedy led to legislation strengthening FDA
oversight  of  medical devices. The Shiley heart valve proved vulnerable to
breakage,  killing  the  patients.  Before  the  valve  was  withdrawn, the
manufacturer  proposed  a  new  version  six  times more dangerous than the
original.  The  FDA  rejected it, but 4,000 patients received it in Europe.
Under  the  Republican  bills,  the FDA's ability to prevent such tragedies
would be seriously compromised.<p>

   The House bill would reduce standards for approving a new use for a drug
already  approved for another purpose. The lower standard would restore the
pre-1962  requirements that brought us DES. In recent years, drugs approved
for  life-threatening  heart  arrhythmias  were  widely prescribed for mild
arrhythmias.  This  "off-label"  use of the drug has been estimated to have
caused as many as 50,000 deaths.<p>

   Both  the  Senate and the House bills contain an inherent and outrageousconflict of interest. They are designed to shift responsibility for product
approval from the independent experts at the FDA to private businesses. The
profitability  of  these firms would depend on the fees they attracted from
the  very companies whose products they review. The Senate bill pretends to
give  the  FDA  final approval of the decisions of these private reviewers,
but  the time frames for action are so short and the rules for oversight so
limited  that  the  agency  would  be  reduced to little more than a rubber
stamp.  The  House bill is even more extreme, removing the FDA from certain
product approvals altogether.<p>

   As  hard  as  it may be to believe, another provision in the bills would
prohibit  the FDA from requiring companies to make information available to
patients  on  possible  dangers  of  prescription  drugs.  At  a  time when
hospitalizations from improper use of prescription drugs by senior citizens
cost  Medicare  $20  billion  a  year,  it  is  foolish  to  deny  patients
information they need to monitor their use of medications.   The  Republican bills also contain provisions to micromanage the agency.
The  strategy of the Republicans and their special interest constituency is
clear: Set up procedures that make it impossible for regulatory agencies to
protect  the  public, and then use their failures as an excuse to dismantle
them.<p>

   The assault on the FDA is fueled by a well-funded campaign alleging that
patients  are suffering because foot-dragging by the agency is denying them
needed drugs already approved in foreign countries. Much of the funding for
this  campaign  comes from tobacco companies, who have their own reasons to
discredit  the  FDA.  In  fact,  FDA drug review time was cut by 40 percent
between  1987  and 1993. According to the nonpartisan congressional General
Accounting  Office,  by  1993 the United States was reviewing drugs as fast
as, or faster than, Great Britain and other foreign countries. Review times
in the United States have dropped even farther since.<p>

   And unlike foreign approval authorities, the FDA has combined speed withsafety. Between 1970 and 1992, 56 drugs were introduced in France, Germany,
Great  Britain  and the United States that subsequently had to be withdrawn
because  they  were  unsafe.  Only  nine had been approved in this country,
compared with 31 in France, 30 in Germany and 23 in Great Britain.<p>

   The  FDA  is  not  perfect,  but it is still renowned as one of the most
effective  regulatory  agencies  in  the  world.  There  is always room for
improvement, but the Republican proposal is a blueprint for demolition, not
modernization, and Congress should reject it.<p>

<h3><center>USDA BUYS BEEF FOR 1996-97 SCHOOL YEAR</center></h3>



     WASHINGTON, June 26, 1996--Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman today
announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is purchasing approximately
4.5 million pounds of frozen fine ground beef product at a cost of nearly $4.2
million.  The ground beef will be used for distribution in the National School
Lunch Program and other federal food assistance programs.<p>

       "To date, we've purchased more than 14 million pounds of beef products
at a cost of about $13 million since we announced an accelerated beef purchase
initiative May 1," Glickman said. "These purchases represent the Clinton
Administration's commitment to combating record-low prices for cattle
producers," Glickman said.<p>

     USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service, the agency which processes the
purchase contracts, said additional offers to purchase beef are scheduled for
June 28 and weekly thereafter until 1996-97 school year purchases have been
completed.


     Total purchases of frozen ground beef since the program was
announced May 17, follow:<p>

   
Fine Ground: 9,504,000 pounds, $8,655,756

Reprocessing Beef: 4,830,000 pounds, $4,115,425

1-Pound Chubs: 198,000 pounds, $257,048<p>

 <hr>
                                     

The Clinton Administration continues to implement a multi-faceted strategy to
deal with problems farmers and ranchers are facing due to drought and other
adverse weather conditions.  The primary elements of that strategy are:<p>
<h3><center>Bad Weather Subsidy </center></h3>


          On April 10, 1996, Secretary  Glickman provided farmers an
          additional  four weeks to purchase catastrophic risk crop
          insurance coverage for spring-planted crops by extending the sales
          closing dates to May 2, 1996.<p>

          On April 26, 1996, Secretary Glickman authorized emergency grazing
          on Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in numerous southern plains
          counties and announced that the reduction in CRP rental payments
          would be 5% for each month CRP acreage is grazed, up to a maximum
          of 25%, rather than the 25% reduction previously assessed for any
          grazing of CRP acreage.<p>

          On April 30, as part of a 5-point plan to direct assistance to
          cattle producers, President Clinton directed Secretary Glickman to
          open all but the most environmentally sensitive CRP acres to
          emergency haying and grazing.<p>

          On May 23, 1996, Secretary Glickman announced plans to reprogram
          $16.4 million to the Emergency Loan Program to replenish exhausted
          funds in that program, making an additional $56 million in loans
          available.<p>

          On May 24, 1996, at the request of President Clinton, Secretary
          Glickman announced authorization for the Noninsured Assistance
          Program (NAP) to cover  losses on small grains used for forage.<p>

          On June 7, 1996, Secretary Glickman announced that insured dryland
          cotton farmers in west Texas and east New Mexico would have to
          wait only seven days after the final planting date, rather than
          the standard 25 days, to put their land to another use, such as
          planting grain sorghum, if the cotton failed to make a stand after
          seven days from the final planting date.  If a stand is not
          produced, the acreage planted to cotton would be considered as a
          total loss under the crop insurance program, assuming compliance
          with all other provisions.<p>

          On July 1, 1996, President Clinton declared a state of emergency
          in the Southwest and other areas adversely affected by weather,
          warranting the release of the Feed Grain Disaster Reserve.  With
          this authority, Secretary Glickman will release feed grain stocks
          held in the Disaster Reserve.  Up to 16 million bushels of grain
          will be sold on the open market on a competitive bid basis and the
          proceeds will be used to make cost-share assistance available to
          eligible livestock producers who have suffered a substantial loss
          of normal feed production and do not have adequate feed to maintain
         their eligible livestock.<p>

<h3><center>OK to trash and set-asides</center></h3>


          In 1995, the Department of Agriculture (USDA) permitted 640,000
          acres of land enrolled in the CRP to exit the program early and
          return to crop production, replacing that land with more
          environmentally sensitive land.<p>

          On January, 25,1996, Secretary Glickman announced that USDA would
          permit farmers with CRP contracts expiring in 1996 to terminate
          their  CRP contracts early and bring that acreage back into
          production this crop year.<p>

          On April 5, 1996, one day after the farm bill was signed,
          Secretary Glickman implemented a provision in the legislation that
          allows farmers with certain CRP land enrolled in the program for
          at least 5 years to terminate their CRP contracts early and to
          return that acreage to crop production.<p>

<h4><center>EXPORT AND DOMESTIC SUBSIDIES</center></h4>


          On January 23, 1996, President Clinton authorized the release of
          1.5 million tons of wheat from the Food Security Commodity Reserve
          to meet humanitarian food aid commitments.<p>

          Secretary Glickman, as part of President Clinton's 5-point plan to
          assist livestock producers, increased the availability of export
          credit guarantees for a number of livestock and meat products to
          countries such as Mexico, Egypt, Estonia, Turkey, Poland, Morocco,
          Central America, Croatia, Lithuania, and Russia.<p>

          For Fiscal Year 1996, USDA has made available $11.6 million in
          export market development funds under the Market Access and
          Foreign Market Development Programs to the U.S. Meat Export
          Federation.  With the help of these programs, U.S. beef and pork
          exports have reached record levels.<p>

          Secretary Glickman, at President Clinton's request, has expedited
          purchases of beef and dairy products for school meals and food
          assistance programs.  Since April 30, USDA has purchased more than
          14 million pounds of beef products at a cost of about $13 million,
          with additional purchases scheduled weekly.<p>

In addition to Secretary Glickman's trips in April to west Texas and southern
Kansas and Deputy Secretary Rominger's trip to Lubbock, Texas in June to tour
drought-affected areas, the Clinton Administration continues to monitor
weather and market conditions closely in consideration of additional actions
as needed.<p>

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS ... July 5 1996

FROM MARTIN FLETCHER AT LAKE FALCON

<br>

ON THE TEXAS-MEXICO BORDER

<p>


THE 250-year-old border town of Guerrero Viejo was once the vibrant hub of this desert region and boasted a printing press, a hospital and a population of 40,000. Wars and revolutions then took their toll, but what finished the place off was the damming of the Rio Grande a few miles downstream in 1953.

<p>

Torrential rains filled the vast Lake Falcon far quicker than expected and, within a year, most of Guerrero Viejo had vanished beneath the rising waters.

<p>

The last 3,000 inhabitants fled to new purpose-built housing near the dam, never believing they would see their old homes again, but they reckoned without the great drought of 1996.

<p>

After three virtually rainless years, the 50-mile lake has shrunk to a third of its normal size and fallen nearly 50ft. The lost town of Guerrero Viejo has miraculously resurfaced.

<p>

A guide took me there last week. We turned off an empty Mexican road, drove ten miles down a dirt track, and in temperatures of 100F (37C) explored the deserted, sun-baked ruins with their tantalising hints of Guerrero Viejo's past glories.

<p>

The beautiful sandstone church with its carved pillars and Roman arches still stands, though the back wall and part of the roof have fallen in. There are faded maroon-and-yellow tiles on the floor, and high on the walls fleur-de-lys are visible on remnants of plasterwork. Someone has recently made a small shrine with plastic flowers and a picture of the Virgin Mary. The church faces what was obviously once a fine town square. The pavements are cracked and tilted, but there is still a gazebo in the centre ringed by crumbling stone benches, and a statue's pedestal. A plaque dated 1927 honours the town's <i>grupo femenil</i>, the women's club.

<p>

In the town square's far corner are the skeletal remains of the Hotel Flores, once famous for its dances, and a pristine stretch of cobbled street. Nearer the receding lake is the colonnaded schoolhouse. Its classrooms are carpeted with dried mud and overrun by frogs and snakes. The houses are mostly rubble, playgrounds for darting lizards.

<p>

In one of the few houses high enough to escape inundation, we found an old Mexican woman named Julia Zamora, who refused to leave in 1953 and stayed on with her goats. More than 40 years later she is developing a new business &#173; purveyor of cold drinks to the growing number of visitors lured by word of Guerrero Viejo's reappearance. This tough old lady is one of the very few beneficiaries of a drought that first took hold in this southernmost point of Texas about three years ago and now blights the entire Southwest.

<p>

It is a gathering crisis that threatens farmers with ruin on a scale not seen since the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s, immortalised in John Steinbeck's novel, <i>The Grapes of Wrath.</i> Rick Perry, the Texas agriculture commissioner, predicts the drought will cost his state $6.5 billion (&#163;4.27 billion) this year, making it the most costly natural disaster in its history.

<p>

Texas is America's biggest cotton producer, but the soil is so parched that most of this year's crop has withered and died. The state's total wheat harvest is expected to be just 57 million bushels, down from 129 million in 1992. Hardest hit of all are the cattle ranchers who have seen feed prices nearly triple, rendering every cow in Texas economically unviable. As ranchers rush to sell their herds, beef prices are plummeting.

<p>

At daybreak in the small east Texan town of Groesbeck, the line of ranchers' lorries and trailers waiting to sell cattle at the auction yards stretches down the highway. "If the drought goes on like this another year 75 per cent of the cows will be gone," complained one rancher, Walton Harter. "Can't keep 'em. Ain't nothing for them to eat."

<p>

Parked outside the auction yards was a lorry loaded with hay. Its owner was selling the hay for an exorbitant $145 a tonne.

<p>

One group of west Texas ranchers have employed an aviation company to "seed" clouds with chemicals that supposedly generate rain. The mayors of two big west Texan towns, Childress and San Angelo, have issued official proclamations urging their people to pray for rain. Ranchers have revived the nearly moribund practice of burning prickles off cacti with butane torches so that their cattle can eat them.

<p>

Farmers are not the only victims. Illegal Mexican immigrants have died of dehydration while crossing the desert borders. Arizona and New Mexico have suffered huge forest fires, and some Texas counties banned fireworks at their Independence Day celebrations yesterday.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Hidden">Hidden</A> Agenda to Scare People into Vegetarian Diet</H3></CENTER>


<I><CENTER>Letter to the editor ... Portland Oregonian ... 4.12.96</CENTER></I>
<P>

The Physicians Commitee for Responsible Medicine is an animal-rights organization that oppose the use of animals for medical research and openly advocates vegetarianism.  Dr. Neal Barnard is the president and chief spokesman for the committee.<P>

I point these facts out so that the readers of Barnard's column ("Brain Rot - Disease of the week," March 31,1996) understand the motivation of its author.  The Physician's Committee was formed ... in an effort to provide credibility to the animal rights movement in the guise of a consumer and health organization<P>


Scare-mongers such as Barnard are orchestrating a campaign to frighten consumers into a vegetarian diet by exploiting the facts surrounding Britains's bovine spongiform encephalopaythy crisis....It is an animal disease, not a human disease....<P>

              Food producers push for laws
              protecting their crops from rumors</CENTER></H3>


              May 13, 1996 ... CNN ... 

              Web posted at: 7:40 a.m. EDT ... 

              From Correspondent Anthony Collings<P>


              WASHINGTON (CNN) -- In some states, at
              least in theory, criticizing food can land an
              offender in jail -- and the issue has become a
              hot potato.<P>


              In Oklahoma, for example, it's best not to
              bad-mouth the cattle, or you could end up in court faster than an auctioneer's
              tongue.<P>


              Ranchers would like to see other states crack the whip against rumor-mongers.
              Cattlemen worry that beef prices are low enough and could get lower if there's
              any health scare like Britain's mad cow disease.


              "It's important to have some sort of backstop in place to penalize people for
              making unsubstantiated comments," said Kansas cattle rancher Jim Sartwelle.<P>

              But critics think such laws are a rotten idea.

              "Individuals will be hesitant to speak out on legitimate food safety concerns,"
              said Theodore Waugh of the Pure Food Campaign.<P>


              But such concerns have not put a damper on the drive to protect food from
              defamation. On the East Coast, Maryland chicken farmers want their state to join
              the others banning bad words about food.<P>

              "This legislation will be like a scare tactic to prevent people from circulating
              unreliable rumors without any factual basis," said Republican state Sen.
              Richard Colburn.<P>

              Twelve states have laws against unfounded criticism of perishable food. In
              Washington state, supporters pushed for the gag law to avoid situations like the
              Alar health scare.

              Sales of apples fell after a news report linked Alar, a preservative, to cancer.
              Apple growers denied the allegation, but there was so much negative publicity
              that they stopped using the chemical spray.<P>

              State laws against food rumors have never been enforced, and critics say they're
              unconstitutional.

              "We're very concerned that these laws will prohibit free speech," said Pure
              Food's Waugh.<P>

              But rancher Sartwelle said he has no room for disparaging words about his
              livelihood.

              "That type of speech," Sartwelle said, "I don't feel needs to be protected."

              Farmers say they just want perishable food to enjoy the same kind of libel
              protection as processed food. But critics say the First Amendment is also
              perishable, and it needs protection, too.<HR>


<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Texas">Texas</A> AG won't sue Howard Lyman over mad cow remarks<HR></H1></CENTER>

<P>   AUSTIN, Texas (May 2, 1996 7:11 p.m. EDT) -- Attorney General Dan Morales on Thursday rejected Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry's request to use the state's new "veggie libel" law to go after a vegetarian who said mad cow disease could affect America's beef supply.<P>


   Though Morales labeled the comments "baloney," he said the law does not allow the state to file suit under the law approved last year by lawmakers to protect against people who make false claims about the safety of food products.
   Any such lawsuit would have to be filed by a private individual who feels his or her products have been unfairly disparaged, Morales said.<P>

   At issue are remarks made during an April 19 appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show" by Howard Lyman of Maryland, a former cattle rancher now with the Eating with Conscience Campaign, a project of the Humane Society of America. Lyman said on the show that mad cow disease "will make AIDS look like the common cold," and that the livestock industry is feeding "road kill" to cattle. <B>A day later, <A NAME="fut">cattle</A> futures plummeted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.</B><P>

   Perry was enraged, and urged Morales to file suit against Lyman.<P>

   Can't do, said Morales, who also recommended a lower-key response to Lyman.<P>

   "Mr. Lyman's statements should be taken for what they are -- baloney," he told Perry. "The more public attention focused upon his outrageous claims, the greater the prospects for real harm being done to our beef industry. I suggest we simply ignore this foolishness."<P>

   Perry said he was disappointed in Morales' response.<P>

   "The letters and phone calls the Texas Department of Agriculture has received from folks who make their living from the land and who are suffering from these false statements tell us that they support our efforts to stop the inaccuracies and innuendo about our $6 billion industry," he said.<P>

   Mad cow disease (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) has been detected in cattle in Great Britain, but it has not been diagnosed in Texas. Perry and other agriculture officials say there is no scientific link between mad cow disease and the human disease (Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease) that killed several Britons.<P>

Texas officials are considering a possible lawsuit against a
man they called a "vegetarian activist" who made "disparaging
comments" about beef on a recent Oprah Winfrey show.  Texas
Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry asked state Attorney General
Dan Morales to take action against Howard Lyman for saying mad
cow disease would "make AIDS look like the common cold," said a
spokeswoman for the TX Agriculture Dept. (JO. OF COMMERCE, 4/29).

Here is a transcript of what Lyman actually said on the Oprah show of April 16. 1996.  Transcripts can be ordered from 1-800-777-8398.<P>
Texas ordinances are subordinate to protection of free speech under the First Amendment to the US Constitution.

<B>Lyman</B>: "Absolutely.  And what we're looking at right now, is that we're following exactly the same path that they followed in England: 10 years of dealing with it as public relations rather than doing something substantial about it.  On hunderd thousand cows per year in the US are fine at night, dead in the moring.  The majority of those cows are rounded, ground up, turned into feed and fed back to other animals....We should have them eating grass, not other cows.  We've not only turned them into carnivores, we've turned them inot cannibals.... We've had a ban in the US of feeding sheep to cows for a long time, but when they went out and looked, 25 percent of the renderers admitted that they were paying no attention to it.  Voluntary bans do not work....<P>

Well, what it comes down to is about half the slaughter of animals is non-salable to humans.

We ended up feeding downed cows to mink; the mink come down with the disease, transfer it to animals.  The animals came down with it.  And you're sitting here, telling everybody that it's safe. Not true."

<HR><H3><A NAME="Vegetarian">Vegetarian</A> running Texas program promoting beef<HR></H1>

<P>   AUSTIN, Texas (May 8, 1996 6:53 p.m. EDT) -- It wouldn't be state government without stuff like this: The state official in charge of promoting beef products is a vegetarian.<P>


   Diane Smith, the Texas Department of Agriculture's assistant commissioner for marketing and agribusiness development, has been meat-free for 14 years.

   "It's a personal preference," she said, declining to offer reasons for her culinary conversion. "It has nothing to do with my work or my position at the Department of Agriculture."<P>

   That's also the official word from the agency, where Agriculture Commissioner Rick Perry says Smith's job is well done.

   "Diane's personal eating habits have never been an issue. There is no question that Diane and her staff have done an outstanding job to promote Texas beef while with TDA," Perry said.<P>

   As assistant commissioner, Smith oversees marketing programs involving livestock, horticulture, fiber and international marketing.

   Livestock accounts for about two-thirds of the state's agriculture business. The raising of beef cattle is the most extensive agricultural operation in Texas, accounting for about half the total cash receipts from Texas farms and ranches.<P>

   Smith's diet raised an eyebrow among the state's major cattle organizations, but all now say they are convinced she does a good job and they don't care what she doesn't eat.

   Steve Munday, executive vice president of the Fort Worth-based Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, said he had no problem with Smith's diet.<P>

   "That's a personal decision. If her boss is satisfied with her performance we could care less," Munday said.

   Similar comments came from the Independent Cattlemen's Association, Texas Beef Council and Texas Cattle Feeders Association.

   Richard McDonald (no relation to Ronald), executive vice president of the cattle feeders group, sees nothing unkosher about the vegetarian beef promoter.

   "We had the opportunity to discuss that with the TDA last year. We feel that she continues to do a good job in her role," he said.<P>

   Smith said she sees no conflict in promoting a product she eschews.

   "As a former deputy commissioner once said, he didn't drink alcohol but he promoted Texas wines. I feel I can be a strong promoter of all Texas products," she said.

   "The vegetable and fruit industries have never complained," she added.

<CENTER><H3>WHAT NOW POOR COW?</H3></CENTER>


<P>MAD COWS CHASED BY MAD solutions. That was the British view last week as science took a backseat to politics in the continuing cow row over the possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, and the similar fatal human brain condition called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. British farmers tried to come to terms with the worldwide ban on their beef, and the government continued to insist that the cows posed no danger to human health. At the same time, in a perfect somersault of logic, the government sought to restore consumer confidence by announcing that some $ 8 billion would be spent in a five-year plan to destroy and incinerate 4.7 million head of the very same cattle that are assertedly so safe. <P>For Britain's E.U. partners, however, the cow crisis was just plain maddening, overshadowing the launching of this year's Intergovernmental Conference that will review the Maastricht Treaty and set the E.U. compass on such key issues as enlargement and a common foreign policy. Fresh from their Turin summit, E.U. leaders found themselves facing what a German foreign-office official described as a "crisis of confidence among E.U. nations." The shroud over Turin, it might be said.   <P>Much of the friction is between Britain and Germany, where the prevailing view is that the British brought the disaster upon themselves. Yet here was London holding out its hand to Brussels for compensation even as Euroskeptics within John Major's government rubbed salt into the beef wound by implying that the crisis was a Europlot against the island member. The German Farmers Association claimed the central problem of the BSE debacle was "the British greed for profits," which allowed the number of British cows affected by BSE to reach 160,000, possibly through the use of feed containing recycled remains of other animals, such as sheep brains. The Germans, particularly, say they have been warning about BSE for years, but claim nothing has been done because of the political clout of British farmers. <P>Britain was seeking a Euro-reimbursement of 80% of the cost of herd disposal, under a Common Agricultural Policy provision. But the Germans led the push to reduce the compensation to 70%, arguing that that amount was all German and Belgian farmers got when swine disease had forced them to kill their pigs. Deeper sentiments were revealed in the German press. The leading daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said in a blistering editorial that "the chasm between London and the Continent is growing deeper." On the critical issues of European integration, the paper claimed, the British showed at Turin that they remained "outside." <P>The French have been less harsh--possibly because they have not been immune to the problem. On Friday the Director-General of French Health, Jean-Francois Girard, revealed that in January a 26-year-old man from Lyons died from an "atypical" version of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease, apparently the same version that 10 Britons contracted. And last week farmers in Brittany slaughtered more than 300 cattle after detection of BSE-infected cows in their herds. No wonder President Jacques Chirac said in Turin that the cow issue is "a European problem that must be financed in a European way." French official caution may have been aimed at desperately trying to hold consumer confidence in the local product and to cash in on the absence of British beef, a strategy that has at best had limited success. Such diplomacy did not in any way hinder France's leftist parliamentarian and former Health Minister Bernard Kouchner, who laid the blame squarely on the conservative Tories. "The arrival of Mrs. Thatcher &lsqb;as Prime Minister&rsqb; in England allowed business to assume responsibility for the public's health," Kouchner fumed. <P>The British see things quite differently. A tentative connection between cow and human brain diseases is one thing, the role of Europe another. Prime Minister John Major said in Turin that British opposition to greater European integration was a matter of "principle" and "quite separate from the beef crisis." But the sovereignty-vs.-Europe question that has vexed British governments since entry into the old Common Market in 1973 has been further highlighted by the Brussels decision to make the ban on British beef sales worldwide. Many British see the extension of the prohibition by the E.U. beyond its own borders as another example of Brussels' having too much power. <P>Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg told the House of Commons the measure was based on neither logic nor science, adding, "We are looking urgently at the legality of what has been done." Yet any legal challenge will have to be made before the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, one of the E.U. institutions against which Britain regularly rails. At a more visceral level, Conservative backbencher Theresa Gorman said of the E.U. move, "These people in Europe who are supposed to be our friends and allies have insulted the Prime Minister. If British people are willing to eat this kind of humble pie, they've lost their right to be a proud nation." <P>Humble pie, perhaps, but Europeans were becoming less prepared to eat beef of any provenance. Part of the German anger against Britain is explained by the fact that German sales of all beef have plummeted faster than elsewhere in the E.U.: up to 75% in some regions, even though last year Germany imported only 600 tons of British beef, a mere 0.5% of consumption. Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert conceded--after posing eating a German roast-beef sandwich--"We Germans tend to panic more easily than the consumers in other nations." <P>A more convincing reason for panic remains the question of how much money "mad-cow" disease is going to cost. French estimates put the price of Euro-compensation to British farmers at $ 560 million in the first year alone, possibly $ 2 billion over the five-year plan. Estimates from Brussels are lower: nearly $ 205 million on doomed cattle in Year 1. The British, meanwhile, are afraid that any money they receive from Brussels will trigger a reduction in their rebate from the E.U. budget, thus diluting the real value of any compensation. The cost of incineration, perhaps a total of $ 3.6 billion, will also have to be paid by Britain, which acknowledges that its present nine livestock crematoria can handle only 1,000 carcasses a week, not the required 15,000. That shortage of capacity in turn will require cow carcasses to be held in freezer depots pending cremation, at an additional untold cost. <P>Even those costs are only part of the toll. Before the announcement of a possible BSE-Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease link, the British beef industry was worth $ 6 billion a year. Now, in addition to farmers, all the associated businesses-- transporters, auctioneers, slaughterhouses, makers of by-products, feed suppliers--also face ruin. On a smaller scale, the picture is grim for the industry in the rest of Europe as well. <P>The fact that emotion has played a bigger role than science has led to criticism of the media. <B>As Chirac complained in Turin, "We should talk less of mad cows and more of the <A NAME="mad press">mad press</A>."</B> That feeling was echoed in London last Friday by one of the co-authors of the report that triggered the crisis in March. Dr. James Ironside said on bbc Radio there was "no scientific evidence to suggest that the widespread slaughter of cattle in this country would actually help matters." He reported that scientists were perhaps 18 months away from establishing anything definite about a cow-human disease link. <P>Lack of scientific proof has done nothing to help the British farmers facing bankruptcy or a beleaguered Prime Minister Major, who announced last week that the beef scare is the greatest crisis since the Falklands war. Britain eventually won that conflict, but mad-cow disease looks to be harder to beat than Argentine generals. <P>

<H3><A NAME="Deja">Deja</A> Vu All Over Again</H3>

People who have followed the unravelling cover-up in Britain will find the U.S. press using a familiar approach -- erring on the side of protecting the meat industry, not public health. The story appeared on Wednesday, 10 April 1996, under the byline of Patrick O'Neill, though the story has the  AP '<A HREF="#garbage">imprimature</A>'.  Reading between the lines, we learn:<P>
∂ 1:  it's public hysteria, a <B>scare</B> with a zany name [mad cow disease], applicable to far-away Britain, not a bona fide U.S. public health concern.<P>
∂2: unnamed experts say <B>BSE has never been documented in the U.S. </B>Actually, the disease  is called 'downer cow syndrome' n the U.S.and as many as 300,000 cattle a year die from it [and enter the food chain as byproduct.]  Not to mention sheep scrapie.  What does the average farmer do with a valuable animal just starting to show signs of an always-fatal disease? {Ans: sell it while it is still worth something.] No mention here of the FDA crackdown in April 1996 of imports of infections agent from Britain, in the form of cattle protein supplements, cosmetics, and dietary supplements.  No mention of Dr. Marsh's 1993 study of transmission from rendered Wisconsin dairy cattle to ranched mink.<P>
∂3:  not to worry, <B>incidence of rare CJD</B> in humans is 1 in 1,000,000.  Oops, they forget to say that's per year, folks -- and it translates, given the long latency, to 1 in 10,000 having it at time of death according to National Institute of Mental Health.  But what would NIMH know compared to the Cattlemen's Association? <I>And who advertises more in the Oregonian?</I>  Don't forget, only 6% of patients exhibiting symptoms of the disease are ever autopsied. [CJD can only be conirmed at autopsy -- pathologists avoid these bodies like the plague -- several have died from it].  Some 7% of Alzheimer PMs exhibit spongiform cerebral lesions.  The Alzheimer Society is a major donor to CJD research because of these similarities.<P>
∂4: "<B>anxiety</B> about the <B>remote possibility of a link</B>" between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and human Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.  Actually, the scientific evidence is ovewelming for variant-CJD.  No quote here of Dr. Richard Lacey, a distinguished English professor of microbiology, calls the situation in England "worse that AIDS,"  with perhaps a hundred  million people exposed globally to tainted meat over 15 years, with 12 documented deaths, and an incipient epidemic.<P>
∂5 :" Oregon health officials are <B>searching computer records</B>," as if this is going to find anything given the rarity of diagnosis and autopsy and the lack of reporting requirements.<P>
∂6. only "3 Oregonians a year died of the illness -- <B>well within the worldwide average</B>."  Actually, there is no worldwide average, only a few industrial countries have any data at all.  The disease is frequently overlooked, individuals die in nursing homes, doctors do not put it on the death certificate at the family's request, and no one wants to do the confirming autopsy.  CJD deaths from corneal transplants, pituitary extracts, growth hormone, blood transfusions, and rabies vaccines are called "friendly fire" by one physician.<P>
∂10:  now, patronizingly, we are "fielding an increasing number of phone calls from [Oops, skip to  page 10] <B>anxious</B> people."<P>
∂12.  silly "<B>worried</B>" people are assured by deputy state epidemiologist that there is no evidence justifying a switch to a vegetarian diet.<P>
∂13 Oregon Health Division, USDA, and Everett Koop "are trying to<B> rein in public concern</B>."  Last sentence of paragraph: emotionally over-wrought  "people who have lost loved ones aren't sure there is not a connection."<P>
∂14-17.  a highly personalized account of a 47-year old Corvallis man who died in his prime from CJD.  His widow describes him as a frequent patron of <BLINK><B>fast-food hamburger</B></BLINK> establishments.

Ä Research by Richard Marsh of the University of Madison, Wisconsin, strongly suggests that
outbreaks of encephalopathy in mink during recent decades (there have been 20 in all) were caused by feeding them meat from infected sheep or cows. Dr Marsh also thinks that some cases in America were spread to mink from cows that died on the hoof in the 1960s; if so, then very low levels of BSE could have long existed in America--though that has never been officially accepted. Most, if not all, encephalopathies also seem able to move to a new species if an animal gets a large enough dose.

Ä Dr. Joseph Gibbs of the National Institutes of Health in the U.S. 
believes that a cattle TSE may exist in the US already.  Dr. Gibbs has speculated  transmissible spongiform encephalopathies  (TSE)  in many species may occur spontaneously at an extremely low level world wide.

Cattle in US definitely have BSE and it has been transmitted to mink farms, as per U. Wisconsin veterinary scientist RF Marsh.

<h3>"Most U.S. consumers <A NAME="trust">trust</A> beef to be safe"

<hr></h3>


   DENVER -- As Europeans try to contain a growing panic that mad cow disease in Britain can cause grave human illness, Americans seem to be staying calm and confident that the beef in their burgers is safe.<p>



   Cattle ranchers, packing houses and retailers say they've fielded only a few questions about the disease. And most consumers buttonholed Thursday insist they trust federal safety guidelines on beef processing.<p>



   "I think the people in this country are on top of what's going on with the beef and the meat," Earl Headley, 48, a visiting New Yorker said Thursday outside a downtown Chicago Burger King. "There are enough safeguards."<p>



   U.S. beef sales and prices have remained steady since March 20, when the British government said there may be a link between mad cow disease and the human equivalent, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is fatal.<p>



   The United States has not imported British beef since 1985. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has found no sign of the disease in American cattle, but says it will increase cattle testing as a precaution.<p>



   Representatives of Wendy's and McDonald's said they have not seen any effect in the United States. Grocers and beef producers say customers are not concerned about American beef, but whether the United States has imported any beef from Britain.<p>



   Employees at Cincinnati-based Kroger, the nation's largest supermarket operator, have handled about four consumer calls, said Jack Partridge, a group vice president.<p>



   "Really, the inquiries have just been, 'Do we import beef from England?' The answer is no," Partridge said.<p>



   Tom Schilder, a Kroger meat department manager in Columbus, Ohio, said he hasn't heard any questions from customers. "In fact, our sales have been steadily increasing the past few days," he said.<p>



   Rick McCarty of the Englewood, Colo.-based National Cattlemen's Beef Association said, "We just don't see any consumer reaction, nor do we see a reaction in the cattle market or from producers.<p>



   "Any time you have a tremendous amount of media coverage on some issue related to food, there is always going to be a period where there is a ripple of nervousness.<p>



   "I think it's always the case that people go, 'Ooh, that's kind of scary,' then good sense takes over and they say, 'Well, not really,"' McCarty said.<p>



   Mad cow disease, officially known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, first appeared in Britain's herds about 10 years ago. It is an extremely rare degenerative disease that affects the brains and central nervous systems of cattle.<p>



   Scientists believe cattle got the disease by eating feed that contained sheep tissue added as a protein supplement. Sheep are susceptible to a similar brain disease called scrapie.<p>



   The U.S. livestock industry voluntarily stopped using cattle feed made from sheep several years ago, although sheep protein is used in some items, such as pet food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering a ban on that feed now.<p>



   Beef parts also are used in dozens of other American products, from cosmetics to candy to gelatins to drugs for diabetes, hay fever and arthritis. But scientists say the disease scare should affect none of them.<p>



   "The public health risk is about as close to zero as you can get," Russell Cross, director of the Institute of Food Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University, said Thursday.<p>



   At a downtown Denver food court, the Thursday lunchtime crowd dined on a variety of foods with beef ingredients. One casually dressed man in his 30s, who refused to give his name, said, "I've heard about it, and I hope to God this hamburger isn't affected."<p>



   Then he bit into a Whopper.<p>

<H4><CENTER>UW SCIENTIST SAYS MAD COWS ARE NO JOKE</CENTER></H4>

Capital Times ... March 23, 1996<BR>
By: Mike Ivey The Capital Times<P>

The  TV  footage  this week of sickly, flopping cows being fork-lifted into
incinerators   was   enough   to  turn  the  stomachs  of  even  occasional
Quarter-Pounder eaters like myself.
   It's  also  the last thing the beleaguered U.S. beef industry needs, new
research  out  of  Britain showing a link between ``mad cow disease'' and a
similar fatal brain disease in humans.<P>

    Even  comic  Jay Leno found the story of British ``mad cow mania'' made
ripe fodder for his own brand of timely humor.
   ``Two  jokes  on  mad  cow  disease  in  one night, unbelievable,'' said
Richard  Marsh,  a  University  of Wisconsin veterinarian and animal health
specialist.<P>

   But  Marsh  will  take  the publicity wherever he can find it. He's been
sounding  the  alarm  over  mad  cow disease for years -- and <STRONG>fighting USDA
officials</STRONG> who say his concerns are unfounded in this country.
   Marsh  is  <STRONG>one  of  the  nation's  top  authorities</STRONG> on bovine spongiform
encephalopothy  (BSE), the scientific name for mad cow disease. It's called
mad  cow  disease  because it attacks the brain of cattle, causing seizures
that makes it appear the animal is crazed. It's always fatal.<P>

   Marsh  coordinated  a conference on BSE in Madison in 1993, the first of
its  kind held in the United States. And he's continued to follow the issue
closely through the European and scientific press.
   While  no  cases  have  yet  surfaced here, mad cow disease has proven a
legitimate threat to the beef industry in British, where 900 to 1,000 cases
a week were reported in 1992-93. That has since declined to about 300 cases
in January of this year.<P>

   The  concern  now is that eating meat from diseased cows can lead humans
to  develop  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  Disease  (CJD),  a  rare brain ailment that
usually affects older men, often mimicking Alzheimer's disease.
   Ten  new  cases  of  Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease have surfaced recently in
people under age 42 in Scotland, leading researchers to suspect a link does
exist  between  the  human and animal versions. The British Health Minister
said  Wednesday  that  consumption  of beef years ago was ``the most likely
explanation'' for the outbreak.<P>

   In  the  U.S.,  concerns over mad cow disease have been limited to Marsh
and a few members of the anti-beef crowd, including activist Jeremy Rifkin.
   Marsh,  himself  a  beef-eater,  maintains  his interest in the issue is
limited  to  worries  over  animal  health.  But he says anything that gets
people to pay attention to the threat to U.S. livestock is OK.<P>

   ``I  hope  this  will  be the impetus to get the USDA to take a stronger
look,'' he says.
   The immediate problem, says Marsh, is that many farmers today supplement
cattle  feed  with  meat and bone meal, usually made from cattle and sheep.
The high-protein feed is said to raise growth rates and milk production.
   But  feed  made  from  sheep  bones can transmit scrapie, a degenerative
nervous disease in animals that is similar to BSE.<P>

   Marsh  has  called  for  a  ban  on  animal-based protein supplements or
requirements  to  label  those  products. He says soy or fish-based protein
supplements  are  just  as good, and much safer. But those efforts have met
strong opposition from the livestock industry.<P>

   ``<B>You'd  be  surprised at the pressure these commodity groups can put on
regulators</B>,'' he said.<P>

   Well, not too surprised.
   The  U.S. beef industry has long benefited from corporate welfare in the
form of taxpayer subsidies for grazing and water. That's why McDonald's and
Hardee's can sell their hamburgers so cheap.
   Price, after all, has little to do with good taste.

Standard dark mink were inoculated with coded brain homogenates from 2 British cows affected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or a third cow from a farm with no history of BSE or feeding ruminant-derived, rendered by-products. Each homogenate was inoculated intracerebrally into separate groups of mink and a pool of the 3 was fed to a fourth group. Neurological signs were seen in mink an average of 12 months after intracerebral inoculation and 15 months after feeding. Decreased appetite, lethargy and mild to moderate pelvic limb ataxia were the main clinical signs, quite unlike the classical clinical picture of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME). Microscopic changes in brain sections of most affected mink were those of scrapie-like spongiform encephalopathy. Vascular change in grey matter neuropil was accompanied by prominent astrocytosis. Varying markedly in severity from one mink to another, the degenerative changes were found in the cerebral cortex, dorsolateral gyri of the frontal lobe, corpus striatum, diencephalon and brain stem. Although resembling TME, the encephalopathy was distinguishable from it by less extensive changes in the cerebral cortex, by more severe changes in the caudal brainstem and by sparing of the hippocampus. These results extend the host range of the BSE agent and show for the first time the experimental oral infection of mink with a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy agent from a naturally infected ruminant species.

Variation in the primary amino acid sequence of prion protein (PrP) has previously been found to be associated with changes in the incubation period of subacute spongiform encephalopathies. The PrP gene from 65 cattle representing 14 breeds was analysed by the polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Two PrP alleles, differing in the number of octapeptide repeats, were found. The predominant genotype was homozygous for 6 octapeptide repeats. Few individuals (8) were found to be heterozygous for these repeats, and only 1 animal was homozygous for the 5 octapeptide repeat allele.

Department of Animal Health and Biomedical Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA. 

Inoculation of the Stetsonville, Wisconsin source of transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) into Syrian hamsters has identified 2 strains of the TME agent having distinct biological properties and producing disease-specific prion proteins (PrP<sup(TME)>) having different physicochemical properties. Although several strains of the sheep scrapie agent have been identified in Great Britain, this is the first indication that agents producing transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in the USA also are capable of producing distinct strains.

The black ferret (Mustela putorius furo) and the closely related mink (Mustela visa) showed differences in susceptibility to challenge with the Stetson transmissible mink encephalopathy agent: the incubation period was longer in ferrets (28-38 months) than in mink (4 months). Western blot analysis detected no differences between ferret and mink prion proteins (PrP). Northern blot analysis of ferret brain RNA indicated that PrP mRNA abundance is similar in infected and uninfected animals. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of PCR amplified PrP coding regions of the PrP genes identified 6 silent base changes and 2 amino acid changes between mink and ferret: Phe<right arrow>Lys at codon 179 and Arg<right arrow>Gln at codon 224, respectively. These changes may indicate the region of PrP that is responsible for the species barrier effect between mink and ferret.

Cattle are susceptible to experimental infection with the Stetsonville isolate of the transmissible mink encephalopathy (TME) agent. Susceptibility to other TME isolates was investigated in 2 groups of calves inoculated intracerebrally with the homogenate of mink brain containing the Hayward or the Blackfoot isolates. A third group was inoculated with a brain homogenate from a steer infected with the Stetsonville isolate in its primary cattle passage and a fourth group was inoculated with a pool of brain homogenate from the 3 cattle experimentally infected with a sheep and goat scrapie agent in its primary cattle passage. Clinical signs of neurological disease appeared in each steer of every group between 15 and 25 months after inoculation. An encephalopathy characterized by severe spongiform change and pronounced astrocytosis occurred in the 3 groups inoculated with the TME agent. The neurohistological changes in the steers inoculated with the cattle-passaged scrapie agent were slight and subtle. Analysis of the octapeptide repeat region of the bovine protease-resistant protein (PrP) gene showed that variations in incubation period, clinical signs, and neurohistological changes were unrelated to the homozygous or heterozygous condition of 6 or 6/5 octapeptide repeats. <P>

    WASHINGTON, May 20, 1996--Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and 
Acting
USTR Charlene Barshefsky announced today that the Dispute Settlement Body 
of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) has established a panel to examine the
European Union's ban on imports of beef from animals raised with benefit 
of
growth hormones.<P>

    In commenting on today's action, Ambassador Barshefsky said, "We are
very pleased that the Dispute Settlement Body has established a panel to
hear our long-standing complaint.  <B>The EU Hormone Directive has no
legitimate basis</B> and we believe the panel will find the Directive 
violates
the EU's obligations under the WTO agreements.  Our pursuit of this 
dispute
underscores the Administration's firm commitment to eliminate unfair 
trade
practices that restrict U.S. exports."<P>

    The EU directive has severely restricted exports of U. S. beef to the
continent.  When <B>the EU imposed the ban in 1989</B>, the United States 
attempted
to challenge it under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but the 
EU blocked the establishment of an experts group to examine the Directive. 
Under new WTO rules, the EU can no longer block the establishment of a
panel.<P>

USDA Secretary Dan Glickman also commended the WTO for establishing a
panel today, stating, "The evidence is overwhelming that proper use of 
these
hormones poses no danger to human or animal health.  Even scientific 
groups
composed by the EU have found that these <B>hormones are safe when used
properly</B>.  We hope that the panel process will lead to a re-opening of 
the
EU market to U.S. beef -- which would benefit consumers and producers on
both sides of the Atlantic."<P>

    The U.S. requested consultations on this matter with the EU -- the
first step in the WTO dispute settlement process -- on January 26, 1996. 
Consultations were held in Geneva on March 27, 1996, with Australia, 
Canada
and New Zealand joining the United States.  Because these consultations
failed to produce a resolution, the United States decided to request a
dispute settlement panel.  The panel will hear the arguments of both 
sides
and <B>report its findings around the end of this year.</B><P>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Recombinant">Recombinant</A> bovine growth hormone: EU bans imports of US beef</CENTER></H3>

 A EU scientific committee recently concluded that there is no
scientific evidence that beef from rBGH treated cattle pose any
health risks. The ban is still upheld -- 'waiting for further
scientific evaluation'. With the present turmoil of
the European beef market, a total collapse could be predicted
if it was lifted now or in the close future. Many European consumers
would not touch anything treated with growth hormones, like it or not.<P>
 
It is a present WTO issue, because EU according
to the agreement can only base a ban on scientifically proved health
hazards, not on fear of consumer reactions. Don't even mention
politico-economical reasons, although obvious they are taboo.<P>

<CENTER><H4><A NAME="Hormones">Hormones</A> in US Beef: Europe not likely to lift ban</H4></CENTER>

Copyright 1996 by <A HREF="mailto:101505,350@compuserve.com">Jan Braakman</A><P>

The Europeans are not impressed by the decision of the US secretary of
Agriculture Dan Glickman to make a complaint against the European Union at the
World Trade Organization.  
Glickman says that the European Union violates international trade-agreements by
the boycott of US beef that is produced with the use of certain natural hormones
that are implanted or injected. The only valid reason to ban the US meat could
be a risk for the public health, Glickman says. "US meat producers an exporters
should be assured that our government will not allow bad science to be used as a
non-tariff barrier. We will use every tool available to us to ensure that our
exports are treated fairly in foreign markets."<P>


The conflict between the US and Europe could escalate into a trade-war. But
Glickman doesn't want that. The minister's personal advisor Paul Drazek has said
that his department continues to lodge a complaint at the World Trade
Organization. But there's no reason yet to take countermeasures, Drazek told
European reporters in january. In an official statement Glickman stated that the
complaint "underscores the US government's determination to end this
long-standing unfair trade practice and restore access for US meat exporters to
this important market." <P>

Allthough Argentina, Canada, New Zealand and other beef producing countries
protested against the European ban, that also hurts them, only the US lodged a
complaint at the WTO.<P>


Although even European scientists claim that - when used properly - natural
hormones are no threat to the public health, European Agriculture Commissioner
Franz Fischler still opposes the use of natural hormones in beef. And he refuses
to allow US meat on the European market.<P>

The most important reason to confront the US is that consumers and farmers in
Europe don't want steak with hormones. There is no scientific proof that the
so-called natural hormones - that are synthetically produced - could damage the
public health. But the public opinion in Europe - especially in the northern
European countries - is firmly against any use of artificial growth stimulators,
although they might not harm the human health at all. 
<P>
Organizations for the protection of animals claim that hormones do harm the
animals. At a special conference in Brussels last year they reported that some
of the hormones could cause cancer in the  animals. That argument is taken
seriously by the European ministers of agriculture who are working on different
laws for what is named 'animal's well-being'. The well-being of animals is a
political issue in Europe that has to be taken seriously. Especially in the
United Kingdom the public seem to be opposed to any form of industrialized
stock-raising.<P>

Since the early seventies the European Union has officially banned the use of
synthetic growth stimulators. Despite of the ban, the use of those illegal
products have been very popular especially for the production of veal and beef.
The use of for instance clenbuterol seemed to be very profitable.
Government-studies in the Netherlands claimed that the income for a farmer could
rise about $ 100 to $ 200 per animal. The profits of the trade in the illegal
growth-stimulator clenbuterol are higher than the profits in trading heroin or
cocaine - and the risks for the trader are a lot less, a Dutch prosecutor stated
at court, where traders and users of clenbuterol were convicted to fines and
imprisonment.<P>

Due to the high profits the trade in illegal hormones and other growth
stimulators is in hands of criminal organizations. Inspectors of the national
criminal investigations departments confront sometimes violent members. The
Belgian inspector Karel van Noppen was killed early 1995. There seems to be no
doubt that the so-called hormone-mob has to do with the killing. Last weekend
(May 26) the French police arrested a suspect: a Belgian illegal arms trader,
who might have delivered the weapon that killed Van Noppen.


The arms trader is together with an conspirator the main suspect in the killing
of Van Noppen. Acoording to sources in the Belgian justice, both suspects accuse
each other of having pulled the trigger.
Both arms traders have connections in the drugs scene as well as in the beef
maffia,  Belgian newspaper say.<P>

Statistics hardly mention the illegal use of natural hormones in Europe.
Although farmers and government inspectors are certain they are used. The
problem is that it is very hard to proof for a criminal court the natural
hormones are used. No scientist is able to certify that the amount of natural
hormones found in an animal are certainly and without any doubt the effect of
injections or implantations. Only when implantations or injection-spots are
found on the meat, the proof is given. <P>

It might be even more difficult to keep American beef out of the European Union.
In February 1996 customs officers detecten a large amount of American beef at
the harbour in Antwerp, that was illegally imported. Customs confiscate tons of
beef. Six people were arrested. Officially the destination of the beef was
outside the European Union, but most of it came on the European market. The
importers not only violated the European regulations on hormone free beef, they
also evaded import levys and value added tax for at least 60 million dollars.<P>

Legalizing hormones wouldn't make an end to the malpractices. The fifteen
ministers of agriculture in the European Union gathered in January 1996. They
are convinced that legalizing hormones is the wrong way. "Even an American
procedure at the panel of the World Trade Organization wouldn't change our
minds", the Austrian commissioner Franz Fischler said. The European Parliament
in Strasbourg is outspoken against legalization.<HR>

 (CNN) March 22, 1996     From Correspondent Eugenia Halsey<P>
WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If you are in the United States and
                    in the mood for a big fat juicy burger, go ahead,
indulge. That's
                    the word from the Department of Agriculture a day after news
                    about infected British beef triggered off an
international scare. 

     Many U.S. ranchers see an opportunity in this rejection of British beef. 

 "We would love to send 'em (Europeans) some wholesome, clean, American
beef ...
     to help 'em with their current problems," said Colorado rancher Scott
Johnson. <P>

     But that is not expected to happen anytime soon. The European Union<STRONG> has
banned
     U.S. beef because it often contains hormones</STRONG>. <P>
 Glickman said he doesn't believe the "mad cow disease" issue is
necessarily going to
     affect American beef sales abroad.  But that doesn't mean the United States isn't going to try. It will
seek to persuade Europe to lift the ban. Now, says Glickman, they even have a good argument:  American beef is safe.<P>

<H4>Beef farmer in <A NAME="Ireland-EU">Ireland-EU</A> writes:</H4>

"The EU ban on hormones is not scientifically based. It is a political
decision taken to keep 'The Greens' in Europe happy. For years we have been
forced to produce meat at without the aid of 'meat quality enhancers' (a
more consumer friendly term).This has increased the cost of producing beef.
<P>
As far as I am aware there was never a residues found in any meat - imported
or EU produced that would cause a threat to the consumer - of any of the
legal hormones. There have been incidences of illegal growth promoters
abused ansd some high residues found.
>Appreciate either answer or pointer to online links with answer.
<P>
We here in Ireland produce"wholesome, clean, Irish beef" which we are trying
to sell to the UK and others. The problem is that beef consumption across
Europe has fallen between 10% and 40%. Each country is promoting it's own
beef as clean and healthy and the reduction in consumption means that each
country in now self sufficient in beef. There is no roon for imports within
the EU and probably no room for imports from outside. <P>

I have no problem with Americian beef. From visits to the states I can say
that the best steaks I have eaten were in Colorado. The consumer here in the
EU has a thing about healthy food. The consumer pays dearly for that food
directly and indirectly. To the consumer the word 'hormone' sets off alarm
bells. We all have a job on our hands to reassure the consumer that the food
we produce is safe.<P>
<HR>

"<A NAME="This">This</A> has been an interesting irony to me for some time. There is no
credible scientific evidence that any of the US-used growth promotants
(please note they are not hormones) cause any problems in beef. It's a
commonly held view in the US that the UK was just using this trumped up
issue to protect their own beef market from US imports.
 
The irony is that others in the EU now used the same approach, but with
bSE as the purported human health risk, against the UK to protect the
domestic markets in Germany and France. The phrase "hoisted on their own
petard" comes to mind.<P>

"Germany was a leader in this.  Germany has quite a history of 
"pure food" philosophy, going back to the Reinheitsgebot (pure beer law) 
going back to 1515 or something like that.  As I recall (I was living in 
Germany from 88-93), there was also a major scandal because of illegal 
hormone feeding of veal calves by a major meat packer.<P>

Germans insist this is based on health and personal preference reasons, 
Americans insist it is a pseudo trade barrier, and each seems to be 
firmly convinced the other has the illogical position.<P>

The Germans lost in the EU on the pure beer law, for the reason that 
other countries were able to persuade the regulating agency that the 
purity law was being used as a trade barrier.  However, it sounds like 
the EU as a whole is embracing the same rationale they rejected in 
another case."<HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Canadian">Canadian</A> Beef Banned Too</CENTER></H3>

In Canada bovine somatotropin (BST) is not permitted. Also Clenbuterol is
banned, though there have been a few cases where it has been
detected after illegal use.<P>
 
The hormonal preparations permitted are used as growth promotants -
anabolic agents which increase feed efficiency and accelerate
attainment of market weight -  being in large part endogenous hormones
such as estradiol and progesterone or testosterone. These are implanted
subcutaneously in the ear.<P>
 
Canadian beef is also banned by the EU because of the use of hormones
and this is currently under appeal.<HR>

<H3><CENTER>UK <A NAME="Consumer">Consumer</A> does not want hormones in their
beef</CENTER></H3>

As a UK beef farmer (Northern Ireland) I would be in my own mind happy that
there are hormones that would not affect the safety of beef.  Its not really
the safety issue that is at stake here althought the EU may well use it as a
front.<P>
The fact is that the consumer here does not want hormones in their
beef.  In the UK we have a particulary fussy customer who insists on the
very highest standards of animal welfare, enviromental awareness and most
of all NOTHING added to the "natural" diet of a beef animal.  Most farmers
in Northern Ireland operate under a "Farm Qulaity Assurance Scheme" which
insists that the animals diet must be grass based.  <P>
Insprectors make
unannounced checks to make sure you are not feeding animals any supplements
that they might consider inappropriate.  They also check on the welfare if
the animals and the enviornemntal friendlyness of the farm.  Because we have
this system in Northern Ireland our beef is very popular all over Europe
(particularly in Holland) were it is marketed under the "Greenfields label".<P>

We export 80% of our beef so naturally our beef industry is in deep crisis.
It is the view of most farmers here that since the market is already
saturated there would be little advantage in increasing supply with hormones
when consumers do not want it.  The people who run the quality scheme have said that even if the EU
allow hormones to be used any one doing so will be removed from the scheme. Obviously hormone beef can be produced cheaper and therefore could be seen
as representing unfair competition.  <P>

 <H3><CENTER>US <A NAME="Milk">Milk</A> and milk products not banned</CENTER></H3>

The ban on US beef is because of the use of growth hormones such as
clembuterol [an anabolic steroid].  The EU Commission takes the view that there is
scientific evidence of a hazard to health,
justifying a ban even under GATT,  but this is disputed by the US
Government. There was speculation that the case
would be taken to the World Trade Commission.<P>

The EU ban on US beef is not because of bovine somatotropin(BST) or
consequent IGF-1, and there is no ban on US milk or milk products,
despite the moratorium until December 1999 on the use of BST in the EU
countries. This is because of GATT implications.<P>
 
In view of the favourable Scientific Report delivered by the
European Committee on Veterinary Medicinal Products
(CVMP), and the European Commission themselves accepting that the use
of BST does not create a human health hazard, there is no scientific
basis on which imports of milk or milk products from BST treated cows
could be banned.  The EU Commission have indicated that the long-term
moratorium does not include a ban on such milk or milk products imports from USA or other
countries where BST is in use.<P>
<HR>
<I>Listserve item, 29 May 96:</I><P>
About the EU beef ban: The European Union doesn't want to import beef that is
produced in a way that is considered unsafe by the public nor  in
an illegal way according  to European law. As a politician said: it is not
because the meat is unsafe to eat, but it is because my voters don't want it.<P>

Milk production stimulating BST (bovine somatotropin) [also known as recombinant
bovine growth hormone] is not allowed in Europe. Reasons are partly economical
(we don't need to produce more milk in Europe), partly because of uncertainties
about health problems for the animal.<HR>

 Sir, <BR>
Mothers with babies are in a painful dilemma. With cow's milk
     discounted as an option for feeding babies (reports, May 28) they are
     forced to choose between breast feeding and baby formula milk ≠ when <STRONG>both
     are contaminated with chemicals</STRONG> that can mimic hormones and affect the
     future health of their child. 

     In the case of breast milk we know that levels of <STRONG>dioxin</STRONG> exceed the World
     Health Organisation standards by more than ten times. With baby formula
     milk exposure to phthalates averages between two and three times the
     precautionary limits set by the EC Scientific Committee on Food.
Infants are
     being exposed at levels of the same order of those known to cause
    <STRONG> reproductive damage in rats</STRONG>. <P>

     When we are experimenting with the health of our children surely the
     Government must urgently impose tough regulations on those chemicals that
     are known to mimic hormones. In some cases this will inevitably mean
     banning or phasing-out their use, but the short-term inconvenience to the
     chemical industry would be a small price to pay. <P>

     Yours faithfully, <BR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Fears">Fears</A> over chemicals in milk </CENTER></H3>
BY NIGEL HAWKES 
                           SCIENCE EDITOR <P>

 WORRIED mothers who abandon bottle-feeding because of the discovery
     in baby milk of traces of chemicals which might affect the fertility of
boys
     may be doing do their babies no favours. Studies have shown that breast
     milk contains traces of chemicals that may be at least as dangerous as
those
     found in infant formulae. <P>

     The chemicals are different ≠ phthalates in formula milk, and dioxins
in breast
     milk ≠ but both belong to the group of chemicals suspected of mimicking the
     behaviour of natural hormones. Exposure to them in the womb or in the first
     few weeks of life may affect the sexual development of children, especially
     boys. <P>

     Scandinavian scientists have claimed that one in ten women have such high
     levels of dioxin in their bodies that they should breast-feed for only
a few
     weeks at most. But the Department of Health, supported by advice from the
     Committee on the Toxicology of Chemicals, argues that they present no
     hazard. <P>

     The department says breast is still best, in spite of the dioxins. The
chemicals
     are produced by incinerating household waste and are in all our bodies, as
     are other long-lived chemicals, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). <P>

     The fear that these chemicals may have subtle and previously unsuspected
     effects has turned toxicology on its head. As poisons, they are present in
     food at levels far below those which would cause damage. But as disrupters
     of the hormone system in the womb, or the first few months of life, they
     could do damage at much lower levels. The committee's advice is that
     although <B>breast-fed babies can receive big doses of dioxins -- up to ten
times
     the tolerable daily intake</B> --  in the early months of life, this is
irrelevant over a
     whole lifetime. <P>

     But, at a recent meeting at Lancaster University, Dr Michael DeVito of the
     US Environmental Protection Agency said this approach ignored the
     "window of sensitivity" to the hormone-disrupters, according to the
     newsletter of Environmental Data Services. Whether such a window exists is
     disputed. Animal experiments and studies of fish in contaminated rivers
     suggest that some chemicals can affect sexual development. But the
potential
     culprits are many ≠ probably thousands.<P>
 To focus only on phthalates and
     only on baby formulae misses the point. For example, tinned vegetables
     contain bisphenol-A, another potential disrupter. There are traces in the
     environment of the breakdown products of DDT and PCBs, both prime
     suspects. The fact that phthalates may be present in gravy browning or in
     coffee whitener is a side-issue because they are not eaten by infants.<P> 

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Baby">Baby</A> milk formulas contain phthalate
                         </CENTER></H3>
             BY NICK NUTTALL, ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT... The Times ...May28, 1996<P>

     THE baby milk formulas at the centre of the current scare are made mainly
     from cows' milk with some manufactured from the curds and whey and
     others based on casein, the milk's protein. A small number are also made
     from soya beans. <P>

     The formulas then have vitamins, fats, minerals and other essential
elements
     added or taken away so that the final, dried product mimics human mother's
     milk. <STRONG>Phthalates, the group of chemicals implicated in contaminating the
     formulas</STRONG>, are man-made. They have been used in a wide variety of industrial
     materials linked with the plastics industry for many years. <P>

     The chemicals have been put into special inks used to print on wrappers,
     labels and other packaging materials. They allow the inks to be flexible so
     they stick to wrappers without fracturing and flaking off. Phthalates
have also
     been put in cellophane, plastic tubing used in industrial plants and
plastic
     storage containers. <P>

     Gwynne Lyons, scientific adviser to the World Wide Fund for Nature and
     an <STRONG>expert on oestrogen-mimicking chemicals</STRONG>, said yesterday that research in
     America had also detected the chemicals in crops. 
     Ms Lyons said: "The levels found are probably cumulative. A bit from the
     field, a bit from the processing and a bit from other sources." 

     She said that concern about phthalates was part of a wider concern
     surrounding up to 60,000 chemicals linked with a declining sperm count in
     the West and other environmental effects. <P>
  Scientists tested 59 samples from 15 brands and all were found to contain
     phthalates. Nine brands were said to contain levels of the chemicals
close to
     those found to<STRONG> damage the testicles of baby rats</STRONG>. <P>

    <I>Four manufacturers dominate a market worth £134 million a year in
     Britain, including follow-on formulas, ready-to-feed milks and soya-based
     milks. The leaders are SMA Nutrition (37 per cent market share), Cow
     & Gate (37 per cent), Farleys (15 per cent) and Milupa (8 per cent). </I><P>

<STRONG>Do something different?</STRONG> Government scientists, the baby milk industry and independent bodies such
     as the National Childbirth Trust and the Health Visitors' Association
say they
     should keep to their current feeding patterns, using the same brand and
     dosage. <P>


    <STRONG> Is one brand better than another? </STRONG>

     This is difficult because the Government refuses to publish the names of
     brands containing high levels of phthalates. Experts suggest that most, and
     possibly all, are affected to some extent. Powdered milk made abroad is no
     safer. Formulas on sale in Britain are made here, the Republic of Ireland,
     France and Germany. Soya-based
milks also were found to be affected.<P>


<STRONG>     Should older babies drink cows' milk? </STRONG>

     Mainstream thinking is that only babies of a year or more should drink
     cows' milk. It is not regarded as suitable for the newly born as it
lacks iron,
     vitamins and other essential nutrients. <P>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Concern">Concern</A> grows over suspect baby milk </CENTER></H3>
 BY RUSSELL JENKINS 
                         AND NICK NUTTALL ... The Times ...May 26, 1996<P>
 
     THOUSANDS of anxious parents rang baby-milk manufacturers' helplines
     yesterday, demanding to know if their products are safe. 

     At the same time ministers and government scientists stepped in to try to
     calm increasing public concern over the effects of the milk on the future
     fertility of boy babies. Doctors expect to be inundated today with
inquiries
     from mothers desperate for information. <P>


     Ministers refused yesterday to bow to criticism of their refusal to
name the
     15 brands that tests have shown to contain <STRONG>gender-bending chemicals</STRONG>, called
     phthalates, at levels that could be high enough to reduce fertility. When
     similar levels of the chemicals were administered to baby rats in tests
by the
     Medical Research Council their <STRONG>testicles were damaged and sperm counts
     reduced.</STRONG> <P>


     The Ministry of Agriculture stood by its decision not to publish the
results of
     its own research. Dr Jeremy Metters, the Government's Deputy Chief
     Medical Officer, claimed in a statement that there was no cause for alarm.
     He urged mothers to carry on using their usual brands of infant formula. <P>


     Tim Boswell, an Agriculture Minister, said on Radio 4's World at One: "We
     are in the business of being open with the public, giving them the
facts which
     are relevant, and I hope they will respond by accepting that ... if we say
     things are safe, that is what we mean." <P>


     The Government received support from Dr Richard Sharpe, Britain's most
     respected <STRONG>expert on sex-changing chemicals</STRONG>. Dr Sharpe, of Edinburgh's
     MRC Reproductive Biology Unit, said the controversy was needlessly
     alarmist, adding: "Infants are not at any significant risk from formula
     baby-milk powder because of the presence of low levels of phthalates which
     may have weak oestrogen activity." <P>


     The formula-milk industry, worth more than £134 million a year, was
     surprised by the level of public concern generated by newspaper reports.
     The Infant and Dietetic Foods Association, which represents the industry,
     said last night that there was <B>no need for the Government to identify the
     contaminated brands</B> because it was already acknowledged as an
     industry-wide problem. <P>

     Several of the chemicals, including detergents, plastic additives,
pesticides
     and the by-products of incineration, have been accused of <STRONG>mimicking the
     female hormone oestrogen</STRONG> in laboratory tests. Other chemicals appear to
     block the male, androgen, hormones to cause a similar feminising effect. <P>


     Researchers around the world have linked these chemicals to an<B> increase in
     cases of undescended testes, a lowering of sperm counts and a rise in
female
     breast cancer</B>. 
<HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="EPA">EPA</A> proposes looser pesticide tests</CENTER></H3>
 WASHINGTON (Reuter) -- The
     Environmental Protection Agency said
     Tuesday it was proposing easing its
     scrutiny of hazard tests on some
     low-risk pesticides by <STRONG>allowing
     manufacturers to vouch for the accuracy</STRONG>
     of the product studies they submit to the
     agency.<P>


     The new policy would allow companies applying to register products that had
     previously been registered by the original manufacturer "to certify
that acute toxicity
     studies submitted to the agency in support of registration were
conducted properly
     and that the reported toxicity category for each is accurate," the EPA
said.<P>

     Studies on the long-term effects of products, such as their potential
for causing
     cancer or birth defects, would remain under close watch, Heier said.

     The goal of the new policy is to allow the agency to shift resources to
"areas that
     have the potential to deliver greater overall public health
protection," the EPA said.<P>

     TAKE two cows. One is a marvel of high-tech farming. It lolls in the straw
in a giant shed at a farm-research centre outside London. It has been bred by
artificial insemination and vaccinated against a variety of diseases. Once a
year it has antibiotics inserted up its teats. Round its neck is an electronic
signalling device which opens its personal feed-bin. This animal produces
12,000kg (over 25,000lb) of milk every year, roughly twice as much as Britain's
average dairy cow.<P>

     The other, nonchalantly chewing the cud on an organic farm in Oxfordshire,
is surrounded by a circle of admirers. For today the farm is open to the
public. Visitors, worried by the recent mad-cow scare, have flocked from miles
around. This cow was sired by a live bull, not a pipette. It eats no
manufactured feed, and its blood is free from drugs. Crops grown on the farm
are fertilised by its manure, not by some chemical cocktail. The trouble is
that the milk produced by this cow is more expensive than intensively farmed
milk. Many visitors may be inspired by the cow's back-to-nature feeeling. Fewer
will buy its milk.<P>
     That is the dilemma confronting consumers throughout the world. Increasing
numbers of people in rich countries have doubts about modern farming methods.
But few, so far, are willing to give up the cheap food these methods have
brought. Even fewer consumers in developing countries are willing to make the
sacrifice, for farming technology has saved millions of them from starvation.<P>
     In the 1970s, when world food prices last reached a peak, many pundits
argued that mass starvation was imminent because the world's population was
growing so fast. Like Thomas Malthus, the 19th-century economist who first made
the argument, they were proved wrong. They failed to take account of the "green
revolution" in farm productivity. Farmers throughout the world began to apply
pesticides and fertilisers to their crops. Irrigation allowed barren lands to
bloom. Scientists devised more productive strains of cereals.<P>
     The result has been a steady increase in yields (in Asia, wheat yields
rose fivefold between 1961 and 1991); a long-run trend of falling food prices
(see chart on next page); and a fall in the number of people classed by the
United Nations as chronically undernourished (from 942 million in 1970 to a
still-awful 786 million in 1990).<P>

     So how seriously should the detractors of modern farming (many of them
rich- world lobby groups) be taken? Their many criticisms can be separated into
three main strands: that food from high-tech farms is bad for people's health,
that intensive farming damages the environment, and that it is bad for animal
welfare. Consider each of these points in turn. Unhealthy?<P>
     On one level the answer to the first criticism is simple. Without modern
farming technology more people would be starving today. Without it more people
would be suffering from deadly illnesses (the pasteurisation of milk, for
example, has cut the incidence of tuberculosis and scarlet fever). Even today,
inadequate nutrition contributes to horrible illnesses in poor countries. Every
year, according to IFPRI, the International Food Policy Research Institute in
Washington, DC, 250,000-500,000 children go blind due to vitamin-A deficiency.<P>
     There is no doubt, however, that some illnesses can be linked to modern
farming methods. In particular, manufactured animal feeds have probably helped
spread salmonella food poisoning and BSE (mad-cow disease). Meat and bone meal,
for example, have long been used in animal feeds for herbivores such as cows
because they are high in protein. Yet many scientists reckon that BSE first
spread to cows as a result of their being fed on bits of sheep infected by
scrapie (and in Britain the problem may have been made worse by not boiling
down the feed at sufficiently high temperatures to destroy the infectious
agent).<P>
     The bacterium that causes salmonella (which sometimes kills people but
mostly just makes them sick) occurs naturally in chickens. But scientists
reckon that the infection may have been made worse in British chickens in the
1980s (as notoriously noted by the then junior health minister, Edwina Currie)
because they were fed bits of other infected chickens. Packing birds tightly
together in sheds probably helped salmonella spread even faster.<P>
     The way that food is handled and cooked, however, is as important as the
way that it is farmed. Both salmonella bacteria and E. coli (a bacterium which
recently caused a number of deaths in America when it got into hamburger mince)
can be killed by proper cooking. And many types of food contamination are as
likely to occur in organic as in intensively farmed food. Grains, nuts and
dried fruit, those favourites of natural-food addicts, frequently develop
moulds that make dangerous chemicals known as mycotoxins. "The worst cases of
poisoning I've come across are among health-food enthusiasts," says Tom
Sanders, professor of nutrition at King's College, London.<P>
     Another common complaint against intensively farmed food is that it is
     contaminated with pesticides or other farm chemicals. Yet regulations
throughout the rich world restrict the level of such chemical residues in food.
There is no evidence that chemicals applied within these limits will harm human
health, according to John Lupien, director of food and nutrition at the UN's
Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome.<P>
     As the alchemist Paracelsus observed, there are no poisons, only poisonous
doses. Virtually anything is toxic, provided you eat enough of it. In a recent
book called "But Is It True?"*, Aaron Wildavsky, until his death professor of
political science at the University of California, Berkeley, examined a series
of health scares in America. He started with the cranberry scare of 1959 when
the government seized over 1,400 tonnes of the fruit because of suspected
contamination by weed-killer. Looking closely at the scientific evidence,
Wildavsky argued that most such scares have been exaggerated. And many, he
said, were triggered by flawed experiments in which animals were given huge
doses of a chemical in the hope that this would help predict the effects of
minute doses on humans.<P>
     A lot of the suspicions that surround intensive-farming techniques boil
     down to a distrust of technology in general. For example, many consumers take
fright if they learn that their food has been irradiated with gamma rays, or
that their beef has been reared on growth hormones. Yet nutritionists scoff at
both these worries. A group of scientists brought together by FAO and the World
Health Organisation (WHO), for example, has concluded that irradiation is
perfectly safe, provided it is properly controlled. Giving food a short burst
of radiation can kill pathogens and prevent spoilage. The same technique is
often used to sterilise instruments in hospitals.<P>
     Another scientific commission organised by FAO and WHO concluded that
growth hormones were safe. It is true that animals given anabolic steroids,
such as testosterone, will build up their muscles more quickly (as will
drug-taking athletes). But provided that cattle are given correct doses of such
steroids, the amounts ingested by people will be too small to have any effect
on health.<P>
     So why are consumers not reassured? With irradiation, the explanation may
be the association in many people's minds with dodgy power stations and nuclear
bombs. And with growth hormones, farm politics may also play a part. The
European Union, for example, bans the use of growth hormones, ostensibly to
maintain "consumer confidence" in beef. American farmers--who are allowed to
use such hormones--say this is a ploy to keep their beef out of the European
market.<P>
     Destructive?
     The evidence that modern farming has hurt the environment is much stronger
than the evidence that it has damaged human health. Fertilisers and herbicides
are often washed off the land into rivers and reservoirs. Fertilisers contain
nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates which encourage algae to multiply.
Algal slime sometimes chokes waterways, killing plants and fish.<P>
     Environmentalists also link nitrates in the water supply to human
illnesses such as stomach cancer, though tough regulations throughout the rich
world ensure that quantities in water are too small to harm anyone.<P>
     These days environmentalists in rich countries are particularly concerned
about biotechnology. This new science, which allows direct manipulation of the
genetic make-up of plants and animals, may yet revolutionise farm productivity.
So far it has produced some modest gains such as the "Flav'r Sav'r" tomato in
America, which is designed to ripen more slowly than ordinary tomatoes. Though
an old-fashioned and long-winded form of genetic manipulation (ie, selective
breeding) has taken place for centuries, environmentalists worry about the
unforeseen consequences of this more powerful technique. After all, no one can
fully predict how organisms crafted in a laboratory will interact with existing
plants and animals.<P>
     In developing countries, meanwhile, the green revolution has had some un-
green side-effects. Irrigation, for example, has destroyed large tracts of land
as well as boosting crop yields. Without proper drainage, soils can become
waterlogged. Irrigation water can also deposit salts in the soil--and too much
salt can damage plants.<P>
     Excessive salinity is estimated to have a serious effect on the
productivity of 20 million-30 million hectares (80,000-120,000 square miles) of
land around the world (out of a total of around 220 million hectares of
irrigated land). Elsewhere, the huge amount of water needed for irrigation has
led to worries about scarcity, and even to fears of future wars over water. In
parts of southern India, water tables are estimated to have fallen by as much
as 25-30 metres in a decade.<P>
     Though chemical pesticides wiped out many pests in the early years of the
green revolution, some insects and fungi have evolved resistance. Other pests,
such as the brown plant-hopper, have thrived in some rice crops in Asia because
insecticides have killed off their natural predators. A problem of intensive
farming everywhere is its reliance on fewer varieties of plant or animal
(artificial insemination, for example, means that a single bull can father some
2,000 offspring each year). Reducing the genetic base in this way may boost
efficiency, but it also increases the risk that one type of pest will infest a
whole harvest.<P>
     Few would deny that modern agricultural technology has caused
environmental problems. The more perplexing question is how to solve them. Some
solutions can be borrowed from old-fashioned farming techniques. Planting a
number of different crop varieties, for instance, can help spread risks from
pests and diseases, and also block their progress once they get going. And many
farm- research bodies around the world are now trumpeting the idea of
"integrated pest management".<P>
     This involves using chemical pesticides only when absolutely necessary.
Breeding plants which are resistant to pests, and making more use of natural
predators to attack pests, is preferred. In Africa the mealy-bug--an insect
that destroys cassava--was eliminated in many countries by employing the
services of another insect, a small, parasitic wasp. According to Per
Pinstrup-Andersen of IFPRI, since Indonesian farmers switched to such a scheme
about a decade ago pesticide use has dropped by more than 60% and rice yields
have risen at least 40%.<P>
     At the same time, a full-scale switch to pre-green-revolutionary farming
methods would not only reduce food supply (and lead, in India alone, to 400
million people going hungry, according to IFPRI). It could also, argues Dr
Pinstrup-Andersen, damage the environment even more than the green revolution
itself. In order to compensate for lower output from each plot of land, there
would need to be a dramatic expansion of the amount of land under cultivation.
This would involve clearing many delicate ecosystems, such as mountainsides and
forests. Even today, small farmers who clear land for agriculture are
responsible for around two-thirds of the destruction of rainforests each year.<P>
     A better solution may be to accept that modern farming technology is here
to stay, but to smooth its rough edges. Governments in many rich countries are
trying harder to enforce regulations on the run-off of fertilisers from farms.
In many countries, both water and farm chemicals are heavily subsidised. Making
farmers pay the full cost of such inputs would cut their use, and hence reduce
environmental damage.<P>
     New technologies may also provide an answer. Farmers in Israel have
managed to cut the amount of irrigation water they need by using pipes
containing pinholes to drip water close to each plant. And biotechnology,
whatever its risks, should allow farmers to reduce their use of chemicals.
Scientists have recently devised a new strain of maize that is resistant to the
European corn-borer, another damaging insect pest. This should cut the need for
pesticides.<P>
     In the vast grain-growing plains of America's mid-west, a monstrous
vehicle is helping to reduce fertiliser run-off. The machine is loaded with a
variety of fertilisers, which are sprayed from a multitude of pipes extending
on either side. Traditionally, many farmers apply fertilisers uniformly across
a field. With this technology, a farmer starts by taking soil samples at
regular intervals throughout his land--with each position recorded to within a
few centimetres using global positioning satellites. The nutrients in each soil
sample are analysed to work out exactly how much fertiliser, and of what type,
is required. The vehicle is then driven through the field, varying the mix of
fertilisers as it moves. A computer in the cabin uses the satellites to work
out where the vehicle is, and calculates what mixture to apply.<P>
     By reducing the risk that too much fertiliser is applied, this method
ensures that less will be washed off by rain--an advantage to the farmer as
well as to the environment. The machinery, supplied by Cargill, a multinational
commodity firm, is expensive, but some farmers have already cut their
fertiliser costs; better targeting of fertilisers should eventually boost
yields too.<P>
     Cruel and unnatural?
     Though the fashion has yet to catch on in most developing countries,
consumers in the rich world are increasingly worried about animal welfare.
Britons are way ahead of other nationalities in this respect: the Royal Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, founded in 1824, is the world's
oldest animal-welfare group, and one of its largest. Last year thousands of
Britons protested against the export of live calves (the animals are crammed
into lorries for days without food). Animal lobby groups are also thriving
elsewhere in northern Europe and throughout America.<P>
     These groups claim that intensive farming is cruel. Their evidence appears
strong. In a quest for efficiency, many modern farmers stick hens in cages so
small that they cannot scratch at the ground. Turkeys are crammed by their
thousands into windowless sheds, their beaks cut off to prevent aggression.
Pigs are confined to stalls which prevent them from turning around. And
mycotoxin-producing moulds grow as well on badly kept cattle feed as on the
nibbles of natural-food lovers.<P>
     These practices are undoubtedly disgusting. Whether animals have rights,
or whether people have moral obligations to animals, are questions for
philosophy and ethics rather than for science. But science does have a
contribution to make to this debate, if only to remind those who are concerned
for the welfare of animals that a shift away from intensive farming will not
always improve the animals' lot.<P>
     Sir Colin Spedding, retired professor of agricultural systems at Reading
University in Britain, argues that animal welfarists tend to have a
"preoccupation with animal freedom". Given complete freedom, chickens in a
free-range farm will often bully and peck at each other, he points out. They
may also catch more infections because they can peck around in each other's
faeces.<P>
     Recall the intensively farmed cow mentioned at the start of this article.
It is part of a herd bred by ADAS, a British farm consultancy, to investigate
ways of boosting yields without damaging the animals' welfare. Its enormous
productivity is explained partly by selective breeding, but also by careful,
individual management. There is, according to Bridget Drew, head of dairy
research at ADAS, nothing more costly than a cow that has a problem.<P>
     The cows are given the teat antibiotics to prevent mastitis, a common
infection which leads to a painful inflammation of the udder. Every week, they
are weighed and put through a foot bath, to avoid foot infections. The mix of
their diet is calculated by computer so that it includes the right combination
of nutrients. It is also designed to encourage the cows to eat amply (hence it
includes molasses, a bovine delicacy).<P>
     In addition, the cows are milked three times a day--more than the average
in Britain. This improves their yield, but may also reduce the discomfort they
feel from over-distended udders. All this treatment requires more manpower and
equipment than the average dairy herd, yet the profits per cow are still
higher, according to ADAS.<P>
     In sum, the complaint that high-tech farming is bad for animal welfare is
only partly true. It is in danger of missing the point that technology has also
brought gains for animal welfare and--on some farms--may continue to do so.<P>
     Such arguments will not convince everyone. For behind all these complaints
about modern farming lies an assumption which is rooted deep in the minds of
many people. This is that modern farming is a subversion of nature, and that
plants and animals would in general do much better without human interference.<P>
     The idea has an instinctive appeal, especially to the many city-dwellers
who long for a more natural existence. Yet it relies on a distinction between
the human and the natural worlds which may not coincide with reality.<P>
     Many species depend on one another to thrive. Ants have farmed aphids and
edible moulds for millions of years and, though they do not eat the aphids, the
moulds are consumed as a crop. These arrangements came about by the normal
processes of natural selection.<P>
     One way of interpreting the emergence of agriculture, some 10,000 years
ago, is that humans and domestic animals have developed a similar mutually
beneficial relationship. In his book "The Covenant of the Wild"*, Stephen
Budiansky, a science writer, popularises the argument that some animal and
plant species "chose" (in evolutionary terms) to become domesticated, even
though it meant that many individuals of those species would end up in people's
stomachs. Before deliberate selective breeding got going there was a period
when natural selection worked to fit the ancestors of today's sheep, cattle and
cereals into a symbiotic relationship with people.<P>
     Mr Budiansky points out that many wild species now face extinction, but
that, thanks to agriculture, the world population of sheep and cattle exceeds 1
billion--a spectacular evolutionary success. None of this is to deny the
drawbacks of modern farming. But it suggests that the "nature" to which so many
people would like farmers to return is neither as easy to define, nor as
benign, as is often imagined.

TAMPERING WITH THE NATURAL FOOD CHAIN SCARY THING TO DO</center></h3>

St. Petersburg Times (PE) - FRIDAY March 29, 1996<BR>
By: WILBUR G. LANDREY<P>

TURIN, Italy - In the growing crisis over mad cow disease and the safety of
eating  beef, it may have surprised most of us that the cattle that used to
graze grass down home on the range have been turned into cannibals.<P>

   In  the  intensive  industrial production of meat and milk, they eat the
protein  meals  that  can  be  salvaged  from  the bones and offal of other
animals.   And  if,  as  now  appears  apparent,  animal  diseases  can  be
transmitted to humans, nature may be having its revenge.<P>
   Cattle  also eat fish, pigs eat poultry, chickens eat parts of their own
eggs, all in the name of greater production and efficiency.
   How much of a danger this is, if any, is still unknown. But the scare in
Europe raises questions about these practices of industrial farming.<P>
   And  in advance, the scare has ruined the lunch of the 15 heads of state
and  government  meeting in this northern Italian city today for an hour of
speeches  to  launch  a  year  of  meetings to decide the next steps toward
European unity.<P>
   Checking  into  my  hotel  here, the first thing I was handed was a note
that  ""neither  beef  nor veal coming from Great Britain will be served in
our restaurants.''<P>

   Of  course,  not  all  meat, milk and eggs are produced by the intensive
methods  that  began to come into use, I think, sometime in the early 1960s
if not before.
   But  cattle  are  what  the  dictionary  defines  as herbivores that eat
vegetation,  and  many still do. Feeding them the additives and substitutes
that some eat today may in effect make them carnivores.<P>
   While  science  has  greatly  improved  our  food  and health, increased
production  and  defeated  diseases,  tampering with the natural food chain
raises the shivers of the unknown.<P>
   Last  week's  announcement  of a possible connection between the mad cow
disease   BSI  (bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy)  and  Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease  that  destroys  the  human brain has thrown a rock into the placid
pool of our assurance.<P>
   Who knows where the ripples will stop?

<h3><center>'MAD-COW' ILL <A NAME="RAISES">RAISES</A> U.S. FEARS<BR>
 BAN ON MEAT SCRAPS IN ANIMAL FEED MULLED</center></h3>

Phoenix Gazette (PG) - Friday, March 29, 1996<BR>
By: Scripps Howard<BR>

WASHINGTON  - In its quest for bigger, faster-growing animals, the American
livestock  industry  has  turned to feeds boosted with protein derived from
other animals for more than 25 years.<P>


   But  now,  the  possible  link  between  those  proteins and an aberrant
protein  that attacks brain cells in sheep, cattle, mink and man has raised
new concern about the use of meat scraps in animal feed.   U.S. officials stress that no cattle in the United States have turned up
with  bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy,  or  "mad-cow  disease," since an
outbreak  of  the  disease in Britain resulted in a 1989 ban on imports and
increased surveillance of U.S. herds containing earlier British imports.<P>

   Nor has there been any increase in the number of diagnosed U.S. cases of
the human form of the sickness, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

   "We  are  confident we're safe," Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickmen said
this  week,  noting that increased spot inspections were being conducted at
major slaughterhouses.<P>

   "BSE  doesn't  pose  a  threat  in the U.S., but as a precaution, people
should  not  eat  cattle  brains  or sheep brains," said Pennsylvania State
University  veterinary virologist Anthony Castro, who adds that he has seen
no evidence that the disease can be passed to humans.   Yet  some  scientists and food-safety groups are concerned that the type
of disease and the path of infection found in Britain might be different in
the United States and require different protective steps.<P>

   In  light  of  the  new  evidence  from  Britain  that bovine spongiform
encephalopathy  may  be transmissible to humans, the United States may move
ahead  with a proposed ban on using rendered products from mature sheep and
goats, which has been in limbo since 1994. Critics say such a step would be
insufficient to protect animal and human health.<P>

   Sheep  in  Britain  and  the  United States suffer from a version of the
brain  disease  called  scrapie,  and it is believed the disease in British
cows  was  passed  on  when dairy cattle were fed rendered sheep parts as a
protein supplement.<P>

   U.S.  industry  officials  say cattle are not fed proteins from rendered
sheep,  although  government officials note there's no way to be certain ofthis  because  there's  no  way  to  test  a  rendered  product  for  sheep
ingredients.

   Proteins  from  rendered cattle are routinely added to the feed of other
cows, however.<P>

   "<B>Animal  agriculture  is a grisly, grisly business</B>," said Scott Williams
of  the  Farm  Animal  Reform  Movement.  "You  may imagine a contented cow
chewing  on  its  cud,  but  that  cow is more likely being fattened on the
intestines of its slaughtered comrades."<P>

   Veterinary  scientist Richard Marsh of the University of Wisconsin first
detected  a  species  jump  in  a  neurological ill in 1985 at a mink farm.
There,  animals  had  been  fed byproducts from "downer cows," animals that
mysteriously fall down and never get up.<P>

   When  Marsh  and  colleagues  injected  cows  with  brain  material from
  scrapie-diseased  sheep, they developed the downed-cow symptoms rather than
the  more  aggressive,  rambling  behavior  of  British  cows  with  bovine
spongiform encephalopathy.<P>

   Marsh  argues  that  the USDA surveillance program looking only for cows
exhibiting the British symptoms completely ignores the possibility that the
disease is different here.<P>

   Each  year,  about  100,000  cows  in  the  United States succumb to the
downer-cow  syndrome,  and  most  end  up  in rendering plants and products
ranging from protein supplements to gelatin used to make drug capsules.<P>

   Marsh  has  convinced  some  colleagues that the diagnostic net for cows
should  be  cast  wider,  but  neither  the  USDA  nor  the  Food  and Drug
Administration,  which  regulates  animal  feeds,  has  concluded  there is
justification  either  for wider testing or a ban on feeding cow remains to
cows.<P>
   The  crisis  for  British  beef  peaked  this  month,  when a scientific
advisory  panel  said  it could find no credible reason, other than contact
with  bovine  spongiform  encephalopathy-diseased  beef,  for 10 relatively
young  Britons  to  contract  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease strikes one person in a million, and it is usually an older person.<P>

   All  spongiform encephalopathy diseases appear to progress by some agent
attacking  and  destroying  cells  in  the  brain,  causing  confusion  and
dementia, creating holes in brain tissue and then physical debilitation and
death.  There  is  no known treatment or even a proven test for the disease
before death occurs.<P>

   Ronnie  Cummins,  national  director  for  the  advocacy group Pure Food
Campaign, said that if doubts about protein-enhanced beef were to spread in
the United States as they have it Britain, "you'd probably see the practice
of animal cannibalism disappear almost overnight."<hr>

<h4><center>GOVERNMENT'S <A NAME="PROMOTION">PROMOTION</A> OF BEEF AT ODDS WITH HEALTH GUIDELINES</center></h3>

Oregonian (PO) - TUESDAY, May 21, 1996<BR>
Edition: SUNRISE  Section: EDITORIAL  Page: B08<P>

To the Editor: Now I am really confused.<P>
   Over  the  past  few  years, I have been reading in your pages about the
impact  of  meat-eating on obesity, heart disease, cancer and other chronic
diseases, about E. coli and salmonella epidemics, about ``mad cow disese,''
shortages  of  grains used to fatten farm animals, and loss of topsoil from
animal-feed croplands.<P>
   More  recently,  I  read  that  the  U.S.  Department of Agriculture was
endorsing  meatless  eating  in  its  dietary guidelines and promoting more
grains,  vegetables  and fruits in the school lunch program. I learned that
meat consumption was dropping and that producers were cutting back.<P>
   I  was  relieved  that  the  forces  of national preservation and market
economics  seemed  to  be  working  after  all.  I  even considered that my
government could be genuinely concerned about my health and welfare, rather
than its own.<P>
   But  my faith was crushed by news that President Clinton decided to dump
$50  million  of  surplus  beef  on  America's school children and to allow
cattle  grazing  on  35  million  acres of erosion-prone land set aside for
future generations (May 1).<P>
   Do cattle producers have more votes than consumers? Or just more money?

<BLOCKQUOTE> David Walker et al., MSU   JULY 1992<P>      

<B>Melengestrol acetate (MGA), a progestogen-like   
compound:</B><P>
                                              
     Progestogens are synthetic forms of the naturally      
occurring hormone, progesterone.  Progesterone is produced  
by the corpus luteum [CL].  By  negative feedback, it       
reduces pituitary function, thus preventing a female from   
coming into heat.  When administered in conjunction with a  
luteolytic agent, such as PGF2a or estradiol valerate,      
progestogens can provide an effective means of resetting    
the cow's physiological clock.  If the progestogen is       
administered for several days, an artificial corpus luteum can in      
effect be installed, which can be removed at the producer's 
discretion.   <P>
 
<B>Melengestrol plus Prostaglandin F2a</B>:<P>
                                                 
     A synchronization regime involves combining the  
effects of melengestrol acetate (MGA), a progestogen-like   
compound, with PGF2a.  When administered in the feed at a   
level of .5 mg. per head per day, MGA is very effective at  
preventing cows from coming into heat.  When PGF2a is

Many producers, however, have reservations about summer grazing of
heifers  their exhibiting estrus. Problems
include better fencing required and  getting bred if there is a bull nearby.  Also,
reduced weight gains can be expected. This project tested the effectiveness of
Ralgro growth implants and Melengestrol Acetate [MGA] as mineral supplement
for suppressing estrus in yearling heifers on a summer grazing program.<P>

  Thirty-eight  heifers, average weight 562 pounds, were
purchased  on April 12, 1993 and
processed the next morning at the Mountain Research Station in Waynesville, North
Carolina.  All heifers were given a Lutylase injection a few days later to
abort any that might be pregnant. They were grazed on improved mountain pasture until May
4th. The
heifers were
weighed again on May 5th and the two weights averaged for a starting weight. One group was
implanted on May 5th with the growth stimulant Ralgro.  One of the two groups that were not implanted
received MGA mixed in their  mineral supplement. The average daily intake of MGA was .63 mg per head.

<H4>EXOGENOUS <A NAME="ESTRADIOL">ESTRADIOL</A>-17-beta  STIMULATES 
ONSET OF PUBERTY IN BEEF HEIFERS</H4>
P.D. Schoppee et al. NCSU Animal Sciences, 1994 Annual Report<P>


     Lifetime productivity is enhanced if heifers reach puberty by 12 mo of age, conceive
at 15 mo of age and calve at 2 yr of age.  However, delayed onset of puberty is a problem which continues to plague the cow-calf industry. The goal of our research has been to better understand mechanisms which regulate onset of puberty in heifers so that we may develop strategies which
allow the producer to manage the age at which puberty occurs. <P>

 The objective of this experiment
was to
determine whether exogenous estradiol-17-beta , administered as a single
intramuscular injection,
could induce onset of puberty in 8-mo-old heifers.<P>

Changes in serum concentrations of progesterone (P4) were used to determine
whether E2
induced ovulation and onset of puberty.  Heifers were considered pubertal if serum
progesterone
increased above 1 ng/mL for at  least four consecutive samples (indicative of a normal
luteal
phase) and was followed by a decline then a second increase indicative of continued
estrous
cyclicity.<P>


     The mechanism(s) through which  puberty is induced must be identified before
exogenous estradiol-17-beta  can be used as a tool to induce puberty in replacement
heifers.
Increased luteinizing hormone (LH) release, follicular development and endogenous
estradiol-17-beta all precede the first LH surge which induces ovulation during the
natural onset
of puberty.   Exogenous estradiol-17-beta  induces release of an LH surge within 12 hr
of
administration (Schoppee et al., 1994).  Whether the  induced LH surge induces
ovulation in
prepubertal heifers may be determined by the stage of follicular development at the
time
estradiol-17-beta  is injected.

          <CENTER>  <H3>Increasing live <A NAME="weight">weight</A> gains in cattle with steroids</H3></CENTER>

For beef from northern Australia to be sold into premium markets, the grazing industry needs to substantially increase annual liveweight
gains.  There are two research projects:
 alternate use of oestrogenic and androgenic anabolic steroids and developing
 a shot which stimulates muscle growth without increasing feed intake.
Currently in Australia, anabolic steroids are used as finishing agents to boost liveweights in the final months before slaughter. <P>


Alternating steroids may increase liveweight gains and mould carcass composition for a particular market. Steroids currently in use are either oestrogens or combinations of an oestrogen with an androgen. These stimulate growth by different mechanisms: oestrogens make carcasses fatter while androgens make them leaner. Alternate use of an androgen then an oestrogen may result
in sustained stimulation of growth rate.<P>

Are steroids safe? Use of steroids in meat production is controversial despite overwhelming evidence that beef from cattle treated with legal anabolic steroids
is safe for humans. To be competitive, Australia must use equivalent or better technologies than its competitors: in the feedlot industry <STRONG>about 90% of cattle fed for non-EEC markets are treated with an anabolic steroid.</STRONG><P>



A shot that boosts muscle growth may give producers another option to increase liveweight gains. 
 Studies of <B>clenbuterol</B>, a
drug which increases the efficiency of muscle growth, confirmed that it is possible to increase growth without increasing food intake in both
males and females, whether animals are entire, castrated or spayed. Side-effects of clenbuterol make the drug unsuitable for use in animal production.<P>

Copyright &copy 1996 The Associated Press
<P>
 WASHINGTON (Jun 6, 1996) -- Pesticides that by themselves have been linked to breast cancer and male birth defects are up to 1,000 times more potent when combined, according to a study.<P>


   A federal environmental official called the finding "astonishing" and said if it is confirmed in other labs, it could force a revolution in the way that the environmental effects of chemicals are measured.<P>

   The study centered on endosulfan, dieldrin, toxaphene, and chlordane, all pesticide chemicals that are known to turn on a gene that makes estrogen in animals. Estrogen is a hormone that controls formation of female organs. A surplus of the hormone has been linked to breast cancer and to malformation of male sex organs.<P>

   By themselves, the pesticides have only a very weak effect on the estrogen gene, said John A. McLachlan of Tulane University, leader of a team that tested the chemicals.

   "If you test them individually, you could almost conclude that the were non-estrogenic, almost inconsequential," he said. "But when we put them in combination, their potency jumped up 500 to 1,000-fold.<P>

   McLachlan said it was expected that combinations of the chemicals would be additive; that is, the effects of two chemicals together would equal the sum of the effects of the chemicals alone.<P>

   "Instead of one plus one equaling two, we found in some cases that one plus one equals a thousand," he said.

   The study is to be published Friday in the journal Science.
   "These findings are astonishing," said Dr. Lynn Goldman, chief of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. "The policy implications are enormous about how we screen environmental chemicals for estrogen effects."

   "It is a very high priority for us to address the implications of this," she said.<P>

   The EPA monitors testing of environment chemicals one at a time, said Goldman, and the agency now must consider how to test for effects of chemicals that might combine in the environment.

   "We test the ingredients that go into the soup individually," she said. The combination effect "is a very, very new issue for us."
Endocrinologist Wade Welshons of the University of Missouri told Science: "It's a very important red flag."<P>

   In recent years, many researchers have detected signs that certain industrial and pesticide chemicals released into the environment and absorbed by animals and humans may be able to disrupt hormones, perhaps causing cancer or birth defects.
   Some of the chemical molecules, such as those tested by the McLachlan group, act on the gene that makes estrogen. This can cause cells to produce a surplus of the hormone. Some researchers suggest that in male embryos, this added estrogen may affect formation of the sex organs. Estrogen surplus also has been linked to breast cancer, testicular cancer and lower sperm counts.<P>

   Researchers in Florida have found that at a lake where there was a pesticide spill more than half of the male alligators have smaller than normal penises and hormone levels near that of female alligators. In the Columbia River Basin, researchers found that young otters whose livers have absorbed insecticides have penises and testicles half the normal size. And several studies have found that sperm counts have dropped among Europeans men exposed to some of the chemicals.

<H3><CENTER>Clenbuterol may have tainted meat</CENTER></H3>
From ANIMAL PEOPLE, Jan/Feb 1996.<P>
MILWAUKEE--In the first of an expected series of indictments striking at the
brain trust and bankroll of the crate-raised veal and milk-fed spring lamb
industries,  a federal grand jury empaneled in Milwaukee on December 6
charged the Vitek Supply Corporation,  Vitek president Jannes Doppenberg,
and Vitek office manager Sherry Steffen with 12 counts of conspiracy,
smuggling unapproved drugs into the U.S.,  and illegally adding the drugs to
feed mixtures sold to veal and lamb producers throughout the country.
<p>
A prepared statement from U.S. Attorney Thomas P. Schneider said,  "It is
alleged in the indictment that the unapproved drugs were shipped to feed
companies and growers in Kansas,  Nebraska,  Wisconsin,  Minnesota,
Pennsylvania,  and Illinois.  Over 1.7 million pounds of Vitek product
containing unapproved drugs,  valued at over $1.3 million dollars,  were sold
by Vitek between 1988 and April 1994."
<p>
Three drugs were involved,  explained Schneider.  <B>Clenbuterol</B>,  a banned but
still popular synthetic steroid growth enhancer,  has also been at the center
of recent livestock show and horseracing scandals.  "Clenbuterol has been
associated with the acute poisoning of humans who consumed meat from
clenbuterol-fed animals,"  Schneider said.  In Spain,  clenbuterol tainting
of veal and calf's liver caused 135 people to be hospitalized in 1990,  and
another 140 people suffered dizziness, heart palpitations,  breathing
difficulty,  shakes,  and headaches from a similar incident in February 1994.
<p>
The second unapproved drug,  <B>Avoparcine</B>,  is "an antibiotic,  which through
uncontrolled use,  may result in strains of bacteria resistant to other
antibiotics,"  according to Schneider.  
<p>
The third drug,  actually a drug family,  includes <B>Furaltadone</B>,
<B>furazolidona</B>,  and <B>nitrofurazone</B>,  "all members of a class of compounds
referred to as nitrofurans,"  Schneider said.  "Though previously approved,
since January of 1992,  all three drugs have been unapproved due to
substantial evidence that they are carcinogenic.
<p>
The indictments are a milestone for the San Francisco-based Humane Farming
Association and HFA chief investigator Gail Eisnitz,  who found out about the
<B>illegal use of clenbuterol</B> in the veal industry in early 1994,  and has been
working to expose it ever since.

<h4>Biggest Drug Case</h4>

"This is the livestock industry's largest illegal drug case ever,"  Eisnitz
told ANIMAL PEOPLE.  "It only confirms what we've been saying all along:
that the illegal use of powerful and potentially deadly drugs is endemic
within the veal industry."
<p>
Clenbuterol is used to make confined calves and lambs gain muscle mass even
though they get no exercise.  Strong antibiotics are used to try to curb the
chronic inflections and diarrhea that afflict calves and lambs who never go
outside and may not even get colostrum from their mothers' milk.
<p>
The real significance of the December 6 indictments is that Vitek and
Doppenberg are not only important figures within the veal business,  they're
part of the interlocking chain of companies that forms the central part of
the vealing infrastructure.
<p>
Search warrants executed in connection with the case in September 1994
establish a direct business relationship between Doppenberg and Aat
Groenvelt,  the Dutch immigrant who founded the Provimi veal empire in 1962,
introduced the use of the veal crate to North America,  and created  a
market for "milk-fed spring lamb,"  starting slightly later in the 1960s.   
Groenveldt today is not only president of Provimi,  but also vice president
of Pricor Inc.,  the Dutch-based veterinary pharmaceuticals firm of which
Vitek is a subsidiary.   The September 1994 search warrants place Groenvelt,
Doppenberg,  Pricor president Gerard Hoogendijk,  and other influential
people in the veal industry together during high-level meetings at which the
use of clenbuterol was allegedly discussed.
<p>
Various federal law enforcement agencies already had a considerable amount
of evidence linking clenbuterol to veal and lamb feed when Eisnitz was tipped
off  that no one seemed to be bringing it together.  Kansas lamb grower
Stephen Beal was allegedly introduced to the illegal use of clenbuterol
through Doppenberg in late 1988,  while a partner of Hoogendijk and Groenvelt
under the business name Provi-Lean. He reported the matter to the Food and
Drug administration in August 1989,  but there was apparently little serious
investigation before February 1994,  when U.S. Customs traced illegal
veterinary drug imports to Vitek.
<p>
Transactions recorded in the indictment issued December 6 indicate the scale
of the Vitek operations involving illegal drugs.  Eight times between August
5,  1988,  and February 16,  1989,  or slightly more often than once a month,
 Vitek imported anywhere from 75 to 600 kilograms of substances containing
clenbuterol.   Outgoing product covered by the indictment includes 454 tons
of feed containing clenbuterol,  worth $434,784.  The total volume of
unapproved and/or misbranded animal drugs identified as having been sold by
Vitek comes to 866 tons,  worth $1.3 million.
<p>
"If convicted,"  said Schneider,  "Vitek faces fines up to $500,000 on each
of six counts,  and fines up to $10,000 on each of five counts.  Both
Doppenberg and Steffen face up to five years incarceration,  a $25,000 fine,
or both,  if convicted of the conspiracy alleged in count one of the
indictment.  The smuggling-related offenses charged in counts two through six
each carry up to five years incarceration,  a $250,000 fine,  or both."
Additional counts could add as much as three years incarceration and a fine
of $10,000 per conviction.

<B>Collapse of Industry?</B>
"What we are witnessing,"  predicted HFA national director Bradley Miller,
"is the collapse of the veal industry,  an industry that as far as we are
concerned,  more closely resembles a criminal enterprise than it does an
agricultural commodity group.  The veal industry's disregard for animal
suffering is only surpassed by its disregard for the health and safety of
consumers."

"While the recent indictments represent a significant development,"
Eisnitz predicted,  "they are just the tip of the iceberg in regard to the
veal industry's use of clenbuterol and other toxic drugs."

<h3><CENTER><A NAME="Cheating">Cheating</A> with Clenbuterol in Livestock Shows</CENTER></h3>

 <i> Julia Prodis ... AP Online News Service</i> August 20, 1995.<P>


It was an all-American moment -- grinning 16-year-old Ryan Rash resting his
head on his grand champion steer Badger after winning the blue ribbon at the
National Western Stock Show.
<p>
The lumbering, black steer fetched $37,500 at auction, and Ryan and his
parents couldn't be more proud. But within days, the ribbon had been
stripped, the money forfeited and Ryan banned for life from the Denver show.
<p>
The reason? Cheating.
<p>
Badger had been fed an illegal, steroid-like drug called <B>clenbuterol</B> that
beefed him up, giving him the straight lines and muscular physique of a
champion. Ryan's parents, John and Cherie Carrabba of Crockett, Texas,
admitted responsibility.
<p>

As state fairs prepare to open their gates, U.S. Food and Drug Administration
officials are re-arming themselves with kits to detect the drug. In Europe
<B>people who ate tainted meat from animals given the drug were hospitalized</B>
with increased heart rates and muscle weakness.
<p>


Scott McEldowney, who admitted feeding <B>clenbuterol</B> to his 10-year-old
daughter's steer Barney, says he had to cheat to compete on a national level.
"It's like anything in life, either racing cars or anything," said
McEldowney, who has a small farm in Ansonia, Ohio, near Dayton. "If you're
going to play on the same level, let's play on the same level."
<p>
He and seven others at the Ohio State Fair were caught either drugging their
animals with <B>clenbuterol</B> or injecting oil under their skin to give them a
better appearance. His daughter, Jessica, was banned for life from showing at
the state fair and had to return the $4,000 paid for her steer.


<p>
An Ohio Agriculture Department investigation led to the convictions of 10
people for either selling <B>clenbuterol</B> or tampering with livestock, and two
Wisconsin veterinarians and one in Iowa have been indicted in the drug
distribution scheme.
<p>
At the Tulsa State Fair in Oklahoma, six of the top animals tested positive
for the drug. And in Louisville, Ky., <B>clenbuterol</B> was found last fall in the
grand champion lamb at the North American International Livestock Expo.
<p>
The drug is most often smuggled in through Canada, where it is legally used
to treat horse respiratory problems, FDA official George "Bert" Mitchell
said. No human health problems have been reported domestically, however; only
small amounts of drug residue have been detected in the eyeballs of the show
animals.
<p>
McEldowney estimates 30 percent or more of exhibitors have used <B>clenbuterol</B>
on their show animals. Barbara Wood, livestock director for the Tulsa State
Fair that disqualified the six cheaters last year, puts the number at about
20 percent.
<p>
"At this time a year ago, I tried to deny we had a big problem, but I've
changed my mind. It's a serious problem," said Eddie Smith, Oklahoma state
supervisor of agricultural education and adviser to the Future Farmers of
America. "I'm sure there's always been a little fudging here and fudging
there, but it's definitely gotten a lot
worse.
<p>

Irwin Fishman, owner of Lombardi Brothers Meat Packers, has purchased the
grand champion at the National Western Stock Show for the past four years --
including drugged-up Badger. Framed photographs of him posing with the past
grand champions line his Denver office wall.
"I ought to take them all down," said Fishman, who got his money back, but
still feels suckered. "I really thought these were young 4-H kids in high
school that had raised this steer from a young animal, slept with them, made
sure they had water. Maybe I'm overly naive," he said.<HR>

<CENTER><H4><A NAME="FDA">FDA</A> Clenbuterol Alert in Beef Cattle <BR>
--  ClenbuterolCauses Human Liver Poisoning --</H4></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) has received
                information that "Clenbuterol," a drug that has not been
                approved in the United States, may be illegally imported from
                Canada, or other countries, for use in show beef cattle and
                other show livestock.  The drug is reported to have dramatic
                effects upon muscle development and as a repartitioning agent
                in altering the lean to fat ratio.  Recently, in Spain, there
                have been reports of acute poisoning of humans from their
                consumption of liver from clenbuterol-treated animals.<P>


                Clenbuterol is approved in Canada as an injectable and in
                various oral dosage forms for use solely in horses.  The
                authorized source is Boehringer Ingelheim of Canada, under the
                trade name "Ventipulmin."  The manufacturer is
                Ingelheim-on-the-Rhine, in Germany.  The drug cannot be
                legally imported into the United States, except under an
                investigation exemption.  CVM has been informed but has not
                yet confirmed that veterinarians in the U.S. can obtain the
                drug from a Canadian source merely on the basis of a telephone
                call.  We do not know the mode of shipment or if the entries
                are formal, informal, or clandestine.  We do know, however,
                that the drug is in a gelatinous form packaged in bottles for
                encapsulating by the user, and is shipped to the United States
                in a form not approved in Canada.  The actual product
                containers or labels have not yet been seen by the Center.<P>


INSTRUCTIONS :  Automatically detain all shipments of "Clenbuterol," in any
                form, unless the drug is imported under an approved INAD.
                Clenbuterol ("Ventipulmin") is usually or normally shipped
                from Canada, but may be shipped from other countries as well.
                Shipments may be directed to veterinarians or individuals.
                Because there are serious adverse public health implications
                when Clenbuterol is used in food-producing animals, this drug
                is inappropriate for release under the personal importation

<H3><CENTER>Where <A NAME="Angels">Angels</A> Fear to Tread</CENTER></H3>

<I>Reproduced with permission from The Vegetarian Winter 1993/94 </I><P>

The growth-promoting drug Clenbuterol -- commonly known as 'angel dust' -- was banned seven years ago, yet its use in the meat industry
is still widespread, despite the fact that it is known to pass into the food chain. In humans its side-effects are not only unpleasant but
sometimes fatal. <P>

In 1991 ox liver was responsible for the hospitalisation of 135 people in Spain. Throughout the rest of Europe, thousands more offal
consumers have suffered symptoms such as dizziness, tremors and heart palpitations, all of which can be traced to a single source: the
growth-promoting drug Clenbuterol. There has been at least one death to date. <P>

Clenbuterol -- also known as 'angel dust' -- is illegal yet its grip on the livestock industry is unrelenting. Its distribution channels are
shrouded in mafia-like mystery, and those vets and Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) trying to clamp down on the drug's
widespread use have been shot at, petrol bombed and some have even had their cars blown up. <P>

The use of illegal drugs in the meat industry has its roots in the post-war intensification of agriculture. Food shortages and ration books
convinced governments and food producers that increased levels of production had to become their principal aim, no matter what the cost.
'Factory' farming was heralded as the answer, and as more animals were crammed into ever smaller sheds and out-buildings, diseases
became rife. Farmers and vets turned to antibiotics in an attempt to overcome this problem and found that an unexpected bonus was
increased levels of growth in the animals. <P>

Pharmaceutical companies were quick to spot a potential gold mine. The race was on to develop 
growth-promoting drugs. The first widely available growth promoter was <B>diethylstilbestrol (DES)</B>; injected into an
animal's muscle tissue this prompted a rapid gain in pre-slaughter weight. <P>

By the 1960s the dangerous and carcinogenic properties of DES had become known and some countries banned its use. However as recently
as 1980 infant boys in Italy started developing breasts and girls were showing signs of puberty at less than one year of age. Their
abnormalities were attributed to DES, found in certain meat-based baby foods. <P>

The public naturally was shocked, a clampdown followed and in 1988 a whole range of growth-promoting drugs were banned by the EC. The
meat and pharmaceutical industries put up a fight but could not block the legislation: only Britain voted against the ban with the United
States joining the fray as soon as the ban was extended to imports. They retaliated with sanctions on many EC products, from canned tomatoes
to fruit juice. <P>

Clenbuterol was finally banned in 1987, but legislation has done little to curb its use. An EC report on its illegal application was suppressed
for more than 12 months before finally being released in a much-tempered form. One Belgian MEP who saw the original report - and has
since had threats made upon his life - claims that Clenbuterol is to be found in 80 per cent of the cattle in Belgium and 60 per cent in
Holland. In Britain up to a quarter of our cattle may still be receiving the drug illegally. <P>

A <STRONG>beta-agonist</STRONG>, Clenbuterol is related to the drugs used by body builders. It accelerates the building of muscle tissue while breaking down
body fat. Small quantities added to an animal's feed can boost a carcass' lean meat by up to 15 per cent while reducing its fat content by 30
per cent. Manufactured in Eastern Europe, it is smuggled into
the EC by a network of dealers known as the 'hormone mafia'.<P>

 Earlier
this year MAFF had to withdraw Belgian pork liver pate from supermarket shelves after discovering levels of Clenbuterol 40 per
cent higher than those allowed for medical purposes. 
As with many food-poisoning instances, the effects of Clenbuterol in humans may well be attributed to other less sinister complaints and so
go undetected. Common symptoms suffered soon after digestion can include dizziness, headaches, muscle tremors and heart palpitations.
Poisoning on a scale similar to Spanish or French incidents has yet to occur in Britain, but  Clenbuterol is undoubtedly present in our
meat products. <P>

The long-term effects of Clenbuterol are also a cause for concern. The drug is known to accumulate in the liver which could well cause
serious damage over a period of time. Those who suffer from heart disease may also be at risk, as the beta blocker drugs prescribed to
combat their high blood pressure can be neutralised by minute amounts of Clenbuterol. The drug is reportedly also capable of inducing
asthma attacks, so those with chest complaints should be especially wary of products which could be contaminated.

By Kevin L. Ropp<P>

Clenbuterol is used in several European countries by animal
trainers to build muscle mass and strength in exhibition
livestock. It has never been approved for any use in the United
States.
Athletes use clenbuterol because they think it has the same
mass and strength building capability in people as it does in
animals.<P>
But clenbuterol also has serious, immediate side effects in
humans. In Spain, between March and July 1990, 135 people became
ill after eating beef liver that contained clenbuterol residues. 
Their symptoms included fast heart rate, muscle tremors,
headache, dizziness, nausea, fever and chills. Symptoms appeared
from 30 minutes to six hours after they ate the liver and lasted
for nearly two days.

<H3><CENTER>Cattle drug gaining <A NAME="popularity">popularity</A> among U.S. athletes</CENTER></H3>


September 2, 1995 ... By Ira Dreyfuss, Associated Press
WASHINGTON -- A drug that puts more lean meat on cattle is apparently getting increased use by some U.S. athletes, according to a recent
study. Bodybuilders and others who want to lose fat as they gain muscle are taking clenbuterol, the report in the journal of the American College of
Sports Medicine said.<P>


In large doses, clenbuterol can give produce tension, cramps, tremors, a slightly higher heart rate and palpitations, the article said. And its
long-term effects are not known, said the article's lead author, Irvine D. Prather of the University of North Texas Health Science Center at
Fort Worth.

Clenbuterol has legal medical uses in some nations. It relaxes the muscles controlling the bronchial tubes.
Clenbuterol is not approved for medical use in the United States and is banned by the U.S. Olympic Committee and the NCAA.

The U.S.D.A.<STRONG> has not approved clenbuterol for use in livestock</STRONG>, but some veterinary studies have found the drug builds
lean tissue and burns fat in animals, the article said.<P>

Athletes who use steroids realize that drug tests will catch them unless they can quit far enough ahead to clear traces of steroids from their
systems, Prather said. So they finish off with clenbuterol, which the body clears in 2 or 3 days, he said.

Clenbuterol probably won't match steroids as a drug of abuse, Prather said. "It's nowhere near as effective as steroids," he said. "Word on the street is that it probably doesn't work all that well by itself, so people probably use it with traditional anabolic
steroid agents." <P>

Listserve item  29 May96<P>
Clenbuterol (known as Ventipulmin, a registered veterinary medicine  produced by
Boehringer Ingelheim) mimics the quality of anabolic steroids,  of turning fat into muscle. Beef produced
with clenbuterol is less fat! <P>

Clenbuterol is only effective in relatively high doses - you need much more than
a normal dosis than is prescribed for the lung problems. 
Clenbuterol is relatively easy to produce and related to salbutamol, cimaterol, etc. -  used as
dope in athletics. The most effective one - as growth stimulator - is
clenbuterol. Clenbuterol is forbidden in Europe as a growth stimulator, but not
 as a medicine. <P>
Farmers sometimes say when the urine of beef
cattle contains  traces of clenbuterol: my calf had lung problems and I had to
cure the disease.<HR>

<H3><A NAME="Invasion">Invasion</A> of the steroids -- the saga continues</H3>
 
   Natural is usually the way things are supposed to be, so steroids and the new "performance enhancers" are  troubling:<P>


   -- An earnest, determined high school kid takes steroids to bulk up. He's one of 500,000 U.S. youth who have done that.<P>

   -- A sports official hides test results that could give his event a black eye -- and explain why some top runners had such a good week.<P>

   -- A doctor admits he prescribed and monitored illegal drugs for athletes so they wouldn't "get their steroids on the black market without medical supervision."<P>

   The doc may be the most troubling of the three. A few years ago, the assistant director of the American Medical Association's Division of Drugs and Toxicology estimated that 20 percent of all steroids are prescribed by physicians.<P>


   The medical literature has numerous editorials in which doctors are urged to tell young athletes that most of the performance-enhancing drugs are "dangerous, illegal, and immoral."<P>

   There has been an epidemic of amnesia in the doctors' lounge. What happened that doctors need to be (ITAL) told (END ITAL) to explain this to their patients?

   Sure, sports doctors are always in a bind. They're sworn to do what's best for their patients' health, and obligated also, by the nature of their business, to make them winners. A few continue to favor the team over the patient.<P>

   Their smorgasbord goes well beyond steroids. Right now there's a black market in human growth hormone, which is produced by DNA technology to help dwarfed babies attain normal height. In athletes, it builds body mass without fat.<P>

   And long before the authorities caught on, athletes found that <STRONG>Clenbuterol</STRONG>, an asthma drug, will not only build muscle, but increase lung capacity and act as a stimulant.<P>

   Most "enhancer" drugs have serious potential side effects, but a win-happy society makes denial easy.

   We haven't heard much about this sort of thing lately. That may be because of the code of silence among image-obsessed sports promoters -- all the way up the line from your local high school to the International Olympic Committee (IOC).<P>


   The BBC reported in 1984 that officials of the IOC and the Los Angeles organizing committee tried to cover up nine positive drug tests. When the IOC medical commission refused to go along, somebody broke into the commission president's hotel room and stole the test results.<P>

   It's clear that winking at the rules -- unethical acts aimed at creating an uneven playing field -- is a thing that can eventually compromise the integrity of all sport.

   It's the only way we can return to the days when "sports booster" meant merely somebody who loved the game.<P>

<blockquote>Phoenix Gazette (PG) - Tuesday, April 2, 1996<BR>
Edition: Final  Section: Editorial/Opinion  Page: B4<P>


Given   America's   present   passion   for  political  correctness,  we're
absolutely,  positively  sure that there would have been no Mad Cow Disease
had it broken out on this side of the Atlantic.<P>

   While  the cattle might have reacted the same way, we believe Americans,
especially  those liberal Democrats in the Department of Agriculture, would have  been  more  concerned  with  their  plight  -  and dubbed the ailment
something   more   sensitive,  such  as  <b>Neurologically  Challenged  Cattle</b>
Syndrome.

<h3><center>US to Slaughter <a NAME="Imported">Imported</a> Cows</center></h3>

Philadelphia Daily News ... April 10, 1996<p>

   Twenty one  states yesterday began ordering the slaughter of British
cattle because of fears over deadly mad-cow disease.
   All  113  British  cattle  known  to  be  in  the United States would be
incinerated  and  their brains examined for the sponge-like holes caused by
the disease, officials said.<p>

   ``We  want these cattle eliminated. The stakes are too high,'' said Gary
Weber,   an   animal-health   expert   at  the  National  Cattlemen's  Beef
Association, an industry group.<p>
   The  measure  was  precautionary  because no symptoms of the disease had
ever  emerged in twice-yearly monitoring of the cattle, which were imported
before a 1989 ban on imports from Britain was imposed.<p>
   ``We're  doing  this  not  because  these animals have any symptoms, but
because  we  don't  want  to  have  the disease here,'' said New York state
Agriculture Commissioner Donald Davidsen.<hr>

A  handful  of  New  York  cattle  have  been placed under quarantine after

<h3><center>IMPORTED COWS <a NAME="TESTED">TESTED</a> FOR MAD COW DISEASE</center></h3>

Dayton Daily News (DA) - FRIDAY, May 24, 1996<br>
By: David Orenstein\Albany Times Union<p>

ALBANY,  N.Y.  -  *  British cows are being destroyed by the USDA to ensure
that  BSE doesn't spread in this country.
Thirteen  cattle  of  British  origin taken from New York farms in April to
undergo  a  fatal test for mad cow disease have received a posthumous clean
bill of health from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Kay Wheeler, a USDA veterinarian, cited test reports noting that the brains
of  the  cattle  had ``no lesion patterns consistent with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy or BSE.''<P>
    The  department  has  been trying to buy and kill 113 cattle nationwide
imported  from  Britain  during  the  1980s  to  quell  concerns  among the
beef-eating public that the disease that has tainted the British herd could
spread.<P>
   If  the  British  cattle in the United States are not destroyed, Wheeler
said,  the  public  might  hold on to the perception that the American meat
supply  is  in  possible  danger  and  demand similar measures. Killing and
testing the animals  allows the USDA to squash even the remotest risk.
   The  disease,  however,  is only spread to an animal or person eating an
infected animal.<P>

By  far  most Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases -- at least 75
percent  in Prusiner's estimation -- are ``sporadic,'' and no one knows how
their normal prion proteins alter to become rogue proteins.<P>
           
  In  the  U.S.,  Prusiner  is  concerned  because  the Department of
Agriculture  devotes  very  little  money  to research on the role of prion
proteins in scrapie, BSE and other animal forms of the fatal disease.<P>
       His  concern  is  shared  by  Dr.  Richard  Marsh,  a  University of
Wisconsin  specialist  in the nervous system diseases of animals. Marsh has
studied  a  rare  disorder  called  mink  encephalopathy  for 34 years and,
although  like  many  other  scientists  he  initially  rejected Prusiner's
concept  of  prions,  he  is now convinced that mink too can die of a prion
disease that is strikingly similar to scrapie and mad cow disease.<P>
        Marsh  said  he  has  found  at  least  three  different strains of
Prusiner's  prion  protein  in  mink encephalopathy, and in Britain some 29
different strains of the disease agent have been detected.
       As  a  result, Marsh is joining Prusiner in urging the Department of
Agriculture  to  greatly  increase  its support for research into the prion
diseases  of  animals.  This is particularly important in cattle, he noted,
because cows in the Midwest still occasionally die with delayed symptoms of
the  brain  disease  resembling  the  cattle  disorder  that has so alarmed
Britain's public, its government and its livestock industry.<hr>

American  beef  is safe from Britain's mad cow disease, but Colorado's beef
industry  supports  a  feed  restriction  to  prevent  the spread of such a
malady.<P>
 
  Jerry  Bohlander, the state veterinarian, said U.S. researchers have been
tracking  several other varieties of spongiform encephalopathy, but haven't
been  able  to  transmit  the  fatal  disease  by  feeding  cattle  protein

San Jose Mercury News (SJ) - Tuesday, April 2, 1996<BR>
By: Glennda Chui, Mercury News Science Writer<P>


       Not everyone is convinced BSE is not found in the US.
       Dr.  Richard  Marsh,  a veterinarian at the University of Wisconsin,
Madison,  says  he has investigated a number of cases in which ranch-raised
mink  came  down  with  a  BSE-like illness after eating meat from ''downer
cows''  -  cows  that  had been lying down, apparently ill, for at least 24
hours.<p>

       Mink  farmers  typically  pick up downer cows from neighboring dairy
farms and grind them up to feed their animals, Marsh said.<p>

      Since 1947, 23 mink ranches have been hit by the mink strain of BSE.
      ''You  can  trace  it back to a feed real easy in mink,'' Marsh said.
''And  then  you're  left  with  the question, what was it in the feed that
affected  them?  And  what  we  find is it's these downer cows that are the
common link. You don't have to be genius to figure it out.''<p>

      While  mad  mink are hardly a public health problem, Marsh said, they
are ''a sentinel species telling us about a rare infection in cattle.''
      The  lesson,  he  said,  is that ranchers should stop feeding cows to
cows.

<h3><center><a NAME="SHEEP">SHEEP</a> PARTS FAIL TO CAUSE COW DISEASE IN U.S. TEST</center></h3>

Seattle Times (SE) - Friday March 29, 1996<BR>
By: TARA GRUZEN CHICAGO TRIBUNE


CHICAGO  -  ATTEMPTS TO re-create the conditions under which British cattle
have contracted "mad-cow disease" have not been successful, but researchers
still can't declare U.S. beef 100 percent safe.
     CHICAGO  -  For  six  years researchers at the National Animal Disease
Center  have  been  trying  to  infect  an experimental pool of cattle with
"mad-cow disease."
    So far, they have been unsuccessful.
     The  method  being  used  at  the USDA agricultural research agency in
Ames,  Iowa, is one that British scientists theorize led to the outbreak of
"mad-cow   disease"   there:   Scrapie-infected   sheep   parts,  suspected
transmitters of the disease, are placed in cattle's feed.
    To representatives of the Cattleman's Association - the trade group for
cattle  ranchers  -  the  project's  results  say  a lot, they hope: Either
scrapie,  a  fatal nervous disease in sheep and goats, in the USDA research
is different from that in Britain, or scrapie isn't the culprit at all.
    But for public-health experts, the issue isn't so easily resolved. They
worry   about   the   unpredictable   consequences  of  not  taking  enough
precautions.
    Britain  banned  feeding sheep organs to cattle in 1989, but the United
States never followed suit.
    Whatever safety measures exist have been initiated by the feed industry
itself and are followed only on a voluntary basis. Meat-rendering companies
have been advised not to include sheep organs in cattle feed, but there are
no government regulations that prohibit the practice.
    "We're  playing  with  fire," said Paul Brown, medical director for the
U.S.  Public  Health  Service.  "We  have  to worry about things that might
happen and prevent them."
    The   current   scare   over   "mad-cow   disease,"  bovine  spongiform
encephalopathy,  came  last  week  when  Britain  announced a possible link
between the animal ailment and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a similar central
nervous system disease in humans.
    Researchers  and government officials in the United States responded by
meeting in Washington to discuss surveillance and feeding practices.
    There  have  no  cases  of  the  cattle  disease reported in the United
States,  and  an  import  ban  on  beef  from  countries where animals have
contracted the disease has been in place since 1989.
    Though  the  Food  and Drug Administration proposed banning sheep parts
from cattle feed in August of 1994, the legislation remains in limbo.
    "There  really  aren't any government restrictions," said Dr. Tom Gomez
of  the  U.S.  Department of Agriculture. "You're never going to be able to
give someone total assurance that it's not going to happen here."
    The  Food and Drug Administration is considering Britain's new evidence
to  determine  whether  it  information  warrants  calling  for  passage of
regulations proposed in 1994, said FDA spokesman Lawrence Bachorik.
    "We're  confident that we have safeguards in place, but we are going to
take  this very seriously," Bachorik said. "We're moving to a decision very
quickly."
    Gomez  said  the possibility of the British cow epidemic being repeated
in  the  United  States  is highly unlikely, largely because America's beef
industry uses far less sheep parts in cattle feed.
    Most  companies  in the United States have heeded the industry's advice
to  keep  sheep  and goat from cattle feed, said Gary Weber of the National
Cattleman's Association.
    The  Center  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  in Atlanta reports
between 200 and 250 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the United States
each  year. There has not been any increase in the number of incidents over
the past few years.

Orlando Sentinel (OS) - Tuesday, April 9, 1996<P>

BIRMINGHAM,  ALA. - A rancher who owns the nation's largest herd of British
cattle  is driving a hard bargain with the state of Alabama, which wants to
buy  and  destroy  the  animals  in  case they have been exposed to mad cow
disease.  Forrest  Ingram  of  Vinemont  is  seeking  about $600,000 for 29
Charolais  cattle,  which were brought into the country before fears of the
illness  prompted  a federal import ban. The state can condemn and take the
cattle,  but  must pay a fair price. And it doesn't think $600,000 is fair,
even though Ingram's cattle have shown no signs of the illness.<hr>

Canada's lone brush with BSE came in November, 1993, when an Alberta
rancher killed a cow he had imported from Britain in 1987. It was diagnosed
with BSE, the only such case to date in North America. As a precaution,
agriculture officials slaughtered and incinerated the entire herd of more than
200 animals, then ordered the destruction of all 175 British cattle imported
into Canada between 1982 and 1990. Those moves, controversial at the time, were

RENNES,  FRANCE (REUTERS) - France has slaughtered a herd of 220 cows after
one  was  found  infected  with  mad-cow disease, the 18th case reported in
France, officials said Saturday.<P>

   The  herd,  from  a  farm  at Saint-Nicodeme in Brittany, was one of two
where the Agriculture Ministry May 3 reported a case of the disease, bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, which rots the brains of cattle.
    The  other herd, 123 cattle in neighboring Normandy, was destroyed last
week.  Under  French  rules,  entire  herds are killed if a single infected
animal is found.<P>
   France  led  European  nations  in banning imports of British beef after
London  said  there  might  be  a  link  between  eating  infected beef and
contracting   the  disease's  deadly  human  equivalent,  Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease.<P>
   The  infected animal in Saturday's herd was a dairy cow born before 1988
that apparently contracted the disease from contaminated British feed, said
Jean-Francois  Pages,  an official of the prefect's office in Saint-Brieuc,
Brittany.
   Britain has reported about 160,000 cases of the disease.



<h3><center>BEEF <a NAME="SCARE">SCARE</a> IN BRITAIN MAY BOLSTER CATTLE BREEDERS IN UNITED STATES</center></h3>

St. Louis Post Dispatch (SL) - Wednesday, March 27, 1996<BR>
By: Tim Poor<P>

WASHINGTON  -  "Mad  cow"  disease  in Britain could make for some glad cow
breeders in Missouri and the rest of the United States.
   Although  some  government officials and cattlemen's groups are publicly
wary  about taking unseemly advantage of the British crisis, others believe
the United States should waste no time in filling gaps in overseas markets.<P>
   "The  mad cow occurrence gives us the opportunity to promote new exports
on beef . . . to toot our own horn," said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who told
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman as much in a letter this week.<P>
   Skelton  hopes the beef scare will give the United States added leverage
in  trade meetings this week with the World Trade Organization in which the
United  States  is trying to overturn a European ban on much American beef.
The  ban  has  been  in  effect  since 1990 after European market officials
claimed  the  beef  was  unsafe  because  of a growth hormone injected into
cattle.<P>
   "There's  nothing wrong with American beef," Skelton said. "The price is
right,  and  the  quality  is outstanding. This gives us the opportunity to
tell anybody and everybody about good Missouri and American beef."
   Adding  to  Skelton's  sense  of  urgency  is  the poor condition of the
beef-producing  business  in  the  United  States.  The  Department  of  Ag
riculture  announced  Tuesday  that record beef supplies are likely to push
this year's prices to the lowest level in nearly a decade. Those low prices
and  higher  feed  costs  have combined to make this year a money-loser for
many of Missouri's 77,000 cattle producers.<P>
   Tom Amontree, a spokesman for the agriculture department, didn't want to
comment on the impact of mad cow disease, but he did say the government was
fighting to get rid of the ban on American beef.
   "If that was lifted, our industry would be happy to assist the Europeans
in whatever way possible," he said. "We'd love to sell it to them."<P>
   Even  if the European market keeps its ban on U.S. beef, producers might
be  able to export the cattle themselves - without the hormone - if Britain
winds up thinning its herds to allay public fear.
   "It could very well be an opportunity if they destroy a large portion of
their   herd,"   said  Jeff  Rose,  an  international  livestock  marketing
specialist  with the Missouri Department of Agriculture. "It could help the
beef industry tremendously in this country."<P>
   Alisa   Harrison,  a  spokeswoman  for  the  National  Cattlemen's  Beef
Association,  said,  "We  would do anything possible to help them replenish
their herd."
   The association represents 230,000 U.S. cattle producers.

Europe, held an impromptu cookout to hail the safety of U.S. beef. Munching
on smoked brisket at a popular barbecue spot in Austin, Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Rick Perry criticized the media for stoking fears among
domestic beef consumers. The agricultural commissioner said evidence that
bovine spongiform encephalopothy, known as BSE, will cause human brain
disorders was "circumstantial" and that the issue has been politicized in
Britain and Europe.
             <P>
Separately, the U.S. beef industry is considering as an option a
promotional campaign in Europe touting American beef as free of the
disease, an export official said.
    "We'll look at all the options, and that'd certainly be one of them on
the table," said Thad Lively, economist at the U.S. Meat Export Federation,
an association of U.S. meat exporters based in Denver.

<h3><center>U.S.  acts to avoid <a NAME="disease">disease</a> in cattle</center></h3><br>

Washington Times (WT) - Friday, March 29, 1996<BR>
By: David Field<P>
U.S.  officials  are  moving  to head off an American version of the latest
scare  in  Britain  and  the rest of Europe over unhealthy beef from cattle
with "mad cow" disease.
   The malady has never been reported in U.S.-raised cattle.<P>
If  there  were a U.S. version, it could stem from sheep tissue that's used
in   cattle  feed  and  has  been  linked  by  some  to  Bovine  Spongiform
Encephalopathy, or BSE, as mad cow disease is formally known.<P>
   BSE  is  becoming  suspect  as  a source of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a
fatal disorder of the human brain that strikes about 250 Americans a year.
   Britain's  cattle  are thought to have caught BSE a decade ago by eating
feed made from sheep, which can carry scrapie, a related brain disease.<P>
   Britain in 1989 banned cattle feed containing ground-up sheep parts, but
a public panic spread through England last week when the British government
said  a few cases of the human illness might have been contracted by eating
infected beef.
   In 1989, the United States banned imported feed from countries where BSE
had  been  found.  No  beef  can  be imported from Britain under other U.S.
rules.<P>
   Now  the  U.S.  Food  and Drug Administration is considering banning all
U.S.  use of sheep tissue in cattle feed, imported or domestic.
   The  FDA  will decide within two weeks whether to impose a formal ban on
using  sheep  parts  in  cattle  feed  because of possible links to mad cow
disease, an agency spokesman said yesterday.<P>
   "We  are  going  to move very quickly in a seven- to 10-day time frame,"
FDA spokesman Larry Bachorik said. "There's never been a documented case of
BSE  in the United States, and we're confident that we have the appropriate
safeguards in place."<P>
   Livestock  are  being  tested. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which
does the testing, has found no cases since monitoring began in 1989.
  Agriculture   Secretary  Dan  Glickman  told  reporters  in  Houston  on
Wednesday  that  the  agency  had  stepped  up  surveillance because "it is
important to quell the fears of American consumers."<P>
   "The  disease is no threat to the United States. As far as we are aware,
we  are  free  of  the  disease,"  Mr. Glickman said, after a speech to the
National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.
   In  1994, the FDA proposed making all sheep-derived cattle feed illegal,
but  it  never formally took that step. After the British announcement last
week, the FDA began reviewing the feed ban again.<P>
   The  livestock  industry voluntarily stopped using most cattle feed made
from  sheep several years ago, although sheep protein still is used in such
items  as pet food, according to a spokeswoman for the National Cattlemen's
Beef Association, the Washington-based trade group for U.S. beef producers.
   Feeding cattle with meat and bone meal made from rendered cows and sheep
began in the United States in the 1980s.<P>
   "The  FDA  must  act  immediately  to  avoid  a potential epidemic among
cattle,"  said Jeremy Rifkin, who has taken many public positions on animal
nutrition and human food issues.
   Mr. Rifkin, the president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, said his
group plans to sue the FDA to force it to move on the animal-feed ban.<P>
   The  lawsuit, to be filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, will ask
the  court  to  order the FDA to impose an immediate halt to all feeding of
animal  protein  to  cows  and other cud-chewing animals, and "to develop a
separate,  significant  epidemiological study to determine the incidence of
BSE  in cattle that have consumed feed with the rendered parts," foundation
spokesman Ted Waugh said.<P>
   <B>About  14  percent  of cattle by weight is fed back to other cattle</B>, the
foundation  said, but the cattlemen's group disputed the figure, saying the
proportion eaten by cattle is much lower. The rendered animal protein "goes
into  a  lot  of  things,  pet  food,  cosmetics,  soap," the association's
spokeswoman said.<P>
   "Scientific  evidence  indicates that BSE does not spread from cattle to
cattle   or  from  cattle  to  other  species  by  physical  contact,"  the
cattlemen's group said.<hr>

<a NAME="WILL">WILL</a> MAD COW DISEASE STRIKE U.S. CATTLE?</center></h3>

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (PT) - Sunday, March 31, 1996<BR>
By: LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, THE NEW YORK TIMES<P>


Federal  officials  are confident that the mad cow disease found in Britain
has  not  occurred  in  the  United  States  and that existing policies are
adequate  to  protect  the  beef  supply. A meeting of 70 animal and public
health  experts  convened  by  the  U.S. Department of Agriculture reviewed
current  policies  last week and concluded without recommending any further
safeguards.<P>
 
   But  at  least one expert does not share Hueston's confidence. He is Dr.
Richard  F.  Marsh  of the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who has done
research  on a disease of minks that resembles mad cow disease. Marsh notes
that  scrapie  exists  among  sheep  in  America,  and  that sheep offal is
sometimes  fed  to  cows  here. He would like to see more sophisticated and
systematic testing of cows to be sure that mad cow disease is not present.<P>
   ``The  fact  that we have no reported cases of (mad cow disease) in this
country  gives  a  false  sense  of  security  because  it  is not based on
sufficient  testing,''  Marsh  said.  The  Centers  for Disease Control and
Prevention  does  not actively monitor for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which
is  difficult to diagnose in any case. Epidemiologists say at least a small
rise in cases could occur without being noticed.<P>
 
   Hueston  said  the  Department  of Agriculture has carefully studied the
sheep-to-cow  transmission  possibility but has been unable to verify it in
the  United  States,  either in theory or practice. Scrapie-infected tissue
collected  from  sheep in this country has been injected into the brains of
cattle  without  causing  the damage typical of mad cow disease, suggesting
the  scrapie  agent  that  infects  American  sheep  may  differ  from that
infecting British sheep.<P>
   
 Some three
dozen  marketed  drugs  are  derived  from  cattle  tissue  and organs, and
hundreds  more  contain  fractions  of cow blood. Gelatin, derived from cow
hooves, is an ingredient of many drugs and is used o make capsules.<P>
   To  prevent  risk  of  infection  by  the mad cow disease agent, the FDA
prohibits  the use of bovine material from countries afflicted with mad cow
disease.  In  addition, Dr. Carol Vincent, an FDA official, said the agency
did  not  consider  gelatin  to  be  a  problem because ``the manufacturing
process  would  reduce  or  eliminate  the  agent,  if it is present.'' Dr.
Vincent said ``it is terribly unlikely that gelatin is going to be a source
for'' mad cow disease.

<a NAME="Safeguards">Safeguards</a> Urged to Keep `Mad Cow Disease' From U.S.</center></h3>

The Washington Post, May 01, 1996<P>


A  consumer  group called yesterday for new measures to protect against the
possibility  of  a U.S. outbreak of Britain's "mad cow disease," which some
scientists believe may cause a fatal brain disease in humans.<P>

Public  Voice  for  Food  and  Health Policy called for an immediate ban on
using  tissue from cattle and sheep in feed for other cattle and sheep, and
for  additional  safeguards  to keep tissue from cattle spinal cords out of
the human food supply.   "Given  the  lack  of  understanding  of  the disease-causing agent, the
difficulties  of  surveillance and the severity of the disease, the federal
government  should err on the side of caution," Public Voice President Mark
Epstein said.<P>

   Scientists believe that the use of feed containing rendered cattle bones
and  other  tissues  may  have  been responsible for spreading the disease,
known  formally  as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), in Britain. The
infected  cow's  brain  and  spinal cord contain the disease-causing agent,
which  many  researchers  believe is a defective form of a protein normally
found in nerves and other tissues.
<P>
   Although  there have been no recorded cases of BSE in the United States,
fears  of  a possible outbreak have increased since British scientists said
mad  cow disease might give humans Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a fatal
degenerative brain disorder.  <P> The  Food  and  Drug  Administration  has said it will issue regulations
within  18  months  banning  the  practice  of  using tissue left over from
slaughter  in animal feed, and the beef industry has called for a voluntary
ban. In a letter to FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, Epstein said the FDA
should  immediately issue a binding interim ban, pending publication of the
final  regulations. Epstein also urged appointment of an independent public
health  panel  to oversee the BSE prevention effort and called for a review
of  the  rendering process to ensure that methods most likely to neutralize
the disease-causing agent are used.<P>

   The U.S. government should ensure that countries that export beef to the
United  States,  such  as  Mexico  and  Canada, have reliable surveillance,
Epstein added.<hr>



               <h3><center> CATTLE  RANCHERS  HAVE  BIG  BEEF  WITH <a NAME="LOW">LOW</a> PRICES</center></h3>

Phoenix Gazette (PG) - Friday, May 17, 1996<BR>
By: New York Times<p>

</p>
SIMLA,  Colo.  -  As  the  barbecue  season  unfolds  across  America,  the
low-priced  steaks sizzling on backyard grills are the despair of producers
at the opposite end of the food chain, the nation's ranchers.<P>

   "We  cut costs down to the point where isn't anything left to cut," said
Glenn Benjamin, whose broad-brimmed cowboy hat failed to conceal a furrowed
brow.
   While  his  younger  brother,  Lee,  weighed yearling heifers and steers
before  hauling  them  to  summer  grazing  land,  the  rancher  listed the
cost-cutting  measures  taken at his family's 7,700-acre ranch in Simla: no
summer  hired  help,  no  tagging  of  calves and no conditioning shots for
calves prior to shipping to feedlots this fall.<P>

   With  prices  paid  to ranchers at a 10-year low, "prices are lower than
costs  of production for 95 percent of cow-calf producers," estimates Chuck
Lambert,  economist  for  the  National  Cattlemen's  Beef  Association,  a
Denver-based group that represents 250,000 cattle ranchers.<P>

   Nationwide,  beef  sales are the largest revenue source for agriculture.
Here, in the wide open spaces of America's cattle country, rock-bottom beef
prices  are  rippling through local economies: ranchers are postponing bank
payments and purchases of tractors, pickup trucks and fencing lumber.<P>

   "Bankers  are  starting  to sweat," said Jim Taylor, a ranch real-estate   In  Arizona,  New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, drought has compounded the
effect  of  low prices. There, farmers are selling off their herds, keeping
prices  low  through  the  summer  and  eroding  the  tax  base of ranching
counties.<P>

   "In some rural counties, livestock taxes account for half of the taxes,"
said  Al  Schneberger, of Albuquerque, executive director of the New Mexico
Cattlegrowers   Association,  a  private  group.  "Herd  liquidations  hurt
schools, roads, libraries, ambulance services."<P>

   "I've  been  talking  to  people who remember the 1930s - the government
coming out paying $8 a head, digging a hole, and shooting the cow. I wonder
if we are not so far away from that now."<P>

   Historically, beef prices have followed 10-year cycles of price dips andrises.

   Overproduction,  the  past  culprit  for  collapsing  prices, is at work
today.  Beef  production  through  the  third  week in April was 24 percent
higher  than  during  the  same  period  in 1993, a recent peak price year,
according to the beef association.<P>

   At  the same time, Americans are grilling far fewer steaks than 20 years
ago.

   In 1976 annual per capita beef consumption peaked at 94.5 pounds. In the
1990s,  it  has  stagnated  at  around  66  pounds.  It  is unclear whether
Britain's  mad-cow  disease  will  have  any  effect  on the consumption of
American beef.<P>

   Ranchers  like to blame today's plunging beef prices on floods of cattle
from   Mexico   and  Canada,  on  price  gouging  by  supermarkets  and  onmonopolistic prices of meatpacking companies.

   But last year, imports accounted for just 2.2 percent of the 104 million
cattle  in  the  nation's  herds.  During  the  first quarter of this year,
imports were 19 percent below the same period of 1993.<P>

   Ranchers  complain  that  while  they  face  foreclosures, IBP Inc., the
world's  largest  meatpacker,  has  nearly  tripled its profits since 1993,
reaching  $256  million  in  1995.  Next  month,  a  committee appointed by
Agriculture  Secretary  Dan  Glickman  is  to  report  on  the  meatpacking
industry,  where  IBP  and  three  other  companies  hold 82 percent of the
market.<P>

   But  defenders  of  the  meatpackers  -  and they are few in barbed-wire
country  - note that the big four slaughterhouse companies enjoyed the same
market  share  in  1993,  when  prices  were at a peak. A large part of the
profits,  those  defenders  add,  stem  from record beef-production levels,which keep processing plants operating near capacity.<P>

   As  for grocery stores, retail prices have gradually bumped downward and
are  expected  to stay low during the summer, the nation's peak beef-eating
season.

   In  tribute  to  the  barbecue  culture,  beef sales during Memorial Day
weekend  are  25  percent higher than daily averages during the rest of the
year.

   But low cattle prices are not the only cloud over the Benjamin ranch, an
80-year-old homestead in bare, mustard-colored plains 60 miles southeast of
Denver.<P>

   "Feedcake  went  up 50 percent in six months, from $150 a ton in October
to  $220  a ton now," Ileta Benjamin said, as her two sons herded the balky
yearlings into a weighing stall.   The  nation's  cattle  business  is  the  largest  single user of grain,
largely  corn  in  the  shape of cakes or pellets for winter feed. But last
year's drought created a corn shortage, pushing corn prices up to a 20-year
high this spring.

   This  year's corn crop is expected to bounce back to normal, swelling by
27 percent over last year's level, to 9.4 billion bushels, according to the
Agriculture Department.<P>

   To  ease  the  squeeze  in an election year, President Clinton announced
measures  on  April 30 to allow ranchers this summer to graze cattle and to
cut  hay  on  land  previously  set aside under a federal soil conservation
program.  With  more grass available, ranchers would be able to reduce corn
purchases.<P>

   As money from the ranch has dwindled, Lee Benjamin now earns most of his
income  from  a  job  appraising farmland, and a part-time job his wife hasstarted in Denver.

   "The  only  way for a person to get into ranching today is to inherit it
or marry it," he said glumly from the dusty cab of a battered pickup.

   In a business affected by dozens of variables, economists see two bright
spots that may speed ranching's recovery from its cyclical trough.<P>

   This  year's  corn  crop  is expected to be strong. And beef exports are
expected to grow.

   Once  dismissed  as negligible, U.S. beef exports increased sevenfold in
value in 15 years. In 1995, they added up to $3.3 billion, about 11 percent
of the wholesale value of domestic-beef production.<P>

   Although  sales to Mexico fell by half last year, strong sales to Russia
and  South  Korea  helped  U.S. beef exports post an overall increase of 18percent.

   Ileta Benjamin is hedging her bets about ranching's recovery.<P>

   Five  years  ago,  four  men  worked full-time running this ranch, which
averages about 400 head of mixed-breed cattle. Today, the same operation is
run  by  Ileta  Benjamin  and  the  ranch manager, Bob Blake. Her sons give
occasional help.

   "Two years ago, I told the hired men that they were taking the gravy off
my income," she recalled. "Today, I'm doing what the hired men used to do -
branding, fencing, opening the gates."



<
<h3><center>MANY  <a NAME="UNKNOWNS">UNKNOWNS</a>  SURROUND  DREADED  'MAD  COW DISEASE' <br>
UNLIKELY TO SPREAD TO
U.S., EXPERTS BELIEVE</center></h3>

Arizona Republic (AR) - Sunday, March 31, 1996
<p>

WASHINGTON  -  If  there's  a  word  that sums up "mad cow disease" and the
similar illness that eats people's brains, it could be "mystery."<P>

   There's  no  test  for  the diseases and no treatment. Nobody even knows
what  causes  them  or  whether 10 people in Britain truly were sickened by
eating infected beef.
   All  those  unknowns  mean that even though experts believe there's very
little  chance  that  mad-cow  disease  can  spread to this country or hurt
people, they can't rule out the possibility.<P>

   "It's  a  hard  thing  to  explain  to  people," said Linda Detwiler, an
Agriculture Department veterinarian.

   Mad-cow  disease, formally known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or
BSE,  was  discovered  in 1985, when British cows started staggering around
and  dying.  Necropsies showed their brains were full of sponge-like holes.
By the next year, Britain had an epidemic. Other European nations have sick
cows, too.<P>

   No  cow  in  the  United  States  ever  has been found with BSE, despite
rigorous checking for symptoms and thousands of necropsies.

   It  wasn't until 1990 that scientists noticed how similar BSE was to thehuman Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It also eats holes in brains, of about one
in  a  million  people,  or 250 Americans, every year. Invariably fatal, it
kills about seven months after symptoms appear.<P>

   Many  species,  from  mink to sheep, suffer similar illnesses. In sheep,
the disease is called scrapie.

   The  only  link  between  species ever discovered is in animal feed made
from  ground-up  sheep.  This  feed is blamed for Britain's BSE epidemic in
cows, and even for several dozen deaths of house cats.<P>

   Only  the  brains  and  spines  of  animals have been proven infectious;
muscles, milk and other body parts are thought safe.

   The only way scientists have ever found the human version spread is from
medical  procedures,  when someone received infected corneal transplants or
injections  of hormones from corpses, a practice stopped in the 1980s. Theyare  fiercely  debating  the  condition's  cause,  a bacterium or a strange
protein called a prion.<P>

   So the world was stunned when Britain said there might be a link between
10  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  patients  and  infected cows. The British cases were
unusual  because,  while  Creutzfeldt-Jakob  usually  strikes older people,
these  10  were  all  younger  than  42, with some in their 20s. The United
States hasn't had a Creutzfeldt-Jakob patient under 42 since 1978.<P>

   U.S. scientists aren't convinced there is a link.

   "We  don't  know  that  for  an  absolute  fact,"  said  Food  and  Drug
Administration microbiologist Carol Vincent.

   Did  the victims eat infected beef? That hasn't been said. And to infect
a  steak, the butcher would have to accidentally slice open the cow's spine
along  the  way.  But  Britain  did allow cow brains and other organs to beground up in food products before 1989, the British government said.<P>

   In  the United States, a few drugs are made from cow organs, but the FDA
certifies that they do not come from infected cows or BSE countries.<P>

   What about using sheep to make animal feed?

   Britain  has  banned  the  practice,  but  sheep still make up about 0.2
percent  of  the  animals "rendered" into U.S. feed, said Don Franco of the
National Renderers Association.

   Within  two weeks, the FDA will decide whether to ban the practice here,
although  livestock  groups  said  Friday  they  would  halt  the  practice
voluntarily.<P>

   But  no  more  than 50 cases of scrapie a year are found in the nation's
8.9  million  sheep,  making  it  unlikely  that  U.S. animal feed could betainted, Detwiler said.

   The British Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases actually resembled a related illness
called  kuru,  or  "laughing  death,"  more than standard Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease,  Dr.  Paul  Brown  of  the National Institutes of Health has said.
Until now, kuru has appeared only in the highlands of Papua New Guinea.

<h3><center><a NAME="AGENCY">AGENCY</a> SAYS BEEF IS SAFE, BUT CAFETERIA IS BUYING ARGENTINE</center></h3>

Arizona Republic (AR) - Saturday, March 30, 1996


LONDON  - The Department of Health says British beef is safe, but its staff
will be eating Argentine meat during lunch breaks.

   The  department said Friday that it wasn't responsible for the decision.
It said Compass Group UK, the private contractor that runs the department's
cafeteria, acted out of fear over "mad-cow disease."

   "The  Department  of Health is entirely happy that British beef productsare  safe  to  eat,"  said  a spokesman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.

   "Whether  staff  want  to  eat  it  is up to them, and it's a commercial
decision for Compass if they want to take British beef off the menu."

<P>   WASHINGTON (Apr 30, 1996 3:48 p.m. EDT) -- A consumer group and medical advocacy organization urged government regulators to strengthen protections against an outbreak of "mad cow disease" in the U.S.<P>


   Public Voice for Food & Health Policy urged the FDA and USDA to appoint an independent panel -- with consumer representation -- to oversee the effort to guard against bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.<P>

   The group also recommended a review of U.S. procedures and cattle to ensure that there's no BSE in the country and that processors are using the best methods of neutralizing the virus suspected of causing the disease.<P>

   "Given the lack of understanding of the disease-causing agent, the difficulties of surveillance and the severity of the disease, the federal government should err on the side of caution and take effective, preventive measures to make sure that BSE never becomes an American problem," said Public Voice President Mark Epstein.<P>

   Separately, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine said it's prepared to sue the FDA and USDA to stop the feeding of animal remains to livestock and poultry.<P>

   "There is every reason to be concerned about an outbreak" of mad cow disease in the U.S., said Dr. Neal D. Barnard, president of 4,000 member organization. He said practices that led to the mad cow outbreak in the U.K. are common in the U.S.<P>

   That includes the feeding of ground-up animal organs, called offal, as a protein supplement to cattle, hogs and poultry. About 56 percent of all cattle feed contains offal, as does 66 percent of U.S. dairy feed, according to the USDA.<P>

   Barnard told reporters at a press conference that the livestock and poultry industry should stop feeding animal remains, Congress ought to ban the use of offal as a livestock protein supplement, and that the FDA and USDA shouldn't certify meats as fit for human consumption of animals that are fed offal.<P>

   The Agriculture Department has checked 499 cattle imported into the U.S. during the 1980s and "has never identified a single case" of BSE, said the department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.<P>

   The beef and dairy industry has urged the FDA to speed action on a rule to ban the feeding of offal to all ruminants -- cattle, sheep and goats.<P>

   A spokeswoman for the cattle industry, Alisa Harrison, said the physicians' group is going too far. "What they represent is an animal rights organization. They don't want people to eat beef."<P>

   In letters to FDA Commissioner David Kessler and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, Public Voice also asked for a ban on feeding offal to livestock and poultry used for in human food and a requirement that cattle brains and spinal cords be removed during slaughter. It also sought assurance that countries that export cattle into the U.S. have reliable BSE surveillance methods, and recommended additional funds for the agencies to expand their BSE protections without sacrificing other efforts.<P>

   FDA officials weren't available for comment.<P>

   In Europe today, European Union farm ministers urged Britain to speed its efforts to eradicate the disease before they consider lifting a ban on Britain's beef exports.<P>

   BSE, a brain disease recently found among British cattle, has been linked to a rare, but fatal, brain disease in humans. Britain has proposed a selective slaughter of some 42,000 cattle considered most at risk from the disease. The EU ministers said that's not enough.

Public Voice for Food and Health Policy today urged the Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture Department to create several additional layers of protection to assure safety and consumer confidence in the domestic food system in light of the "mad cow disease" outbreak in Britain. <P>

Among other things, the 14-year-old consumer group recommended an immediate government ban on the type of livestock feed suspected of spreading the mysterious diseaseóknown officially as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSEóin Britain. <P>

Public Voice also: <P>

<LI>Urged appointment of an independent panel with a public health orientation, including consumer representation, to oversee the BSE prevention effort.

BSE attacks a cow's brain, resulting in death. Many now suspect a link between BSE and a related fatal human brain ailment called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, or CJD. Scientists fear at least 10 recent cases of CJD in Britain may have resulted from eating beef from BSE-infected cattle. <P>

No cases of BSE have been diagnosed in U.S. cattle. The feed suspected of spreading BSE in British cows contains rendered tissue from sheep and cattle used as a protein supplement. <P>

Public Voice made its recommendations in letters to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and David Kessler, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Public Voice President Mark Epstein complimented both agencies for the actions they have taken but urged them to "create several layers of protection" against BSE. <P>

"Given the lack of understanding of the disease-causing agent, the difficulties of surveillance and the severity of the disease, the federal government should err on the side of caution and take effective preventive measures to make sure that BSE never becomes an American problem," Epstein said.<P>

Public Voice also recommended:<P>

 	<UL>
<LI>A ban on sheep and cow "offal"óbrains, spinal cords and other organsóin human food and a requirement that the brain and spinal cord be removed from cattle during slaughter. Current regulations ban the spinal cord from human food if it has been removed during slaughter. But parts of spinal cords legally can be included in food through some other processes.
<LI> 	Ensuring that countries that still export beef and cattle to the United States, such as Mexico and Canada, have reliable surveillance programs in place so that no BSE appears in their herds. Countries that have reported cases of BSE in their domestic herds are already banned from exporting cattle to this country.
<LI> 	Additional appropriations to assure USDA and FDA have the resources to expand BSE prevention programs without sacrificing other food safety efforts.
</UL>


Epstein said the immediate ban on use of ruminant tissue going into ruminant feed was particularly important. The FDA has begun the process of drawing up such a ban but, under normal procedures, that could take a year to 18 months to implement. In the meantime, national livestock trade associations are moving to establish a voluntary ban. But there are questions about how effective a voluntary ban can be. <P>

The answer, Epstein said, is for FDA to issue a binding interim ban pending completion of the permanent ban. The British government, he noted, has already issued a ban on ruminant protein in ruminant feed and the World Health Organization has urged all nations to do the same.<P>

Epstein said an independent BSE advisory panel is necessary because food safety responsibilities are divided among several different federal agencies. It's important that a single body be responsible for overseeing the entire effort and that this body be independent. 
Expanded surveillance efforts and a review of the domestic rendering process are also very important, Epstein said. <P>

USDA hopes to expand current sampling of brain tissue from cattle with central nervous system disorders, targeting plants that slaughter large numbers of older, cull cows. Public Voice urged that this expansion occur quickly and that the sampling be significantly increased if a test is developed to detect BSE in animals before they show symptoms of the disease. Currently, BSE is only definitively diagnosed by examining brain tissue in dead animals.<P>

The rendering process review, Public Voice said, should mandate procedures that prevent any infected animal tissue that might enter a rendering plant from contaminating non-infected tissue. Because of the long incubation period for BSE and related diseases, it is possible that tissue from infected animals could be processed without plant operators being aware of it. This could contaminate non-infected tissue, Public Voice noted. <P><CENTER>	#  #  #  #</CENTER><P>

<A NAME="hon">The Honorable</A> David A. Kessler<BR> 
Commissioner <BR>
U.S. Food and Drug Administration <BR>
5600 Fishers Lane <BR>
Rockville, Maryland 20857 <P>

Dear Commissioner Kessler: <P>

Public Voice for Food and Health Policy has been intensively researching bovine spongiform encephalopathy in recent weeks. I am writing to share with you a list of recommendations we feel are in the best interest of the federal government, the domestic food industry, and American consumers. A similar letter is being delivered to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.<P>

Public Voice believes that the federal government should err on the side of caution and take effective preventive measures to make sure that BSE never becomes an American problem.<P>

We know from the steps that FDA has already taken that you also believe that a vigorous preventive effort is called for, and we feel that FDA deserves praise for its efforts to date. However, the BSE situation is an evolving story, and we think it is necessary to periodically reevaluate our prevention program.<P>

Given the lack of understanding of the disease-causing agent, the difficulties of surveillance and the severity of the disease, we ask USDA and FDA to create several layers of protection for US consumers.<P>

Specifically, we recommend that:<P>

1. FDA should expedite its ban on ruminant protein in ruminant feed.  If possible, it should issue an interim ban pending completion of the rulemaking process. If research reveals that BSE is transmissible by oral exposure to swine or poultry, the ban should be extended to ruminant protein in swine and poultry feed.<P>

2. FDA should expeditiously undertake a careful review of rendering processes currently in use in the US. FDA should ensure that the rendering process is changed to incorporate methods that are most effective for inactivation of the scrapie and BSE agents, based on research in the US and Europe. In addition, FDA should mandate procedures in rendering facilities to prevent cross-contamination. Because of the long incubation periods for scrapie and BSE, asymptomatic but infected animals may be sent to slaughter plants and their offal rendered.<P>
 
3. USDA and FDA should appoint an independent panel with a primarily public health orientation consisting of experts from outside the government, and including consumer representation, to evaluate all facets of our BSE-prevention strategy, similar to the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee in Britain. Because of the way food safety responsibility is currently divided, different facets of our national strategy are being overseen by different federal agencies. We believe it is important that a single body be responsible for overseeing the entire effort and that that body be independent of both government and the affected industries. Currently, APHIS is taking the lead, because BSE has not yet been proven to be a human health hazard, and APHIS has made a laudable effort to coordinate its strategy with its sister agencies. However, until we know without qualification that there is no relationship between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, we must assume that BSE is a potential human health problem. We therefore recommend the creation of an independent panel with both human and animal health expertise.<P>

4. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) should ban specified sheep offal (i.e., brain, spinal cord, thymus, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes and intestines) from human food. FSIS should also ban cow brain and spinal cord from human food. Current regulations only ban the spinal cord from human food if it has been removed during slaughter. FSIS should require removal of the brain and spinal cord from cattle during slaughter.<P>

5. FSIS and USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) should expand their surveillance of US cattle with central nervous system disorders as quickly as possible to be sure that BSE does not exist in this country. If and when a diagnostic test is developed that can detect pre-clinical BSE in live cattle, APHIS should test a statistically valid sample of high-risk live animals in a given population or, if feasible, in the entire country. APHIS is now in the process of training FSIS veterinarians, private practice vets, and cattle producers to recognize the symptoms of BSE. APHIS and FSIS are also sampling brain tissue from cattle with central nervous system disorders presented for slaughter at certain plants (selected because of the large number of older cull cows they slaughter); their goal is to gradually expand this so that a sample would be taken from any cattle with a CNS disorder presented for slaughter at any plant in the country.<P>

6. FSIS and APHIS should ensure that countries that export beef and cattle to the US, such as Mexico and Canada, have reliable surveillance programs in place and communicate with these countries to ensure that their domestic herds remain free of BSE. According to the World Health Organization, "in the absence of surveillance data, the BSE status of a country must be considered as unknown."<P>

7. Congress should appropriate the funds needed for USDA and FDA to take the measures outlined above. Funding for FSIS' BSE-prevention responsibilities must not be taken out of FSIS' budget for postmortem inspection and implementation of the Pathogen Reduction/HACCP regulation.<P>

The above list of recommendations may not be comprehensive; there may be other recommendations we will wish to advance later as we learn more about this issue. We feel confident, however, making these recommendations now.<P>

I welcome your input and hope that we can work together on this issue. I look forward to your response.<P>


									Sincerely,<P>
<P>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="BOVINE">BOVINE</A> Spongiform Encephalopathy<BR>
("MAD COW DISEASE")</H2></CENTER>

This document is a fact sheet on bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, that has been compiled by Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, based on briefings and conversations with U.S. federal government officials, government fact sheets and reports, conversations with veterinarians outside the government, and medical journal and newspaper articles. We will update this fact sheet as the situation develops and as we continue to learn more about BSE. <P>

<H4>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy</H4> 

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy is one kind of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy.  All TSEs are caused by similar, as yet uncharacterized, agents that produce spongiform changes in the brain resulting in death.  Although the target organ is the brain, other infected tissues may include the spinal cord, the lymphatic system (spleen, thymus, tonsils, lymph nodes), the intestines and the eyes.<P>

TSEs include the following diseases: bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle; scrapie in sheep and goats; transmissible mink encephalopathy; feline spongiform encephalopathy in cats; chronic wasting disease in mule deer and elk; and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), kuru, Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome, and fatal familial insomnia in humans.  Some other cases of TSEs have also been reported in Britain in exotic species, such as kudus, eland, nyala and gemsbok. <P>

In the United States, there have been reported cases of scrapie, transmissible mink encephalopathy, wasting disease in mule deer and elk, and CJD.  There have been no diagnosed cases of BSE in the United States.<P>

Scrapie has been around for over 200 years, and there is no epidemiologic evidence that people can contract it by eating infected lamb or mutton.  Britain has a lot of scrapie; the United States has little scrapie; and Australia and New Zealand have no scrapie. Yet all three countries have about the same rate of CJD, or one case per million people.<P>

Kuru is an extremely rare TSE found in New Guineau and believed to be transmitted by ritual cannibalism involving consumption of or contact with brain tissue.  Kuru is significant, because it suggests that primates can contract a TSE by ingesting infected tissue.<P>

<H4>BSE</H4>

BSE is a new TSE that first appeared in British cattle in the mid-1980s. The disease characteristics have been remarkably consistent in all cattle observed. BSE attacks the brain, but the spinal cord and retina have also been found to be infective in cattle naturally infected with BSE. (In cattle experimentally inoculated with BSE, the intestine was also found to be infective.) Currently, BSE can only be diagnosed by examining brain tissue under a microscope. The incubation period for BSE ranges from two to eight years. Once an animal becomes symptomatic, death usually occurs within six months<P>

In 1986, the first cases of BSE were diagnosed in British cattle. Since then, some 162,000 British cattle have been struck by the disease. At its peak in 1992-93, there were about 1,000 new cases per week, but it dropped to about 300 new cases per week in January 1996 and continues to decline. <P>

The source of the British outbreak is believed to be either scrapie-infected sheep or cattle infected with a previously unidentified TSE. Cattle and other livestock are sometimes fed protein supplements that include rendered tissue from sheep, cattle and other livestock. In the late 1970s or early 1980s, Britain changed its rendering procedures to remove a solvent extraction process that included a steam-heat treatment. It is believed that this change in the rendering process allowed the infectious agent, present in either sheep tissue or cattle tissue, to survive the rendering process and infect British cattle. In July 1988, because of BSE, Britain banned the use of cattle and sheep protein in cattle and sheep feed. In 1989, Britain instituted a specified bovine offal (SBO) ban which excluded all brain, spinal cord and other organs with potential BSE infectivity from human consumption.<P>

Outside Britain, BSE has only appeared in countries to which Britain exported cattle in the 1980s. In six of those countries, including Canada, which has had only one diagnosed case of BSE, BSE did not spread from imported British cattle to domestic cattle. In Ireland, France, Switzerland and  Portugal, BSE has shown up in domestic cattle.<P>

The United States imported 499 cattle from Britain as breeding stock between 1981 and 1989. The U.S. Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has been monitoring 464 of these cattle, of which 96 are still alive. The states in which these 96 cattle are located have quarantined them except for Pennsylvania (5 cattle) and Montana (one cow). Since no government, state or federal, controls the movement of these six un-quarantined British cattle, it would be possible for them to be slaughtered and their meat to enter the human food supply. APHIS has so far been unable to trace 35 imported British cattle of which only four or five are believed to be still alive.<P>




<H4>The US  Ban on British Cattle and  Beef</H4>

In 1989, the US imposed a mandatory ban on cattle imports from Britain and other BSE-affected countries (i.e., countries with BSE in their domestic herds). At the same time, we restricted beef imports from Britain and other BSE-affected countries. Although British beef imports are technically not banned, no British beef has been imported into the United States since 1985, according to USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), because no British slaughter plants met U.S. inspection standards. It is possible that no British beef was imported in the years before 1983, but FSIS records for years prior to 1985, if they exist, have not yet been checked.  According to an FSIS official, FSIS employees in the import program were questioned and could not recall any British beef imports during the 1980s.  It is believed that British cattle were first infected with BSE in 1981-82, even though clinical cases were not diagnosed until 1986. <P>

<H4>APHIS Surveillance of US Cattle for BSE</H4>

APHIS and FSIS have been looking for BSE in U.S. cattle. Since 1990, APHIS has examined brain tissue samples from nearly 2,800 cattle, and none have tested positive for BSE to date. These samples have come from cattle showing signs of central nervous system (CNS) disorders during antemortem inspection outside the slaughterhouse and from rabies-negative cattle. In addition, if a private practice veterinarian notifies APHIS that an animal on a farm or feedlot has a CNS disorder, APHIS will send a veterinarian to examine the animal. <P>

Recently, USDA has announced plans to increase its surveillance effort.  Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was quoted saying "we will bring up the surveillance."  So far, however, this has mainly consisted of increased training and education about BSE for FSIS veterinarians, private practice vets, and cattle producers. APHIS is considering examining more brain tissue samples, but the exact scope of additional sampling has not been resolved and will depend in part on lab capacity.<P>

Additional brain tissue samples would be taken from cattle with CNS disorders and, possibly, also from "downer" or "non-ambulatory" cattle (i..e., cattle that are unable to walk). USDA's immediate goal is to reach the point where a sample would be taken from any cattle showing signs of CNS disorder during antemortem inspection at any slaughter plant in the country. Currently, this is only true at approximately nine plants, but APHIS hopes to expand its coverage to roughly twenty  plants that slaughter most of the cull cows, beef and dairy, in the country. It is important to target older cull cows, because due to BSE's long incubation period, younger cattle are unlikely to show symptoms of BSE even if infected.  In Britain, most BSE cases have involved dairy cows between three and five years old.<P>

APHIS has prepared a risk assessment for BSE in the United States a few years ago.  It concluded that the risk of BSE appearing in this country was not very great.  APHIS found that Britain had several risk factors not present here such as: a higher rate of scrapie in sheep; a higher ratio of sheep to cattle; a higher percentage of sheep meat and bone meal in rendered product (prior to bans in both countries); a greater reliance on animal protein in protein feed (prior to bans); and inclusion of meat and bone meal in calf starter feed (prior to bans). <P>


<H4>The Feed Issue</H4>

The U.S. rendering industry has had a voluntary ban on use of adult sheep tissue in ruminant feed since 1989. A survey of compliance in 1992 found violations, especially among smaller companies. An official of the American Veterinary Medical Association said, however, that compliance has improved and now is probably quite high.<P>

Recently, several national livestock trade associations and veterinary organizations called for a voluntary ban on ruminant tissue in ruminant feed, but this voluntary ban is not yet in effect.  It is opposed by trade associations representing the rendering industry and the feed industry.<P>

The Food and Drug Administration has announced plans to make the "ruminant-to-ruminant" ban mandatory. It will "expedite regulations prohibiting all ruminant protein in ruminant feed."  The exact scope of the ban will be determined in a notice-and-comment rulemaking. Promulgation of a final rule may take one year to 18 months, according to some reports. FDA had proposed a ban on adult sheep and goat tissue in ruminant feed back in 1994, but no action was taken. <P>

<H4>CJD</H4>

The BSE epidemic in British cattle has been accompanied by an increase in CJD cases in people.  CJD cases in Britain have risen from 28 in 1985 to 55 in 1994. Most alarming are 10 recent cases involving young people (teens to early 40s), since CJD is usually a disease of the elderly, and a marked change in the microscopic appearance of the diseased nerve cells. According to the British Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), these ten cases represent "a previously unrecognized and consistent disease pattern." A recent CJD case in France has also been found the fit the pattern of the ten British cases, and several additional CJD cases in Britain are being investigated. Although the link to BSE has not been established, the SEAC concluded that this is "the most likely explanation at present." Dr. Joe Gibbs of NIH in this country agrees that there is "sound reason" to suspect a "strong link" between BSE and the CJD cases in Britain.<P>

CJD generally strikes elderly people and has an incubation period of from five to 30 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does surveillance for CJD in the United States by analyzing death certificate information from multiple-cause-of-death mortality data.  These data indicate that CJD mortality in the United States from 1979-1992 was relatively stable ranging from 0.8 cases per million in 1979 and 1990 to 1.1 cases per million in 1987.  CDC is doing active surveillance for all emerging infectious diseases at four sites around the countryóin Minnesota, California, Connecticut, and Oregonóand these sites will also begin looking for CJD.<P>

<H4>The Infectious Agent</H4>

The agent that causes TSEs is not new; we've known about it for 20-30 years. We just don't understand it. While some scientists believe the agent is an unconventional virus or an incomplete virus, Dr. Stanley Prusiner at University of California at San Francisco has advanced the leading theory which is that the agent is an abnormal or mutated version of the prion protein (PrP) found in many cells, especially nerve cells. An infectious prion in a brain cell can cause the normal prion protein in another brain cell to mutate simply by coming in contact with it, causing a chain reaction.<P>

If this theory is true, it would explain why TSEs produce no detectible immune response (i.e., production of antibodies) or inflammatory reaction in infected animals. Unlike bacteria or viruses which introduce foreign proteins into the body, prions are believed to depend on the infected animal's own proteins. Lacking foreign proteins, prions are invisible to the victim's immune system. Prions also appear to be extremely resistant to heat and normal sterilization processes.  <P>

Prion diseases can be inherited, can arise spontaneously, or can be transmitted infectiously. Most cases of CJD (excluding, perhaps, the recent cases in Britain) seem to occur as a result of spontaneous mutations of nerve cells. Other human forms of TSE, such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, are inherited. Kuru (and, possibly, the recent CJD cases in Britain) are spread by eating infected tissue.<P>

How are infectious prions able to cross the species barrier? No one knows, but Dr. Prusiner has theorized that it may depend on the degree of similarity in the amino acid sequence in the proteins of the two species and that the degree of similarity of certain parts of the amino acid sequence may be more important than others for determining whether the disease will cross the species barrier. <P>

        Mad Cow Disease, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, or BSE  is 
devastating the British beef industry, with serious ramifications for 
all meat eaters.  It is a startlingly clear example of what can happen 
when we allow government scientists to secretly muck around with 
biologically hazardous substances.<P>

        Scrapie, a Spongiform disease of older sheep and goats, has been 
known for over two hundred years in  western Europe.  The animals 
become irritable, lose vision, rub themselves raw (hence Scrapie), and 
die.  Scrapie is a variant of a disease known as Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephlopathy (TSE) which is now found in many different 
animals, including humans.  TSE diseases cause central nervous system 
damage and the source of infection is probably a baffling disease 
agent known as a "prion" (pree-on). <P>

         Prions were first identified in 1980 by Dr. Stanley Prusiner at 
UCSF.  Prions are  proteins which contain no known genetic material, 
but  they can act as extremely resistant infectious agents that slowly 
alter other protein molecules in the brain.  Ordinary nerve cells 
produce proteins very similar to the mutant prions, so natural 
defenses are ineffective in halting the spread, once TSE has been 
successfully introduced into a susceptible organism.  The healthy 
protein is transformed by the  misshapen prion through a still unknown 
process into brain matter that resembles a sponge.  Genetic 
susceptibility and exposure to pesticides may play a possible role in 
the spread of the TSE.<P>

        BSE was first diagnosed in British cows during April of 1985. 
"Officials"  claimed that there was absolutely no danger in eating 
British beef.  As a result infected material ended up in meat pies, 
cosmetics, and cattle feed.  After thousands of cattle began dying of 
BSE in 1988, the government finally ordered measures to curtail 
dangerous practices, such as feeding cows other ground-up cows to 
improve milk productivity, and using offal (waste parts) for hot dogs 
and kidney pies,etc.  But all this came too late; humans have now 
contracted the deadly Mad Cow disease.<P>

        The March 22,  Sacramento Bee  headline: "Deaths cause British panic 
over ‘Mad Cow Disease’"  was my first inkling of events just surfacing 
that would soon  seriously affect the our world’s meat eating habits.  
The article mentioned the slump in beef prices, the Scrapie connection 
and  "brain disease".  American consumers were assured that  " mad cow 
disease had never been detected in cattle in the U.S.".<P>

        After reading Emerging Viruses: Aids and Ebola by  Leonard Horowitz, 
I decided to reexamine the BSE situation.  In his  thoroughly 
researched history of the AIDS and Ebola plagues, Horowitz vividly 
portrays the inept, dishonest and secretive science found in our 
country’s national laboratories and in international organizations 
such as the World Health Organization (WHO).  These powerful networks 
control the  direction of most medical research but never take 
responsibility for  miscalculations and lapses in judgment.   If we 
all really knew the truth about these irresponsible scientists, we’d 
stop quarantining animals and start quarantining them.<P>

         WHO has been researching Scrapie since at least 1965 as a possible 
bio-warfare agent.   In 1969 it reported that during the previous five 
years there had been a "recent interest in the "slow viruses", in 
particular those causing chronic degenerative disease of the nervous 
system- the CHINA viruses...progress has come from painstaking work 
with visna and Scrapie, degenerative diseases of the central nervous 
system, and Kuru, a degenerative disease of the central nervous system 
of man..."   <P>

        The CHINA (chronic infectious neuropathic agents) viruses were 
inadequately understood at that time:  "CHINA viruses are 
distinguished by the languishing character of the infection process 
they initiate.  The incubation period in the host may be months or 
years, and the disease itself may progress laggardly towards an 
irreversible deterioration of the victim.  Cells infected with "slow" 
viruses are in general neither impaired nor stimulated to proliferate.  
Their functions are impaired but the nature of the dysfunction has not 
yet been clarified...The resistance of the Scrapie agent to heat, 
ether, formalin, and other enzymatic and chemical agents, as well as 
its very small particle size, poses the question whether it is a 
conventional virus, an incomplete virus, or some other agent..."<P>

        If it hadn’t been for Dr. Prusiner, WHO would still be looking for a 
"slow" virus.  Until 1980, scientists didn’t have a clue about prions; 
from 1964 on these folks were looking for a virus. To determine the 
nature of this  "slow" virus,  tissue cultures were made, infected and 
then injected into countless lab animals including cows, mice, 
hamsters and monkeys.  The Department of Defense also began trying to 
develop "a new infective microorganism which could differ in certain 
important aspects from any known disease-causing organism."  In 1970 
the Army received a ten million dollar down payment toward the goal of 
developing a "super germ" like the AIDS virus that would inhibit or 
destroy the immune system, and we’ve all been keeping up the payments 
ever since.  <P>

          Henrietta Lack died in 1965 of uterine cancer.  She gained dubious 
immortality through the cells of her cancer for they were the first 
cancer cells to be grown in perpetuity in tissue cultures.  Before 
HELA (Henrietta Lack) cells, only one or two divisions were possible.  
The HELA cells were sent world wide.  It’s not well known but even 
during the peak of the "cold war", Soviet and U.S doctors were 
collaborating on bio-warfare and cancer virus research.  In 1972 the 
Russians sent us six cell lines they thought contained cells with 
cancer causing viruses.  As it turned out, these cell lines were all 
contaminated with HELA cells that contained monkey viruses.  <P>

        Dr. Walter Nelson Reese had the responsibility of keeping  the cell 
lines in the U.S. cataloged.  After the incident with the Russians, he 
decided to examine all the cell lines.  He discovered, much to his 
amazement, that over a third of them were HELA contaminated, probably 
when culture lids were opened and aerosolized particles would float 
around the lab and sometimes drop into another cell line.  The 
aggressive  HELA cells, often carrying viruses from other 
species,would soon take over a culture.    <P>
 
        What are the long range consequences of such sloppy science?   What 
new prion configuration is lurking in your next  flu shot or Big Mac?  
While the USDA insists that our beef is safe and our cattle are free 
of BSE,  they fail to divulge that a form of TSE is present in many 
domestic herds.  How many is unknown at this time because blind denial 
on the part of the beef & dairy industry has blocked any attempt to 
realistically assess the problem.  <P>

        Every year 300,000 of the 100,000,000  cattle reared in this country 
exhibit a set of strange symptoms.  Known as "downers", the cattle 
become irritable and begin to stagger around.   When put under stress, 
these poor creatures fall down and are unable to stand upright ; the 
animals waste away.  USDA scientists  know  that "downer" is a TSE 
variant because "downer" meat, fed to minks, has led to outbreaks of a  
Spongiform Encephlopathy type disease, MSE.  These TSE carrying 
"downers" are ground up and  fed to other animals. There is no telling 
where  prions can appear since they cannot be eradicated.   They’ve 
been allowed  access to humans and  domestic animals for almost thirty 
years.  Presently, more than 200,000  U.S. citizens die each year from 
misdiagnosed TSE caused diseases.<P>

        Is  botched science  responsible for the unsettling circumstances 
surrounding the recent explosion of Spongiform diseases?  During the 
mid sixties the quest for a new "infectious agent" centered on the 
"slow virus" thought to be found in Scrapie and Kuru.  I contend that 
our national labs have been clumsily contaminating their cultures with 
prions, just as they did with HELA cells.  On top of that,  fetal calf 
serum is still being used as a culture medium.  Thinking it sterile, 
scientists never understood until recently that vertical transmission 
of the then unknown prion was possible.  The slow nature of prion 
diseases has prolonged a misunderstanding of the problem and perhaps 
allowed prions’ entry into vaccines, and these vaccines have been put 
back into cows and you and me.  The prions have begun to accumulate 
exponentially and we’re left with the situation we have today- big 
trouble.<P>

        Can we  rely on government scientists to cure our collective ills?  
Remember Dr. Walter Nelson Reese, the guy who warned his colleagues 
about the HELA contaminated cells?  After  pointing out the problems 
he uncovered, his laboratory was de-funded and Reese now operates an 
art gallery.<P>

<FONT SIZE=-2>REPORTS BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT</FONT><BR>

The Times: Britain: 22 May 1996<P>
<B>THE FARMERS</B><BR>

There are 40,000 dairy farmers and 70,000 beef farmers in Britain. Beef farmers with prime animals younger than 30 months are suffering most. If they sell now they could lose up to &#163;150 an animal, compared with what they would have been paid before the announcement on March 20 of the possible link between BSE and CJD in human beings. If they hold back, there is no certainty that prices will improve. Farmers with cattle older than 30 months will be reasonably compensated when these animals are taken off their hands and destroyed. Pay ments average between &#163;480 and &#163;800 per animal, depending on weight and type. The cost will run to about &#163;630 million in the first year, funded partly by the European Union. Farmers are frustrated by the slow pace at which the slaughter is proceeding. This is mainly because of the limited number of incinerators and rendering plants in which to dispose of the carcasses. No one knows how many animals older than 30 months are still on farms awaiting slaughter. Estimates range from 150,000 to more than 300,000.

<P>

<B>ABATTOIRS</B><BR>

Many of the initial lay-offs of staff were in abattoirs as cattle sales slumped. But abattoirs and renderers have now been given the work of culling and destroying older animals and have received a total of &#163;228 million in government aid. Some abattoirs are still in financial trouble, however, because supermarkets will not accept beef from plants that are also involved in culling older cattle. Several of the biggest and most efficient plants have lost their export trade and need to be able to increase supermarket business and culling to be viable.

<P>

<B>MARKETS</B><BR>

There are about 200 livestock markets in Britain. Auctioneers earn a commission that is fixed as a percentage of the price of every head of cattle sold. In the second week of May, the number of prime steers and heifers traded at markets was 13,497, compared with 22,247 at the same time last year. The average price was &#163;555, against &#163;665 a year ago. Auctioneers fear that they will lose under the scheme for culling cattle aged more than 30 months because farmers are compensated at a better rate if they send those animals direct to an abattoir.

<P>

<B>HAULIERS</B><BR>

The Road Haulage Association says 5,000 lorries and 8,000 people are normally involved in transporting cattle and beef. Graham Houghton, its livestock controller, said: "The export trade has completely gone and the transport of cattle from farms to markets is 40 per cent down. Up to 70 firms have gone out of business or stopped trading." Firms are estimated to have lost &#163;90 million of turnover. The glut of empty livestock lorries and refrigerated beef vans looking for other cargoes has forced down the rates for all haulage work by as much as 25 per cent.

<P>

<B>EXPORTERS</B><BR>

Beck Foods, of Boston, Lincolnshire, is typical of the many meat-processing and packing firms affected by the BSE crisis. It did 30 per cent of its business abroad. Turnover is now down from &#163;110 million to &#163;75 million and it has had to lay off 200 of its 600 staff. Morris Bond, chairman and managing director, runs his own abattoir and will qualify for a share of the &#163;110 million aid for slaughterhouses. First City Trading, in London, whose sole business is exporting beef, is not eligible for any aid. It is left with &#163;2.75 million of unsold stocks.

<P>

<B>RETAILERS</B><BR>

Beef sales fell by more than 50 per cent after March 20. The Meat and Livestock Commission says sales are now back to 94 per cent of the pre-March level. Asda puts its sales at 90 per cent of normal and last week announced it was banishing foreign beef from its shelves. But other supermarket chains, as well as the National Federation of Meat and Food Traders, representing butchers, says sales are still 20 per cent down. Demand for other meats has risen, pushing up prices by 17 per cent for lamb, 10 per cent for pork and 8 per cent for poultry.<HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Cheek">Cheek</A> Meat Specialist Severely Impacted</CENTER></H3>

JOHN CATTERMOLE is one of the lesser-known victims of the crisis in the beef industry. Two months ago he had a thriving business near Coventry specialising in the removal of cheek meat from the heads of slaughtered cattle, an ingredient in a variety of meat products from pies to p&acirc;t&eacute;s.

<P>

On March 28 the Government announced that cattle head meat was to be added to the list of bovine carcass parts no longer deemed safe for human consumption. Scientists had advised that brain tissue, known to be an area of BSE infection, might contaminate the rest of the head.

<P>

"Overnight a factory in which I had invested &#163;500,000 only two years ago, taking out bank loans and a mortgage on my house, was forced out of business," he said. "I have had to get rid of the 22 people who worked there and am facing redundancy claims of up to &#163;60,000. I owe abattoirs who supplied me with cattle heads a further &#163;50,000 and have been left with &#163;20,000 of unsold stock. I have put my house up for sale to try and pay off my debts." Mr Cattermole's factory processed 300,000 cattle heads a year and was one of the biggest members of the Association of Cattle Head De-Boners, representing an industry which until eight weeks ago had a turnover of &#163;20 million a year and a workforce of 300.

<P>

Mr Cattermole, 32, has two daughters, Danielle, 10, and Lucy, 12. His wife, Joanne-Marie, does not go out to work so the factory was the family's only source of income.

<P>

Before the ban on head meat, the Cattermole meat cutting plant on an industrial estate had an annual turnover of &#163;1.7 million and made a net profit of &#163;200,000. "Trying to find other work for the plant will be difficult. Operating costs are &#163;4,000 a week so we would have to be very confident of any new business we started."

<P>

Graham Reed, the association's chairman, said: "An entire specialist industry has been shut down without warning. It is blatantly unfair that the Government has offered no compensation. It is near impossible to find other work for our plants because of over-capacity in the abattoir and meat cutting industry."

WITH the beef crisis entering its third month, the travail of Britain's cattle industry shows no sign of easing. Jobs are being destroyed and companies are going bankrupt.

<P>

In addition to the financial disaster many farmers face, it is estimated that up to 10,000 ancillary workers have been laid off, put on short-time or made redundant since the global export ban was imposed on March 27. Despite earmarking nearly &#163;1 billion to support the industry, introducing new safeguards to protect the public and embarking on the destruction of about one million older cattle, the Government is no nearer persuading the European Union to lift its ban.

<P>

Even if Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, had succeeded this week in persuading other EU ministers to end the ban on beef by-products such as tallow, gelatine and semen, exporters would have gained little financial relief. At a generous estimate, these items earned no more than &#163;34 million last year.

<P>

That compares with the beef exports worth &#163;520 million annually that remain blocked, and the &#163;70 million earned by the export of 450,000 calves to the Continent last year for the veal trade. Sheep exports, worth &#163;40 million, are also at a standstill because the trade is not viable without cattle to ship with them.

<P>

As well as failing to persuade the EU that British beef can safely be imported and eaten, the Government has had little support at home for the rescue strategy it is struggling to put in place.

<P>

Even before other EU ministers had rejected as inadequate Mr Hogg's plan to cull up to 80,000 cattle, mainly dairy, considered to be at high risk of developing BSE, British farmers and vets had denounced the scheme as irrelevant and unjustified. The cull would have been in addition to the slaughter and incineration of cattle older than 30 months, already under way, and is designed to ensure that only those animals least likely to be incubating BSE enter the food chain.

<P>

Meanwhile, exporters, who were left with unsold beef stocks worth &#163;18 million when the ban began, are aggrieved that they have had no help from the Government. The International Meat Trade Association is taking the Ministry of Agriculture to court for alleged unlawful discrimination between suppliers.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Court">Court</A> case threatens consumer confidence</CENTER></H3>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT...May 23,1996 ...copyright London Times
<P>

 A GROUP of abattoir owners and cattle farmers is today starting legal action that could wreck the Government's strategy for restoring consumer confidence in beef.
Lawyers for the Quality Meat and Livestock Alliance will seek leave in the High Court to apply for a judicial review of the ban on the sale for food of cattle over 30 months old. They will argue that the ban is illegal.

"We are seeking an expedited proceeding because of the urgency of the case," Richard North, a food safety consultant who is advising the group, said.
<P>If the legal challenge succeeds, it will be devastating. Retailers have been rebuilding sales of beef by guaranteeing that it now comes only from animals under 30 months old. Members of the alliance are furious because the cull of cattle over 30 months old includes not only barren dairy cows at the end of their useful working lives but tens of thousands of prime beef cattle, even though only 15 per cent of beef herds have ever had a case of BSE.<HR>

  BY OLIVER AUGUST<P>
 

     ONE thousand jobs came under threat yesterday at Cricket St Thomas
     Dairies in Somerset after the appointment of an bankruptcy administrator <P>

     Cricket St Thomas failed to achieve expected efficiency gains and was
     granted the appointment of administrators at the High Court on Sunday. 
     Its difficulties were compounded over the last two months as milk sales
were
     depressed after the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)scare.
     The collapse of the milk export market led to a surplus that depressed
prices
     in spite of the lack of scientific evidence linking milk to BSE. <P>

     The Somerset company has an annual turnover of £90 million and employs
     400 people at its dairy and 600 at its 16 depots. It supplies milk and
cream
     products to supermarkets, retailers and on a doorstep delivery service. <P>

     Arthur Andersen said the decision to put the dairy into administration
meant
     it would continue to trade as a going concern and provided a "realistic
     prospect of finding a solution to the current difficulties". 

     The administrator is currently conducting a detailed appraisal of
trading and
     financial prospects. <HR>

Dairy Crest, the former processing arm of the Milk
     Marketing Board is expected to announce stock flotation plans today.  After unveiling the final results, Dairy Crest, the former processing
arm of
     the now-defunct Milk Marketing Board, is set to seek a stock market listing
     today, despite the industry's problems with BSE. <P>

     Dairy Crest has been considering a stock flotation for several months and said in
     early December last year that it was still prepared for a full listing
on the
     London Stock Exchange. 

     The company is expected to be valued at £200 million.

What about using sheep to make animal feed?  Britain has banned the practice, but sheep still make up about two-tenths of a percent of the animals ``rendered'' into U.S. feed, said Don Franco of the National Renderers Association. But no more than 50 [sic -- webmaster]  cases of scrapie a year are found in the nation's 8.9 million sheep, meaning it's unlikely that U.S. animal feed could be tainted, Detwiler said.

Listserve item ... 23 May 96<P>

The BSE epidemiology studies have suggested that BSE was linked
to the discontinuance of the solvent extraction step in the
rendering process in the U.K.  However, Dr. Taylor presented
data at the joint FDA/USDA meeting in Riverdale, May 13, 1996,
showing that none of the three steps in the solvent extraction
process reduced TSE infectivity.  So where does this leave us?<P>
Well, if not a direct link let's go for an indirect one.<P>

The discontinuance of solvent extraction of greaves* meant that
the final renderer extracted less fat from greaves, about
2/3rds.  Now, some of these less valuable greaves were coming
from "Knacker Yards".  An April 6th, 1991 article in 'The
Economist' Britain Section discusses knackers. The picture
shows of a whole bunch of dead sheep on the ground with a
"Knackered Knacker" (man) standing by them.<P>


*Greaves are a U.K word  for the solid portion prior to 
fat extraction, either by solvent or mechanical means.  
In the U.S. we refer to the solid unground fraction as "crax".  
Before fat is extracted they are "wet crax", after "dry crax" 
or just plain "crax".<P>

Some quotes from the article:<P>

 
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Knackers would then take the carcasses to pieces, sell the
meat off as pet food, the tallow off to pharmaceutical
companies, the hides as leather and the rest to the renderers
to turn into animal feed."<P>

"Knackers are closing down, Of the 130 in Britain, 12 have
closed in the past year.  Scotland has been particularly badly
hit, because the two big companies that ran the industry have
both closed."</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
 
If you wanted to find the highest dose of TSE's in the world
you would have gone (and still go) to a U.K. Knacker yard.  The
key here is that Knackers extracted some of the fat, hence they
had to at least partially render the material. So you have
Knackers buying deadstock from farmers and selling tallow and
greaves to..... Highest Bidder?<P>
  If this industry did exist in
the U.S., which it does not, farmers would have been lined up
at the Knackers door with money in hand. Or maybe that's how
farmers were paid for their deadstock.<HR>
Early cases of BSE animals didn't enter the human food chain but they
most certainly DID go to the knacker and thus straight into the M&B meal,
brains spinal chord and all. If you take a reasonable date for onset of say
1982 that gives you 14, YES FOURTEEN, years possibly more. Remember we are
taking about provably infected material here, about as concentrated as you will
find anywhere. Given the dry matter of M&B meal it's probably more infective
than neat brains, and certainly (at a 2% to 5% inclusion in ruminant feeds)
much more infective than the cattle food.<HR>

<A NAME="Listserve">Listserve</A> Items ... May 15 1996:<P>

<LI>The FDA has announced its support of the [rendered ruminant] ban, and is initiating regulatory activity toward that result.However the American Feed Industry Association which represents the *feed* industry does NOT agree with the call for a voluntary ban. Also vocally NOT supported by the Livestock Conservation Instiute who's members include 6 majornational Ag associations, 46 producer organizations and 33 publicly supported organizations. Of course the North American Rendering Industry does not support the call for a voluntary ban.
<P>

<LI> Fat derivatives used for cosmetic or pharmaceutical uses
(stearic acid, glycerin, etc.) are produced through refining, a
process which entails very very high temps. Regarding feeding of tallow to ruminants, it is a common
practice in the U.S.<P>
<LI>
In Britain, the fat by-product, tallow, is subjected to such severe
treatment during processing that BSE infectivity is destroyed.
It does not generally get into cattle rations  because
it is more valuable in other uses.<P>

<LI>In Japan, the process of continuous rendering is to pass the meat
material in oil at the temperature from 110 to 130 centigrade for an hour.
At this condition, prion protein is not expected to survive.<P>
<LI>
BSE and scrapie are extremely resistant to rendering -- the conditions in Japan might not destroy infectivity. <HR>

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Rendered">Rendered</A> Fats and Tallow</CENTER></H3>


 From a May 1996 symposium on TSE's where Dr.
Taylor and Dr. Kimberlin were guest speakers:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The reasoning
behind the exclusion of fats from any ban or *potential* ban is
that Dr. Taylor's studies on both scrapie and BSE infectivity
in rendered products show that no detectable infectivity occurs
in rendered fats even in those systems that produced infective
meat and bone meal.  Most rendered fats are filtered using a
media such as diatomacious earth to remove even trace levels of
proteinaceous materials.  The resulting filtered fat is a pure
chemical triglyceride which contains NO animal tissue which is
*potentially* associated with the infective agent.</BLOCKQUOTE>

 Annex 2.4 of the 1992 Report of the Expert Group on
Animal Feedingstuffs:<BR>
 
<STRONG>Batch Rendering</STRONG><P>

 
<B>2.4.5</B> The traditional method of cooking is used by plants processing
about 20% of the raw material.  The average particle size of material
entering the cookers is 40mm and average cooking time about 3 1/2
hours.  Maximum temperatures range from 120-135ëC under atmospheric
pressure with a normal maximum of about 125ëC.  However one plant
cooks under pressure (2 bar) for 35 minutes at 141ëC.  In some plants
the load is discharged once the maximum temperature is reached, in
others there may be a holding time of up to 20 minutes.  On discharge
the free run fat is drained off and the residual greaves removed for
pressing and/or centrifugation to extract more fat.  The dried greaves
is subsequently ground to produce meat and bonemeal or sold as greaves
to other renderers for further processing.<P>

<B>2.4.6</B> There are four continuous systems employed in the UK.  They were
first introduced in the early 1970s and now process about 80% of the
raw material.<P>

<STRONG>Stord Duke system</STRONG><P>

 
The system works on the principle of a deep fat fryer.  The rendering
vessel operates with a high proportion of liquid fat, the heat being
applied via a steam jacket and a steam heated tube rotor.  The
particle size of raw material entering the cooker is 20-50mm.  Maximum
temperatures achieved are between 135ëC and 145ëC with an average
residence time of at least 30 minutes.  The protein material is then
pressed before being ground into meat and bonemeal.<P>

<STRONG>Stord Bartz system</STRONG><P>

 
There are a number of different types and sizes of Stord Bartz
systems.  The material (reduced to a particle size of 20-50mm) is
heated by a steam heated disc rotor.  The discs occupy the length of
the rendering vessel.  The average maximum temperature achieved is
around 125ëC and an average residence time of between 22 and 35
minutes.  Pressing and grinding is similar to the procedure operated
in the previously described system.<P>

<B>Anderson Carver-Greenfield system</B><P>

 
Finely minced (to a size of less than 10mm) raw material is first
mixed with recycled heated tallow to form a slurry.  This is then
pumped through a system of tubular heat exchangers with vapour
chambers under partial vacuum before being centrifuged and pressed.
The heat treatment involves a maximum process temperature of 125ëC
with an average residence time of between 20 and 25 minutes.<P>


<STRONG>Protec De-Watering  System</STRONG><P>


 
Raw material is initially minced to a particle size of 10 mm before
being heated to 95ëC for 3-7 minutes.  The liquid phases (fat and
water) are removed by centrifuging or light pressing and are further
separated to recover the tallow.  The resultant solids are dried at
temperatures ranging from 120ëC to 130ëC.
<HR>
<B>Listserve item</B><BR>
15 June 96<P>

 At the end of 1987, John Wilesmith, of the
Central Veterinary Laboratory looked at the first 200 cases of BSE and did a very
careful analysis of the epidemiology.  He found the only common feature
was that every single case had been fed proprietary concentrates or
protein supplements and he identified that the vehicle that carried
the infection was the meat and bone meal."

"The precipitating factor causing BSE was a sudden cessation of
hydrocarbon solvent extraction of tallow in the rendering system. Why did this occur? Well, this process probably inactivated the
causal agent sufficiently to prevent disease and when that procedure
was stopped independently by the rendering companies for commercial
reasons, this permitted sufficient infectivity to pass into the feed
and cause disease. It was then recycled and initiated the escalation
in the epidemic from mid 1989 onwards. <P>
How had solvent extraction of
tallow prevented the disease? We think by the double heat process
which this particular kind of rendering utilised and in particular the
use of a second wet heat stage using steam in a low fat environment.
When did that happen? It happened in the late l 970s and early 1980s
especially in the period 1981/82 when cattle were first exposed to
sufficient agent to cause disease which was first recognised five
years or so later after the incubation period was complete."<P>

There are (or were) two separate industries involved in the
production of animal feedstuffs based on meat and bonemeal. They are
the rendering industry, milling the meat and bonemeal, and
the feed compounding industry. The renderers do not normally sell
their product direct to farmers but to the compounders.<P>
 
The information that follows derives from discussions with a
now-retired well-known technologist who worked for one of the major
rendering companies during the period in question.<P>

After the first heated stage of rendering, much of the fat (tallow)
was removed by pressing, leaving behind the "greaves" containing
residual fat. Why was solvent extraction ever involved? It was because
it was virtually impossible, in the small-scale batch processing
plants that existed up to the early 1960s, to mill the meat and
bonemeal without first removing the residual fat, by solvent
extraction. Up to the early 1960s, the renderers therefore carried out
solvent extraction, and sold the milled product to compounders on a
commercial specification of 50% protein, and very low fat content.

After extraction the residual solvent then was removed from the
product by "stripping" it with steam nominally at 120  deg C plus,
(though, delving further into detailed history, I am told by my
informant, that it was, in practice, not always operated above 100
deg C). The fat-in-solvent solution was then evaporated to leave the
by-product, tallow. <P>

By the early 1960s, there was a worldwide trend to move from a larger
number of renderers operating small-scale batch processing to fewer
large-scale continuous processing plants of modern design, on which,
moreover, it was possible to mill the product containing the residual
fat, so that there was no technical need for solvent extraction or for
the subsequent steam stripping of solvent residues. These changes were
taking place worldwide, not just in the UK.<P>

Meanwhile, tallow was increasingly being added as an ingredient during
compounding, as an energy supplement,. Realization  dawned
that it was ridiculous to go to all the trouble, expense, hazard and
environmental pollution involved in removing residual tallow by
solvent extraction, only for it to be added back in compounding. This
led to the increasing adoption of a commercial specification of  a 45%
protein meal with 8-10% fat, which could, of course, be achieved, and
milled, without solvent extraction. The trend started with the
largest renderers back in the early 1960s, not "in the late l 970s and
early 1980s especially in the period 1981/82" as the typical
rationale has it. Moreover, the major UK renderers doing this were
not only doing it in the UK but in their factories in continental
Europe (plus of course there was a substantial export trade from the
UK).<P>

I have heard that two small renderers in Scotland carried on solvent
extracting after everyone else had stopped, but that is hearsay.
In any event, research in the last few years on the conditions
necessary to inactivate BSE infectivity demonstrates that the
steam-stripping process would be most unlikely to have inactivated it.<P>

The economic benefit of removing the two unnecessary processes, is
interlinked with the changes in technology that made it possible, in
operating scale and in concentration of the industry into fewer larger
units. The economics were obviously significant in the 1970s after
the oil crisis of 1973 onwards (more from energy usage than from
solvent, which was recovered); and the safety aspect even more
significant in the UK in view of the general tightening up on
industrial safety after the Flixborough disaster in June 1974.<P>

So it would seem that the changes in processing started much earlier
than is generally supposed, and were not confined to the UK.<P>

Regarding the background of ultra-low prevalence of sporadic BSE, This
seems possible. Some experts still have reservations about sheep meat
and bonemeal as the sole source, particularly with regard to how the
sheep scrapie prion changed, during passage through cattle, to the BSE
prion. Some of those offer the view that BSE has always existed at low
and previously unrecognised level in cattle, and the inclusion of
cattle meat in the animal feed resulted in an amplification effect.
Some older farmers and vets now say, with hindsight, that it has
always existed, but occurred so rarely that when a cow had "the
staggers" nobody recognised it as anything but an inexplicable one-off
event. <HR>

<CENTER><H3>BSE Amendment Order of 28 March</H3>
</CENTER>
The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Amendment Order) was made on 28 March and came into force on 4 April. It prohibits the sale of meat and
bonemeal of mammalian origin, or any feeding stuff known to
incorporate it in feeding stuffs for farm livestock (including fish) or
horses; and it is an offence to use such materials for feeding farm
animals (i.e to use up stocks of such materials). So ruminant protein in
non-ruminant feed and non-ruminant protein in ruminant feed seem both
to be prohibited.<P>

  It extends to <STRONG>pet foods</STRONG> for domestic cats and dogs "produced in mills
which handle material for farm animals or horses."  But what about pet foods
produced elsewhere? Apparently not covered.  "Mammalian origin"
appears to cover chicken meat or waste or<STRONG> cattle or chicken
manure</STRONG> if incorporated in "meat and bonemeal", but <STRONG>it does not appear
that this would prevent a farmer from directly feeding such materials</STRONG>,
other than in "meat and bonemeal" form, to his animals.<P>


The ban is (broadly) on feeding mammalian protein to farm animals.
Effectively, this means that such protein will have to be destroyed. In the
UK at least, almost all petfoods use only food fit for human consumption.
All protien derived fron SBOs (specified bovine offals, the infective tissues) will be destroyed
anyway. We will be checking cattle rations to ensure that they are free of such
protein.There are no restrictions on using chicken protein.<P>

The Regulations exclude from use
in meat and bonemeal: products derived from domestic pets (other than budgies or parrots)
and pork protein, but _not_ chicken. <A NAME="The">The</A> rules do not appear to exclude the use of sheep and beef protein in chicken
and pig rations or the use of chicken (and broiler litter), <STRONG>domestic pets</STRONG> and
pork protein in cattle feed. <STRONG>Cattle and chicken manure have also been
employed in animal rations in the past.</STRONG><HR>

<B>603. Inspection of meat and meat food products</B>

              (a) Examination of animals before slaughtering; diseased animals slaughtered separately and carcasses examined 

              For the purpose of preventing the use in commerce of meat and meat food products which are adulterated, the
              Secretary shall cause to be made, by inspectors appointed for that purpose, an examination and inspection of all
              cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines before they shall be allowed to enter into any
              slaughtering, packing, meat-canning, rendering, or similar establishment, in which they are to be slaughtered and
              the meat and meat food products thereof are to be used in commerce; and all cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses,
              mules, and other equines found on such inspection to show symptoms of disease shall be set apart and slaughtered
              separately from all other cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines, and when so slaughtered the
              carcasses of said cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines shall be subject to a careful
              examination and inspection, all as provided by the rules and regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary, as
              provided for in this subchapter. 
              (b) Humane methods of slaughter 

              For the purpose of preventing the inhumane slaughtering of livestock, the Secretary shall cause to be made, by
              inspectors appointed for that purpose, an examination and inspection of the method by which cattle, sheep, swine,
              goats, horses, mules, and other equines are slaughtered and handled in connection with slaughter in the slaughtering
              establishments inspected under this chapter. The Secretary may refuse to provide inspection to a new slaughtering
              establishment or may cause inspection to be temporarily suspended at a slaughtering establishment if the Secretary
              finds that any cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines have been slaughtered or handled in
              connection with slaughter at such establishment by any method not in accordance with the Act of August 27, 1958
              (72 Stat. 862; 7 U.S.C. 1901-1906) until the establishment furnishes assurances satisfactory to the Secretary
              that all slaughtering and handling in connection with slaughter of livestock shall be in accordance with such a
              method. </PRE>
<PRE><B>604. Post mortem examination of carcasses and marking or labeling; destruction of carcasses
condemned; reinspection</B>

For the purposes hereinbefore set forth the Secretary shall cause to be made by inspectors appointed for that purpose a post
mortem examination and inspection of the carcasses and parts thereof of all cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and
other equines to be prepared at any slaughtering, meat-canning, salting, packing, rendering, or similar establishment in
any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia as articles of commerce which are capable of use as human food; and the
carcasses and parts thereof of all such animals found to be not adulterated shall be marked, stamped, tagged, or labeled as
''Inspected and passed''; and said inspectors shall label, mark, stamp, or tag as ''Inspected and condemned'' all carcasses and
parts thereof of animals found to be adulterated; and all carcasses and parts thereof thus inspected and condemned shall be
destroyed for food purposes by the said establishment in the presence of an inspector, and the Secretary may remove
inspectors from any such establishment which fails to so destroy any such condemned carcass or part thereof, and said
inspectors, after said first inspection, shall, when they deem it necessary, reinspect said carcasses or parts thereof to
determine whether since the first inspection the same have become adulterated, and if any carcass or any part thereof shall,
upon examination and inspection subsequent to the first examination and inspection, be found to be adulterated, it shall be
destroyed for food purposes by the said establishment in the presence of an inspector, and the Secretary may remove
inspectors from any establishment which fails to so destroy any such condemned carcass or part thereof. </PRE>
<PRE>605.<B> Examination of carcasses brought into slaughtering or packing establishments, and of meat food
products issued from and returned thereto; conditions for entry</B>

The foregoing provisions shall apply to all carcasses or parts of carcasses of cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and
other equines or the meat or meat products thereof which may be brought into any slaughtering, meat-canning, salting,
packing, rendering, or similar establishment, and such examination and inspection shall be had before the said carcasses or
parts thereof shall be allowed to enter into any department wherein the same are to be treated and prepared for meat food
products; and the foregoing provisions shall also apply to all such products, which, after having been issued from any
slaughtering, meat-canning, salting, packing, rendering, or similar establishment, shall be returned to the same or to any
similar establishment where such inspection is maintained. The Secretary may limit the entry of carcasses, parts of
carcasses, meat and meat food products, and other materials into any establishment at which inspection under this
subchapter is maintained, under such conditions as he may prescribe to assure that allowing the entry of such articles into
such inspected establishments will be consistent with the purposes of this chapter. </PRE>

A survey was conducted at the Randolph Packing Company to identify ways for reducing water use and waste. The beef processing plant
generates a waste load high in BOD, total suspended solids, and floatable oil and grease. The waste stream contains blood, flesh, soluble

Process changes to reduce waste load include dry cleanup of animal holding pens and collection of blood, paunches, and

Banning the feeding of ruminants to ruminants has resulted in sharply
falling rates of infection in Britain, but new infection has been continuing because
of such causes as old feed stocks on farms (in the late 80's), farmers
feeding infected chicken rations to cattle, and cross-contamination in
feed mills (extremely hard to prevent).<P>

The FDA has announced it's support of the ban, and is initiating
regulatory activity toward that result.<P>

However the American Feed Industry Association which represents the
*feed* industry does NOT agree with the call for a voluntary
ban.  Also vocally NOT supported by the Livestock Conservation
Instiute who's members include 6 major national Ag
associations, 46 producer organizations and 33 publicly
supported organizations.<P>

Of course the North American Rendering Industry does not
support the call for a voluntary ban.<HR>

<H5>U.S. GROUPS  RUMINANT FEED TO <A NAME="SAFEGUARD">SAFEGUARD</A> BEEF</H5>

Commercial Appeal  (Memphis) (CA) ... March 30, 1996<P>


Reacting  to  the  mad  cow  disease  panic  in  Britain, the United States
livestock industry and veterinary medical groups said Friday that they will
immediately  establish  a voluntary ban on the use of all ruminant parts in
animal feed.

   No case of mad cow disease has been found in this country in 10 years of
monitoring.  But  federal  officials  said they supported the move from the
livestock and veterinary groups as an extra safeguard.<P>
  
   A  <B>voluntary</B>  ban by sheep renderers in the United States has led to the
<B>removal  of  an  estimated  85 percent</B> of sheep parts in animal feed. It is
believed  the  British  cattle contracted the animal variety of the disease
from eating sheep offal that was mixed with feed.<P>

   Nevertheless,  the federal Food and Drug Administration announced Friday
that  it  ''will  <B>expedite  regulations</B> prohibiting all ruminant protein in
ruminant feeds.''
   Dr.  Michael  Blackwell,  an  FDA official, said that his agency and the
industry  agreed on the need for a broader proposal because of developments
in Britain.<P>

   The groups supporting the voluntary ban include the National Cattlemen's
Beef  Association,  the  American  Sheep Industry Association, the National
Milk Producers Federation, the American Veterinary Medical Association, the
American  Association  of Bovine Practitioners and the American Association
of Veterinary Medical Colleges.<P>

<H5><CENTER>CATTLE <A NAME="FEED">FEED</A> INDUSTRY SAYS MOVE TO
BAN ANIMAL BYPRODUCTS IS OVERREACTION</CENTER></H5>

Wisconsin State ... April 21, 1996<BR>
By: JENNIFER A. GALLOWAY AGRICULTURE REPORTER<P>

While  Britain  copes  with the devastating effects of mad cow disease, the
United  States  livestock  industry  is  <B>bickering</B>  over  whether it should
continue  feeding  animal  byproducts  to  cattle, a practice that has been
linked to the deadly disease.<P>

   On one side of the debate is the feed manufacturing industry, which says
meat  and  bone  meal  additives  are  perfectly  safe  --  at  least until
scientific evidence proves otherwise.
    On  the  other  side  is  a coalition that includes consumer advocates,
veterinarians and the country's largest cattle association. They argue that
since  the  additives  could be dangerous to human health, they must not be
fed to cattle. Scientists  believe  that  the British cattle were
infected by eating contaminated meat and bone meal.<P>

   ``It's  been  shown  that  these  additives are a risk factor for BSE in
Britain,''  said  Gary Weber, director of beef safety and cattle health for
the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. BSE stands for bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, the scientific name for mad cow disease.
   ``We are going to do absolutely everything to make sure it never happens
here,''  Weber  said.  ``We  cannot  afford  to  fix  a problem once it has
occurred.''<P>

   However  the  American  Feed  Industry Association, which represents 600
manufacturers  and  suppliers, contends there is no reason for rash action.
Rex  Runyon,  the  association's  vice  president  for public affairs, said
concern  over  mad  cow  disease  is exaggerated and that there is no sound
reason for changing bovine feeding practices.
   ``We feel strongly that any ban should not capitulate to the emotions of
an  issue,''  Runyon  said.  ``It's time for cooler heads to prevail and to
look at the science.''<P>

   The  debate  is  expected  to  heighten  April 22 when the Food and Drug
Administration  begins  writing  regulations that would ban the practice, a
process  that  will  take  at  least  several months. The government took a
preliminary  step  earlier  this  month  by urging farmers to comply with a
voluntary ban on meat and bone meal.<P>

   But  because  there is no proof that the feed supplements are dangerous,
<STRONG>farmers aren't rushing to halt their use</STRONG>.
   ``Some  farmers  might stop using ruminant protein, and some won't until
there  is  a  regulation,''  said  Randy Shaver, UW-Madison dairy extension
specialist.<P>

   Animal renderers produce meat and bone meal by grinding and mixing parts
of the cattle that are not fit for human consumption. The product, which is
rich  in  protein, calcium and phosphorous, is fed to dairy cattle, many of
which end up as hamburger.<P>

   One  million  farmers  raise  103  million  beef and dairy cattle in the
United  States,  according  to  the  cattlemen's  association. The industry
provides  $40  billion  in  direct  income  to  the  livestock industry and
generates $160 billion for the U.S. economy.<P>

   Farmers  say the practice of feeding ground cow parts to other cattle is
relatively  common  because it is a cost-effective way to meet the animals'
nutritional  needs. Plant-based supplements such as roasted soybeans do the
trick, but can cost up to 30 percent more than meat and bone eal.<P>

   A  permanent  ban  on animal byproducts means farmers would be forced to
use  alternative  and  more costly sources of protein. What's more, farmers
worry  about  what  would  become of their cattle carcasses if there was no
longer a market for the rendered parts.
   ``You  can't land-fill this stuff,'' said Jerry Lehman, president of the
Wisconsin Cattlemen's Association.<P>

   Area  feed  mill managers say they've been inundated with questions from
farmers  who  feed the additives to cattle wondering whether to continue to
do so.
   ``The  dairy  farmer  in Dane County really wants to do what is right,''
said Dan Neckvatal, marketing manager for Mounds Agri-Service in Middleton,
which sells feed additive.
   ``But  based  on  the  information we have, we don't think there is ever
going to be a problem,'' he said.<P>

   Pete  Gross,  feed  division manager for Cottage Grove Cooperative, said
some area dairies have stopped using meat and animal protein supplements in
recent weeks.
   Land  O'Lakes is heavily marketing a soybean meal substitute while other
farmers are turning to a pork-based additive, Gross said.

   ``There  is  reason  to  be  concerned about ruminant meat and bone meal
because  we  don't  know enough about it,'' he said. ``There better be some
caution out there. We don't want to wreck our market.''<P>

   It's  clear  that  even  the  poultry  industry is afraid of that. Tyson
Foods,  the  country's  largest chicken producer, has removed meat and bone
meal from its birds' diet.
   ``We  basically  did  it  to extricate ourselves from the controversy,''
said  Ed  Nicholson, a Tyson spokesman in Springdale, Ark. He said that the
additive represented less than 1 percent of the birds' diet and there is no
indication that there are health concerns regarding poultry.
   ``It's more a matter of public confidence,'' Nicholson said.<P>

          I have worked at two veterinary diagnostic labs that take

          necropsied (autopsied) away from other species and there are
          special containers designated "sheep only" into which all
          sheep parts go so that they are kept separate from
          renderable material.  Sheep remains are then incinerated as
          biohazardous waste.  All of the pathologists I've worked
          with have been very careful to follow the correct

<CENTER><h3>	Jobs vs. Mechanically Rendered Meat</h3></CENTER>
<p>AN EAST Lancashire company was today set to make legal history with a  ground-breaking legal challenge over fears about mad cow disease.
 Great Harwood Food Products, which manufactures around 580 tonnes of MRM - Mechanically Recovered Meat -  each year, claims the Government's "cave-in" over "groundless public fears" about the disease could force it to shut with the loss of 150 jobs. Around 80 per cent of its MRM is recovered from the spinal columns of cattle, the part which the Government banned the use of last year.
<p> The company has won the right to an urgent High Court review of its complaints, and the national test case could have wide-ranging implications for the whole industry.
<p> The move was sparked by a Government ban on the use of vertebrae bones in the MRM process - used to strip meat off cattle bones to make burgers and other convenience foods.
 The firm claims the Government's latest restriction is "irrational and out of all proportion to any health risks", and argues the Ministry of Agriculture had no power under European law to impose the ban.
<p> Great Harwood Food Products is the town's largest employer with an annual turnover of around £30 million, but profits have declined in recent years.
<p> MRM has continued to yield profits of around £230,000 a year and, if stripped of those, the company claims its viability will be under threat.
<p> In a written application to the High Court it said there was and never had been a shred of evidence to support fears that Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy could jump from one species to another to affect the human population. Mr Justice Buxton yesterday took little time to rule that the company had "arguable" grounds for complaint, opening the way for a full judicial review, which he said should be heard as a matter of urgency.
<p> In its application, the company said there was no scientific or even anecdotal evidence linking BSE to the extremely rare Creuzfeld-Jakob disease in humans.
<p> It added that MRM was "perfectly safe" and a minute "theoretical" risk could only arise where slaughterhouses failed to completely remove spinal cords from carcasses.

<H3><CENTER>British generator allowed to try "moo-clear" power</CENTER></H3>
<PRE>
LONDON (Jun 14, 1996 4:17 p.m. EDT) -- A British power station was given
permission Friday to test if meat from cattle culled because of the mad cow
scare can be used safely and efficiently as fuel.

The government's Environment Agency said it granted permission for generator
PowerGen to begin small-scale test burning of meat, bone meal and tallow
from the government's slaughter scheme.

"Tests and analyses will take place to confirm the material can be
successfully burned without adversely affecting the environment," the agency
said in a statement.The test is expected to last several weeks. "The test will cease should any
potential for undesirable environmental effects be noted," it said.

The test will not include any cattle product diagnosed as, or suspected of,
suffering from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) which can only be
disposed of in designated incinerators.

A BSE committee has advised the Ministry of Agriculture that incineration of
bovine material in power stations, at temperatures of 1,400 degrees celsius,
would be sufficient to ensure there was no risk to public health from smoke
or ash.

<BLOCKQUOTE><H4><CENTER>Power stations burn slaughtered cattle in quest for cheap fuel
</CENTER></H4>



BY NICK NUTTALL, ENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT, AND CHRISTINE BUCKLEY

<BR>The Times: Britain:June 15 1996<P>

A SMALL power station in the Midlands has been given the go-ahead to burn rendered meat and bone from the Government's cattle slaughter scheme.


PowerGen, which has a test station at Ratcliffe, Nottinghamshire, will assess the viability of the products as a fuel. The industry hopes that such a fuel could deliver profits of up to &#163;15 million over the next two years.

National Power is expected to receive similar approval from the Environment Agency next week for a small power station at Didcot, Oxfordshire. The agency said that the products did not include any material from cows known or suspected to have BSE. Offal, in which the infectious agent can be found, has also been removed.

<P>

The purpose of the tests, which will be carried out over six weeks at the one-megawatt Ratcliffe station, is to see how well rendered meat, bone and tallow burn and what the enviromental emissions might be. Scientific experts, advising the Ministry of Agriculture, have concluded that incinera tion of cattle material in power stations would be safe, with no risk to communities near by or downwind.

<P>

It will be the first time that electricity generators have been used for the mass incineration of animals. If the tests are successful, the beef products will be pumped into bigger, coal-fired stations.

The generators were asked by the Government to help with the huge task of incinerating cattle culled because of the BSE crisis. It is likely that power stations close to abattoirs will be used once the full operation begins. Small amounts of the beef products will be fired in the generation process, along with the coal.

<P>

Under a BSE-eradication plan being considered at a meeting of Europe's senior veterinary officers in Brussels yesterday, Britain has offered to cull 80,000 high-risk older beasts. However, a full-scale use of cattle products as fuel would require generators to consider other issues, such as the concerns of local residents and workers.

<P>

Roger Lilley, industry and pollution spokesman for Friends of the Earth, said yesterday: "This obviously represents a new departure for the power industry. We hope that there will be comprehensive monitoring of the emissions, particularly of the organic compounds, such as dioxins, which may well be produced from the burning of animal matter.

<P>

"We would like to see proper evaluation of any effects on public health, particularly of the communities living near by. Our other main concern is that this appears to be yet another example of how industry is being allowed by the Government to circumvent the normal processes of applying for planning permission for waste disposal. It appears that the Government is happy to turn a blind eye to the power stations operating as de facto animal waste incinerators."

Slaughtered cattle may be burnt at power stations </CENTER></H3>

The Times May 13 1996<P>

THE Government is seriously  considering using slaughtered cattle as  fuel in power stations, Tony Baldry, the  junior Agriculture Minister, said yesterday.  <P>Cattle over 30 months old, regarded as  more likely to be infected with mad cow disease, are being slaughtered under a &#163;630  million scheme to keep them out of the food  chain and restore consumer confidence in  beef. The Ministry of Agriculture expects  the much-delayed scheme, which began formally  on May 1, to become "fully operational"  today. Up to 25,000 cattle will be killed  every week. <P>Farmers said yesterday they  wanted cattle to be killed at a faster rate  to clear the backlog of at least 150,000  unsaleable animals and to enable them to  start receiving compensation. Farmers will  be paid on average between &#163;480 and  &#163;800 per animal. <P>Mr Baldry said  all options for the animals were being considered.  Prosper De Mul der, the biggest animal waste  rendering company, said: "Bone meal [from  cattle] produces more energy per tonne than  chicken litter, which is used in some power  stations, and has about two-thirds the energy  value of coal."

From Greenwire:<P>

     The British government is reportedly offering a plan to fuel
electric power plants with the ground-up meat and bones of the
millions of cows set to be destroyed to combat mad cow disease in
the UK.  David Naish, president of Britain's National Farmers
Union, said the plan could help to offset the "huge cost" of

<h3> L'Oreal  <A NAME="recalls">recalls</A> Cosmetics Products made with Beef  <hr></h3>

   PARIS -- European cosmetics makers, including France's L'Oreal SA, will recall products made with beef tissues as part of a broader effort to prevent the spread of "mad cow" disease to humans, European consumer affairs commissioner Emma Bonino told Journal du Dimanche.<p>



   She revealed the decision of the producers ahead of tomorrow's extraordinary meeting of European Agriculture ministers in Luxembourg, following last week's EU ban on exports of all beef products from the U.K.


   The ban stems from the discovery that there may be a link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, known also as "mad cow" disease, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans who ate beef from infected cattle.<p>



   European cosmetics makers have agreed to pull products made with beef tissues from shelves, and companies will use alternative ingredients in the future, French daily Le Journal du Dimanche reported Bonino as having said Friday.


   Until that happens, some consumers prefer not to take any chances.


   "We had one client earlier who was asking all sorts of questions about what went into Estee Lauder creams," said Martine Drauart, a cosmetics vendor at Bon Marche department store in Paris.<p>


   Cosmetics makers use a variety of beef by-products in the composition of products, including fat as an emulsifier in skin creams. The animal parts most likely to carry disease, Bonino reportedly told consumer protection representatives at a Brussels meeting Friday, are brain tissues, eyes and tissues from the central nervous system.<p>
   "I imagine it'll take a few days to see whether this really changes peoples' behavior," Drauart said.


   If the consumer reaction to the "mad cow" scare in edible beef products is a gauge, cosmetics makers could be in for a tough campaign to prevent a collapse of sales.<p>



   Since the first report of a link between BSE and the brain-wasting disease in humans, beef sales in French stores have fallen as much as fifty percent. Stores are using measures such as labeling beef products "made in France" to reassure consumers, but this has done little to win back customers.<p>



   Outside France stores are being hurt too. "In Italy, our Continent stores have seen a similar drop in beef sales, as well as in virtually all the countries where we have a presence," said Corinne Henry, director of marketing for Promodes SA, France's second-largest supermarket and mall chain operator, recently.<p>

Neue Z¸rcher Zeitung 7.7.95/8.8.95
The article followed a report from the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge, England, with a section on the use in pharmaceuticals of
substances derived from cattle. According to Jean-Christophe MÈroz of the IKS, which licenses pharmaceuticals, some 170 products on the
market in 1992 contained bovine products.<P>

 Of these, 40 had been withdrawn voluntarily, 15 had been reformulated to replace bovine
material for a different animal source such as porcine material, 20 had been prohibited by the IKS because of an unfavourable cost/benefit
analysis, and the remainder were still in production because of their irreplaceable medical value and very low risk, of which bovine insulin
was an example. <HR>

<CENTER><H3>U.S. Cosmetics Industry -- Not to <A NAME="Worry">Worry</A></H3>
</CENTER>
   NEW YORK -- From cosmetics, candy and gelatins to drugs for diabetes, hay fever and arthritis, there are beef parts in dozens of products Americans use every day. 

   Worries about the safety of British beef spread beyond just steaks and chops Wednesday when the European Community ordered Britain to stop exporting all beef-derived products including ice cream, candy, cosmetics and drugs.<p>



   U.S. scientists noted, however, that very few of these products use pieces of the steer's brain and spinal cord, the only parts of the steer's body where mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encepthalopathy, has been found.


   The most widely used beef product is collagen, the spongy substance derived from beef skin or bones. Collagen is often an ingredient in ice cream, custards, cheeses, candies, sausage casings and cosmetics.<p>



   Even if it were found to be a carrier, the vast majority of the collagen in U.S. products comes from domestic beef because it is so plentiful, said Bob Rust, professor emeritus in meat science at Iowa State University.<P>

   The FDA, prior to approval of any drug with beef products, requires the manufacturer to certify that the beef only come from countries free of the disease, he said. <I> [Wrong - manucturers have refused to do this, saying they take  their supplier 's word for this-- webmaster]</I> <p>



   The variety of drugs derived from cattle parts is diverse and includes:


<UL><LI>Growth hormones come from the cattle pituitary glands.

<LI>Adrenalin products for hay fever, asthma and other allergies, from the adrenal gland.

<LI>Cortizone, for arthritis, asthma, shock, also from the adrenal gland.

<LI>Insulin, for diabetics, from the pancreas.

<LI>Tissues used as patches during heart bypass surgery, from the bovine pericardial tissue.

<LI>Thromboplastin, a blood coagulant used in surgery, from the brain.

<LI>Drugs for the treatment of stomach ulcers.

<H3><A NAME="japan">Japanese</A> Pharmaceutical makers ordered to shun British beef</H3>

 TOKYO, April 10 (Kyodo) _ The Health and Welfare

Ministry on Wednesday advised pharmaceutical makers across the country not to

use British beef and beef products in the manufacturing of medicine and

cosmetics to prevent the spread of ''mad cow'' disease in Japan.
The ministry also called on wholesalers and retailers to halt imports of

medicine and cosmetics containing substances from British cows.</P>

Cattle in several European countries have been infected with a protein that can

cause mad cow disease or BSE, a form of brain degeneration resulting in death,

but the outbreak has been particularly severe in Britain.
Recent research indicates that humans who eat infected meat could develop

Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), the human equivalent of the cattle disease. At

least 10 CJD patients in Britain are believed to have contracted the disease

from eating beef.</P>

The health ministry guidance comes on the heels of an import ban on British beef

and beef products for food consumption, imposed by the Agriculture Forestry and

Fisheries Ministry late last month.

<P>
The ministry also called on

drug makers who use cattle substances for their products to quickly declare

which parts of the animals they process and their raw materials' country of

origin.</P>

<h3>FDA <A NAME="Crack-Down">Crack-Down</A> on Beef Products  April 3, 1996</h2>
WASHINGTON _The Food and Drug Administration is planning to close a regulatory loophole that allows dietary supplements and cosmetics to contain ingredients from cattle  with "mad cow disease."<P>
The proposed action comes after evidence surfaced that the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, might be linked to Creautzfeldt-Jacob disease, a rare, fatal brain disease in humans.<P>
Many supplements and cosmetics, ranging from "energy boosters" to "anti-aging creams" contain beef proteins or hormonal extracts from bovine organs and glands....
FDA officials have grown increasingly concerned ... that a contaminated cosmetic could infect a person through a cut in the skin or contact with the eyes, providing easy access to the brain.<P>Herds in at least five European countries are known to harbor the cow disease.  with little or no documentation to indicate the country of origin for bovine ingredients, consumers cannot be certain that the products are free of the disease agent, experts said.<P>

Representatives of the food supplement and cosmetics industry said keeping track  of indivdual sources for every lot of product sold would be unnecessarily burdensome.  Instead they rely on promises from supppliers that ingredients come from countries without the cow disease.

To Manufacturers and Importers of <A NAME="Dietary">Dietary</A> Supplements and Importers of Cosmetics:<BR>
August 17, 1994  FDA Attachment B


The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is recommending that firms
that manufacture or import dietary supplements and cosmetics
containing specific bovine tissues (see Appendix A) ensure that
such tissues do not come from cattle born, raised, or slaughtered
in countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) exists
(BSE-countries). Extracts of these tissues and ingredients derived
from these tissues are also of concern. The recommended actions
are precautionary measures to reduce potential risk of human
exposure to, or transmission of, the agent which causes BSE in
cattle.<P>


At this time, FDA is not extending the recommendation in this
letter to dairy products or gelatin, because available evidence
does not suggest transmission via these foods. Furthermore, meat
(i.e., skeletal muscle) is not covered by this letter. For
guidance on importation of meat and other products regulated by
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), refer to Title
9 of the Code of Federal Regulations.<P>


The Agency is providing the following information to explain why
it believes that BSE may potentially be a concern with certain
dietary supplements and cosmetic products. BSE has been identified
in more than 100,000 cattle in the United Kingdom and, to a much
lesser extent, in several other countries. BSE has not been
diagnosed in the United States. This neurological disease is a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) and is similar to
other TSEs such as scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease
(CJD) in humans. The spongiform encephalopathies are uniformly
fatal and no rapid diagnostic test for infection in living animals
or humans is presently available. Current scientific information
indicates that the causative agent is extremely resistant to
inactivation by normal  disinfection or sterilization procedures.
A range of research projects into the exact nature of both the BSE
agent and other TSE agents, host range, patterns of pathogenicity,
and development of rapid ante mortem diagnostic tests is ongoing.<P>


Since 1991, USDA has prohibited the importation into the U.S. of
certain tissues and organs from ruminants from countries where BSE
exists (BSE-countries; see 9 CFR 94.18). USDA's regulations are
intended to protect livestock in the United States from
contracting TSEs and address known or strongly suspected modes of
transmission. For the up-to-date listing of BSE-countries please
contact USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
at (301) 436-7830.<P>


The USDA regulations permit, under certain conditions, the
importation of some cosmetic ingredients (i.e., collagen, collagen
products, amniotic liquids or extracts, placental liquids or
extracts, serum albumin, and serocolostrum) derived from ruminants
from BSE-countries; see 9 CFR 95.4.<P>


The USDA regulations do not apply to imports of:
<UL>
    <LI> o    cosmetic products that are packaged and ready for sale;

   <LI>  o    bovine-derived materials intended for human consumption
          as either finished dietary supplement products or for
          use as ingredients in dietary supplements; or

<LI>     o    human food (except meat, i.e., skeletal muscle).
</UL><P>

While documented transmission of the causative agents of BSE or
scrapie to humans has not been reported to date, the FDA wrote to
manufacturers of dietary supplements in November 1992, alerting
them to the developing concern about TSEs in animals and CJD in
man. That letter recommended that manufacturers voluntarily
investigate the geographic source(s) of any bovine or ovine
material used in their products (generally neural or glandular
tissue or tissue extracts). The Agency also suggested that each
manufacturer develop a plan "to assure, with a high degree of
certainty," that such materials are not from BSE-countries, as
identified by USDA's APHIS, or from scrapie-infected sheep flocks,
either foreign or domestic.<P>


FDA now considers further protective steps to be reasonable and is
restating and expanding its recommendation to manufacturers and
importers of dietary supplements and their ingredients, to develop
plans for ensuring, with a high degree of certainty, that specific
bovine-derived materials (see Appendix A) from BSE-countries are
not being used. The Agency is also recommending that manufacturers
and importers of cosmetic products and their ingredients develop
the same type of plans. FDA is not, at this time, recommending
restrictions on the use of ovine-derived materials in the
manufacture of dietary supplement and cosmetic products and
ingredients, as the epidemiological evidence now appears
convincing that scrapie is not related to TSEs in humans.<P>


FDA believes it is prudent to expand its recommendation to
cosmetics and cosmetic ingredients because extracts of listed
tissues, e.g. sphingolipids isolated from brain tissue and
extracts of bovine placenta, are used in cosmetics. Additionally,
FDA is unaware of data demonstrating that processing techniques
used in the manufacture of cosmetics will inactivate TSE agents.
Further, little is known about the potential human risk of
transmission from topical application of cosmetics containing TSE
agents to intact, broken or abraded skin.<P>


To assist manufacturers and importers whose products are within
the scope of this recommendation in developing their plans, the
following guidance is provided:<P>

<UL>
   <LI>  a.   To ensure that bovine-derived materials (listed in
          Appendix A) used in the product(s) are from non BSE-
          countries, identify all countries where the animals used
          were born, raised or slaughtered. The supplier of the
          bovine-derived materials should provide the necessary
          records.

  <LI>   b.   Maintain traceable records for each lot of bovine-
          derived material and records of products containing the
          materials.

  <LI>   c.   Maintain records for those products manufactured at
          foreign sites or by foreign manufacturers which contain
          bovine-derived materials.

<h3><center>Farmers Evade Controls on Diseased Sheep and Cows</center></h3>
<p>
The Lancashire Evening Telegraph reports farmers 'cheat on <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> controls.'
 East Lancashire consultant microbiologist, Dr Stephen Dealler, has condemned rogue farmers who evade controls against the spread of <b>mad</b> <b>cow</b> disease by forging certificates and bogus cattle tags. At least 1% of all cattle in England are infected and estimate range up to 10%.
<hr> 
Another version of cheating has been smuggling diseased cattle out of Northern Ireland.  Animals there are covered there by the ban on British beef.  The Country of Ireland has  a much lower incidence of the spongiform disease and its beef products are not banned.  Egypt recently lifted its ban on 5700 ship-bound animals that had been at port for over a week.<hr>
More commonly, farmers have learned to recognize early on the symptoms of scrapie in sheep and BSE in cows and get the animals to market while they still have value as consumer meat.  In the U.S., animals that cannot stand up in the stockyard are  deemed fit only for the lower-value rendering and cosmetics/protein supplement markets.<hr>
Ironically, honest farmers in Britain who have sought to keep their herds healthy by reporting sick animals immediately have been frustrated by Veterinary Officers under orders from MAFF not to acknowledge BSE cases.  An Oregon woman recently destroyed a whole herd of scrapie-infected sheep on a voluntary basis without any government compensation.
<hr>
<h3><center><a NAME="Beef">Beef</a> Producers Blame Dairymen for Losses</center></h3>

BEEF farmers fear many of them could be ruined by plans for the cull and disposal of all cattle over 30 months old, which the Government is expected to announce this week.

Tens of thousands of prime steers and heifers reared for the beef market have become virtually worthless because the animals happen to exceed this age limit and can no longer be used for food. Beef producers believe they are being asked to carry the can for dairy farmers whose herds account for 90 per cent of the nearly 160,000 confirmed cases of "mad cow" disease so far recorded.<p>

Under the cull plan, agreed with Britain's EU partners, farmers will be compensated at a rate of 86p per kilogram liveweight, which will average at about &#163;480 per animal destroyed. The EU will pay 70 per cent. This is roughly the market price dairy farmers would have got for the 15,000 barren old cows sent for slaughter every week at the end of their working lives. The carcasses will now be burnt.
<p>

Dairy farmers can sell milk from their cows. Their steers and heifers are eligible for sale as beef provided the animals are slaughtered before 30 months, which they normally would be.

By contrast, beef farmers are estimated to have up to 100,000 prime steers and heifers for which there is now no market because the animals are older than 30 months. Many would go under if they were paid no more for these high-quality animals than the going rate for a worn-out dairy cow.<p>

James Burnett, one of the biggest cattle farmers, has never had a case of BSE in the 1,400-strong herd of pedigree Charolais and Belgian Blue cattle he and his brother rear at Burridge Farm, near Newark, Nottinghamshire. In normal times, they kill up to 5,000 steers a year at between 33 and 34 months, the slaughter age for these Continental breeds, to supply beef to France and Italy. Since March 26, exports have been banned by the EU and the cattle are now too old to be sold for beef here.<p>

"The cattle would normally fetch up to &#163;1,100 each," Mr Burnett said. "If we are compensated at the same rate as for old dairy cows we would lose up to &#163;400 per animal. As our profit margin is only &#163;30 a head, we would be ruined. All our cattle are fed on vegetable waste and have never been given the kind of rations that caused BSE."<p>

<b><a NAME="Listserve">Listserve</a> Item</b> of 10 May 96<br>
I have been prompted by a question from a dairy farmer to comment on the
statement that beef farms are less affected by BSE than dairy farms. Using
empirical data on age-specific incidence rates of BSE, I can only conclude
that they are not. Fewer beef herds have been affected by BSE (ie: the
reported status of "BSE-affected") primarily due to the smaller size and
younger age of the animals in beef herds. The animals within those herds do
not appear to be less exposed to the BSE agent.<p>

Bob Stevenson, the president of the British Veterinary Association, said that some farmers might be tempted to extract teeth from mature cattle to make them
appear young enough to qualify for human consumption. <p>

Scientists predict that hundreds of cattle will still be dying
every year from BSE at the turn of the century. Researchers at
Oxford University's zoology department claim that from 1996 to 1999 between 15,000 and 24,000  cattle will develop the disease because of failure to enforce
controls on contaminated feed. <p>

Among signatories to their warning letter in the science journal Nature is Sir Richard Southwood, former vice-chancellor of the university, who produced the first report on BSE for the Government in 1989. The Agriculture Ministry said that since March,

<h3><center><a NAME="Oregon">Oregon</a> Department of Agriculture press release</center></h3>July 12, 1995. <p>

 Testing of
nearly 200 ground beef samples gathered at random from retailers around the state showed fewer violations than three years ago-- the last time the Oregon Department of Agriculture tested ground beef for fat content.
 ODA's Food Safety
Division periodically checks samples to make sure that the fat content statement on the label of the package is accurate. <p>

If the percentage of fat or category of ground beef stated on the label differs from lab testing, the retailer is in violation. 
"Out of 195 samples, we have found 18 violations or a violation rate of about 9%,"says McKay. "Compared to what we saw a couple of
years ago when we had a violation rate of 22%, this doesn't appear to be as much of a problem."<p>

Regular ground beef has a maximum fat content of 30%. Lean ground beef has
a maximum of 22% fat. Extra lean ground beef has a maximum of 16% fat. Anything exceeding those specific levels is a violation. <p>

Most of this year's violations deal with the actual number printed on the label. As an example, one sample labeled 9% fat content has been
confirmed by testing to contain nearly 14% fat. Although that product can still be identified as extra lean ground beef, the label is

<font SIZE=+1><p><a NAME="Irish">Irish</a> Conceal BSE Outbreak to Protect Lucrative Exports<p></font></center><p>

<i>Sunday London Times 5 May 1996<p></i>


<p>"The Irish government deliberately broke European Union (EU) rules by failing to inform Brussels officials of the latest incidence of BSE, detected in Cork three weeks ago, it was claimed this weekend, writes Valerie Hanley.

<p>The claim was made by senior EU sources, who said the effected animal was not disposed of properly and that the department of agriculture failed to destroy adequately all other animals in the herd.

<p>Officials from the department failed to carry out post mortem examinations on the entire herd, despite assurances given by, 
Ivan Yates, the agriculture minister, in January. The department said post mortems were not needed because the cattle were not destined for consumption.

<p>The Sunday Times has also learnt that another case of BSE in a herd at a North Tipperary farm was reported to the department in February. officials ordered the slaughter of all 250 animals, but the case has yet to appear in official statistics. 

<p>News of the latest BSE case comes as an embarrassment to Yates, who strongly criticized the handling of the BSE crisis in Britain. he claimed last week that the BSE scare had been caused by British incompetence and said that there should be " a complete depopulation of high risk herds"

<p>The new case in Cork is the 11th this year. It was diagnosed three weeks ago, when Yates and the food board, were launching a large promotional campaign to reassure consumers that beef was safe. 

<p>The campaign resulted in the lifting of a Egyptian import ban on Irish beef, worth (pounds sterling) 300 m each year, and moves by officials to resume live exports to Iran and Libya worth up to (pounds sterling) 100 m.

<p><a NAME="Iran">Iran</a> banned Irish beef after the Sunday Times exposed an international ring that sold ear tags and blank health certificates which could have allowed unscrupulous dealers to export infected animals. 

<p>The case in Cork emerged when the Sunday Times made inquiries on Friday about recent BSE cases. The infected animal was buried at the farm and up to 183 other cattle in the herd were killed at an abattoir normally used to process meat for family butchers. the carcasses of the animals were sent to a rendering plant, where body parts were crushed and heated before being put in storage pending final disposal.

<p>This process contradicts statements made by  Yates in January, when he said all animals which might have the disease in herds where bse was diagnosed would be given rigorous post mortem brain tests. 

<p>Each incidence of bse should be reported to the European Commission and a spokesman for the agricultural department said yesterday that the commission had been notified promptly about the Cork case. 

<p>A spokesman for Franz Fischler, the EU agricultural commissioner, said yesterday that he had, however, been unaware of the recent BSE case until he was contacted by the Sunday Times. Officials had immediately contacted the agriculture department in Dublin and asked why it had failed to report the outbreak.

<p>"Member states are obliged to notify the commission about BSE and we are very annoyed about Ireland's behavior,: he said. "look what happened when the UK concealed information"

<p>Dr. Alan Long, a bio- and organic chemist with Britain's vegetarian economy and green agriculture agency (vega), said yesterday the way the animals had been disposed of was "unsafe and risky". the safest way to destroy cattle from a herd where bse had been diagnosed was to slaughter them in special, dedicated abattoirs.
Long's recommendation coincide with the practice followed by the british agriculture ministry.

<p>"If you really want to get rid of BSE you would cremate the animals," said Long. "if you slaughter the animal in an abattoir where other work is carried out, their is a danger of cross contamination."  There is also a risk of contaminating water supplies when animals were buried. 
<hr>
24 April 1996 List-Serve message:<p>

"Irelands cattle kill was disastrously down by over 80% on pre-British Mad
Cow BSE levels this week.  Last night, beef industry statistics revealed that less then 5,000 cattle
were processed at Irish plants-- a staggering
85 % less than average processing levels three weeks ago.<p>

Before the British crisis erupted on March 27 last, Irish beef plants were
slaughtering an average of 30,000 cattle per week.
Within just seven days, that through put had dropped to just 12,000 head-
with this weeks paltery 5,300 head kill representing
the biggest ever decline at Irish slaughter plants.<p>

On 24 April 1996, beef processors and cattle exporters admitted that Ireland faces
"a chaotic scramble" to cope with the estimated
50,000 finishing cattle that are already stored on Irish farms."
The reason for this is not that the sales of beef are down here. We export
85% of our beef and these international markets have been closed to us since
March 20. As a result with no markets there is no point slaughtering cattle.

BY PHILIP WEBSTER AND MICHAEL HORNSBY</FONT><BR>

The Times: Britain: 2 May 1996<P>


JOHN MAJOR promised a speedy investigation yesterday after a chaotic start to the &#163;630 million cattle slaughter scheme. Farmers, abattoirs and livestock auctioneers said they had no clear guidelines, and Tony Blair described the launch as inept.

<P>

The Labour leader said in the Commons: "People say that there are insufficient collection centres, that there may be inadequate capacity for incinerating the carcasses and that many farmers appear to be in the dark both about the details of compensation and how it is actually going to operate."

<P>

The Prime Minister replied: "I have already made my own inquiries to make sure that such information as is necessary is distributed and made available to farmers speedily. This is a very large scheme. It's going to involve the slaughter of 15,000 to 20,000 animals a week.

<P>

"The scheme is finalised and we moved immediately to make sure that farmers had the information they needed. Most of them should have. If some haven't, that is now being examined and investigated and I hope they will have it very speedily."

<P>

Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said in the Commons on Wednesday that the slaughter of cattle over 30 months old, regarded as crucial for restoring consumer confidence in beef, would start yesterday. Alison Best of the National Farmers' Union said: "There is huge confusion. Farmers took Mr Hogg at his word and started contacting abattoirs and livestock markets this morning but were told to stay away.

<P>

"Once the scheme does get up and running, which might be next week, there is going to be chaos without some procedure for rationing access to slaughterhouses. At the moment it looks as if there will be a free-for-all, which would be disastrous."

<P>

Paul Gentry, a senior auctioneer at the Newark-on-Trent market in Nottinghamshire, said: "The situation is farcical. Mr Hogg seems to be totally out of touch with reality. We still do not know where to send cattle for slaughter, on which days, or how we will be paid. Many beef farmers in my area are at their wits' end, with feeding costs mounting daily for cattle they cannot sell."

<P>

An abattoir owner, Peter Bowyer of Hatherleigh, Devon, said: "We have got only the sketchiest idea how the scheme will work. Crucial details, such as the slaughter fee we will be paid and where we will send the carcasses, are still being negotiated with the Ministry of Agriculture."

<P>

Ian Gardiner, the NFU's chief policy director, said: "The total backlog of over-age cattle awaiting slaughter on farms could now amount to at least 150,000 animals. We simply do not know the exact figure. But it will take several months just to clear this log-jam. It is vital that the slaughter starts soon."

<P>

Tony Baldry, the junior Agriculture Minister, said that ministers and officials had been working hard to set up the slaughter scheme. The rate at which animals could be killed was limited by the capacity of abattoirs and rendering plants. He added: "Not all these animals can be slaughtered overnight. Why every farmer is complaining is that they want to try and ensure their cattle are among the first slaughtered. This has to be done in an ordered way that has regard to the welfare of the livestock."

<P>

Beef farmers are insisting that they should get priority. Dairy farmers are under less pressure because they can go on selling milk from their cows until slaughter and the compensation they will receive &#173; an average of about &#163;480 a head &#173; is similar to the market price they would have fetched.

<P>

The decision to keep cattle over 30 months old out of the food chain was taken more than a month ago with the backing of the European Union and the retail trade. These animals are considered at greater risk of being infected with BSE or "mad cow' disease.

<H3>'Mad cow' slaughter off to slow start</H1>

<P>May 2, 1996<BR>


<P>BANBURY, England (CNN) -- Efforts to begin slaughtering cows 
linked to the so-called "mad cow" disease got off to a rocky 
start Thursday, sparking renewed criticism that Prime 
Minister John Major's government was dragging its feet on the 
issue.
 </P> 
<P>No cows have been killed yet, though the government says the 
program is officially under way and Agriculture Minister 
Douglas Hogg said the slaughter would likely start Thursday.</P>

<P>The British government wants to keep cattle older than 30 
months from entering the food chain. Its plan to deal with 
the mad cow crisis includes a voluntary cull of older cattle.
    </P> 
<P>The government's plan calls for markets to be used as 
collection centers. Farmers will bring their cattle in on 
designated days, the market will reimburse the farmer and in 
turn, the government will reimburse the market. 
      </P> 
<P>But Major's opponents have criticized the plan. "At the 
moment, it appears pretty inept," Tony Blair, leader 
of the opposition Labor Party, said in the House of Commons.</P>


<P>Farmers are not too thrilled, either. Farmer Brian Smith says 
he is totally in the dark about the plan. "I just don't know 
how they work the figures out and I don't follow their 
reasoning at all through the whole system," he said. </P>

<P>Farmer Sue Fraser says she thinks the slaughter is only to 
appease the European Union, which has imposed a ban on 
British beef.</P>

<P>She and other farmers, many of who face financial ruin, say 
reimbursement will help but not really compensate for the 
loss of a herd.</P>

<P>The government expects that some 42,000 cows with possible 
links to BSE will be slaughtered in coming months. In 
addition, up to 15,000 older cattle a week may be 
slaughtered. </P>

<P>The animals will be killed with a special pistol. The cattle 
will then be ground up and either incinerated or buried, said 
Jean Auty, a spokeswoman for Britain's Intervention Board, 
which is handling the slaughter.</P>

<P>Many farmers are bitter about the impending slaughter of 
healthy cattle, but, at the same time, fear even that will 
not be enough to bring back consumer confidence -- at home 
and abroad. </P>

<P>The embattled industry got a minor boost Thursday when the 
hamburger chain Wimpy said it would put British beef back on 
the menu. But Burger King and McDonald's say they are not 
about to follow suit, yet.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Farmers">Farmers</A> angry at continuing beef ban</H3></CENTER>

BY MICHAEL HORNSBY</FONT><BR>

The Times: Britain: 2 May 1996

 DOUGLAS HOGG faced growing anger and frustration from the farming community yesterday over his failure to make clear progress on getting the European Union ban on British beef exports lifted.

<P>

Milk producers said they feared the Agriculture Minister would be forced to agree to a much bigger cull of prime dairy cattle than the limited slaughter of up to 42,000 animals he proposed at his meeting with EU counterparts this week in Luxembourg.

Animal welfare campaigners joined farmers in criticising the Government for delays in starting the compensated slaughter and disposal of cattle over 30 months old which can no longer be sold for food.

<P>

During the past five weeks at least 150,000 cattle above the age limit are estimated to have accumulated on farms, a figure that is increasing by up to 20,000 every week. Many farmers are desperate to get rid of these animals and receive some payment for them.

<P>

Mr Hogg insisted yesterday that he had "put in place a process that could lead to the lifting of the [export] ban". He also claimed there had been "no substantive criticisms" in Luxembourg of his proposal for culling dairy cattle most at risk of developing BSE but admitted he had agreed to "listen to constructive suggestions" for tougher measures.

<P>

Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said: "We cannot afford to have the EU's politicians indulging in a step-by-step approach whilst the livelihoods of farmers and others in the meat trade are on the brink of disaster."

<P>

<A NAME="High-risk">High-risk</A> parts of beef carcasses, including thymus glands and spinal nerves, are still turning up in butchers' shops, a survey in Birmingham says. The city's consumer department said the parts were found in seven shops which had bought the meat with a health guarantee. Slaughterhouse veterinary inspectors who passed the beef as BSE-free may now be prosecuted.

 :    BSE has been identified in more than 100,000
                    cattle in the United Kingdom and, to a much
                    lesser extent, in several other countries
                    (France, Republic of Ireland, Oman, Portugal
                    and Switzerland). BSE has not been diagnosed
                    in the United States. This neurological
                    disease is a transmissible spongiform
                    encephalopathy (TSE) and is similar to other
                    TSEs such as scrapie in sheep and Creutzfeldt-
                    Jakob Disease (CJD) in humans. The spongiform
                    encephalopathies are uniformly fatal and no
                    rapid diagnostic test for infection in living
                    animals or humans is presently available.
                    Current scientific information indicates that
                    the causative agent is extremely resistant to
                    inactivation by normal disinfection or
                    sterilization procedures. A range of research
                    projects into the exact nature of both the BSE
                    agent and other TSE agents, host range,
                    patterns of pathogenicity, and development of
                    rapid ante mortem diagnostic tests is ongoing.<P>


                    Since 1991, USDA has prohibited the
                    importation into the U.S. of certain tissues
                    and organs from ruminants from countries where
                    BSE exists (BSE-countries: United Kingdom,
                    France, Republic of Ireland, Oman, Portugal
                    and Switzerland - refer to 9 CFR 94.18).
                    USDA's regulations are intended to protect
                    livestock in the United States from
                    contracting TSEs and address known or strongly
                    suspected modes of transmission.
                    The USDA regulations permit, under certain
                    conditions, the importation of some cosmetic
                    ingredients (i.e., collagen, collagen
                    products, amniotic liquids or extracts,
                    placental liquids or extracts, serum albumin,
                    and serocolostrum) derived from ruminants from
                    BSE-countries (see 9 CFR 95.4).<P>


                    The USDA regulations do not apply to imports
                    of:

                           human consumption as either finished
                           dietary supplement products or for use

                    Documented transmission of the causative
                    agents of BSE or scrapie to humans has not
                    been reported to date. The FDA has recommended
                    that manufacturers who use bovine by-products
                    voluntarily investigate the geographic
                    source(s) of any bovine or ovine material used
                    in their products (generally neural or
                    glandular tissue or tissue extracts). The
                    Agency also suggested that each manufacturer
                    develop a plan "to assure, with a high degree
                    of certainty," that such materials are not
                    from BSE-countries, as identified by USDA's
                    APHIS, or from scrapie-infected sheep flocks,
                    either foreign or domestic.<P>


                    FDA now considers further protective steps to
                    be reasonable and, in an August 17, 1994
                    letter (Attachment B), recommended that
                    manufacturers and importers of dietary
                    supplements, cosmetic products, and
                    raw materials for these finished products
                    develop plans for ensuring, with a high degree
                    of certainty, that specific bovine-derived
                    materials from BSE-countries are not being
                    used.<P>



                    Attachment A is an expanded list of those
                    tissues presenting the highest known risk of
                    infectivity, e.g., high-risk tissue, which are
                    the subject of this import alert.  Additional
                    tissues may be added to this list as studies
                    warrant and this import alert will be revised
                    accordingly.<P>


                    FDA will be gathering information on the
                    development of BSE plans for all bovine-
                    derived tissues and documenting the use of
                    high-risk tissue from BSE-countries during
                    domestic inspections under both the cosmetics
                    and dietary supplements compliance programs.<P>


                    Due to the difficulty in verifying the
                    presence of high risk tissues in finished
                    dietary supplements or cosmetic products, this
                    import alert is limited to bulk lots of these
                    tissues from BSE-countries.<P>


                    FDA is not, at this time, recommending
                    restrictions on the use of ovine-derived
                    (sheep) materials since the epidemiological
                    evidence now appears convincing that scrapie
                    is not related to TSEs in humans.<P>


GUIDANCE  :         Districts may detain the shipment without
                    physical examination, if the high-risk bovine
                    tissue or ingredient, as listed in Attachment
                    A, originated from one of the six (6)
                    following countries: United Kingdom, France,
                    Republic of Ireland, Oman, Portugal and
                    Switzerland.<P>


               ***  If an entry is detained and the importer or
                    manufacturer has not provided within sixty
                    (60) days documentation that establishes that
                    the bovine derived tissue used in the product
                    came from BSE-free cattle or from a non BSE
                    country, districts should attempt to determine
                    the status of the entry and, where possible,
                    reach a final determination as to the entry.
                    Sixty (60) days should be ample time for an
                    importer or manufacturer to provide such
                    documentation.<P>


                    Districts may provide a copy of the Agency's
                    August 17, 1994 letter (Attachment B) to
                    importer's for their use in developing plans
                    to assure that future shipments of bovine
                    tissues are obtained from non-BSE countries.<P>

<CENTER><HR>
<h3>Britain Says Beef Sales Recovering After Health Scare</h2></CENTER>

<blockquote><blockquote>By JOHN DARNTON ... April 17, 1996  ... NY Times
<p>   

LONDON  --  Four weeks after setting off a public scare about the
safety of British beef because of mad cow disease, the government
said Tuesday that beef sales in Britain were recovering.
<p>   Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg told Parliament that Britain's
consumption of beef was back up to 85 per cent of the level before
March 20, when the announcement was made of a possible link between
the fatal bovine disorder and a similar disease in humans. He said
that market sales of cattle had reached 60 per cent of its
pre-crisis levels.
<p>  <B> But Hogg did not mention the deep price-cutting that
supermarkets have instituted to lure back consumers. Some have been
selling beef at 50 per cent off the usual price and many of those
doing the buying appear to be poorer families trying to stretch
their food budgets.</B>
<p>   Cattle farmers say they are taking heavy losses and that when
the animals can be sold they are going for prices that are down by
about one-fifth.
<p>   Hogg provided the sales figures while presenting some details of
a modest culling of cattle in an effort to further restore consumer
confidence and a program of compensation to slaughterhouses, beef
renderers and cattle farmers.
<p>   Moments before he spoke, Prime Minister John Major, whose
Conservative government has been widely criticized for its handling
of the crisis, told Parliament that Britain would go to the
European Court of Justice to challenge the worldwide export ban on
British beef and beef products imposed by the European Union on
March 27.
<p>   An extra impetus for the court challenge came over the weekend
when the agricultural commissioner of the European Union, Franz
Fischler, said in an interview with Reuters that he himself thought
British beef was safe to eat but that the ban was needed as a way
to restore confidence. His remarks, widely covered here, angered
farmers and government officials.
<p>   Agricultural representatives from the 15-nation group are
supposed to meet at the end of April to consider whether British
measures are sufficient to lift the ban.
<p>   Hogg said that a previously announced program to kill and
dispose of all cows over 30 months of age as they reach the end of
their productive lives, at a rate of about 15,000 a week, would
begin April 29.
<p>   The program will affect mostly dairy cows, which live longer
than cattle raised for beef and show a higher incidence of mad cow
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The aging dairy cows
will be destroyed rather than sold for use in food products, as
most are now.
<p>   Farmers would be compensated at a rate of about $750 per cow.
For six months the government would pay an extra "top up" to
owners of steers and heifers over 30 months old. Customarily these
are slaughtered at a younger age but some breeds mature later and
are worth much more than diary cows.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Rescue">Rescue</A> Package for the Beef Industry</CENTER></H3>

 THE rescue package for the beef industry announced yesterday by the Agriculture Minister will cost nearly &#163;1 billion in the first year and is likely to involve the destruction of more than a million cattle.

<P>

Farmers last night welcomed the announcement from Douglas Hogg as a first step towards putting the industry back on its feet after the crisis over the possible link between "mad cow" disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. But they were concerned about the threat of further culls and said many farmers could still suffer serious financial loss.

<P>

Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said: "Prompt payment of the compensation and the removal of devalued carcasses from cold stores will help the industry as it attempts to meet the renewed public demand for beef." Tony Loud, who runs a 200-cow family dairy farm near Okehampton, Devon, said: "The compensation announced by Mr Hogg for old milking cows is acceptable. But we are very worried by his reference to possible further selective culls of animals deemed to be susceptible to BSE. We do not see any need for that at all."

<P>

James Burnett keeps 1,100 prime beef cattle near Newark, Nottinghamshire, which are all over the age of 30 months and face destruction. "The compensation for beef farmers like me is not as bad as I feared, but I could still face a loss of up to &#163;250,000 over a full year," he said.

<P>

About &#163;630 million of the aid package will be spent on the slaughter and disposal of cattle over 30 months old, which are considered to be at greater risk of being infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

<P>

There will be &#163;110 million to help slaughterhouses. Some &#163;80 million of this will be used to buy an estimated 40,000 tonnes of stockpiled beef which cannot be sold because it comes from older cattle or because there is no demand. The meat will probably have to be destroyed.

<P>

In addition, up to &#163;80 million will be paid to abattoirs and farmers for the slaughter of male calves from dairy herds immediately after birth. Nearly all these animals, up to 500,000 a year, were previously exported for the continental veal trade. They may now be made into pet food.

<P>

Rendering plants, which specialise in processing animal waste, will receive &#163;118 million in aid. Mr Hogg said the plants had "substantial surplus capacity" and would be mainly responsible for treating and burning the waste material, offal and carcass meat that would no longer be allowed into the food chain.

<P>

According to an audit prepared for the Ministry of Agriculture by the accountant Coopers &amp; Lybrand, 15,000 old cows and 6,000 beef animals over 30 months old will have to be slaughtered and destroyed each week, implying the destruction of about a million cattle in a year.

<P>

Old cows at the end of their productive life would have been slaughtered anyway. But instead of being turned into burgers and pies they will be destroyed. Farmers will get 86p a kilogram liveweight, averaging nearly &#163;500 per animal, roughly the market price they would have fetched before the BSE scare.

<P>

The European Union will pay 70 per cent of the cost of this compensation. But the Government will have to pay for the disposal of the carcasses. It will also pay a top-up payment of 25p a kilogram to owners of prime beef cattle over 30 months old, which are much more valuable than old dairy cows.

<P>

There are estimated to be 300,000 prime beef cattle on farms above this age limit which cannot now go into the food chain. To clear this backlog alone in a year, the animals would have to be slaughtered and destroyed at a rate of about 6,000 a week.

<P>

Mr Hogg said he was looking at other ways of identifying individual cattle or groups of cattle more likely than others to develop BSE that could be culled selectively in addition to those over 30 months old. But there would be no question of killing whole herds just because they had had a few cases of BSE.

<P>

He said: "The models we are looking at involve limited numbers of individual animals &#173; in the low tens of thousands and not hundreds of thousands &#173; and do not provide for the slaughter of whole herds."

<P>

The proposals for a selective cull are due to be presented to European Union Agriculture Ministers at the end of this month. There is no chance of the EU's worldwide ban on British beef being lifted until other member states have seen the proposals.

<P>

Mr Hogg said he was still discussing with the Environment Department the best and safest way of disposing of unwanted carcasses after they had been treated by rendering plants.

<P>

* A legal challenge by the British Government over Europe's beef ban would be boosted by the Farm Commissioner's admission last week that the ban was needed to shore up the European beef industry (Frances Gibb writes). Lawyers say there is no doubt that the Commission has power to impose a ban but they believe it must be done on public-health grounds.

<P>

The likelihood of success, some lawyers believe, is quite high: the grounds for legal challenge would be that the ban was disproportionate to the risk it sought to avoid. But as any legal action in the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg would be likely to take at least ten months from start to final court ruling, the chief benefit of lodging proceedings could be as a bargaining counter in any negotiations to have the ban lifted.

<P>

* The families of eight people who died from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after treatment with a human growth hormone obtained from the pituitary glands of dead bodies launched a High Court claim yesterday for compensation. They allege that the Government and Medical Research Council were negligent in administering the treatment.

<CENTER><H3>Beef products in drugs, candy, foods supposedly safe</H3>
</CENTER>






   NEW YORK -- From cosmetics, candy and gelatins to drugs for diabetes, hay fever and arthritis, there are beef parts in dozens of products Americans use every day. Scientists say the "mad cow disease" scare enveloping Europe should affect none of them.<p>



   "The public health risk is about as close to zero as you can get," Russell Cross, director of the Institute of Food Science and Engineering at Texas A&M University, said Thursday.<p>



   Worries about the safety of British beef spread beyond just steaks and chops Wednesday when the European Community ordered Britain to stop exporting all beef-derived products including ice cream, candy, cosmetics and drugs.<p>



   U.S. scientists noted, however, that very few of these products use pieces of the steer's brain and spinal cord, the only parts of the steer's body where mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encepthalopathy, has been found.<p>



   The most widely used beef product is collagen, the spongy substance derived from beef skin or bones. Collagen is often an ingredient in ice cream, custards, cheeses, candies, sausage casings and cosmetics.<p>



   Even if it were found to be a carrier, the vast majority of the collagen in U.S. products comes from domestic beef because it is so plentiful, said Bob Rust, professor emeritus in meat science at Iowa State University.<p>



   In addition, the manufacturing process for collagen and related products often involves extreme heat and chemical treatments, virtually ensuring the disease won't survive, the experts said.<p>



   When it comes to drugs, the Food and Drug Administration takes an extra safety step, said FDA spokesman Lawrence Bachorik.<p>



   The FDA, prior to approval of any drug with beef products, requires the manufacturer to certify that the beef only come from countries free of the disease, he said.<p>



   The variety of drugs derived from cattle parts is diverse, said Craig Morris of the American Meat Institute, a marketing a research organization:<p>

-- Fetal bovine serum, bonemeal, bloodmeal<P>


-- Adrenalin products for hay fever, asthma and other allergies, from the adrenal gland.<p>



-- Cortizone, for arthritis, asthma, shock, also from the adrenal gland.<p>



-- Insulin, for diabetics, from the pancreas.<p>



-- Tissues used as patches during heart bypass surgery, from the bovine pericardial tissue, a membrane enclosing the steer heart.<p>



-- Thromboplastin, a blood coagulant used in surgery, from the brain.<p>


-- Growth hormones come from the cattle pituitary glands.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE><A HREF="/~tom/chicken_medline.html">Six medline abstracts on chicken prion</A>
<CENTER><H3>TCEs: Transmissable Chickeniform Encephalopathies</H3></CENTER>

What are the prospects for TCE in chickens?  We expect it certainly, from the extended <A HREF="/~tom/gibbs_principle.html">Gibbs Principle</A> that states every vertebrate will exhibit an uneradicatible, endemic level of TSE disease from natural germline and somatic mutation.  So far, chickens are only non-mammal for which the primary structure of prion is known.  While the chicken sequence aligns well in spots (ominously, almost perfectly to toxic fragment 92-122) , serves as the best match to a chicken genomic DNA library, and occurs as a single copy in a single ORF, it has not actually been shown to be orthogolous to mammalian prion  [e.g., myoglobin and hemoglobin both bind oxygen] and overall sequence agreement is so-so.  Homology is always complicated by the potential fusion of remote individual domains.  
<P>
Supposing that chicken gene is only paralogous, there could be a second undiscovered orthologue of it in mammals, which would then be a promising candidate for a new (though related) class of prion diseases, under the paralogous Gibbs Principle. So far a mammal probe has been used in chicken, but a degenerate chicken probe has not been used in mammals.  Thus mammals could, in fact, have an undetected additional prion-like gene with  a <A HREF="/~tom/gibbs_principle.html#superfamilies">corresponding second form</A> of prionic disease.<P>

One special problem with chicken prion is its hexapeptide repeat, which occurs in 9 rather faithful copies.  While the repeats occur in a comparable region to the 4-5 repeats of placental mammalian octapeptide repeat and the 4 repeats of marsupial nonapeptide,  it is hard to infer an ancestral vertebral sequence that could give rise to 6x9=54, 8x5=40, and 9x4=36 (but see <A HREF ="#below">below</A>).  Further, polymorphisms involving extra repeats and repeat deletions have been reported in cow and in familial CJD (where they cause roughly half the adjusted incidence). This is evidently a very labile region.   
<P>
Chickens are a highly inbred and long-domesticated species; the prion sequence may be unrepresentative of the avian lineage.  We can't rule out, without more sequences from the lower vertebrates, the worry that birds normally have a 4-5 fold repeat, and that <B>the 9 repeats in domestic chicken correspond to comparable pathogenic inserts seen in humans.</B>  That is, every chicken could be inadvertently incubating a TSE.  In support of this, repeats R3, R4, and R5 are <A HREF="#identical">identical</A> as DNA in White Leghorns (as noted in PNAS 89: 9097 1993), i.e., the duplication is so recent that not even  silent mutations have had time to accumulate.  In human CJD, additional octapeptide usually have accommodate 2-3 wobble nucleotide changes in the new repeat event; thus the modest changes in R7-R9 could also be very recent repeats in chickens.  Silent third codon positions are not equilibrated, supporting recent amplification (or need for stable hairpin in nucleic acid).
<P>
In short, we have a pressing need for more prion sequences from  (so-called) lower vertebrates, for this reason and also to augment currently failing BLASTp homology searches.  That is, we have prion back to sharks, but can't find it in C. elegans, Drosophila, or yeast.  A phylogentically motivated list of the "10 most wanted" prion sequences might include other birds, lisards, turtles, frogs, bony fish, notochordates, tunicates, echinoderms, amphioxus, and so on. (The yeast psi system is not homologous; while a welcome addition, it may fade in relevence as researchers gets deeper into the particulars.)
<P>
Indeed, the main paradox in prion evolution is the absence of paralogues in the face of extraordinary sequence conservation.  That is, if it is truly not in yeast or C. elegans, where did it come from and where is the rest of its superfamily?  Otherwise, it has to have undergone burst evolution from something now unrecognizeable into something that has hardly changed in135,000,000 years  [ie, changed function]. 
<P>
By comparing chicken, marsupial, and mammal repeat regions, it emerges that nearby but different stretches of DNA were amplified in a series of events.  Thus the repeat regions are not structurally homologous to each other, though their ultimate function may be similar. Beginning with a short palindrome, the forestem was repeated in mammals, the backstem in chickens. The repeat region may be analagous to <A HREF="/~tom/repeats_other_dis.html">trlnucleotide repeat</a> neurological genes, serving to modulate translation and in situ translocation.  Repeat-CJD may thus be a gene dosage effect or mis-compartmentalization, and not arise from the altered protein structure per se.
<P>
Because the chicken sequence is quite divergent, it is best to clamp the sequences by domain and to specific anchors, such as the known leader signal peptide,  cysteine cross-bridge, glycosylated asparagines, alpha helices, beta sheets, and GPI tail, using conventional alignment between the clamped residues. (Homology software has difficulties with divergent sequences involving insertions and deletions and makes no use of 3D information in optimizing alignments.  Having aligned the sequences, it is then instructive to <A HREF="#Variation">compare</A> variation in beta strands, helices, and so on across species.  The core region (post-repeat, pre beta 1) is the region best conserved across all species (as expected a ligand binding site or hydrophobic core); unfortunately, it was  lost in preparing sample for 3D NMR.  It is predominantly basic with prolines N-terminal but very hydrophobic except for one lysine in the C-terminal 16 residues, which scores high in theoretical alpha helix forming potential because of the many alanines.

<CENTER><H3>Nearly-neutral mutations from primates</H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The <B>principle of secondary polymorphisms</B> can be applied to human prion protein to predict non-CJD causing polymorphisms.  The idea here is that normal prion sequences in phylogenetically adjacent species provide candidates for neutral changes in the target species.  The variations are presumed nearly-neutral because  they became established in a host population from an earlier consensus sequence via Kimura drift across Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium heterozygosity.  Differing auxillary genes can weaken applicability.
<P>
 As more CJD control genes are sequenced, these variations are predicted to be preferentially observed.   A few human alleles are <A HREF="/~tom/chromo.html">already known</A> that don't seem to cause CJD in and of themselves but may modulate disease course or a species barrier.  The analysis assumes that nascent pathology is not masked by the shorter life spans in other primates.
<P>
Beginning at the N-terminus using gorilla, orangutan, human, and chimp, we find <B>six candidates for neutral polymorphisms</B>.  The table below shows these relative to known structural features of prion protein: one occurs in the signal peptide, two flank helix H1, and three occupy the variable loop between beta stand B2 and helix H3. (No allowance has been made for coordinated changes attributable to residue-residue interaction in the 3D structure.)  With less certainty, this analysis could be extended to old world monkeys, and a similar analysis could be performed centered on cow and artiodactyl nearest-neighbors.

Mutation in the prion gene seems driven by structural issues in prion DNA: at sites where contemproray mutations are occuring, we find the same substitutions, despite the genetic code offering alternative conservative single base change options and empirical transition/transversion expectations in humans.   
<P>
While we now have three "<B>hot spots</B>" along the prion gene for CJD-causing mutations,  this does not necessarily mean that the amino acids at these positions play exquisitely sensitive roles in the 3D structure or in triggering pathology.  Enhanced occurrence could simply be a by-product of special chemistry and conformation within the sequence.  A previously compiled  <A HREF="/~tom/chromo.html">list</A> of deleterious mutations in human prion gene collates explanations for hot-spot frequency and aligns CJD-causing mutations in humans to seemingly harmless polymorphisms in sheep and cow.
<P>
How many familial CJD cases will it take to attain '<B>saturation</B>' of the genetic map?  That is, what changes in what codons can pathologically affect prion structure-function.  This is hard to answer from screens.  More rapid progress, at some cost in interpretability, could result from  site-specific, directed mutagenesis of a chimeric transgenic mouse.  By constructing specific point mutations by the thousands (as done for lac repressor) and inserting them individually back into the host, we could probe systematically which changes cause TSE, as a probe of prion domain structure-function.
<P>
Worldwide <B>re-occurrence</B> is seen of the _same_ lethal FFI first codon position GAC to AAC transition resulting in  asp to asn change at codon 178,  just before the second alpha helix [Neurology 47:1313 Nov1996].  This same change has now been seen in lineages from Italy, Ireland, and Japan, mainly in a met/met background at codon 129.  Multiple lineages are also known at codon 102, where spontaneous deamidation of  a methylated C may account for the high frequency of localized mutation. 
<P>
The high frequency of insertions and deletions in the  <B>octapeptide repeat region may induce CJD by a different mechanism</B>. Extra octapeptide repeats don't necessarily act through perturbation of prion protein structure; indeed, the region is <A HREF="/~tom/chicken_medline.html#Processing">cleaved off</A> in chickens.  The repeats may function primarily in mRNA; CJD resulting from a dosage effect (increased translational efficiency) or improper in situ localization of synthesis.  In <A HREF="/~tom/repeats_other_dis.html">other neurological repeat disorders</A> repeat amplification is attributed to a looped-out hairpin on the lagging strand and replication read-through (Mol Cell Bio 16:6619 1996). 
<HR width=55%>
We have been told for years that <B>sporadic CJD</B> comprise 85% of all cases; indeed, a whole speculative literature has grown up around this subject (spontaneous conversion to rogue conformer, somatic mutation, etc.).  The question now arises whether sporadic CJD is not being squeezed out of the picture by improved genetic studies and conventional dietary / iatrogenic transmission.
<P>
Collinge et al. have found prion <B>promoter polymorphisms</B> in CJD victims.  Further, an  amino acid change at a new codon, R208H, has just been added [Neurology 47:1305 Nov1996] to the growing list of prion gene mutations seemingly sufficient to cause familial CJD.  The change is an A to G transition at the second position within the codon, causing an arginine to histidine shift  in the middle of the final 18 residue long alpha helix.<P>

There are two reasons for <B>mis-classification of sporadic CJD</B>.  First, it is easy to miss a family history (that  can be inferred at codon 208 from a younger sibling): early death from other causes, inadequate querying, short generational history, and so on.  Second, it seems that earlier prion gene gel techniques have been inadequate.  With DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis), an 8M urea-formamide gradient amplifies the melting point differences of mis-matched hybridization pairs arising from single base changes and deletions and gives better detection of genetic changes.
<P>
A <B>remarkable finding with ALS</B>  could have applicability to  sporadic CJD: again making it genetic after all, even though in ALS the coding region of the gene is normal.  A tissue-specific (motor cortex and spinal cord) error occurs in mRNA intron editing, yielding an erroneous protein sequence. Either some non-ORF mutation is giving cellular RNA-processing machinery the wrong directions for removing the introns, or a mutation has occurred in the processing machinery itself 
<P>
The prion gene also has introns, but these are upstream of the coding region.  Experimentally, prion protein itself would not normally be sequenced in a case of sporadic CJD because it is faster and safer to work on DNA.  Usually, just the ORF DNA is sequenced. Introns are long tracts of DNA with little selective pressure, so  irrelevent polymorphisms will make it hard to isolate causative events.  Each such case of sporadic CJD might have its own separate genetic basis.  There are a variety of reasons why these might not show up as familial (penetrance only in conjunction with other factors, etc.).

<CENTER><H3>Is prion protein unusually evolutionarily conserved?</H3></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Most people have the impression that prion protein sequence is extraordinarily conserved, at least in the mammalian lineage.  To make this quantitative, I took  an out-of-date compilation of 40 not-necessarily-representative protein families for which the rate of change is known.  Common units are accepted point mutations (PAMs), changes per 100 residues per 100 million years, adjusted for multiple hits at the same site, as per Dayhoff.  The mean PAM was 19, with median 14 and standard deviation 18, for this data set. 
<P>
 More convenient units (multiply by 1.85) for comparisons to prion protein would be changes per 250 residues per 135 million years (our earliest node, excluding chickens), with a mean of 35, median of 26, and a standard deviation of 33.  The sorted data set in these units is: 0.5, 0.6, 3.1, 3.1, 3.3, 4.3, 5.2, 7.8, 8.3, 9.3, 9.8, 9.8, 12.4, 13.1, 14.3, 16.9, 20.4, 22.2, 24.1, 25.9, 25.9, 25.9, 31.5, 31.5, 31.5, 37.0, 37.0, 46.3, 46.3, 50.0, 55.6, 61.1, 61.1, 74.1, 79.6, 79.6, 88.9, 98.1, 109.3, 131.5
<P>
A better data set needs to be larger and computed relative to the same phylogenetic tree, that is, the same bird-marsupial-placental divergence dates.  Neither the mean nor the standard deviation is currently robust: ie, dropping the two highest values lowers the mean to 31 and the standard deviation to 27.
<P>
To compute the PAM for prion protein, one must decide how to handle three special situations, namely, whether to include the signal peptide and the cleaved GPI sequence (or only look at mature protein, recalling that  fibrinopeptides evolve wildly whereas fibrin does not) and how to handle changes in the octapeptide repeat region (where the unit of change is roughly the octapeptide unit itself, not a single nucleotide).  The rate needs to be figured for individual  positions, separate domains, as well as globally.
<P>
Including the chicken sequence would drastically raise the prion PAM rate .  The alternatives are to say (1) chicken prion is actually an inbred defect and atypical of birds, (2) chicken prion is only paralogous, (3) chicken prion is orthologous but the molecular clock runs unevenly, bursts of evolution have accompanied development of new features and functions of the mammalian nervous system.  There seem to be no examples of function has abruptly changed in some lineages but not others, without gene doubling.
<P>
There is obviously a difference between PAMs [point accepted mutations that propagated across a population and became established within a species]  and the much commoner narrow mutational events that occur in an individual but, for whatever reason, never becomes established. The former mutations are important to prion structure-function analysis; the latter to natural background BSE incidence.  In species like cows where individuals number in the billions (unlike, say, pandas), rare events happen happen every year. 
<P>
Consider  the oft-sequenced protein, cytochrome c.  Here, the "invariant" residues slowly evaporated over time as the net was cast wider; today only a few core residues remain in this category.  Placental mammals and marsupials diverged 135,000,000 years ago and 'early vertebrates' now go back closer to a billion years.  The prion gene has changed slowly but the record is held by histone iv, with one difference between humans and peas. 
<P>
This still begs the question why some regions of prion protein are as conserved as we see them, given the mild impacts of total deletion. Prion protein may have an conventional ligand-binding  function that would not be particularly sensitive to sequence change, but that in the course of its maturation, processing, and turnover, it must maintain binding sites for a large and disparate group of other proteins. In this scenario, prion protein has little "wiggle room" not because its job on the outer cell membrane is so exquisitely sensitive to structural disturbance (or particularly important) but because of the sum total of all these other constraints.  With some work, one could check whether other GPI proteins exhibit similar anomalies.
<P>
It is important to align the DNA separately from the protein to partition genetic changes between hairpin structural signalling and conventional amino acid roles.  In this case we already know there is a strongly conserved <A HREF="#c">helix C</A> in the nucleic acid, overlaying and out of phase with the first octapeptide repeat.  Third codon position change (silent mutations) in the 4-codon amino acids (val, ala, thr, pro, gly, and also arg, ser, and leu) componetize selective pressure between nucleic acid and protein realms.  That is, there should be slower Kimura drift where nucleic acid structures are important.  If not, we obtain a dating technique for the repeat region, based on non-equilibration at silent codon positions.
<P>
By examing changes in closely related species such as macaques, where confusing over-writing second mutations aren't expected, the distribution of silent mutations along the length of the gene can be determined.  It is important to reccognize the difference in purine and pyrimidine third position useage by various amino acids, (i.e., keep transitions and transversions separate).  By restricting to conserved amino acids, the desired parameter is isolated.
<P>
The chart <A HREF="#use">below</A> shows type of codon used along the prion gene and so the opportunities for measuring variation in third position for comparable <A HREF="/~tom/chickens.html">conserved</A> amino acids.

Mouse prion protein fails to translate as expected, with the third amino acid in the first repeat, <BLINK>codon 53</BLINK>, not represented in protein [JMB 245: 362 1995], probably due to a transcription error from a weakened 3'hairpin stem.
<p><CENTER><IMG  SRC="colorbar_anim.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="1"></CENTER><p>
The consensus sequences below show possible a small internal duplications within the pre-repeat region nucleotide helix C, GG-NRYP-Q, that possible occurs again much later between alpha H1 and beta B2 (with loss however of the helix c hairpin, VYY not substituting for GGG).  This region itself has additional small repetitive character of its own, YYR, found internally in H1 and B2, or alternatively triple repeats of RY and YR.  These regions may be very ancient areas of prion gene extension, attributable to replication slippage or unequal crossing over.

Recall with a random string of 20 amino acids used equally, there are 400 possible pairs, 8,000 triplets, 160,000 quartets and so on. Prion protein is approximatly 250 amino acids in length; one does not expect to see a sequence like GGxNRYPyG repeated by chance.

<BLOCKQUOTE>In yeast, where nearly all genes have been experimentally deleted, a goodly proportion were deemed non-essential to normal colony growth. Of these, a surprising fraction were assigned a <B>modulatory role</B>.  That is, rather than being in the mainstream of intermediary metabolism, they only fine-tuned some process.  Further, the cell often had some compensatory mechanism that could come into play in a deletion setting.  Evidently there can be considerable selective pressure to maintain a non-essential gene.  This could all be applicable to prion protein.
<P>
Why wasn't the rogue conformer possibility eliminated during evolution -- sheep are struck down in their prime reproductive years. Does it exist by happenstance or could a second conformer have an unsuspected in vivo value that could explain its ongoing evolutionary availability?
<P>
<CENTER><IMG  SRC="colorbar_anim.gif" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="1"></CENTER><p>
<CENTER><H3>Prion paradox or just so-so software?</H3></CENTER>
Suppose we take some homology alignment software off the Web and align a batch of prion sequences only to find (as Southward's and Prusiner's groups have) that something we know to be wrong is returned as the best phylogenetic tree.  
<P>
The options are that (1) the consensus of a century of anatomical, embryological, paleontological, and mega-sequencing data is wrong, and we should be using prion phylogeny to correct the situation, (2) the software algorithm is insufficiently sophisticated, gave the wrong result, and the nodes in error should be examined by eye to see what, if anything, is going on.  
<P>
There is a widespread misconception that phylogenetic software is somehow 'objective' when in fact it simply incorporates personal decisions and weighting preferences of the programmer.  An expert on protein crystallography may be able to align the sequences much better by eye, using software results only as the point of departure (for bulk processing).  The best analogy is in medicine: do you believe your internist or the 'expert' computer system that commented on your blood panels?
<P>
In other words, we are not studying prion protein not because of any interest in revising vertebrate evolution; the known tree should drive our study of prion evolution. In this situation, we require optimal alignment with respect to a constrained tree.  Otherwise, the tail is wagging the dog.
<P>
Now it is often not possible to reproduce computer alignment results because they are seldom published in detail and the software version number used has long since vanished (if it even runs at all on a current computer).  However, it is worth asking what information about prion protein could possibly come out of analyzing conflicted nodes:
<P>
It may turn out that deletions or insertions in the octapeptide region and elsewhere have thrown off the software  --  deletions are historically the Achilles heel in automatic alignment scoring.   Another scenario is mutations on top of previous mutations have reverted or obscured a sequence's real changes.  Constrained to the standard tree, we may  correctly infer what happened in seemingly improbable events.
<P>
The situation for prion protein is that a lot is known about domains beyond the primary sequence.  Cysteine residues, glycosylation sites, helices, beta structure, GPI and signal cleavages provide <B>internal anchors for alignment:</B> thus homology software also needs to be clamped to regions between these fixed points.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><H3>Understanding Prion Structure and Stability</H3>
</CENTER>
<CENTER><TABLE WIDTH="580">
<TR><TD   VALIGN=Top ><BLOCKQUOTE>Wuthrich et al. made an important observation (Nature 382: 180 1996): mouse prion fragment 121-231 is <B>markedly bipolar</B>: one side of the disks is negative, the other positive.   They interpret this latter feature as electrostatic binding to a negatively-charged outer phospholipid plasma membrane surface which then orients the negative face of prion protein outwards. 
<P>
The  dimensional scale is missing from the article but fortunately the axis of helix H1 is parallel to the plane of the diagram, so an axial translation of 1.5 Angstrom per residue is appropriate. Overall the fragment of prion protein studied would fit into  a <B>35 x 35 x10 angstrom box</B>.  It thus has a high surface area to volume ratio compared to a globular protein of the same size.
<P>
Prion protein  has a GPI anchor already so it doesn't need  electrostatic binding to anchor itself to the membrane.  Major plasma membrane components like sphingomyelin, cerebrosides, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, phosphatidyl choline, sterols, and integral membrane proteins can provide neutral membrane amphipathicity; neuronal membranes are highly specialized mosaics; and prion protein is reported localized within calveolar patches.  Bipolarity is not consistently reported from other GPI caveolar proteins. The undetermined amino terminus of mature prion could mask the fragment's positive surface.  In short, <B>the proferred explanation for bipolarity is problematic</B>.
<P>
The authors do not calculate the electric dipole moment and  dipole axis corresponding to this surface, nor did they measure it by dielectric constant relaxation frequency.  An accurate calculation is easy given refined coordinates [Biophys J 94:1550 1993]; as a point of departure, the Glockshuber-Wuthrich structure can be modelled as a oblate ellisoid and the dipole moment estimated (with an unscreened uniform dielectric coulombic model) at some <B>225 debyes orthogonal to the plane of the disc</B>  with only the 3 histidines presenting a computational issue at the isoelectric point.   (Coordinates can be reverse-engineered from published rendered projections using  "thin-sectioning" techniques in IHS color space.) Charge separation is thus a force holding the protein together and could contribute to the exceptional stability of prion protein to heat denaturation or to kinetics of renaturation.
<P>
Now the three <B>alpha helices have significant dipole moments</B> of their own (from aligned hydrogen bonds and peptide bonds) not related to that from surface charge, unlike the beta sheet.  These align constructively along the helical axis to form macrodipoles (positive axis N-terminal) of 39, 43, and 59 debyes.  The pattern is out-of-sequence anti-parallel, ie, there are constructive dipole-dipole interactions between pairs of helices and also with the bipolar dipole, as the dipoles are oriented nose to tail and a few angstroms apart in the 3D picture.  Normally,1H NMR  directly correlates helix dipole strength and amide proton chemical shifts (J Mol Biol 222: 311 1991).
<P>
The accompaning graphic shows the relationship between these features -- it is consistent with the idea of an <B>important dipole contribution to structural stability of prion protein</B>.   A previously predicted helix H0 at 109-122 (PNAS 91: 7139 1996) is shown in faint colors in a speculative alignment that matches its dipole with the unpaired end of helix H2.  This stretch is the core invariant region of prion protein, hardly changing from chicken to marsupial to mammal since the Devonion, and a likely site for ligand binding.  The figure also shows (with a red X) a proposed binding site for a small ligand or catalytic binding site based on dipole distribution. (Helix HO should folded over this but is not, for clarity.)  These roles for the observed surface charge distribution could either supplement the membrane binding proposal, or displace it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<TR><TD>

<BLOCKQUOTE><HR WIDTH="35%" ALIGN=Left>A very important further consideration for an alpha helix is its <B>cap</B>, commonly a macrodipole-compensatory charged residues facing the end of the helix. These need to be considered in prion structure and disease, as do the effects on helix stability of various internal changes (e.g. alanine can improve stability). The leading and trailing four residues of alpha-helices also differ from the others by a partial inability to make  intra-helical hydrogen bonds. There is a statistical preference for certain cap residues at the C and N termini that fulfill these special hydrogen bonding requirements (Nature 342: 296 1989). 
<P>
Five CJD-causing mutations are helix-proximal, <B>attributable perhaps to cap effects</B>. Internal helical changes associated with disease may follow inverse propensity to form alpha helix [given in Science 250: 646 1990], to the extent that a weakened helix is conducive to formation of the scrapie isoform.
<P>
If prion protein forms a oligomer, we might expect the dipole moment of each subunit to be antiparallel,  causing partial cancellation of the net dipole moment, as Takashima observed for tetramers such as normal hemoglobin (Biophys J 64: 1550 1993).  It is worth noting that sickle cell tetramers have a signficantly smaller dipole because of two glutamate-to-valine changes. With prion strains,  scrapie isoform seems to induce symmetric changes in cellular isoform [Science 20 Dec 1996], consistent with Monod's theory of homodimer  Z(2) symmetry and thus reinforcing anti-parallel subunit dipoles.
<P>
The final observation pertinent to electrostatics and prion protein conformational change is that of Przybycien and Bailey  (BBA 1076: 103-11 1991): <B>a chaotropic salt, KSCN, caused formation of beta sheet at the expense of alpha helix</B> in proportion to the dipole moment, fraction of charged amino acids in the primary sequence, surface area, and initial helical content, in 12 proteins.  Precipatates could not be redissolved without a solubilizing agent.
<P>
In other words, conversion of cellular to scrapie isoforms could essentially be <B>salting out</B> nucleated by a slightly abnormal isoform.  Beta sheet is commonly seen at a quaternary subunit interface.

The roles of  global electrostatic interaction in proteins are reviewed in Quart. Rev Biophys 29: 1-90 1996.  Horse cytochrome c is strongly bipolar: a 300 debye dipole contributes signficantly to interaction with substrate (JBC 257: 4426 1982). Human neuropeptide Y has a charge clustering giving rise to a  dipole moment of 325-450 debye directed toward the receptor-binding region, a dipole moment  antiparallel to that of the alpha-helix (Biochemistry 32: 2954 1993). Acetylcholinesterase exhibits charge steering (Biopolymers 39: 85-94 1996). The overall dipole moment  of red algal flavodoxin  is said to be important in its interactions with other proteins (J Biol Chem 265: 15804 1990).
<P>
There are many examples in protein chemistry where helix dipoles have been implicated in ligand binding and catalysis, reviewed in Adv Biophys 19: 133 1985, where nine examples are given of alpha helix N-termini near an active site.   For papain and  cathepsin (Biochemistry 35: 12495  1996),   tryptophan synthase (Proteins 21: 130 1995), and  thioredoxin (J Mol Biol 253: 799 1995),  a helix macrodipole has a binding role.  Cohen observed twelve proteins  with  anti-parallel orientation of neighboring helices  and concluded that "this distribution is in accordance with structure types expected if the helix macro dipole effect makes a substantial contribution to the stability of the native structure (PNAS 86: 6592 1989). 
<P>
Alpha helical caps have been found significant in many proteins:  for  lysozyme, introduced acidic groups designed to interact with dipole partial positive charge at the N-termini of alpha-helices increased stability (Ciba Found Symp 161: 52 1991) as did internal alanine; similar results were found for malate dehydrogenase (Biochemistry 32: 39131993); Tyr to Asp in cro protein was a stabilizing  capping interaction N-terminal to an alpha helix (Proteins 19: 310 1994); capping improved heat stability in ribonuclease (Nature 342: 296 1989);  histidine adversely affects alpha-helix stability  by interacting with the backbone charges (PNAS 90: 11337 1993);  and ribonuclease T1was destabilized by acidic to amide dipole cap changes (J Mol Biol 252: 133 1995).
<P>
Lys to Ser or Asp at a helix N-terminus improved neutral protease thermostability (Protein Eng 5: 165 1992); ribonuclease A also exhibited  a strong charged cap effect (Nature 326: 5631987); barnase exhibited stabilization of protein structure by interaction of alpha-helix dipole with a charged side chain and a markedly increased pKa for a histidine (Nature 335: 740 1988); in glutaredoxin, the electrostatic field associated with an alpha-helix N terminal to a cysteine residue  lowered the thiol pKa value by  5 units (J Mol Biol 253: 799 1995); and a simple set of rules accounted for the interaction of charged groups with the  alpha helix dipole in myoglobin from 62 different species (J Biomol Struct Dyn 7: 973 1990).

</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Prion protein contains three alpha-helical stretches, according to the 3D-NMR structural fragment described  in the 11 July 1996 Nature.  The first helix was anomalous in not being amphipathic: normally, looking down the axis of an alpha helix in the 'helical  wheel' projection,  one sees polar surface residues on one side and  hydrophobic interior residues on the other.  Amphipathic refers to these two faces.  The problem with helix H1 can be seen clearly from a <A HREF="/~tom/Doolittle.html">graph of Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity values</A> or the wheel below.
<P>
Wuthrich linked this observation to a proposal that the four-residue beta sheet could nucleate a much more extensive beta sheet that could be induced to propagate through this weakly bound alpha helix and loop, yielding a conformational shift to the long-sought scrapie form of prion protein.  The scrapie form might then be protease-resistant because  vulnerable loop regions are now protected.
<P>
Click <A HREF="helix_anim.html">here</A> to see an animation of this hypothetical process.
<P>
Space coordinates for the helical structures are unpublished.  In an ideal alpha helix, there are 3.6 residues per complete rotation so a rotation of 100 degrees per residue, in the clockwise direction looking N-terminal to C.  Since 18 amino acids give 5 complete turns,  positions of side chains begin superimposing in projection with this periodicity.  Mouse prion has helices of length 11, 15, and 18, as shown in the table below.  Note that helix 3 has a bent non-ideal axis; perhaps relaxation of axial strain favors the rogue conformer.  A graphic of helical-forming tendency is also provided <A HREF="#below">below</A> [values from O'Neil and DeGrado, Science 250:646 1990]; proline is seen to be totally disruptive for the N-terminal invariant core.
<P>
In addition to helical wheels for mouse prion, it is useful to align helices from the 34  species where the prion sequence is known and  <A HREF="/~tom/Doolittle.html">compute average Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobic values</A> [or similar measures] to visualize conserved features in the composite wheel.  Amino acids are <A HREF="/~tom/chickens.html#Variation">strongly conserved  overall in the helical and beta strand regions</A>, so this results in minimal change from conclusions drawn for the mouse (except for chicken).<BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><H3>Estimating the scope of the nvCJD epidemic</H3>
</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A <A HREF="/~tom/60_suspected.html">furor</A> has erupted over whether the scope of the nvCJD epidemic in humans can be reliably estimated at this point in its course.  A <A HREF="/~tom/expert_doubts.html">Lancet editorial</A> concluded this week that it could not.
<P>
By estimating the scope of the epidemic is meant a function v(t) that gives the number of victims as a function of time.  The integral of v(t) gives the total number of victims over the whole course of the epidemic.  Broadly speaking, we might expect v(t) to increase monotonically, reach a peak, then taper off, again monotonically.  From the mean value theorem, v'(t) has a zero (the epidemic's peak), v''(t) two zeroes (so a quartic polynomial will do), and v(t)at v'(t)=0 x (epidemic duration) provides an upper bound for the integral.<P>

In other words, without explicitly knowing v(t), we could make some more or less model-independent estimate if we had an expansion of v(t) in its derivatives (ie its MacLaurin series), relying on the polynomials being dense in the function space of v.<P>

Now, the data comes in  as a growing n-tuple of quarterly reports from the CJD Surveillance Unit.  Variants of this n-tuple correspond to using suspected, confirmed, age of onset, age of death, and so on.  'Suspected' is the best leading indicator but  least reliable. We saw an (accelerating) number of 60 come in from John Lanchester for October 1996.

The method of Newtonian differences is a simple approach to differential equations that anyone can use to estimate the necessary derivatives and work out the next yet-to-be reported value for the coming quarter.  Let me illustrate this with an example.  Suppose the data for the first four quarters comes in as: (0, 15, 35, 60).  Subtracting adjacent data points, one obtains (15, 20, 25).  Iterating, (5,5).  Having reached all constants, we  expand and reverse the ladder: (5,5,5, 5), 15, 20, 25, 30, 35), and finally (0, 15, 35, 60, 90, 125) to estimate 90 cases for the fifth quarter and 135, less usefully, for the sixth.  Fitting the quartic polynomial mentioned above requires a 5-tuple, though a good 3-tuple would suffice here from symmetry considerations.<P>

And one could go on and on, least squaring, fitting splines, weighting points by reliability, figuring confidence limits and so forth, ending perhaps with some sense of whether the epidemic is of Old Testament proportions (my view, given the molecular biology and the extent of  BSE) or merely equivalent to a few years of British road rage.<P>

What's wrong with this picture (and how soon will it get fixed)?  Nothing.  But quite simply, we are too early on to know what these first numbers mean.  We have only the roughest estimates to the incubation time distribution, the infectious titre of the food over time, and the genetic susceptibility range of the population. These early numbers could been from atypical individuals with atypical exposures and have little to do with parameters for the "main" epidemic. (Thnk of the whole epidemic as a linear superpositioning of mini-epidemics.) It might be minimally 2-3 years before we have a clearer picture, as the Lancet suggests, but it could also be 20-30 years.  The nvCJD epidemic might take 50 years to play itself out.<P>

One thing is clear: the British have taken on a horrible risk by under-cutting and under-funding research for the last decade. Money was spent, but on industry bail-out rather than research, in a ratio of 1000 to 1 (billions to millions).  Even now, policy focus is on rehabilitating beef sales, and facing up to the epidemic if and when it gets totally out of hand.  There is some serious ignorance at work here on the time scales needed to make meaningful progress in research and therapies.

<H1>Glossary of Scientific Terms</H1>



<P>This is one of the most

obscure subjects in microbiology. Many of the terms

make little sense even to scientists working in virology or

bacteriology.   The influx of politics and economics into the decision

making has also made things difficult to the laboratory

scientists.  Terms will be explained as if the person reading

them has a biological degree and are in alphabetical order.</P>

cell is, for some reason not broken down by the enzyme.



<DT>PrP<DD>The prion protein.  It can exist in various forms. 

One is called PrPc and is the normal type of the protein that is

found in a cell. One is called PrPsc (or PrPscrapie) that is

found in the infected cells.  It may be called PrP-res,

indicating that it is difficult to break down with proteinases.

PrP27-30 is the name of the prion protein after it has been

broken up



by protease K.



<DT>RNA<DD>Ribonucleic acid.  Often found in viruses as the

nucleic acid that caries the genome of the agent.



<DT>SAF<DD>Scrapie associated fibrils.  These are the fine

structures, seen under the electron microscope that are only

found in brains of TSEs.  It has been suggested that they are

the infective agents themselves, as infectivity can be filtered

out with a filter small enough to stop the SAF. 



<DT>Scrapie<DD>The TSE of sheep or goats.



<DT>SDS<DD>The compound used in solvents and to attatch to

proteins (and hence allow them to be electrophoretically

separated). 



<DT>SEs<DD>Spongiform encephalopathy.



<DT>SEAC<DD>Spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee. 

Tyrrell committee.



<DT>Species barrier<DD>There appears to be needed much greater a

quantity of infectivity to pass a TSE from one species to

another rather to a species that is the same as the one from

which the sample has come.



<DT>Sporadic cases<DD>The cases of CJD (or perhaps other TSEs)

that are apparently not associated with a change in the gene of

the person developing the disease and not associated with the

inoculation of infective material.



<DT>Strains<DD>It appears that some forms of a TSE in a specific

animal may have different characteristics from other forms.

These are known as separate strains.



<DT>Sulphated-glycan inhibition<DD>The chemicals that have been

found to prevent infectivity of inoculated agent.



  



<DT>Transgenic mice.<DD>These are mice carrying a specific gene

from another animal.  There may be more than one copy of the

gene (for instance, in many transgenic mice containing the human

PrP gene there may be over 20 copies) and may actually replace

the gene that is there normally.  The gene is unlikely to be at

the same site as the normal gene in the animal chromosome.  To

insert the gene requires the DNA to be inserted into the

fertilised ovum of the animal and hence is very difficult

indeed, with many failures.







<DT>Transmissible mink encephalopathy<DD> or TME.  This is the

TSE of mink and has been known for around 30 years, particularly

in the mink farms of the USA.



<DT>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy<DD>A disease that

can be transmitted from one animal to another and will produce

changes in the brain that are appear similarly to a sponge (i.e.

some of the cells are clear when seen down the microscope)



<DT>Tubulofilamentous particles<DD>The particles seen under the

electron microscope that may be associated with infectivity.



<DT>Ultrastructure<DD>The physical and chemical structure of the

<BODY>


<H2><B>A Brief History of BSE</B></H2> <P>
It would be best if I go through the history by date ro get an idea of what was in the mind of the researchers as

the various things took place.  It should be remembered that

this is such a potentially bad disease that everyone was

crossing fingers and hoping.  As a result of this, many

optimistic viewpoints were accepted where there was actually

inadequate information to justify them.</P>

<H2>What took place before 1987 and the surprise of BSE</H2>



	



Scrapie, a disease of sheep was investigated more as an oddity

and for the interest that it caused specific groups of

scientists, particularly in the UK, USA and to a small degree in

Germany. Meetings, even international ones, may have had only 20

people coming that were  involved.  As a result of this,

academic friction was high and the various groups were competing

for the minor research prizes.  Scrapie was thought of as a

disease of sheep that did not infect humans, although its

tissues were known to contain infection.  When BSE arrived, it

was immediately thought, because there were no other natural

TSEs, to be derived from scrapie and for this to have been fed

to cattle in the meal that they ate (to increase their milk

yield).  By the direction of the MAFF [British equivalent of USDA] , a change had taken place

in the way that this was made in the early 1980s and this,

taking place at a similar time to the original infection of the

cattle, was felt to be the answer.







<P>A small farm in Surrey reported more than one cow developing

a strange neurological disease.  The cattle were killed, the

brains removed, and the animals destroyed.  When it was found

that the cattle had a disease never reported before the farmer

wanted to publish the data but was told not to by MAFF. When it

is calculated, it seems that approximately 100 cattle had

developed BSE symptoms before 1987 and many more would have been

infected. 







<P>It is now suggested that MAFF had been shown cattle with this

disease before, and may have known about it in 1983, but did

nothing.







<H2><A NAME="1987">1987</A>; the publication of disease and

Southwood</H2>







Wells et al published the data showing that a cow had developed

a spongiform encephalopathy. Little extra data was given.  It

was clear, however, that MAFF realised that this was no simple

disease in that a committee was set up by them to advise on what

action should be taken to avoid any risk to humans and cattle.

By this time, it was clear that the disease was appearing all

over the country.  Possibly it spread from the West Country to

the other parts but, because of the speed of the spread this was

not clear. 







<H2><A NAME="1988">1988</A>; the year of action that was too

late</H2>







<P>Southwood, in the statement that was published stated that

there would be minimal risk to humans as all infected cattle

would be slaughtered.  By not eating the animals with clinical

illness there would be no problem and, as the disease was simply

scrapie, and scrapie did not spread to humans, we should not

expect BSE to spread to any other animals. Humans could continue

to eat bovine brain and not worry about the consequences. 







<P>The answer to BSE was to prevent all bovine material from

entering the food that was fed to cattle.  This was brought into

action in July 1988. The feed manufacturers were warned that

this was going to happen several months in advance.  The

reporting of cases of BSE to MAFF was made obligatory and half

the value of a non-sick animal was given in compensation.







<H2><A NAME="1989">1989</A>, the year of the specified offals

ban</H2>







<P>The scientific community was surprised by the relative

inaction recommended by Southwood.  The committee that was set

up by Southwood, known as the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory

Committee, immediately recommended that specific offals (brain,

spleen, thymus, tonsil, gut) should be discarded and that all

clinically ill cattle should be destroyed by incineration or

burial. By this time BSE had been transmitted to mice in the

laboratory and apparently to various zoo animals through the

eating of the same feed. Compensation for farmers reporting

cases of BSE was only half the value of the cow.







<H2><A NAME="1990">1990</A>; the year of the media hype</H2>







<P>The CJD surveillance unit was set up in Edinburgh to find out

if BSE was giving rise to extra cases of CJD.  The Parliamentary

Agriculture Committee follows a media scare on the risks from

BSE. John Gummer, at the time the Minister for Agriculture,

tries to give his daughter a beefburger in front of the cameras

outside parliament (she refused). By this time the numbers of

cases were reaching 300 per week. Compensation was stepped up to

the full value of the cow and numbers continued to rise.The

German Government decided that it would not accept British beef

as food in their country because of the risk that it potentially

had to their population.  Gummer was furious and demanded that

less strict laws be taken throught the EC Agriculture Committee.

 The amount of compensation payable to farmers for a case of BSE

was increased.  Lacey demanded that all infected herds should be

slaughted and that restocking should take place from abroad. 

Roger Eddy made it clear that he may have seen cases of BSE

before the epidemic and suggested that scrapie may not have been

its source at all.  Gummer madeit absolutely clear to the

National Consumer Council that beef was safe and said that there

was no risk whatever. A domestic cat develops what we are now

sure was BSE. An American had inoculated scrapie into a cow and

it developed a SE...but under the microscope it was not the same

as BSE.  Various schools ban beef in meals. The centre for

agricultural research in Reading demanded that MAFF let

professional independent researchers carry out the research into

BSE as the results MAFF was releasing led to hysteria.



Kiethley News shows that the number of BSE cases was building up

so fast that the various parts of the animal could not be

incinerated and had to be buried on a local tip.  Beef

consumption in the UK dropped to the lowest level since 1962. It

becomes clear that many of the cases of CJD were never reported.

 65% of doctors 'changed their habit of eating beef' due to BSE.

 All offal banned from export to the EC. A marmoset monkey

inoculated with BSE dies.







<H2><A NAME="1991">1991</A>; the year of refusals</H2>







  UK experts were sent to convince them that BSE was not a risk.

Harash Narang was told to stop carrying on his research into BSE

and its risk to humans. A case appeared in a cow that was born

after the feed ban and they were sure could not have been fed

infective material. Fears arose that BSE would also infect the

rest of Europe because we had exported infected animals there. 

The UK would just be ahead of the rest.  Strains of scrapie

confirmed by US researchers.  In the past the knackers would pay

ú30 for a cow but after 1990 they may actually charge ú40 to

take it away.  The PHLS refused to allow Narang to continue his

research.  Health and Safety executives bring in directives on

how to handle BSE infected carcases as they might be a risk to

the people involved.  Watkins the reporter from Today showed

that people that had received growth hormone inoculations were

still acting as blood donors.  It appears that some genetics of

a human makes them more likely to develop CJD and have a shorter

incubation period.  A statutory order  from MAFF prevented any

use of the specified offals; for a while they had been used for

the feed of other animals and as fertiliser.



The 'mad calf' syndrome; a calf born to a cow with BSE develops

the disease.







<H2><A NAME="1992">1992</A>; the year of the zoo cats </H2>







<P>A cheetah and the puma died of a TSE now thought to be BSE in

the food that they had eaten.  It was not clear, however how

this could have been through eating brain, as they were never

fed this.  Fatal familial insomnia is found to be a SE and due

to a genetic change.  How now mad cow?: an editorial in the BMJ

saying that we simply did not have enough knowledge to pronounce

BSE as safe. Only 85% of cattle reported as BSE turned out to be

that when looked at under the microscope: the same percentage

found with mice infected with scrapie.



More information appears concerning the epidemic of growth

hormone and graft transmission of CJD.







<P>Spending by this time had reached ú74.4 million in

compensation.







<H2><A NAME="1993">1993</A>; 800 cases per week</H2>







<P>The number of cases was still rising with approximately 800

cases reported in each week.  The vets were now being told that

many of the cases that they accepted were not actually infected

when the animal's brains were looked at under the microscope for

evidence of disease; little evidence was ever presented for this

and the rate for negatives seemed to remain at approximately

15%.  Changes were made in the way that cattle could be sold. 

The vets that had been at the auctions were decreased in hours

and a computer system was organised so that the ear tags on a

cow could be used to find out if it was from an infected herd or

not. Dealler publishes the data showing that, even using

underestimation methods, that the risk to humans was

unacceptably high for medical ethics to accept.  Farmers were

often no longer being asked at the auction if their cattle were

from an infected herd and they were receiving better prices from

the buyers as a result. Two dairy farmers with BSE in their

herds, Mark Duncan and Peter Warhurst, were found to have died

of  CJD.  MAFF claim that there was no infectivity in any tissue

outside the central nervous sytem.  A group of chemicals was

found that prevented the growth of the infective agent of

scrapie in the test tube. The mice without the prion protein

gene were grown and found not to be open to infection with

scrapie.







<H2><A NAME="1994">1994</A>; the year of Victoria Rimmer</H2>







<P>Victoria Rimmer, the 16 year old from North Wales was claimed

to be dying of CJD and for this to be due to having eaten

BSE-infected cattle.  Cattle meat was being exported for sale in

Europe without evidence that it did not come from a BSE-free

herd.  Claims were made that pressure was being put on the vets

to sign certificates without evidence.  The computer system that

had been set up was now found to be ineffective.  It could only

take information from the abattoirs and could not supply

information as to whether a cow that was being slaughtered was

from an infected herd or not.  London Zoo revealed that it was

planning to remove the top foot of soil from the  Kudu enclosure

and was destroying any faecal matter from the animals; meanwhile

it was being denied that the soil of farms could become infected

and that cattle could become endemically infected.  The large

number of cattle with BSE that had been born after the feed ban

suggested that endemic infection, or vertical infection from the

mother, could be taking place. MAFF denied this risk. 

Infectivity found in the gut of a 6 month old veal calf that had

been fed BSE when very young.  All gut and thymus from calves

could not then be eaten.  Animal protesters attempted to stop

the export of calves for veal production but little information

was passed to European countries about the risk from BSE. 



No calculations were released about the amount of these tissues

that had already been eaten.  



The start of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Research Campaign. 

The Germans were unimpressed by 'safe beef pledge' from UK.  The

EC now made it essential that any meat on the bone being

exported could only come from herds unaffected with BSE in the

previous 6 years.  Gillian Shephard had thought of this as a

success and came back and told the newspapers.  They quickly

realised it was a defeat.  A farmer suggests that

organophosphorus insecticides may be important in the cause of

BSE.  CJD reported as being in a similar prevelence in many

European countries.  It is admitted that, of 156 cases of CJD

since 1990, 22 are believed to have given blood at some stage. 

CJD in a butcher from Whitby.  Waldergrave takes over as

Minister at MAFF.  It was shown that abattoirs were attempting

to export beef that was from infected herds and that the

computer, supposedly carrying the information about all the

cattle, was not permitted to give that information out for data

control reasons.







<H2><A NAME="1995">1995</A>: the year that underreporting of

cases became clear and further farmers died</H2>







<P>It became clear that 1.8 million infected cattle would be

eaten from UK farms by the year 2001 and that most of these had

already been eaten.  Underreporting of cases in 1992 and 1993

was shown to reach 60%.  A further farmer died of CJD and a

second, was dying of what seemed to be the disease. Both were

from BSE affected farms.  Two teenagers (including Stephen

Churchill) developed CJD.  Only 4 teenagers had been reported

with CJD at any time thoughout the world. It now became clear

that the feed ban that took place in 1988 was too late.  In

fact, around 90% of the dairy cattle in the UK turned out being

in an infected herd and, due to the apparently limited in-herd

rate it seemed that the disease was, by 1988 running out of

cattle to involve.  If the ban had been in 1987 the number of

affected cattle would have been less than half.

<H2><A NAME="scrapie">Scrapie</A></H2>

<P>Scrapie is a natrually occurring disease of sheep found in
many parts of the world, btu not everwhere.  NowKNown for over
200 years, it possibly started in Spain and spread to thewhole
of western Europe.  The export of strictly bred sheep from
Britain in the ninteenth centruy is thought to be involved in
the rapid spread to other couuntries.  Work in Iceland has shown
that the land on which infected sheep graze may retain the
condition and infect later sheep, even if all scrapie-infected
sheep are removed.  Although sheep that were shipped to
Australia and New Zealand could not have been tested for scrapie
before they were sent, the illness does not seem to exist there;
eradication procedures appear to have worked.  Sheep that are
improted into those countries are kept separately for some years
before being alloweed into contact with local sheep, and scrapie
has appeared in sheep durig this quarantine period.  This makes
it extremely unlikely that an infected animal will gain entrance
to these countries.  Some countries claim to have low numbers of
cases (eg. Germany) but limited outbreaks occur apparently
randomly among unconnected flocks, despite this.  The incidence
of scrapie in a flock appears to be related to the breed of
sheep with some being relatively resistant to theillness (e.g.
scottish blackface) and others that are prone to it (herdwick,
suffolk) attempts have been made to eradicate scrapie from
certain countries (e.g. US) by slaughtere of infected flocks.
This, however, has been largely unsuccessful, and theoccurence
of scrapie has been claimed to be increasing in the UK.  Poor
statistics on the prevalence of scrapie abound, and farmers not
recognising the condition may merely slaughtere the infected
animal and fail to report it to an agricultural officer. </P>

<P>In 1936 reserarchers showed that scrapie could be transmitted
to a healthy sheep by the intra-ocular inoculation of a
homogenate of scrapie infected brain.  This experiment led to
large amounts of resrarch conernig the mode of transmission of
TSE. </P>

<P>Sheep inoculated with scrapie infected tissue intracerebrally
will have a short (possibly as low as 2 months) incubation
period, but on farms it is older sheep, usually more than 4
years old that show signs of disease.  The sheep irritablility,
excitability, and restlessness at the onset, giving rise to
scratching, biting, rubbing of the skin (hence the name scrapei)
patchy loss of wool, tremour (hence the French name
'tremblante'), loss of weight, weakness of the hindquarters, and
in some animals, impaired vision. The disease is always fatal. 
Only a small number of animals in a herd suffer from the
clinical signs of scrapie, and experts have rarely seen 10 cases
in a single herd.  The natural mode of transmission between
sheep is unclear. Experiments in which sheep with scrapie and
those without it have been kept together on a farm have given
rise to differing results, but goats have been shown to catch
the disease from sheep in this form of experiment.  Lambs of
scrapie infected sheep are more likely to develop the disease
later in life, but the reason for this is unclear.  The
infective agent is present in the membranes of the embryo but it
has been demonstrated neither in the colostrum and milk of the
mother nor in the tissues of the newborn animal.  Many cases of
scrapie appeared following the accidental contamination of a
louping-ill vaccine; however, the mode of infection in most
cases of scrapie seen on farms is unknown.  </P>



<H2>Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies of humans</H2>



<P>TSEs of humans are divided into specific clinical types,
which may appear similar histopathologically but are either
spread differently or have different patterns of distribution
and prevalence.</P>



<H3><A NAME="cjd">Creutzfeldt-Jakob</A> Disease</H3>



<P>CJD was first described in 1920/21 when it was known as
'spastic pseudosclerosis' or 'subacute spongiform
encephalopathy'.  The illness exists throughout the world and is
claimed to have a similar prevalence in each ofthe countries
tested with an annual incidence of approximately 1 case per
million of the population.  This is almost certainly an
underestimate because histopathologists dislike carrying out
necroscopies on cases that may have died of CJD and many older
people dying of a dementing illness do not have necroscopies
performed. There is an increased incidence among Libyan jews (26
cases per million) and spacial or temperal clusters in areas of
Slovakia, Hungary, England, USA and Chile.  Cases are clustered
in urban areas (except in Slovakia) but this can be accounted
for by the increased population density.  The average age in
typical CJD is 56yrs, and only 7 cases between 18 and 29 years
have been reported.  Between 4 and 15 % of cases have a familial
connection with other cases.  There is a slight excess of CJD in
women.  </P>

<P>Clinical prodromal symptoms start with changes in sleeping
and eating patterns and progress over a few weeks to a clearly
neurological syndrome.  A rapid onset of neurological symptoms
appears in 20% of cases, most commonly vibrating muscular
spasms, dementia, loss of higher brain function and behavioural
abnormalities.  The disease progresses with deterioration in
cerebral and cerebellar function to a condition which most
neurological activity is decreased, sensory and visual function
decays, and the patient dies, possibly after a decrease in
lowere motor neurological function and seizures. 90% of the
cases end in death within 1 year of onset, and the further 5%
die within the following year. However, for 5% of the cases
fatality may take up to 10 years, and in these cases
neurological decay is relatively slow. </P>

<P>Diagnosis is by clinical assessment of patients with
pre-senile dementia and by examination of electroencephalogram
patterns, which characteristically show triphasic one cycle per
second activity or slow wave bursts with intermittent
suppression (also found in animals with TSE).  Enlargement of
the lateral ventricals and an increase in a IgG may be found but
these factors are of limited diagnostic value.  Post mortem
diagnosis is currently carried out by histological examination
under the light microscope of cerebral tissue, although this is
not always reliably diagnostic.  Research techniques have been
used to demonstrate CJD (and other TSEs).  These may involve the
electron microscope examination of brain tissue for scrapie
associated fibrils (SAF), the staining of the tissue for prion
protein antigens, or the intracerebral injection of tissue into
animals, which will go on to die of the disease. </P>

<P>In some patients, the source of CJD has been claimed to be an
infection transferred from other patients with the condition. 
For example, in one case, cerebral electrodes that had been
sterilised with only alcahol and formalin vapour after use in a
patient with CJD, were both used in the brains of two young
epileptic patients, both of whom contracted CJD after a short
incubation.  The transfer of CJD by corneal transplant in one
patient, by cadaveric dura mater graphs in two patients and by
concentrated human growth hormone injections in over 40 more
have been reported.  Some cases in the literature seem too
improbably for the low incidence in a community.  For instance
the report of CJD in a neurosurgeon, a mortury attendant, in two
men living 200 metres apart in sharing a general practitioner,
in a patient who had visited the Eastern Highlands of New Guinea
(the kuru area) ten months previously, in 3 patients who had
been operated on in the same neurosurgical unit within a period
of 8 months, in 2 people living together but not genetically
linked and in an individual marrying into an infected family
(although the spouse did not suffer from CJD).  Two husband and
wife couples have died of CJD as well as a life long vegetarian.
Four farmers that had cases of BSE on their farms have died in
the UK suffering from CJD since 1993, as have 2 teenagers.  The
mode of disease transmission may be by personal contact, but
only medical procedures have been described as to how this takes
place. If the disease is transmitted from animal sources, many
routes have been suggested but insubstantial evidence has been
available to prove them.  The distribution of CJD in the world
does not seem to be the same as that of scrapie in sheep, and
human exposure to sheep is poorly associated with CJD.  None of
the animals that suffer from CJD except cows appear to be
present in large numbers in all the countries where CJD is
prevalent. Although their tissues are unliekly to be infective,
pigs, which are generally slaughtered, are not consumed by
Muslims and Jews, who also suffer from CJD.  </P>



<H3><A NAME="kuru">Kuru</A></H3>



<P>Kuru is a condition of the Fore tribe of the Okapa district
of the Eastern Highland in Papua New Guinea, in which a practice
of ritual cannibalism of fellow tribesmen took place until
around 1956.  The disease affected mainly adult woment and
children of both sexes to give an annual disease specific
mortality of approximately 3%. Most deaths of women occured
through this disease and some men who died from this disease
were thought to have contracted it when young.</P>

<P>Kuru is caught by eating infected tissue. The brain of the
dead tribal member was eaten by women and children and the
muscle tissue by men. The possibility that has also transmitted
the disease to men but with a lower dose of infective agent and,
hence, a longer incubation period has not been ruled out. The
cohort of children born since 1956 has not suffered greatly from
kuru. </P>

<P>Clinically the disease is of a progressive cerebellar ataxia
leading to uncoodinated movements, neurological weakness,
palsies, and decay in brain cortical function.  Most patients
dying of kuru are not demented, and this is a major clinical
difference between kuru and CJD. Patients with a longer
incubation period appear to have a slower progression of
symptions, but generally death from inter current infection or
medullary involvement takes place with an average clinical
period of 12 months. </P>



<H3><A NAME="gss">Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease</A>
</H3>



<P> Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (GSS) is an
autosomally dominant condition rarely present in families.  The
disease is similar to CJD except that it has a more extended
onset and duration, a tendency towards cerebellar ataxia as the
initial predominant neurological sign, and a large number of
amyloid plaques present among the spongiform encephaloapthic
changes of the brain. It has been transmitted to monkeys and
rodents by intracerebral inoculation and to hamsters merely by
the insertion of the human abnormal PrP gene from chromosome 20
into the hamster genome. </P>



<H3><A NAME="alp">Alpers disease</A></H3>



<P>Alpers disease represents a group of very rare chronic
progressive degenerative disorders of the central nervous system
of infants and children.  Histologically this condition is
similar to CJD and can be transmitted, like CJD, to hamsters
easily but not to guinea pigs by intracerebral inoculation. 
Unlike CJD, however, there is also a fatty degeneration of the
liver. </P>



<H2><A NAME="mink">Transmissible mink encephalopathy</A></H2>



<P>TME is an uncommon fatal disease that occurs as outbreaks in
ranch mink (mustella vision).  The condition was first reported
in 1947 in Wisconsin and has also been reported in Canada and
Finland with a similar pattern.  Most of the mink on the farm
die rapidly after a short encephalopathic period.  The
incubation in experimental situations is considered to be
approximately 6 months.  Because mink are generally separate
from each of the other on farms  (except when less than 3 months
old) and because little contact is made between them and
external animals, the disease is thought to be derived from
their food, which is contaminated with a TSE of an other animal.
Fighting and canibalism among young mink is difficult to prevent
and this may be reason why most animals on the ranch become
infected. One outbreak in Stetsonville, Wisconsin, USA, followed
the feeding of the mink with the meat and bone meal of a cow
that had died of a disease similar clinically simialr to BSE. No
sheep were included in their diet. The experimental feeding of
food that contained scrapie or BSE infective agent to mink has
given rise to the disease but not of apparently the same
clinical type.</P>



<H2><A NAME="cwdd">Chronic wasting disease of deer</A></H2>



<P>CWDD is a TSE seen in 1978 in a mule deer herd and in an
adjacent herd of elk at Ford Collins, Colorado, USA.  Both herds
were captive.  The disease shows typical spongiform change in
the cerebral grey matter and can be transmitted to deer and
ferrets by inoculation.</P>



<H2><A NAME="bse">Bovine spongiform encephalopathy</A></H2>



<P>BSE, a condition seen generally in adult cattle of either sex
was first recognised in 1986 in the UK, where it now infects
greater than 55% of  milking herds.  The numbers are highest in
Southern England where more than 60 cases have been reported in
a single herd but are generally spread throughout the British
Isles, often as less than 3 cases per herd of 100 cattle per
annum. It has been reported now in Oman, Switzerland, France,
Germany, Canada, Denmark, Portugal, and Italy but these cases
are probably associated with the export of either infected
animals or infected meat and bone meal for bovine feed from the
UK.  It is difficult to explain the cases in Portugal in that
many are the offspring of cattle exported from the UK, whereas
their mothers are apparently not clinically infected.  The
disease is thought to have been derived either from the change
in the manufacture procedure of meat and bone meal (for bovine
consumption) or from the inclusion of an uncomon bovine case of
spontaneous BSE in bovine food in approximately 1978-1980.
Claims have been made that this is not a new disease; in the
past, although not histologically diagnosed, it has been seen in
approximately 1 cow in 20,000 to 30,000.  The rapid increase of
the disease (850 cases reported per week in 1994) is probably
due to the inclusion of undiagnosed cases of BSE in the meat and
bone meal used for bovine food.  This was stopped in the UK in
July 1988, but the meal was simply exported to other countries
by its manufacturers (this has now been stopped). BSE has now
been transmitted to cattle, mice, sheep, and goats both orally
and by inoculation, and to pigs, marmoset monkeys but not
hamsters merely by inoculation.  Over 18,000 cases have been
developed BSE although they were born after the ban of oral
infectious material being present in their food. It is still
unclear whether the cattle become infected directly from the
food that they eat or from asymptomatic mothers that have done
this.The possibility that an environmental factor other than the
BSE infective agent may be involved with the transmission of BSE
has been suggested due to the relatively low incidence of
disease on 'organic' farms and organosphorus insecticide use has
been suggested as being involved.</P>

<P>The long incubation period (presumed to be more than 2 years
and most commonly 5 years) means that case numbers have appeared
to decrease accoreding to MAFF statistics since 1994.  There is
argument about the validity of this data. Clinically, the cow
appears alert but agitated, anxious, and apprehensive.  As the
disease progresses, however, the animal starts to take a wide
base stance, the abdomen is drawn up and the gait becomes
abnormal and exaggerated and it gives rise to tumbling and skin
wounds.  Fine muscle contractions are seen involving small
muscle groups over the surface of the neck and body with
occaisional larger muscular jerks. The animal loses weight and
is taken to frenzied movements including aimless headbutting. 
</P> 

<P>The possibility that BSE may be infectious to humans was
considered to minimal in the UK until November 1989, when the
feeding of bovine tissue, lymphoid tissue, spleen, thymus or gut
(from cattle over the age of 6 months) to humans was banned. 
All animals that show signs of BSE in the UK must now be
slaughtered and disposed of by incineration or burial.  Beef in
the UK would be expected to carry a lower titre of the
infectious agent at the present time, but the larger amounts
eaten by humans and the long human lifespan make its safety
unclear.  </P>



<H2><A NAME="cats">Feline spongiform encephaloapthy</A></H2>



<P>FSE is a condition that was reported in May 1990 in a 5 year
old male siamese cat and has then been reported in many other in
the UK.  The epidemiology of FSE is unclear at the present but
attempts to find previous cases among demented or neurologically
degenerate cats from the past have been uncussessful.  We must
therefore consider it to be a new disease. Histologically, it is
similar to other TSEs.  It is now felt to be due to BSE being
present in feline food.  The owner of the original cat with FSE
denied feeding it tinned cat food and insisted that it was fed
fresh meat.  </P>



<H2><A NAME="zoo">Zoological spongiform encephalopathy</A></H2>



<P>Zoological animal TSE has been reported since 1986 in an
eland, a nyala, an Arabian oryx, a greater kudu, a gemsbok, a
cheetah, a puma, and an ocelot in British zoos. Various
offspring of the mother kudu have died of the disease and the
possibility that it is passed vertically must be considered. 
They had not been given food thought to be infected.  The
animals became clinically unwell after the appearance of BSE on
British farms, and they were probably infected either from the
same source as the cattle or from BSE contaminated foodstuff. 
No TSE in similar animals has been reported before and, hence,
these must be considered new diseases.  Four ostriches in the
zoos of northern Germany have developed simialr conditions but
no evidence is currently available as to whether the diseases
are transmissible. </P>



<H2>Transmissible of spongiform encephalopathies</H2>



<P>Infected nervous tissue from some animals was injected, often
intracerebrally, into others to find the range of infectivity of
the agent.  From this it was found that only approximately 70%
of animals developed disease. </P>



<H3><A NAME="dose">Dose experiments</A></H3>



<P>Dose experiments were carried out to understand the nature of
the infective agent.  Scrapie infected brain was exposed to
various agents (e.g. irradiation) and then injected in multiply
diluted forms into the brain of an uninfected animal. In this
way, the agent could be filtered. Multiple ten-fold dilutions
were made of the infective material, and each of the dilutions
was inoculated in a similar amount into an animal of the same
species. The infective dose of the greatest dilution that caused
the animal to die (often after years of incubation), was defined
as infective unit (IU) if the animal receiving the inoculum was
the same species as that of the animal that was donating it. The
brain of an animal dying of TSE commonly contained between one
million and ten thousand million IU per gram. The oral infective
dose of scrapie for a mouse was 4 x 10,000 IU, which represents
between one hundredth and one hundred thousandth of a gram of
infected  brain tissue.  In these experiments, researchers
noticed that the incubation period was inversely related to the
dose given to the animal and that the animal may be infected
with a small dose of TSE but die of old age before clinical
signs appear. </P>



<H3><A NAME="barrier">Effect of host passage on the properties
of the infectious agent</A></H3>



<P>1.  The infectous dose between species is usually higher than
between animals of the same species (possibly a million fold),
but it is some times the same (e.g. between scrapie doses for
mink perhaps)

<P>2.  When a species has been infected with a TSE of a
different species it can then go on to infect a range of animals
that the original species could not, and with a different dose.

<P>3.  When a species has been infected, it can infect
additional animals of the same species with much lower doses of
agent.

<P>4. The histopathology of the disease in an animal infected
from another species is not the same as if it had been infected
from one of the same species.

<P>5.  The incubation period of an animal infected from another
species is much longer than that of an animal from one of the
same species.</P>



<P>To demonstrate these factors, brain tissue of a sheep with
scrapie would only need one 1IU to infect another sheep, but if
mice were injected a much larger dose would be needed, the
incubation period would be relatively long, and a low percentage
of the mice would be affected. If brain tissue from these
infected mice was inoculated into addicitonal mice, the dose
would be one IU (a very small amount) the incubation period
would be much lower, a high percentage of the mice would become
infected, and the histology would be the same as in further
passages of the disease in mice (but different from the
histopathology of the mouse infected from the sheep).   The mice
would also be able to infect a distinct range of animals other
than sheep.  </P>

<P>These factors are known as the species barrier (SB) and
behave as if the agent is altered by passage through a species
to a form that is more likely to infect that species.  The
insertion of the hamster PrP gene (vide infra) in to the genes
of a mouse removes the SB between the animals; i.e. when
injected with scrapie from a hamster, such a mouse would develop
scrapie as if it is a hamster. This has been explained by the
possibility that the PrP protein is all or part of the infective
agent and, as it is produced from the genes of the host animal,
it has a different structure in different species. </P>



<H2><A NAME="tissue">Tissue infectivity of clinical cases of
TSEs</A></H2>



<P>TSE infectivity is present in most tissues tested (e.g.
liver, kidney, muscle, brain, thymus, spleen, etc), and the
distributions vary among species. The finding of infectivity in
the buffy coat of blood has led to fears that CJD may be
transferred by blood transfusions, but there has been no report
of this at time. The finding that the scrapie agent was present
in perpheral as well as central nervous tissue and in lymphoid
tissue has given little surprise to the finding of TSE agent in
muscles of goats, hamsters, mink and possibly humans. </P>



<H2>Tissue infectivity during the incubation period</H2>

<P>The animal is as asymptomatic for a long period before the
disease becomes clinically apparent.  During this time, many of
the tissues of the body are infectious but at a relatively low
titre compared to the nervous system during the symptomatic
period.  This titre is adequately high, however, to permit
infection of other animals by intracerebral inoculation and
possibly by parenteral or oral routes.  </P>



<H2>The mode of spread of TSEs inside the body</H2>



<P>Research has shown that the agent will pass along peripheral
nerves and hence will travel in this way form a site of
absorbtion to the brain.  Other resarch has shown it to be
present in the buffy coat (probably the macrophages or
lymphocytes) of the blood.  The exact mode of spread of TSE
inside the body is unclear.  </P>



<H2><A NAME="immunity">Immunity</A></H2>



<P>Developed immunity against the infective agent has not been
demonstrated.  Apparently no antibodies that react with it are
produced, even in chronically infected animals.  The possibility
that this may permit multiple inoculations of sublethal doses of
the agent to be effectively additive in their effect has been
considered and is presumed by some researchers but no specific
proof of this has been shown. Rabbits may produced antibodies
against PrP derived from sheep (vide infra). </P>



<H2><A NAME="res">Resistance of the agent to destruction</A></H2>



<P>Chemical disinfectants (e.g. domestic bleach), weak acids,
DNAase, RNAase, proteinases (including those found in the animal
gut), ultraviolet light, ionising radiation, heat (cooking
tempertures), and chemicals that react with DNA (psoralins/UV
light, hydroxylamine, zinc ions), all have little effect on the
infectivity of the agent.  High temperature autoclaving (135
degrees centegrade for 18 minutes) decreases the infectivity
dramatically, as does the use of 1M NaOH, but neither will fully
destroy the agent, as it has been found to remain infective
after 360 degrees C for 1 hour or even after incineration. 
Internment of infective tissue in the soil for three years did
not destroy the agent.  Some phenols and proteases will decrease
the infectivity of the agent but not to an adequate degree to be
of value in disinfection. </P>



<H3><A NAME="preven">Prevention of TSEs</A></H3>



<P>Nosocomial CJDs should be prevented by prohibiting CJD, GSS,
or Alpers disease patients (or those with obscure neurological
conditions) from becoming blood or tissue donors, by the
incineration or high temperature autoclaving of all materials
that came into contact with blood, or post mortem tissue from
such a patient, and by the disposal of all surgical instruments
used for brain surgery on such a patient.  The body should not
be used for teaching anatomy or surgery.  Correct action to be
taken concerning BSE infected herds is currently under intense
discussion.</P> 



<H2><A NAME="histo">Histopathogical changes</A></H2>



<P>Characteristic lesions under the light microscope consist of
spongy changes in the neuropil nerve cells and astrocytes with
nerve cell degeneration and astrocytosis.  These changes
generally take place in the grey matter of the cerebrum and
cerebellum.  The distribution of the histopathology may vary
according to the strain of the disease, as has been shown with
inbred strains of mice.  It may also vary with the site of
inoculation, for example, if the infection reaches the brain
through the optic nerve, then the spongy degeneration is
clustered around the occipital lobe.  Amyloid plaques may be
seen between cells in some TSEs (e.g. kuru, hamster scrapie) and
strained with Congo red.  These contain PrP and have been shown
to be infective.  Electron microscocopy shows twig-like
structures 12 to 16 nanometers in width and 100 to 500
nanometers long, which are found only in TSE and are now called
scrapie associated fibrils (SAF).  </P>



<H2><A NAME="agent">Nature of the infective agent for
TSEs</A></H2>



<H3>PrP: A cellular protein found altered in cases of TSEs</H3>



<P>PrP is a sialoglycoprotein produced from a gene normally
found in the genome of the infected animal.  This gene on
chromosome 2 in mice (or chromosome 20 in humans), may be
conserved between strains but altered between species.  PrP in a
normal brain has glycoside modifications and is held onto the
membrain of the cell by covalent attatchement to phospholipid.
In scrapie, however, the PrP is present much more within the
membrane and has a different structural form (PrPsc).  This
modification, whatever it may be, renders the protein resistant
to heat and to most proteases and when treated with proteinase K
(a very powerful enzyme) it is split into particles fo 27-30 kDa
the structures of which are uncertain.  PrPsc structure has been
shown to vary with the strain of TME and for the altered form of
PrP to induce such a change in normal PrP (this is, however,
very inefficient, and the infectivity of the PrPsc that is
formed has not been shown). The PrP of patients with GSS is
mutated so that proline is replaced by leucine at position 102. 
The PrP of CJD in the Libyan Jew and Slovak clusters and some
cases of familial CJD have a different alteration from that in
GSS and various changes have been reported.  Patients with CJD
that is not familial do not generally have PrP mutations.  When
the gene for PrP in a patient who suffers from GSS (PrPgss) is
inserted into a hamster genome, about one in twenty animals
spontaneously develop a TSE. PrP is therefore greatly involved
in the infectivity and pathogenesis of the disease, but how it
could be the infective agent (vide infra) is not clear.  Inbred
mouse strains with long and short incubation periods (known as
sinc genes) for scrapie have been found to have differences in
their PrP codons, which are claimed by some to be the sinc genes
themselves. Mice have been developed that do not carry a PrP
gene at all.  These mice appear to grow in an asymptomatic way
and cannot be infected with scrapie (nor do they become infected
and remain asymptomatic). </P>



<H3>Structure of the transmissible spongiform infective
agent</H3>



<P>Conjecture is currently complex and hence, there are many
hypotheses: </P>

<P>Virus: No specific particle (although many have been claimed
to have been seen under the elecron microscrope)  has been
isolated but the transmissibility is similar to this form of
agent.</P>

<P>Prion: A protein infectious agent.Felt to be the PrP altered
form (PrPsc), which is resistant to destruction, would not cause
antibody production in the infected animal, and would vary
according to the species infected.  Purified PrPsc has been
claimed to transmit scrapie but experimental methods have been
challenged as being fully vaid. How a prion would transmit
strains of disease without an independent genome is currently
unclear.  The recent transmission of GSS to hamsters by an
artificial PrP GSS gene has made this hypothesis more likely.</P>

<P>Virino:  Small fragment of DNA/RNA closely wrapped in
protein.  The SAF that are found only in TSEs and that have PrP
involved in their structure could be virinos.  They are sugested
to contain some genetic material (although none has been found),
which could explain the different strains of disease.  However,
the agent is resistant to chemicals and ionising radiation,
which would be expected to destroy the nucleic acid. </P>

<P>Tubulofilamentous particles: these are the items seen under
the electron microscope in all cases of TSE.  Their association
with infection has not been demonstrated.</P>

<P>Crystalloids: These would be the growing crystals of prion
protein that would cause the PrP to change into the PrPsc form
with the release of energy.  This would explain the strain types
as being the form of crystalloid depending on other factors
apart from the PrP protein structure (possibly depending on the
glycan chains to which are attatched).</P>

<P>Spiroplasmas. These are infective agents that can be cultured
in vitro and are well known in microbiology.  Althogh no
spiroplasma has been found specifically, the appearance of the
structure of the EM particles suggest it.</P>



<H2>Future prospects</H2>



<P>The incidence of CJD is apparently unchanged over any years,
although poor statistics to confirm this.  The epidemic of BSE
in the UK is expected to continue there for up to 10 years but
the incidence to decrease after 1993.  It is, however likely to
spread to Europe and other countries that imported infected
British meat and bone meal. The precise risk that this may be
followed after 5-25 yrs by a wave of CJD, FSE and Zoological SE,
is unknown but the possibility should be considered.</P>

<H1>The Prion Diseases </H1>
<P><EM>Prions, once dismissed as an impossibility, have now gained
wide recognition as extraordinary agents that cause a number of
infectious, genetic and spontaneous disorders </EM>
<CENTER><P ALIGN=CENTER>by Stanley B.  Prusiner.</P></CENTER>
<H2>Description &amp; History</H2>
<P>Fifteen years ago I evoked a good deal of skepticism when I
proposed that the infectious agents causing certain degenerative
disorders of the central nervous system in animals and, more
rarely, in humans might consist of protein and nothing else. At
the time, the notion was heretical. Dogma held that the conveyers
of transmissible diseases required genetic material, composed of
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA), in order to establish an infection in
a host. Even viruses, among the simplest microbes, rely on such
material to direct synthesis of the proteins needed for survival
and replication.   <P>
Later, many scientists were similarly dubious
when my colleagues and I suggested that these "proteinaceous
infectious particles"--or "prions," as I called the
disease-causing agents--could underlie inherited, as well as
communicable, diseases. Such dual behavior was then unknown to
medical science. <P>
And we met resistance again when we concluded
that prions (pronounced "pree-ons") multiply in an incredible
way; they convert normal protein molecules into dangerous ones
simply by inducing the benign molecules to change their shape.  
Today, however, a wealth of experimental and clinical data has
made a convincing case that we are correct on all three counts.<P>

Prions are indeed responsible for transmissible and inherited
disorders of protein conformation. They can also cause sporadic
disease, in which neither transmission between individuals nor
inheritance is evident. Moreover, there are hints that the prions
causing the diseases explored thus far may not be the only ones.
Prions made of rather different proteins may contribute to other
neurodegenerative diseases that are quite prevalent in humans.
They might even participate in illnesses that attack muscles. <P>
 
The known prion diseases, all fatal, are sometimes referred to as
spongiform encephalopathies. They are so named because they
frequently cause the brain to become riddled with holes. These
ills, which can brew for years (or even for decades in humans)
are widespread in animals.   The most common form is scrapie,
found in sheep and goats. Afflicted animals lose coordination and
eventually become so incapacitated that they cannot stand. They
also become irritable and, in some cases, develop an intense itch
that leads them to scrape off their wool or hair (hence the name
"scrapie"). The other prion diseases of animals go by such names
as transmissible mink encephalopathy, chronic wasting disease of
mule deer and elk, feline spongiform encephalopathy and bovine
spongiform encephalopathy. The last, often called mad cow
disease, is the most worrisome.   <P>
Gerald A. H. Wells and John W.
Wilesmith of the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge,
England, identified the condition in 1986, after it began
striking cows in Great Britain, causing them to became
uncoordinated and unusually apprehensive. The source of the
emerging epidemic was soon traced to a food supplement that
included meat and bone meal from dead sheep. The methods for
processing sheep carcasses had been changed in the late 1970s.
Where once they would have eliminated the scrapie agent in the
supplement, now they apparently did not. The British government
banned the use of animal-derived feed supplements in 1988, and
the epidemic has probably peaked. Nevertheless, many people
continue to worry that they will eventually fall ill as a result
of having consumed tainted meat.
<P>The human prion diseases are more obscure. Kuru has been seen
only among the Fore Highlanders of Papua New Guinea. They call it
the "laughing death." Vincent Zigas of the Australian Public
Health Service and D. Carleton Gajdusek of the U.S. National
Institutes of Health described it in 1957, noting that many
highlanders became afflicted with a strange, fatal disease marked
by loss of coordination (ataxia) and often later by dementia. The
affected individuals probably acquired kuru through ritual
cannibalism: the Fore tribe reportedly honored the dead by eating
their brains. The practice has since stopped, and kuru has
virtually disappeared.   <P>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, in contrast,
occurs worldwide and usually becomes evident as dementia. Most of
the time it appears sporadically, striking one person in a
million, typically around age 60. About 10 to 15 percent of cases
are inherited, and a small number are, sadly, iatrogenic--spread
inadvertently by the attempt to treat some other medical problem.
Iatrogenic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has apparently been
transmitted by corneal transplantation, implantation of dura
mater or electrodes in the brain, use of contaminated surgical
instruments, and injection of growth hormone derived from human
pituitaries (before recombinant growth hormone became available).
<P>The two remaining human disorders are
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease (which is (2) 
manifest as ataxia and other signs of damage to the cerebellum)
and fatal familial insomnia (in which dementia follows difficulty
sleeping).
Both these conditions are usually inherited and typically appear
in midlife. Fatal familial insomnia was discovered only recently,
by Elio Lugaresi and Rossella Medori of the University of Bologna
and Pierluigi Gambetti of Case Western Reserve University. 
<P>
<H2>In Search of the Cause</H2>
<P>I first became intrigued by the prion diseases in 1972,
when as a resident in neurology at the University of California
School of Medicine at San Francisco, I lost a patient to
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. As I reviewed the scientific
literature on that and related conditions, I learned that
scrapie, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru had all been shown to
be transmissible by injecting extracts of diseased brains into
the brains of healthy animals. The infections were thought to be
caused by a slow-acting virus, yet no one had managed to isolate
the culprit.  <P>
 In the course of reading, I came across an
astonishing report in which Tikvah Alper and her colleagues at
the Hammersmith Hospital in London suggested that the scrapie
agent might lack nucleic acid, which usually can be degraded by
ultraviolet or ionizing radiation. When the nucleic acid in
extracts of scrapie-infected brains was presumably destroyed by
those treatments, the extracts retained their ability to transmit
scrapie. If the organism did lack DNA and RNA, the finding would
mean that it was not a virus or any other known type of
infectious agent, all of which contain genetic material. What,
then, was it? <P>
Investigators had many ideas--including, jokingly,
linoleum and kryptonite--but no hard answers.   I immediately
began trying to solve this mystery when I set up a laboratory at
U.C.S.F. in 1974. The first step had to be a mechanical
one--purifying the infectious material in scrapie-infected brains
so that its composition could be analyzed. The task was daunting;
many investigators had tried and failed in the past. But with the
optimism of youth, I forged ahead [see "Prions," by Stanley B.
Prusiner; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, October 1984]. 
<H2>Amazing Discovery</H2>
<P>All our results pointed toward one startling conclusion:
the infectious agent in scrapie (and presumably in the related
diseases) did indeed lack nucleic acid and consisted mainly, if
not exclusively, of protein. We deduced that DNA and RNA were
absent because, like Alper, we saw that procedures known to
damage nucleic acid did not reduce infectivity. And we knew
protein was an essential component because procedures that
denature (unfold) or degrade protein reduced infectivity. <P>
I thus
introduced the term "prion" to distinguish this class of disease
conveyer from viruses, bacteria, fungi and other known pathogens.
Not long afterward, we determined that scrapie prions contained a
single protein that we called PrP, for "prion protein."   Now the
major question became; Where did the instructions specifying the
sequence of amino acids in PrP reside? Were they carried by an
undetected piece of DNA that traveled with PrP, or were they,
perhaps, contained in a gene housed in the chromosomes of cells?<P>

The key to this riddle was the identification in 1984 of some 15
amino acids at one end of the PrP protein. My group identified
this short amino acid sequence in collaboration with Leroy E.
Hood and his co-workers at the California Institute of
Technology.   Knowledge of the sequence allowed us and others to
construct molecular probes, or detectors, able to indicate
whether mammalian cells carried the PrP gene. With probes
produced by Hood's team, Bruno Oesch, working in the laboratory
of Charles Weissmann at the University of Zurich, showed that
hamster cells do contain a gene for PrP. At about the same time,
Bruce Cheseboro of the NIH Rocky Mountain Laboratories made his
own probes and established that mouse cells harbor the gene as
well. That work made it possible to isolate the gene and to
establish that it resides not in prions but in the chromosomes of
hamsters, mice, humans and all other mammals that have been
examined. What is more, most of the time, these animals make PrP
without getting sick.  <P>
 One interpretation of such findings was
that we had made a terrible mistake: PrP had nothing to do with
prion diseases. Another possibility was that PrP could be
produced in two forms, one that generated disease and one that
did not. We soon showed the latter interpretation to be
correct.   The critical clue was the fact that the PrP found in
infected brains resisted breakdown by cellular enzymes called
proteases.<P>

Most proteins in cells are degraded fairly easily. I therefore
suspected that if a normal, (3) nonthreatening form
of PrP existed, it too would be susceptible to degradation.
Ronald A. Barry in my laboratory then identified this
hypothetical protease-sensitive form. It thus became clear that
scrapie-causing PrP is a variant of a normal protein. We
therefore called the normal protein "cellular PrP" and the
infectious (protease-resistant) form "scrapie PrP." The latter
term is now used to refer to the protein molecules that
constitute the prions causing all scrapie-like diseases of
animals and humans.<P>

<H2>Prion Diseases Can Be Inherited</H2>
<P>Early on we had hoped to use the PrP gene to generate pure
copies of PrP. Next, we would inject the protein molecules into
animals, secure in the knowledge that no elusive virus was
clinging to them. If the injections caused scrapie in the
animals, we would have shown that protein molecules could, as we
had proposed, transmit disease. By 1986, however, we knew the
plan would not work. For one thing, it proved very difficult to
induce the gene to make the high levels of PrP needed for
conducting studies. For another thing, the protein that was
produced was the normal, cellular form. Fortunately, work on a
different problem led us to an alternative approach for
demonstrating that prions could transmit scrapie without the help
of any accompanying nucleic acid.   <P>
In many cases, the
scrapielike illnesses of humans seemed to occur without having
been spread from one host to another, and in some families they
appeared to be inherited. (Today researchers know that about 10
percent of human prion diseases are familial, felling half of the
members of the affected families.) It was this last pattern that
drew our attention. Could it be that prions were more unusual
than we originally thought? Were they responsible for the
appearance of both hereditary and transmissible illnesses?   In
1988 Karen Hsiao in my laboratory and I uncovered some of the
earliest data showing that human prion diseases can certainly be
inherited. We acquired clones of a PrP gene obtained from a man
who had Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease in his family and
was dying of it himself. Then we compared his gene with PrP genes
obtained from a healthy population and found a tiny abnormality
known as a point mutation.   <P>
To grasp the nature of this
mutation, it helps to know something about the organization of
genes. Genes consist of two strands of the DNA building blocks
called nucleotides, which differ from one another in the bases
they carry. The bases on one strand combine with the bases on the
other strand to form base pairs: the "rungs" on the familiar DNA
"ladder." In addition to holding the DNA ladder together, these
pairs spell out the sequence of amino acids that must be strung
together to make a particular protein. Three base pairs
together--a unit called a codon--specify a single amino acid. In
our dying patient, just one base pair (out of more than 750) had
been exchanged for a different pair. The change, in turn, had
altered the information carried by codon 102, causing the amino
acid leucine to be substituted for the amino acid proline in the
man's PrP protein.  <P>
 With the help of Tim J. Crow of Northwick
Park Hospital in London and Jurg Ott of Columbia University and
their colleagues, we discovered the same mutation in genes from a
large number of patients with Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
disease, and we showed that the high incidence in the affected
families was statistically significant. In other words, we
established genetic linkage between the mutation and the
disease--a finding that strongly implies the mutation is the
cause. Over the past six years work by many investigators has
uncovered 18 mutations in families with inherited prion diseases;
for five of these mutations, enough cases have now been collected
to demonstrate genetic linkage.   The discovery of mutations gave
us a way to eliminate the possibility that a nucleic acid was
traveling with prion proteins and directing their multiplication.<P>

We could now create genetically altered mice carrying a mutated
PrP gene. If the presence of the altered gene in these
"transgenic" animals led by itself to scrapie, and if the brain
tissue of the transgenic animals then caused scrapie in healthy
animals, we would have solid evidence that the protein encoded by
the mutated gene had been solely responsible for the transfer of
disease. Studies I conducted with Hsiao, Darlene Groth in my
group and Stephen J. DeArmond, head of a separate laboratory at
U.C.S.F., have now shown that scrapie can be generated and
transmitted in this way [see BOX at end of this article].   These
results in animals resemble those obtained in 1981, when
Gajdusek, Colin L. Masters and Clarence J. Gibbs, Jr., all at the
National Institutes of Health, transmitted apparently inherited
Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease to monkeys. They also
resemble the findings of Jun Tateishi and Tetsuyuki Kitamoto of
Kyushu University in Japan, who transmitted inherited
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease to mice.<P>

Together the collected transmission studies persuasively argue
that prions do, after all, (4) represent an 
unprecedented class of infectious agents, composed
only of a modified mammalian protein. And the conclusion is
strengthened by the fact that assiduous searching for a
scrapie-specific nucleic acid (especially by Detlev H. Riesner of
Heinrich Heine University in Dusseldorf) has produced no evidence
that such genetic material is attached to prions.  Scientists who
continue to favor the virus theory might say that we still have
not proved our case. If the PrP gene coded for a protein that,
when mutated, facilitated infection by a ubiquitous virus, the
mutation would lead to viral infection of the brain.
Then injection of brain extracts from the mutant animal would
spread the infection to another host. Yet in the absence of any
evidence of a virus, this hypothesis looks to be untenable.  <P>
 In
addition to showing that a protein can multiply and cause disease
without help from nucleic acids, we have gained insight into how
scrapie PrP propagates in cells. Many details remain to be worked
out, but one aspect appears quite clear: the main difference
between normal PrP and scrapie PrP is conformational. Evidently,
the scrapie protein propagates itself by contacting normal PrP
molecules and somehow causing them to unfold and flip from their
usual conformation to the scrapie shape. This change initiates a
cascade in which newly converted molecules change the shape of
other normal PrP molecules, and so on. These events apparently
occur on a membrane in the cell interior.  <P>
 We started to think
that the differences between cellular and scrapie forms of PrP
must be conformational after other possibilities began to seem
unlikely. For instance, it has long been known that the
infectious form often has the same amino acid sequence as the
normal type. Of course, molecules that start off being identical
can later be chemically modified in ways that alter their
activity. But intensive investigations by Neil Stahl and Michael
A. Baldwin in my laboratory have turned up no differences of this
kind.<P>

<H2>One Protein, Two Shapes</H2>
<P>How, exactly, do the structures of normal and scrapie forms
of PrP differ? Studies by Keh-Ming Pan in our group indicate that
the normal protein consists primarily of alpha helices, regions
in which the protein backbone twists into a specific kind of
spiral; the scrapie form, however, contains beta strands, regions
in which the backbone is fully extended. Collections of these
strands form beta sheets. Fred E. Cohen, who directs another
laboratory at U.C.S.F., has used molecular modeling to try to
predict the structure of the normal protein based on its amino
acid sequence. His calculations imply that the protein probably
folds into a compact structure having four helices in its core.<P>

Less is known about the structure, or structures, adopted by
scrapie PrP.   The evidence supporting the proposition that
scrapie PrP can induce an alpha-helical PrP molecule to switch to
a beta-sheet form comes primarily from two important studies by
investigators in my group. Maria Gasset learned that synthetic
peptides (short strings of amino acids) corresponding to three of
the four putative alpha-helical regions of PrP can fold into beta
sheets. And Jack Nguyen has shown that in their beta-sheet
conformation, such peptides can impose a beta-sheet structure on
helical PrP peptides. More recently Byron W. Caughey of the Rocky
Mountain Laboratories and Peter T. Lansbury of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology have reported that cellular PrP can be
converted into scrapie PrP in a test tube by mixing the two
proteins together.  <P>
 PrP molecules arising from mutated genes
probably do not adopt the scrapie conformation as soon as they
are synthesized. Otherwise, people carrying mutant genes would
become sick in early childhood. We suspect that mutations in the
PrP gene render the resulting proteins susceptible to flipping
from an alpha-helical to a beta-sheet shape. Presumably, it takes
time until one of the molecules spontaneously flips over and
still more time for scrapie PrP to accumulate and damage the
brain enough to cause symptoms.   Fred Cohen and I think we might
be able to explain why the various mutations that have been noted
in PrP genes could facilitate folding into the beta-sheet form.<P>

Many of the human mutations give rise to the substitution of one
amino acid for another within the four putative helices or at
their borders. Insertion of incorrect amino acids at those
positions might destabilize a helix, thus increasing the
likelihood that the affected helix and its neighbors will refold
into a beta-sheet conformation. Conversely, Hermann Schatzel in
my laboratory finds that the harmless differences distinguishing
the PrP gene of humans from those of apes and monkeys affect
amino acids lying outside of the proposed helical domains--where
the divergent amino acids probably would not profoundly influence
the stability of the helical regions.
<P>
<H2>Treatment Ideas Emerge(5)</H2>
<P>No one knows exactly how propagation of scrapie PrP damages
cells. In cell cultures, the conversion of normal PrP to the
scrapie form occurs inside neurons, after which scrapie PrP
accumulates in intracellular vesicles known as lysosomes. In the
brain, filled lysosomes could conceivably burst and damage cells.
As the diseased cells died, creating holes in the brain, their
prions would be released to attack other cells.   We do know with
certainty that cleavage of scrapie PrP is what produces PrP
fragments that accumulate as plaques in the brains of some
patients. Those aggregates resemble plaques seen in Alzheimer's
disease, although the Alzheimer's clumps consist of a different
protein. The PrP plaques are a useful sign of prion infection,
but they seem not to be a major cause of impairment. In many
people and animals with prion disease, the plaques do not arise
at all.
<P>
<P>Even though we do not yet know much about how PrP scrapie
harms brain tissue, we can foresee that an understanding of the
three-dimensional structure of the PrP protein will lead to
therapies. If, for example, the four-helix-bundle model of PrP is
correct, drug developers might be able to design a compound that
would bind to a central pocket that could be formed by the four
helices. So bound, the drug would stabilize these helices and
prevent their conversion into beta sheets.  <P>
Another idea for
therapy is inspired by research in which Weissmann and his
colleagues applied gene-targeting technology to create mice that
lacked the PrP gene and so could not make PrP. By knocking out a
gene and noting the consequences of its loss, one can often
deduce the usual functions of the gene's protein product. In this
case, however, the animals missing PrP displayed no detectable
abnormalities. If it turns out that PrP is truly inessential,
then physicians might one day consider delivering so-called
antisense or antigene therapies to the brains of patients with
prion diseases. Such therapies aim to block genes from giving
rise to unwanted proteins and could potentially shut down
production of cellular PrP [see "The New Genetic Medicines," by
Jack S. Cohen and Michael E. Hogan; SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, December
1994]. <P>
They would thereby block PrP from propagating itself.   It
is worth noting that the knockout mice provided a welcomed
opportunity to challenge the prion hypothesis. If the animals
became ill after inoculation with prions, their sickness would
have indicated that prions could multiply even in the absence of
a preexisting pool of PrP molecules. As I expected, inoculation
with prions did not produce scrapie, and no evidence of prion
replication could be detected.  <P>
 The enigma of how scrapie PrP
multiplies and causes disease is not the only puzzle starting to
be solved. Another long-standing question--the mystery of how
prions consisting of a single kind of protein can vary markedly
2n their effects--is beginning to be answered as well. Lain H.
Pattison of the Agriculture Research Council in Compton, England,
initially called attention to this phenomenon. Years ago he
obtained prions from two separate sets of goats. One isolate made
inoculated animals drowsy, whereas the second made them
hyperactive. Similarly, it is now evident that some prions cause
disease quickly, whereas others do so slowly.<P>

<H2>The Mystery of "Strains"</H2>
<P>Alan G. Dickinson, Hugh Fraser and Moira E. Bruce of the
Institute for Animal Health in Edinburgh, who have examined the
differential effects of varied isolates in mice, are among those
who note that only pathogens containing nucleic acids are known
to occur in multiple strains. Hence, they and others assert, the
existence of prion "strains" indicates the prion hypothesis must
be incorrect; viruses must be at the root of scrapie and its
relatives. Yet because efforts to find viral nucleic acids have
been unrewarding, the explanation for the differences must lie
elsewhere.   One possibility is that prions can adopt multiple
conformations. Folded in one way, a prion might convert normal
PrP to the scrapie form highly efficiently, giving rise to short
incubation times. Folded another way, it might work less
efficiently. Similarly, one "conformer" might be attracted to
neuronal populations in one part of the brain, whereas another
might be attracted to neurons elsewhere, thus producing different
symptoms. Considering that PrP can fold in at least two ways, it
would not be surprising to find it can collapse into other
structures as well.  <P>
 Since the mid-1980s we have also sought
insight into a phenomenon known as the species barrier. This
concept refers to the fact that something makes it difficult for
prions made by one species to cause disease in animals of another
species. The cause of this difficulty is of considerable interest
today because of the epidemic of mad cow disease in Britain.
We and others have been trying to find out whether the species
barrier is strong (6)
enough to prevent the spread of prion disease from cows to
humans.<P>

<H2>Breaking the Barrier</H2>
<P>The barrier was discovered by Pattison, who in the 1960s
found it hard to transmit scrapie between sheep and rodents. To
determine the cause of the trouble, my colleague Michael R. Scott
and I later generated transgenic mice expressing the PrP gene of
the Syrian hamster--that is, making the hamster PrP protein. The
mouse gene differs from that of the hamster gene at 16 codons out
of 254. Normal mice inoculated with hamster prions rarely acquire
scrapie, but the transgenic mice became ill within about two
months.  We thus concluded that we had broken the species barrier
by inserting the hamster genes into the mice. Moreover, on the
basis of this and other experiments, we realized that the barrier
resides in the amino acid sequence of PrP: the more the sequence
of a scrapie PrP molecule resembles the PrP sequence of its host,
the more likely it is that the host will acquire prion disease.<P>

In one of those other experiments, for example, we examined
transgenic mice carrying the Syrian hamster PrP gene in addition
to their own mouse gene. Those mice make normal forms of both
hamster and mouse PrP. When we inoculated the animals with mouse
prions, they made more mouse prions. When we inoculated them with
hamster prions, they made hamster prions.
From this behavior, we learned that prions preferentially
interact with cellular PrP of homologous, or like, composition.  
The attraction of scrapie PrP for cellular PrP having the same
sequence probably explains why scrapie managed to spread to cows
in England from food consisting of sheep tissue: sheep and bovine
PrP differ only at seven positions. In contrast, the sequence
difference between human and bovine PrP is large: the molecules
diverge at more than 30 positions. Because the variance is great,
the likelihood of transmission from cows to people would seem to
be low. <P>
Consistent with this assessment are epidemiological
studies by W. Bryan Matthews, a professor emeritus at the
University of Oxford. Matthews found no link between scrapie in
sheep and the occurrence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in
sheep-farming countries.   On the other hand, two farmers who had
"mad cows" in their herds have recently died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease. Their deaths may have nothing to do with the bovine
epidemic, but the situation bears watching. It may turn out that
certain parts of the PrP molecule are more important than others
for breaking the species barrier. <P>
If that is the case, and if cow
PrP closely resembles human PrP in the critical regions, then the
likelihood of danger might turn out to be higher than a simple
comparison of the complete amino acid sequences would suggest.  
We began to consider the possibility that some parts of the PrP
molecule might be particularly important to the species barrier
after a study related to this blockade took an odd turn. My
colleague Glenn C. Telling had created transgenic mice carrying a
hybrid PrP gene that consisted of human codes flanked on either
side by mouse codes; this gene gave rise to a hybrid protein.
Then he introduced brain tissue from patients who had died of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker
disease into the transgenic animals.<P>
 Oddly enough, the animals
became ill much more frequently and faster than did mice carrying
a full human PrP gene, which diverges from mouse PrP at 28
positions. This outcome implied that similarity in the central
region of the PrP molecule may be more critical than it is in the
other segments.  The result also lent support to earlier
indications--uncovered by Shu-Lian Yang in DeArmond's laboratory
and Albert Taraboulos in my group--that molecules made by the
host can influence the behavior of scrapie PrP. We speculate that
in the hybrid-gene study, a mouse protein, possibly a "chaperone"
normally involved in folding nascent protein chains, recognized
one of the two mouse-derived regions of the hybrid PrP protein.
This chaperone bound to that region and helped to refold the
hybrid molecule into the scrapie conformation. The chaperone did
not provide similar help in mice making a totally human PrP
protein, presumably because the human protein lacked a binding
site for the mouse factor.<P>

<H2>The List May Grow</H2>
<P>An unforeseen story has recently  emerged from studies of
transgenic mice making unusually high amounts of normal PrP
proteins. DeArmond, David Westaway in our group and George A.
Carlson of the McLaughlin Laboratory in Great Falls, Mont.,
became perplexed when they noted that some older transgenic mice
developed an illness characterized by rigidity and diminished
grooming.
<P>
When we pursued the cause, we found that making excessive amounts
of PrP can (7) 
eventually lead to neurodegeneration and, surprisingly, to
destruction of both muscles and peripheral nerves. These
discoveries widen the spectrum of prion diseases and are
prompting a search for human prion diseases that affect the
peripheral nervous system and muscles.   Investigations of
animals that overproduce PrP have yielded another benefit as
well.<P>
 They offer a clue as to how the sporadic form of
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease might arise. For a time I suspected
that sporadic disease might begin when the wear and tear of
living led to a mutation of the PrP gene in at least one cell in
the body. Eventually, the mutated protein might switch to the
scrapie form and gradually propagate itself, until the buildup of
scrapie PrP crossed the threshold to overt disease. The mouse
studies suggest that at some point in the lives of the one in a
million individuals who acquire sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, cellular PrP may spontaneously convert to the scrapie
form.<P>
 The experiments also raise the possibility that people who
become afflicted with sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
overproduce PrP, but we do not yet know if, in fact, they do.  
All the known prion diseases in humans have now been modeled in
mice. With our most recent work we have inadvertently developed
an animal model for sporadic prion disease. Mice inoculated with
brain extracts from scrapie-infected animals and from humans
afflicted with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have long provided a
model for the infectious forms of prion disorders. And the
inherited prion diseases have been modeled in transgenic mice
carrying mutant PrP genes. 
<P>
These murine representations of the human prion afflictions
should not only extend understanding of how prions cause brain
degeneration, they should also create opportunities to evaluate
therapies for these devastating maladies.<P>

<H2>Striking Similarities</H2>
<P>Ongoing research may also help determine whether prions
consisting of other proteins play a part in more common
neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There are
some marked similarities in all these disorders. As is true of
the known prion diseases, the more widespread ills mostly occur
sporadically but sometimes "run" in families. All are also
usually diseases of middle to later life and are marked by
similar pathology: neurons degenerate, protein deposits can
accumulate as plaques, and glial cells (which support and nourish
nerve cells) grow larger in reaction to damage to neurons.<P>

Strikingly, in none of these disorders do white blood
cells--those ever present warriors of the immune
system--infiltrate the brain. If a virus were involved in these
illnesses, white cells would be expected to appear.   Recent
findings in yeast encourage speculation that prions unrelated in
amino acid sequence to the PrP protein could exist. Reed B.
Wickner of the NIH reports that a protein called Ure2p might
sometimes change its conformation, thereby affecting its activity
in the cell. In one shape, the protein is active; in the other,
it is silent.   The collected studies described here argue
persuasively that the prion is an entirely new class of
infectious pathogen and that prion diseases result from
aberrations of protein conformation. Whether changes in protein
shape are responsible for common neurodegenerative diseases, such
as Alzheimer's, remains unknown, but it is a possibility that
should not be ignored.<P>

<H2>BOX: A Persuasive Experiment</H2>
<P>Several studies have shown that prions composed only of PrP
are able to convey infection from one animal to another. In one
such experiment, the author and his colleagues created mice
carrying many copies of a mutant PrP gene; these animals made
high levels of mutant PrP, some of which appears to adopt the
scrapie conformation. Eventually all the mice displayed symptoms
of brain damage and died. <P>
Then the workers injected brain tissue
from the diseased animals into genetically altered mice making
low levels of the same mutant PrP protein. (Such mice were chosen
as recipients because scrapie PrP is most attracted to PrP
molecules having the same composition.) Uninoculated mice did not
become ill (indicating that making low levels of the aberrant
protein was safe), but many of the treated ones did. Moreover,
brain tissue transferred from the diseased recipients to their
healthy counterparts caused illness once again. If the aberrant
protein were unable to transmit infection, none of the inoculated
animals would have sickened.

This document describes infectious agents which (almost certainly) do not have a nucleic acid genome. It seems that a protein alone is the infectious agent. The infectious agent has been called a <B>prion</B>. A prion has been defined as <B>"small proteinaceous infectious particles which resist inactivation by procedures that modify nucleic acids"</B>. The discovery that proteins alone can transmit an infectious disease has come as a considerable surprise to the scientific community. <P>
Prion diseases are often called <B>spongiform encephalopathies</B> because of the post mortem appearance of the brain with large vacuoles in the cortex and cerebellum. Probably most mammalian species develop these diseases. Specific examples include:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Scrapie</B>: sheep
<LI><B>TME</B> (transmissible mink encephalopathy): mink
<LI><B>CWD</B> (chronic wasting disease): muledeer, elk
<LI><B>BSE</B> (bovine spongiform encephalopathy): cows
</UL><P>
<H3>Humans are also susceptible to several prion diseases:</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>CJD</B>: Creutzfeld-Jacob Disease
<LI><B>GSS</B>: Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome
<LI><B>FFI</B>: Fatal familial Insomnia
<LI><B>Kuru</B>
<li><B>Alpers Syndrome</B>
</UL><P>
These original classifications were based on a clinical evaluation of a patients family history symptoms and are still widely used, however more recent and accurate molecular diagnosis of the disease is gradually taking the place of this classification. <P>
The <B>incidence</B> of sporadic CJD is about 1 per million per year.<BR>
GSS occurs at about 2% of the rate of CJD.<P>
It is estimated that 1 in 10,000 people are infected with CJD at the time of death.<BR>
These figures are likely to be underestimates since prion diseases may be misdiagnosed as other neurological disorders. <P>
The diseases are characterised by <B>loss of motor control, dementia, paralysis wasting and eventually death, typically following pneumonia</B>. Fatal Familial Insomnia presents with an untreatable insomnia and dysautonomia. Details of pathogenesis are largely unknown.<P>
Visible end results at post-mortem are <B>non-inflammatory lesions, vacuoles, amyloid protein deposits and astrogliosis</B>.<P>
<B>GSS</B> is distinct from CJD, it occurs typically in the 4th-5th decade, characterised by cerebellar ataxia and concomitant motor problems, dementia less common and disease course lasts several years to death. (Originally thought to be familial, but now known to occur sporadically as well).<BR>
<B>CJD</B> typically occurs a decade later has cerebral involvement so dementia is more common and patient seldom survives a year (originally thought to be sporadic, but now known to be familial as well).<BR>
<B>FFI</B> pathology is characterised by severe selective atrophy of the thalamus.<BR>
<B>Alpers syndrome</B> is the name given to prion diseases in infants.
<P>
<B>Scrapie</B> was the first example of this type of disease to be noticed and has been known about for many hundreds of years. There are two likely methods of transmission in sheep:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Infection of pasture with placental tissue carrying the agent followed by ingestion, i.e. an acquired infection.<P>
<li>Parry showed considerable foresight and anticipated many years work by suggesting that it is not normally an infectious disease at all but a genetic disorder. He further suggested that selective breeding would get rid of the disease altogether.
</OL><P>
<H3>Humans can be infected by prions in 2 ways:</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Acquired infection (diet and following medical procedures such as surgery, growth hormone injections, corneal transplants) i.e. infectious agent implicated.<P>
<li>Hereditary mendelian transmission where it is an autosomal and dominant trait. This is not prima facie consistent with an infectious agent.
</OL>
<P>
This is the feature that marks out prion diseases as unique. They are <B>both</B> infectious <B>and</B> hereditary diseases. They are also sporadic, in the sense that there are also cases in which there is no known risk factor although it seems likely that infection was acquired in one of the two ways listed above.<P>
In fact prion diseases in humans are probably primarily a <B>genetic neurotoxic disorder</B>. Transmission of the disease to humans via infectious prions is likely to be rare.

<B>Kuru</B> is the condition which first brought prion diseases to prominence in the 1950s. Found in geographically isolated tribes in the Fore highlands of New Guinea. Established that ingesting brain tissue of dead relatives for religious reasons was likely to be the route of transmission. They ground up the brain into a pale grey soup, heated it and ate it. Clinically, the disease resembles CJD. Other tribes in the vicinity with same religious habit did not develop the disease. Speculated that at some point in the past a tribe member developed CJD, and as brain tissue is highly infectious this allowed the disease to spread. Afflicted tribes were encouraged not to ingest brain tissue and the incidence of disease rapidly declined and is now almost unknown.<P>
Evidence suggests that a prion is a modified form of a normal cellular protein known as <B>PrPc</B> (for cellular), a normal host protein encoded by a single exon of a single copy gene. This protein is found predominantly on the surface of neurones attached by a glycoinositol phospholipid anchor, and is <B>protease sensitive</B>. Thought to be involved in synaptic function.<BR>
The modified form of PrPc which may cause disease i.e. the prion is known as <B>PrPsc</B> (for scrapie) which is <B>relatively resistant to proteases</B> and accumulates in cytoplasmic vesicles of diseased individuals. <P>
It has been proposed that PrPsc when introduced into a normal cell causes the conversion of PrPc into PrPsc. Process is unknown but it could involve a chemical or conformational modification.

Presumably these mutations enhance the rate of spontaneous conversion of PrPc to PrPsc which permits disease manifestation within the lifetime of an individual. Suggests that some sporadic incidents can be accounted for by somatic mutation of the PrP gene.<P>
<H3>5. Crucial experiment:</H3>
Mice carrying a murine transgene with the 102P-L GSS mutation spontaneously develop a lethal scrapie like disease. Brains also contain infectious prions because transmission to recipient animals has been demonstrated.<BR>
Mice lacking the PrPc gene develop normally, no evident physiological or behavioural problems. Suggests that loss of PrPc function is unlikely to be the cause of disease rather accumulation of PrPsc is responsible. When inoculated with prions they do not develop disease . There are obvious implications here for the livestock and pharmaceutical industries and treatment of familial cases. Animals expressing reduced levels of PrPc are also resistant to infection - perhaps more immediately relevant to human disease. Animals overexpressing PrPc are more likely to develop prion diseases.
<P>
<H2>Evidence against the prion model:</H2>
The existence of many different strains of scrapie (>15: latency, lesion patterns differ) which can be propagated in the same inbred mouse strain. These can transmit serially without changes in properties in the same mouse strain homozygous for a single PrP genotype. Cannot argue that there a distinct PrPc is converted to distinct PrPsc. Must mean that a common PrPc is corrupted in a different way, seems improbable but there is now experimental support for it.<P>
<CENTER><H1>So how can a protein be infectious?</H1></CENTER>
PrPsc is a protease resistant form of PrPc, both are extensively post translationally modified. No chemical differences between the two forms of the protein have been detected. Clearly there must be some difference. One great problem is that infectivity ratio is about 100,000:1, so infectious agent even if derived from PrPc may not be PrPsc and it could be chemically modified.<P>
However, a more likely possibility is that the difference between PrPc and PrPsc is conformational. 3D structure not known but other physical techniques suggest that PrPc contains almost no beta sheet whilst PrPsc has a lot. Proposed therefore that this protein can adopt 2 quite different stable conformations. The safe PrPc form is normally adopted but rarely it can switch to the PrPsc form. Mutations favour this switch. Propose that PrPsc is transdominant and converts PrPc to PrPsc in an exponential fashion. Precedents for this model do exist. There is a yeast mutant phenotype which doesn't correlate to any mutational difference in the gene structure but does correlate to a different protein structure. The Ure2p protein converts to an inactive conformation. Mutations in the tumour suppressor protein p53 which are associated with the onset of neoplastic disease have a different conformation to the normal protein. When normal protein is incubated with mutant protein its conformation is altered to the mutant form.<P>
<H2>Concluding Remarks:</H2>
With an apparent incidence of less than 100 cases a year in the UK you might think it can hardly be considered an important medical problem. However, recent diagnostic procedures show that it is more common than we think. The pathology is similar to other more common neurological disorders with a similar late onset, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.<P>
There is also, at least in the UK, BSE a grand experiment going on with us as the laboratory animals. Epidemiological studies show that BSE almost certainly arose through feeding cattle, a herbivore, with scrapie-infected sheep meet. In the early 1980s, industry changed their method of rendering offal. Presumably the agent which was previously inactivated or removed by this process no longer was. Recently about 100,000 cattle p.a. developed BSE. The rate may now be declining. We have already seen today how new scrapie strains arise when passaged through new hosts, as yet we do not fully know what the characteristics of the BSE strain are. It is clear that scrapie is not as infectious via the oral route as via intracerebral inoculation and there is no evidence that it is has been transmitted to WoMan by dietary means. One hopes that BSE is the same but agent has been transmitted to cats, pigs and other exotic ruminants via infected beef. So one cannot state with certainty that there is no risk to humans from infected meat. PrP is present in skeletal muscle (steak). PrP is also present on the surface of lymphocytes which are present in milk. Pasteurisation temperatures will not destroy this infective agent. Again there is no evidence that milk ingestion can cause disease.<P>
We all have a long wait.<P>

 <p>


The announcement by British health authorities that bovine

spongiform  encephalopathy (BSE, pictured in medulla of cow,

left), also known as  mad cow disease, may have been 

transmitted to humans has led to a chaotic situation in the UK

with ripple  effects occurring throughout Europe and the rest of

the world. What is BSE  and what is its relation to scrapie in

sheep and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease  (CJD) in humans? How did

the current epidemic begin?  <p> I asked Frederick A.  Murphy,
DVM,

PhD, Dean of the School of Veterinary Medicine at the 

University of California, Davis these and other questions in an

attempt to  sort out the science from the media hysteria

surrounding the announcement  from the UK on March 21, 1996 that

10 people may have become infected with  the BSE agent through

exposure to beef.



<p> <br>

<hr> <p> <br> <B> Let's start at the beginning. What exactly is
BSE?</B>



<p>

 BSE, that is bovine spongiform

encephalopathy, also known in Britain as  the  mad cow disease, 

is a progressive, lethal central nervous system  disease of

cattle. It is characterized by the appearance in neurons in the 

brain of affected cattle of vacuoles, clear holes, that give the

brain the  appearance of a sponge -- this is where the term

spongiform came from.



<p> <br> <b>What is the reason for the current panic?

What is the link, if any,  between BSE in cattle, scrapie in

sheep and CJD in humans?</b>



<p>

 BSE was initially recognized in cattle in

the UK in 1986; there is good  information that it had not

occurred before then. Epidemiological research  led to the

conclusion that the bovine agent had originated from the scrapie

agent, which had been present in sheep in the United Kingdom for

at least  200 years. It is presumed, but will likely never be

proven, that the scrapie agent  jumped species  and moved into

cattle when sheep offal (the leftover  parts of butchered

animals) was included in protein supplements fed to  cattle.

After cattle started to die, cattle carcasses and offal were 

included in the same protein supplements -- this seems to have

amplified the  epidemic. 

 <p> 



The epidemic in cattle in Britain reached incredible

proportions; by 1993  more than 1,000 cases per week were being

reported. More than 160,000  infected cows have now been

identified, involving more than 50% of the dairy  herds in the

UK. Protein supplements containing sheep and cattle offal were 

banned in the UK in 1988, but it was not until 1991-1992 that

the ban was  strictly enforced. Given the long incubation of

BSE, the epidemic curve  (number of new cases reported per week)

didn't start downward until late  1993. It is now down to about

250 cases per week..



<p>



Even by 1990 when the epidemic curve was on the upswing,

questions were  raised in many quarters in the UK, "...does BSE

pose a risk to human  health?" British government officials at

the time said  don't worry, there  is nothing to worry about. 

This of course only led the public to become  more skeptical.

Even then, in 1990, the editors of the British journal  Nature

reacted, saying: "...Never say there is no danger {risk}.

Instead,  say that there is always a danger {risk), and that the

problem is to  calculate what it is. Never say that the risk is

negligible unless you are  sure that your listeners share your

own philosophy of life..." I think this  advice has come back to

haunt British officials again, six years later.



<p>



The next chapter started with the announcement on March 21, 1996

of 10 cases  of CJD in people not otherwise considered at high

risk. These individuals  were much younger than the usual cases

of CJD that occur sporadically  everywhere in the world at an

incidence of about one per million population  per year. This

sporadic incidence of CJD is the same even in countries, like 

Australia, where there is no scrapie. Also, there have been

statements in  the press, but no details, that the pathologic

changes in the brains of  these 10 patients are different from

those in usual CJD cases. In any case,  it is the

age-distribution of these 10 cases (average age 27 vs. 63 for 

sporadic CJD cases) that led the British expert committee to

make its  startling announcement.



<p> <br>

<b>So, the problem in the UK can be traced to

feed supplements containing  infected cow and sheep parts?</b>



<p>

 In the early 1980s in England the rendering

process (by which livestock  carcasses are converted to various

products, including protein supplements  for livestock feed) was

changed. Earlier, a solvent extraction step had been  used to

extract fats (tallow); this step was stopped when the price of

the  petroleum-based solvents used to extract fats went up. The

infectious agent  is solvent-sensitive. Otherwise, the

infectious agent is extremely hardy --  it can survive boiling

and many disinfectants, but is readily destroyed by  extremely

high temperature (such as in an autoclave), or by oxidizing 

agents, or by solvents.



<p>



Of course, this change in the rendering process was only part of

the story  -- in tracing the source of the problem other

practices employed in the  livestock industries of the UK have

to be assessed -- and the still  mysterious events that likely

led to the  species jump  of the scrapie agent  into cattle must

be assessed too.



<p> <br>

<b>Our knowledge of CJD goes back to earlier

studies of kuru, the so called  headhunter disease seen in Papua

New Guinea, where people became infected  after eating the

brains of their foes and preparing their dead relatives for 

burial. How are these diseases related?</b>



<p>

 Kuru and CJD should be thought of as two

different spongiform  encephalopathies. Kuru studies were

instructive since they showed for the  first time that a slowly

progressive neurological disease of humans can be  infectious,

that is transmitted from one person to another. For this 

discovery Carleton Gajdusek was awarded the Nobel Prize.

Recently, as the  power of molecular biology has been applied to

the spongiform  encephalopathies, it has become clear that each

disease (scrapie, BSE, and  others in animals, and CJD, kuru and

Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease in humans) is caused by a

distinct variant prion.



<p> <br> <b>You've mentioned prions. What are they? How

are they associated with the  pathogenesis of these diseases?</b>



<p>

Prions are the most bizarre infectious

agents ever imagined. It was  Stanley Prusiner of the University

of California, San Francisco, who first  discovered the nature

of prions and suggested they are the causative agents  of the

spongiform encephalopathies. For this he won the prestigious

Lasker  Prize two years ago. Prions (pronounced  pree-ons ) are

proteins,  rogue proteins,  and nothing  else. They contain no

nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). They consist of a single  molecule

containing about 250 amino acids, termed the PrP protein. They

are  abnormal variants of proteins that occur normally in cells,

such as human  brain cells. Amazingly, abnormal PrP proteins,

when they enter the body, are  able to convert their normal

counterparts into more of the abnormal forms.  The difference

between the normal and abnormal proteins does not lie in  their

primary structure (the sequence of their amino acids), but

rather in  their folding -the abnormal PrP proteins are folded

in a way that allows  them to resist normal protease degradation

so that over time this leads to  the build up of aggregates of

PrP, especially in neurons in the brain. These  aggregates

resemble the tangles of abnormal protein found in neurons in 

Alzheimer s disease patients, but as in Alzheimer s disease, we

do not know  how the presence of these tangles causes neurologic

disease.



<p>



Prions are the only "life forms" that break the great "central

dogma" of  biology. That is, we have come to expect that all 

life forms  from viruses  to bacteria to plants to humans to

hand down the blueprints for all their  progeny via their DNA

(except for some viruses which carry their blueprints  as an RNA

genome), and we expect that the process for converting the 

blueprints into building blocks must involve replication of DNA,

transcription of the message into RNA, and translation of the

RNA s message  to form proteins, the building blocks of cells,

tissues, organs and whole  organisms. Here we have  life forms 

where abnormal proteins, the PrP  proteins, direct the refolding

of normal proteins just by direct contact.



<p>



PrPs from the various spongiform encephalopathies have been

sequenced and  found to differ, in some cases by very little, in

some cases by quite a bit.  For example, recent research has

shown that the scrapie PrP protein differs  from the BSE PrP

protein at only seven amino acid loci, whereas the BSE PrP 

protein differs from the human CJD PrP at more than 30 loci.

These  differences explain the concept of  strains  and help

explain why prions  from one species might jump more easily into

another species than another.  It is difficult to find the terms

to discuss prions -- for example, can we  talk about  mutants 

when there is no DNA? What would Watson and Crick think  of all

this?



<p> <br>

<b>Are there factors that may predispose an

animal or human to infection?  After all, it would seem that

many more people are exposed to prions than  actually get

disease?</b>



<p>

 In a nutshell, the answer to this question

is,  we don t know. It s true  in every disease that there are

more exposures than infections. And it s  true that in most

cases we don't know why one person or animal gets infected  and

another doesn't. With the prion diseases, we don't know much

about a  dose effect -- beyond a  minimum infectious dose,  does

a big dose of prions  lead to a higher probability of infection

or a faster progression to  clinical disease? In the real-world

setting, what do we know about how easy  it was for prions

contained in feed supplements to enter a cow's body? The  answer

is,  not much. 



<p> <br>

<b> How is a prion different from a virus? What

does a virus have that a  prion does not?</b>



<p>

 As President of the International Committee

on the Taxonomy of Viruses,  I've had to wrestle with this

question -- in our most recent report, we have  a chapter on

prions, contributed by a study group chaired by Stanley 

Prusiner. This chapter is included in a section entitled 

sub-viral agents.   This title has allowed us to avoid the

question, to keep our definition of  virus  intact, to hold to a

sense that a virus should have a nucleic acid  (DNA or RNA)

genome, and still keep the prions under the wing of virologists 

around the world. After all, it is virologists who care most

about prions,  and it is virology meetings and virology journals

where scientific progress  on prions and prion diseases is

reported.



<p> <br> <b>What about the hypothesis that prions are

not infectious themselves, but  serve only as a kind of virus

activator?</b>



<p>

 People who still believe that there has to

be some nucleic acid somewhere  in the picture have been caught

out in the cold by all the recent progress  in our understanding

of the nature of prions. Perhaps these people have to 

rationalize some direct role of a nucleic acid in the infectious

moiety and  so they envision some kind of activator role for the

prion, acting in  concert with a yet-to-be-found traditional

virus. As the nature of prions  becomes better known, I think

this idea will fade away.



<p> <br>

<b>Is there any evidence that CJD can appear as

a genetic disease?</b>



<p>

 Yes, there is a familial form of CJD,

accounting for about 10% of cases.  In the familial disease

there is are mutations in the gene encoding the  normal protein

such that the protein tends to fold in the abnormal way and 

tends to pile up into aggregates in brain cells with lethal

consequences.



<p> <br>

<b>How do we know that these new cases of

so-called BSE disease in humans  are not CJD? How can we tell if

someone got CJD from a cow, or if they got  it from their

grandfather?</b>

 <p> We can tell by genetic analysis. This has

been well studied in the  familial form of CJD. The prion

protein in familial cases is the same in  each family member

that has it, and different in all other families.  Sometimes the

difference is as small as one amino acid, but these  differences

can be used to determine the pedigree of the prion. I'm sure 

such analyses are being applied to the 10 cases just reported in

the UK.



<p> <br>

<b>The British announcement has raised

questions not only about the safety  of British beef, but

British milk and dairy products as well. What is known  about

this?</b>



<p>

 There has never been any evidence of any

prion being transmitted through  milk. Although, we don't know

if prions can occur in the milk of a cow with  BSE, there is

very good epidemiologic evidence that this is not a route of 

transmission. For example, if the BSE prion was transmitted in

cow s milk,  wouldn't we expect to see BSE in calves fed on such

milk? There are solid  data from the UK that such calves have

not become infected.



<p> <br>

<b>There is a report that the French are

worried about infection via  cosmetics containing animal

products? Is this far fetched?</b>



<p>

 It seems far fetched to me. Cosmetics are

full of lipid-solvent-based  chemicals which would be very

destructive to prions.



<p> <br>

<b>What about the political impact of the BSE

epidemic?</b>



<p>

 The global political impact has been

incredible. We're now reading that  this might be the ultimate

crisis for Prime Minister Major's Tory  government, and could

lead to its downfall. There are also huge economic  costs. Some

estimates go as high as $50 billion, with 300,000 jobs at risk. 

At the recent Turin (Italy) meeting of the leaders of the

European  Community, representatives of European countries even

brought up questions  concerning the pace of the unification of

Europe. Even though it has now  been decided that quite a bit of

the cost of eliminating BSE from British  cattle will be shared

among other European governments, I don t think we ve  heard the

last of these tensions at the highest levels of governments.



<p> <br>

<b>What are public health authorities doing in

the US?</b>



<p>

 There was just a big meeting in Washington

with people from the American  agricultural sector, veterinary

medicine, USDA, and cattlemen groups.  Ruminant (cattle and

sheep) -based feeds are already excluded in the US on a 

voluntary basis, but this will soon become an FDA regulation.



<p>



There is no indication of BSE infection in US cattle. APHIS, the

Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service of the USDA, will be

increasing its  surveillance measures. In my personal opinion,

this kind of direct  surveillance based upon histopathological

examination of brains of selected  cattle, has been modest in

scope and scale until now -- I suspect that the  level of such

surveillance will increase. Another kind of surveillance is 

also ticking up: trained APHIS inspectors working in cattle

sales yards and  slaughter house yards are on the lookout for

animals with clinical signs of  BSE. Education is also being

improved for practicing veterinarians and  farmers. The USDA has

also announced that it will increase its research in  this area.



<p> <br>

<b>So, do you feel confident eating US beef?</b>



<p>

 Absolutely -- I m a beef eater, always will

be. Last year the concern in  this country was over E. coli
0:157 in hamburgers. As you will recall,  cooking

temperatures were raised to kill the bug in ground beef. We

survived  that scare, and now we eat fast-food hamburgers

without a second thought. In  regard to BSE, the American public

should feel confident in eating  American-grown beef -- the BSE

prion has never been found in our country.



<p> <br>

<b>Similar encephalopathy has been reported in

cats in England. Is there a  risk of pet-to-owner
transmission?</b>



<p>

 Other animals in the UK exposed to the same

protein supplements as cows,  such as some zoo animals, did get

infected. Indeed, cats began to get the  disease about the same

time as the BSE epidemic began in cattle in Britain.  Whether

these cats got infected from the same feed products (such as

bone  meal as well as protein supplements) that cows were

eating, or whether they  got infected by being fed infected meat

products is not likely ever to be  known. In any case, I cannot

imagine any circumstance whereby humans might  be at risk from

their cats.



<p> <br> <b>What about the gardener who just put bone

meal on his gladiolus bulbs.  Could he be inhaling prions?</b>



<p>

 If the gardener is in America, the bone meal

would have come from  American livestock. Since there is no

evidence that BSE occurs in this  country, that risk would seem

vanishingly small. We don't know what the risk  to a British

gardener might be because we don't know enough about the 

transmission of the BSE agent. All in all, I call this a 

...what if...?   question -one can go on and on asking such

question, never pausing for  answers, never getting anywhere.



<p> <br> <b>Is the US government responding adequately?</b>



<p>

I would say, yes. As I mentioned, our

agricultural sector, our USDA, has  taken this matter very

seriously and is doing many things to minimize risk.  Our health

sector, our CDC and State health departments, are on top of the 

matter as well. I would like to see a better interaction between

surveillance, research and public education between the health

sector and  agricultural sector. In my view, veterinary medicine

is right in the middle  of all this -- serving as a health

science and as an agricultural science --  communicating with

people across all turf boundaries. I expect that my  colleagues

in veterinary medicine in our country will play a major role in 

our national response over the coming months. My colleagues in

veterinary  medicine in the UK have done a fine job -- their

sound scientific  recommendations have, however, been caught up

in the mega-political mess  that would overwhelm any

scientifically based activities.



<p> <br> <b>What are the research priorities now?</b>



<p>

 At the heart of the matter we're dealing

with the abnormal folding of a  native bovine protein. This

protein, the abnormal PrP protein, is not  immunogenic and

doesn't seem like a reasonable target for vaccine  development.



<p>



The number one need is for a diagnostic test that could be used

for early  diagnosis in cattle and humans. We keep hearing that

such tests are  forthcoming immediately, but I've heard that for

several years now and we  still do not have such tests. Whenever

such a test comes along, it will then  be along time before it

could be validated and proof tested in the field. I  think this

development should be a national priority.



<p>



What would such a test be like? It can't be a DNA or RNA probe

since the  gene encoding the PrP protein is a normal constituent

of the body. It may  have to be an immunological test, one that

is specific for the abnormally  folded shape of the PrP protein.



<p> <br> <b>What do you think could form the basis for

treatment of these  prion-related encephalopathies?</b> 



<p>

 For cattle with BSE there will not likely

ever be a treatment -slaughter  will continue to be the

end-game. Stanley Prusiner thinks that for humans with CJD one

tack should involve  designing drugs that would stabilize the

normal protein throughout the body,  preventing its refolding

into the abnormal PrP protein. Prusiner also thinks  that

antisense technology may prove useful. This might involve

delivering  into human brains engineered genes that would block

those genes that give  rise to unwanted proteins. Of course,

this would require that the normal  protein from which abnormal

PrP proteins derive are not essential-- so far  we do not know

what the function of the normal protein may be. Progress in 

this area could spin off and provide keys for Alzheimer's

research as well.  All this would seem to represent years of

research.

<h3>MAD COW DISEASE:  A SOBERING "WAKE UP CALL"?</h3>

<p>

Copyright 1996 by David J. DeRose, MD, MPH

<p>

"Mad Cow Disease" grabbed headlines in late March 1996 when a group of

prestigious British Scientists were constrained to admit that the fatal

disease could possibly be transmitted to humans.  The news brought the

British meat industry to a virtual standstill.   English folk avoided the

meat markets.  The European Union and a cascade of other countries banned

British beef.

<p>

Referred to as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) by the medical

community, the illness is aptly named.  The designation makes it clear that

we are talking about a brain disease (encephalopathy) that affects cows

(bovine).  Furthermore, the disease riddles the afflicted cow's brain with

tiny holes--causing it to look like a sponge under a microscope (thus

rendering the brain "spongiform").  The lay term, "mad cow disease," in

addition to being much easier to pronounce, also conveys the fact that

infected cows may develop mental deterioration and behavioral abnormalities.

<p>

First diagnosed in Britain in 1986, BSE has powerful emotional appeal.  It is

one of a group of fatal brain diseases that can be transmitted from one

living creature to another.  These diseases are technically called

"transmissible encephalopathies."  Many British consumers had apparently

comforted themselves for years with the thought that it was unlikely for such

a disease to spread from cows to humans.  However, even before March 1996, I

would guess that scientists who were aware of this fatal cattle disease

would--if honest--have to admit to some level of discomfort.  After all,

transmissible encephalopathies affect many other creatures besides cattle.

 Some 16 or18 animal species have been documented to come down with diseases

that resemble BSE.  Many or all of those species can apparently get a

BSE-like disease from eating infected cattle meat.  Furthermore, cattle

themselves likely contracted the disease from a different species.  Most

researchers believe that BSE was introduced into British cattle herds by

feeding them dead sheep carcasses which were infected with a similar illness

called "scrapie."  (The sheep disease gets its name from the fact that

afflicted sheep can become mentally unstable and literally "scrape" the wool

off their hide.)

<a name="targ_3">

<h3>HUMANS CAN GET TRANSMISSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHIES</h3>

<p>

However, it is not only animals that can contract transmissible

encephalopathies.  Humans can also get them.  A disease called

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) can be thought of as a type of <A NAME="Alz"><B>fast acting

Alzheimer's disease</B></A>.  This is an extremely rare illness that has typically

occurred in older individuals.  I have personally only seen one patient with

this rare and fatal disease.  

<p>

We know from cannibalistic tribes in New Guinea, that a disease like CJD is

transmissible to humans.  There, at one time, the dead were honored through

ritual cannibalistic rites.  Children typically ate the brains of their

deceased parents during these rituals.   Many of them did get a disease

called "kuru" which is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy similar (if

not the same as) CJD.  The disease sometimes took up to 30 years to develop.

 Young children who engaged in these cannibalistic practices tended to

develop the illness sooner than their older siblings or peers who also

consumed infected brains.  

<p>

Many scientists had speculated that if sheep could transmit the disease to

beef, beef could transmit the disease to humans.  In fact even in the United

States, a country which claims to have no evidence of BSE, there have been

reports that are less than comforting.  For example, an outbreak of a related

illness, Transmissible Mink Encephalopathy occurred on a Wisconsin mink farm.

 It was discovered that the mink illness was likely related to that farmer's

practice of feeding them local "<A NAME="downer"><B>downer</B></A>" dairy cows.  This is a designation

for cows that either are so ill that they fall down and can not get up, or

actually are found dead on the farm.  Deemed unfit for human consumption,

such cows have been used for animal feed among other things.  In this case,

the carcasses found their way into the minks' diets.

<p>

The mink outbreak provided another example of probable BSE infecting other

species.  (The link could not be made definitely since the "downer cow or

cows" that were fed to the mink were not autopsied.)  It also raised another

concern:  countries like the US who think they have nothing to worry about,

may in fact have diseased animals in their herds.  

<p>

Despite assurances from the USDA that BSE has not crossed the Atlantic, the

mink story leaves us with an uncomfortable feeling.  However, there is even

more disturbing news.  Laboratory research has demonstrated that different

strains of prions do exist.  For example, a British researcher found that

when he injected the prions from an infected group of goats into mice, those

mice developed an encephalopathy (brain disease) characterized by drowsiness.

 The prions from a different group of infected goats also caused brain

disease when injected into mice; however, instead of becoming lethargic, the

diseased mice turned hyperactive!  The message was clear:  there were

apparently at least two different strains of scrapie-like illness in goats.

 When transmitted to another species (in this case the mice) the infected

rodents came down with one or the other of these two very different looking

diseases.

<p>

Such research has raised an important question.  If scrapie in goats could

give rise to different appearing diseases in mice, could sheep scrapie result

in more than one type of cow disease?  There is some suggestion that this

could be the case.  There may well be more than one strain or type of BSE.

 The different types may cause different looking diseases.  Some who have

been studying links between cattle and mink disease in the US, have raised

the concern that BSE is present in America, but "looks different" than the

British variant due to a different BSE strain.  Specifically, the <B><A NAME="bse">BSE in the

US</A></B> may be one cause of "downer cow" disease rather than its "mad cow" cousin

in England.

<a name="targ_4">

<h3>FINALLY TAKING NOTICE</h3>

<p>

It was Creutzfeldt-Jakob statistics that really got the medical community's

attention in March 1996.  By that time some eight young Britons had succumbed

to this devastating illness.  The unusual occurrence of the disease in young

people combined with a different pattern to the sponge-like brain

destruction, prompted leading British scientists to raise the concern that

BSE may be the source of a new variant of CJD.  Further thickening the plot

was the occurrence of a worrisome cluster of CJD in British dairy farmers.

<p>

The biggest concern, of course, is that we are just glimpsing the tip of that

proverbial iceberg.  One prominent researcher is putting estimates of

BSE-related CJD well into the thousands.  And the problem does not appear to

be confined to Britain.  There are worrisome reports now from France and

Italy.  Still others are raising concerns that some cases of "Alzheimer's"

may actually be spongiform encephalopathy.  Granted, all of these conjectures

may not prove true; but what if just some of them are?  Even if only in part?

<a name="targ_5">

<h3>PRIONS:  FRIGHTENING CARRIERS OF DISEASE</h3>

<p>

Adding to the fear of this relatively newly appreciated disease is the nature

of the BSE infectious agent.  Many animal borne diseases are caused by

bacteria or viruses.  Risk from these illnesses can often be decreased or

eliminated by a combination of careful washing, refrigeration and thorough

cooking.  Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, however, appears to be caused by

an unusual infectious agent known as a "prion" (pronounced "pree-on").

 Prions are truly very unusual infectious agents.  They have no genetic

material and consist entirely of protein.  Research suggests that these prion

proteins are similar in structure to proteins that occur naturally in the

brains of humans and other animals.  The prions differ from those similar

normal proteins, however, in their three dimensional shape.  Prions seem to

cause disease by coming into contact with those normal proteins and then

stimulating them to change their shape to mimic the prion protein.  This

change in shape appears to set up a chain reaction.  Normal proteins change

their shape to look like the prion proteins and then later influence

neighboring proteins to do the same.  The end result is a progressively

devastating and ultimately fatal disease.  No treatment has yet been

discovered.

<p>

Making the picture even bleaker is the resiliency of prions.  They are not

destroyed by the usual means used to kill infectious agents.  They are

resistant even to boiling at temperatures as high as 250 degrees Celsius

(well over 400 degrees Fahrenheit).  They are also resistant to ionizing

radiation.

<p>

Prion related diseases are also extremely difficult to diagnose.  There is no

way to do a blood test for BSE and an infected animal does not mount any

immune response to the infection.  Tell-tale signs of diseases like BSE are

usually only possible to diagnose at autopsy.  However, not all infected

animals necessarily have the characteristic sponge-like brain changes.  Of

particular concern, animals who carry the disease and have not yet developed

signs of BSE, may not show the characteristic brain involvement.  

<a name="targ_6">

<h3>WHAT ANIMAL PRODUCTS ARE FREE OF PRIONS?</h3>

<p>

Of even more concern is the fact that we do not know which tissues could

carry the infection.  Most of the focus of late has been on beef.  This is

warranted.  Although organ tissue carries the greatest risk, animal studies

do suggest that meat itself can transmit prion-related diseases.  However, we

cannot exclude the possibility that milk could also carry disease-inducing

prions.  Many may recall how some years ago assurances were given that a

mother could not pass HIV to her child by nursing.  Of course, we now know

that HIV can be transmitted in breast milk.   Granted, prion diseases are

vastly different than HIV.  The risk from <A NAME="milk">milk</A> (if it does exist) does appear

to be much smaller than from eating beef or cattle organ tissues.

 Nonetheless, a British BSE expert has pointed out that there has been at

least one human case that suggests passage of prions in milk.  This was the

case of a woman dying with CJD who demonstrated the infectious agent in her

colostrum (the type of breast milk made in the initial days following

delivery).  

<p>

Eating the flesh of other animals (besides cows) or drinking their milk may

not be safe either.  These other animals may also be affected with a

prion-related diseases.  As we have already mentioned, sheep as well as goats

can become infected with such illnesses.  Even if some of these illnesses do

not seem to be easily transmitted to humans (because of what is often called,

"the species barrier"), the possibility exists that different strains of

prions could present more danger.  

<a name="targ_7">

<h3>OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h3>

<p>

There is one other very important aspect that needs to be reemphasized.

 These transmissible spongiform encephalopathies have extremely long

incubation periods.  (This is the technical term for how long it takes for a

person with the infection to actually show signs of the disease)  As already

mentioned, in humans, there is evidence that kuru can take up to 30 years to

manifest itself.  This is likely to be the same with CJD.  With BSE, it may

take up to 6-8 years or more before infected cows show signs of the disease.

 The important implication is that thousands of animals and humans may now be

infected yet not develop symptoms for many years.

<p>

The current British proposal to slaughter all older cows <B><A NAME="inadequate">may not go far

enough</A></B>.  If younger cows are infected they may not yet show any signs of the

disease.  However, an infected cow can theoretically transmit the illness

whether or not it has yet developed symptomatic disease.  The widely

publicized 1988 ban on feeding dead sheep parts to British cattle did not

stop the epidemic.  When the statistics were reviewed in a 1995 report, over

half of all the British cattle that had developed BSE were born after the ban

was implemented.  The important message is that young cows may be infected,

and may be able to transmit disease to humans.

<a name="targ_8">

<h3>CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<p>

The Consumers' Association , an independent British "watchdog group", has

been quoted as saying that the only way to avoid BSE risk would be to stop

eating beef all together.  Others are saying even more.  Some are suggesting

that the time has come to recognize that disease in animals has become so

rampant that we all need to seriously consider becoming vegetarians.  They

point out that BSE is just one of many fatal diseases linked to animals.

 Literally hundreds of deaths have been documented in the US alone from a

host of animal related infections.  Some of the most significant causative

agents may not yet be household words, however most will recognize at least

one of them:  salmonella, listeria, campylobacter, and yersinia.  Of course,

we can't forget that the risk of dying prematurely from the Western World's

two leading killers, cancer and heart disease, generally rises with

increasing consumption of animal products.

<p>

If there is even a small chance of getting a severe fatal disease, some are

suggesting it would be prudent to avoid all animal products.  But maybe a few

other questions are more important.  What is the next transmissible disease

in animals that will be recognized?  Do I want to wait for tragedy to strike

me or someone close to me--or have I already had warning enough?

<a name="targ_9">

<h3>APPENDIX:  IS IT ALREADY TOO LATE?</h3>

<p>

If you have been eating beef and using other animal products for years is it

already too late?  The answer is clearly, "no."  In the case of human prion

related diseases, there is evidence that the total amount of prion exposure

affects the incubation period of the disease.  In other words, someone who

eats a large amount of prion containing foods may develop the disease in 10

years or less, while someone with moderate, yet significantly less, exposure

may develop the condition in 15-20 years.  Another with still smaller

exposure may not come down with the illness for 30 or more years.

<p>

Thus, even if someone was doomed to come down with a condition like CJD

(because of previous exposure to prions), it may be possible to delay the

onset of the disease significantly.  And don't forget:  a diet that moves

away from animal products can also dramatically help you decrease your risk

of other diseases like heart disease and cancer.

<A NAME="1"><h2>Identification of candidate molecular species</h2></A>



The existence of many strains of scrapie, some of which change properties on serial passage,

suggests that the scrapie agent may contain an informational molecule in addition the important

PrP protein.  The simplest hypothesis for its nature is to propose the existence of

a nucleic acid which encodes strain-specific information.  To test this hypothesis a strategy

is being developed whereby any scrapie- specific nucleic acid should be detected, regardless

of its properties.<p>



The basis of the adopted approach is that:<p>



<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>scrapie infectivity can be highly purified with minimal losses - but it is
assumed that any method for purifying nucleic acid from a scrapie infectivity
fraction destroys infectivity, preventing further assay;<p>

<LI>in 1g scrapie-infected brain with a titre of 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>10</FONT></SUP> infectious units/g, a minimum
of &gt;1ng nucleic acid M<SUB><i><FONT SIZE=-1>r</FONT></i></SUB> &gt;60,000 is present;<p>

<LI>silver staining can detect 0.1ng of any nucleic acid in scrapie brain extracts,
if it is sufficiently purified, regardless of its structure or properties.<p>
</UL>

Scrapie infectivity is extracted from infected brain using a protocol in which subcellular

fractionation is used to isolate a membrane-rich fraction.  Dissolution in Sarkosyl followed

by centrifugation to sediment particles &gt;50S is performed twice.  Fractions with little loss of

infectivity compared with the initial titre can be recovered.  The extraction protocol has

been modified specifically to remove ferritin, ribosomes and some PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP>, some of the

contaminants which may interfere in the subsequent observation of candidate nucleic acids.<p>



Guanidine extraction and sedimentation through CsCl allowed the recovery of RNA some of

which was sequenced.  Analysis of more highly purified infectivity fractions showed little

difference between control and scrapie fractions.  However, further purification of the scrapie

infectivity fraction removed much of the RNA, allowing a reassessment of whether

differences between control and scrapie samples could be detected.<p>



<A NAME="2"><h2>Changes in RNA</h2></A>



Elevated levels of 7S RNA in scrapie mouse brain have previously been reported.  This work

has been repeated and results obtained using silver staining and slab gels with a scrapie

mouse model have concurred with the earlier observations.  For a BSE mouse model the

results were less clear-cut.  Silver stain is not specific for nucleic acids, and contaminants

could not be distinguished.  Fluorescent dyes specific for DNA and RNA are now being

exploited to resolve this problem. <p>



Several explanations for 7S RNA changes are possible.  A similar elevation has been

reported in Crohn's disease.  Thus this is probably not a scrapie-specific phenomenon and

elevated levels of 7S RNA may be correlated to pathological progression.  Comparison of

the nucleic acids isolated from brains, spleens and blood of scrapie-infected mice during the

incubation period using a 7S-specific probe should resolve the problem.<p>



<A NAME="3"><h2>Strains of agent</h2></A>



The series of strain typing transmissions to mice from nine UK BSE cattle sources, collected

between 1987 and 1992, has been completed.  All sources have given closely similar results,

indicating that each contained the same major strain of agent.  In addition, strain typing of

two Swiss BSE sources has shown them to be closely related to UK BSE.<p>



In parallel, four transmissions of natural sheep scrapie have been completed, one from a

flock in which a food-borne source in infection was suspected.  None of these resembled BSE

in their transmission characteristics to mice, suggesting that different strains of agent were

present in the sheep and cattle sources.  As in previous studies, the results from the range

of sheep scrapie sources were very variable, in contrast with the uniformity seen with the

BSE cattle sources.  A further scrapie transmission is in progress from a sheep from a flock

with a suspected food-borne source of infection.<p>



Serial passages in different mouse genotypes have been completed, up to the third mouse-to-mouse

passage, from three of the BSE sources and one scrapie source.  The same two

mouse-passaged strains of agent  have been isolated from each BSE source and these differ

from the two strains isolated from the scrapie source.  Further mouse-to-mouse passage lines

have been set up from other sheep scrapie sources, in an attempt to identify any overlap in

the mouse-passaged strains isolated from BSE and scrapie.<p>



Transmissions have been set up from genetically defined Cheviot sheep with natural scrapie

from the NPU flock, in order to characterise the strains of scrapie involved.  The selection,

characterisation and biological cloning of scrapie strains from established isolates has

continued on a small scale.  Stocks of mouse-passaged strains for use in other projects are

also routinely generated in this project.  <p>



<A NAME="4"><h2>Post-transcriptional control of PrP mRNA expression</h2></A>



Reporter gene constructs have been made containing various sections and deletions of the PrP

3'-UTR downstream of the CAT gene.  In <i>in vitro</i> cell-free systems, expression of CAT

protein has not been markedly affected by any of the PrP 3'UTR regions.  However,

constructs which will allow similar studies to take place in cultured cells (N2a), have given

more promising results and an additional set of deletion mutants is now being investigated.<p>



<A NAME="5"><h2>5' and 3' non-coding regions of PrP mRNA</h2></A>



Susceptibility to scrapie has been shown to be associated with polymorphisms in the ovine

PrP protein coding region.  Novel disease-associated amino acid changes have also been

shown in goats.  However, some sheep and goats encoding the same PrP protein variant still

exhibit different susceptibility to scrapie, which might be explained by variation of PrP

expression linked to polymorphisms outside the coding region.  Several new polymorphisms

in the 3'-non-coding region have now been found, some of them between alleles encoding

the same PrP protein sequence.  These sequence variations are currently used to analyse the

expression of different ovine PrP alleles.<p>



<A NAME="6"><h2>PrP structure</h2></A>



The conversion of the normal form of the prion protein (PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP>) to its protease-resistant

isoform (PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP>) is a key process in the development of scrapie and related prion disease.

PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> is enriched in preparations of infectious particles and, either by itself or in association

with other molecules, is regarded by many as the infectious agent.  The structure of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP>

(and infectivity) is resistant to heat and chemicals which destroy most other micro-organisms

and this stability has been considered as a critical factor in the transmission of scrapie from

sheep to cattle in the early 1980s which initiated the epidemic of BSE.<p>



Recently, in collaboration with Dr B Caughey and colleagues at the NIH Rocky Mountain

Laboratory, Montana, the conversion of bovine PrP (PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP>) to a protease-resistant isoform has

been achieved <i>in vitro</i> using bovine PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> as a catalyst.  The parts of the protein molecule

needed for this conversion and for the replication and inter-species transmission of disease

are under investigation at the IAH and elsewhere, using recombinant DNA methods to

produce native and mutant prion proteins in cells and transgenic mice.  While this work aims

to delineate regions of the PrP molecule important for these processes, it will be difficult to

interpret in terms of mechanism because the secondary and tertiary structure of the PrP

protein and the effect of various mutations and deletions on this structure are unknown.<p>



Parallel work on the natural forms of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP> and PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> has been hindered by the lack of protein

and its aggregated, highly-insoluble nature, but some recent studies have provided clues to

their structures.  In other laboratories, spectral changes monitored by circular dichroism or

fluorescence during the thermal or chemical (irreversible) denaturation of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>27-30</FONT></SUP> (an active

fragment of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP>) indicate a more complex 'melt' of this fibrillar form of the protein, 

possibly involving a transition state with similar properties to a 'molten globule.'  Circular dichroism (CD),

Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy (FT-IR) and fluorescence

measurements on PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP> and PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> give estimates of a high alpha-helix secondary structure in

PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP>, less in PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> and least in

PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>27-30</FONT></SUP>.  These spectroscopic data and computer simulations

of the secondary and tertiary structure of PrP have led Dr F Cohen and his colleagues in San

Francisco to propose a four-helix bundle model of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP> and a mechanism involving the

switch of one or more of these helices to beta-sheet structure when this normal isoform

changes to its protease-resistant forms (PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> and

PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>27-30</FONT></SUP>).<p>



The thermodynamic stabilities and folding mechanisms of proteins have been extensively

studied in recent years by using genetic engineering techniques to manipulate the co-valent

structures of polypeptide chains.  By comparing proteins that differ by only one or a few

amino-acid residues produced by mutation of genes <i>in vitro</i>, the roles of individual residues

and interactions in folding and stability can be tested.  To complement studies on the natural

forms of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP> and PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> and

on the Institute's transgenic programme of research on the

biological aspects of PrP in the spongiform encephalopathies, a programme has been initiated

to investigate the structure, stability and folding of the wild-type and mutant,  recPrP

proteins.  Milligram quantities of recPrP are being produced and purified.   During the year,

a new group has been formed and appropriate analytical equipment installed (circular

dichroism spectropolarimeter, fluorimeter, electro-spray mass spectrometer, laser light

scattering instrument, plasmon resonance spectroscopy and a crystallisation oven) to exploit

this material fully.<p>



<A NAME="7"><h2>Cytotoxicity of PrP</h2></A>



The abnormal form of the prion protein (PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP>), a synthetic prion protein peptide fragment

(PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>106-126</FONT></SUP>) and fragments of the Alzheimer's protein precursor (APP) have been shown to be

cytotoxic <i>in vitro</i>.  Synchronous, clonal cell models, originally developed to study the

toxicity of the Alzheimer's disease amyloid peptide, A25-35, have been used to investigate

the actions of PrP peptides.  The cytotoxicity of the PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>106-126</FONT></SUP> was found to depend on its

state of aggregation and the cellular expression of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>c</FONT></SUP>, and was independent of a loss of

MTT reduction activity in the absence of cell death associated with the cellular effects of

A25-35.  These factors may play a role in the lesion-specificity of different pathological

phenotypes of prion-protein.<p>



<A NAME="8"><h2>Recombinant PrP</h2></A>



Recombinant murine PrP protein expressed from mammalian cells is being used for

structure/function studies.  In addition to truncated aglycosyl Prp protein, material is also

being purified from a cell line that stably secretes truncated glycosylated PrP.  Studies on

improved stability and purification are progressing well. <p>



<A NAME="9"><h2>Crystalline PrP</h2></A>



Good quality crystals of recPrP protein are the key to the high resolution X-ray diffraction

analysis of the tertiary structure of the protein.  Empirical screening of crystallisation

conditions continue.<p>



The protein is soluble in the presence of significant quantities of non-polar water-miscible

solvents in keeping with its hydrophobic properties deduced from previous detergent solubilisation studies.<p>



Further progress will be assisted by recent improvements in purification procedures.<p>



<A NAME="10"><h2>Replication of PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP></h2></A>



The work has focused on a variety of extensive studies principally aimed at the unequivocal

demonstration that rat PC12 cells can efficiently take up and replicate mouse-passaged scrapie

agent.  The growth and nerve growth factor-mediated neuronal differentiation of scrapie-proficient

cells obtained from Dr R Rubenstein (USA) were optimised. This included the six-week maintenance

of attached neuronal cells for the reported duration of maximal

accumulation of the scrapie-specific isoform of PrP protein (PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP>).  Various methods used

for the preparation and application of the scrapie-infected mouse brain homogenate were tried

but no <i>de novo</i> rat PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> could be detected despite the unequivocal detection of mouse PrPSc

in the inoculum.  Polyclonal antisera raised in mice to recombinant rat PrP protein purified

from an <i>E coli</i> expression system was produced but has yet to be evaluated.<p>



<A NAME="11"><h2>A basis for prophylaxis</h2></A>



Plasmon resonance studies have been used to investigate the hypothesis that a range

of anti-scrapie prophylactic compounds act by interacting with a specific region on the PrP protein.<p>



A synthetic peptide to this region has been shown to bind to one of these compounds under

physiological buffer conditions.  Another peptide of identical amino acid composition but of

differing primary sequence does not bind.  Chemically similar but non-prophylactic

compounds also failed to bind to the PrP peptide.<p>



<A NAME="12"><h2>Markers for susceptibility in sheep</h2></A>



PrP genotypes of sheep affected with natural scrapie and those of healthy flock mates are

being compared.  Differences have been noted between outbreaks and between flocks.  This

may be due to differences in the strain of natural scrapie affecting the flock or may reflect

breed differences in the sheep themselves.<p>



The most important variants of the PrP gene are those differing at codon 136 and 171. 

Valine at codon 136(V<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>) has a dominant association with incidence of scrapie but is not

found in all breeds of sheep.  Glutamine at codon 171 (Q<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB>) has a recessive association with

scrapie and has been found in all breeds of sheep examined so far.  <p>



The NPU Cheviot flock had 45 deaths from natural scrapie between 1986 and 1995.  Of

these cases 39 were analysed for disease-linked PrP gene polymorphisms and all encode V<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>

on at least one allele with 79% homozygous (VV<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>) and 21% valine/alanine heterozygotes

(VA<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>).  Mean survival time was 888 and 1482 days for VV<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB> and VA<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB> animals

respectively.  VV<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB> animals were all at great risk of disease if allowed to live long enough. 

However, scrapie occurred only in a specific subgroup of VA<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB> sheep, survival advantage

depending on VA<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB> animals being heterozygous for other polymorphisms at codon 154 or

171.<p>



The flock history has been recorded in great detail since its foundation in 1960.

However there was no strong evidence for simple maternal or paternal transmission of disease other

than inheritance of PrP genotype.<p>



In a Suffolk flock with scrapie, cases occurred in animals according to their PrP genotype

at codon 171.  QQ<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB> sheep were at great risk of scrapie whereas those which were

arginine/glutamine heterozygotes (RQ) were at less risk and RR<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB> animals appeared to be

resistant.  A histidine codon (H<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB>) can also be found at this position in Suffolk sheep but this

did not occur in scrapie-affected animals.<p>



<A NAME="13"><h2>An ante-mortem test </h2></A>



Antibody reagents to ruminant PrP have been produced in chicken eggs using recombinant

PrP as the immunogen.  Such anti-PrP antibodies require extensive purification before use. 

Ion exchange-purified antibody treated with pepsin to create Fab' fragments have high

specificity and sensitivity to PrP in ruminant brain and spleen homogenates.  Affinity-purified

antibody shows similar or enhanced properties.  Monoclonal antibodies which recognise

species-specific epitopes have also been produced.<p>



Extraction of ruminant tissue with the detergent Sarkosyl plus differential digestion with

proteinase K followed by immunoblotting provides an assay for PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP>.  The purified chicken

antibody reagents are sufficiently sensitive and specific to detect PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> in ruminant brain and

spleen.  However, PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> cannot be unequivocally detected in lymph node extracts with the

current technology.  PrP<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>Sc</FONT></SUP> has been detected in brains and spleens from all natural scrapie

cases examined so far but not in controls.<p>



<A NAME="14"><h2>Natural modes of transmission</h2></A>



The incidence of natural scrapie in the NPU's flock of Cheviots is linked to PrP genotype.

The flock is maintained as two breeding lines, one (susceptible: 'positive') which has

endemic natural scrapie and the other (resistant: 'negative') which is entirely free from

clinical manifestation of the disease.<p>



The positive line is being bred to carry specific PrP genes which are linked to susceptibility

to experimental inoculation but resistant to the natural disease (VA<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>/RQ<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB>), thereby

controlling its incidence by manipulating genetic frequency.  The negative line is being bred

for different PrP genes (AA<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>/RR<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB>, RQ<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB>, QQ<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB>) which also never allow natural scrapie

to develop and in which transmission experiments can be achieved without compromise.  A

further line, completely segregated from the first two, is being bred to generate an high

incidence of natural scrapie, by increasing the frequency of susceptible PrP genes (VV<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>,

VA<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>136</FONT></SUB>/QQ<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>171</FONT></SUB>) so that studies on the pathogenesis of natural scrapie can continue.<p>



Recovery of CNS, lymphoreticular and placental tissues from sheep of different PrP

genotypes for immunolabelling by histology and western blotting of the PrP protein is

continuing.<p>



Work continues on the transmission to mice from sheep tissues of inoculated and

uninoculated animals to establish whether a carrier state of infection exists and to characterise

natural isolates of scrapie from the Skedsbush flock.<p>



<A NAME="15"><h2>Transmission of BSE to sheep and goats</h2></A>



This study is nearing completion with three sheep surviving from oral challenge with BSE,

and three goats and two sheep surviving oral challenge with an isolate of natural scrapie.<p>



The results have shown that sheep (from both negative and positive lines--<i>see</i> previous

report) and goats are susceptible to infection by intracerebral inoculation and by oral dosing

with homogenates of cow brain known to be carrying the BSE agent. <p>



Comparative transmission results between BSE and a natural isolate of scrapie do not support

significant differences in incubation data.  It is apparent from transmission studies in mice

that when BSE is passaged in sheep, the strain characteristics do not differ much from those

of primary BSE.<p>



<A NAME="16"><h2>Rendering methods</h2></A>



It has been suggested that meat-and-bone meal became the dietary vehicle for BSE in cattle

because of the large-scale abandonment of organic solvent extraction of greaves in the late

1970s.  It is postulated that the application of hot solvent to the already heat-treated greaves,

and the subsequent evaporation process utilising dry heat and steam, had traditionally

suppressed the titre of infectivity in meat-and-bone meal to a sufficient extent that it was not

an effective oral dose for cattle.  There were two objections to the hypothesis:<p>



<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>The scrapie agent is known to be little affected by organic solvents generally
although the efficacy of those specifically used by the rendering industry, <i>ie</i>
hexane, benzene, petroleum and perchlorethylene, had not been tested
previously.<p>

<LI>The temperature of 100<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C used to evaporate the solvents is unlikely to have
much effect.<p>
</UL>

Nevertheless there was sufficient concern to encourage a project designed to determine

whether exposure to the relevant hot solvents and/or heat during the evaporation process has

any significant inactivating effect.<p>



The starting material was pooled mouse spleen infected with either the 301V strain of BSE

agent or the 22A strain of scrapie agent.  The experiments are still in progress but in the

study using hexane with 301V there appears to be little inactivation by the solvent extraction

or the evaporation processes, either individually or in combination.<p>



<A NAME="17"><h2>Rendering under commercial conditions</h2></A>



Facsimiles of the rendering processes used within the EU were conducted in commercial

pilot-scale rendering equipment using raw materials spiked with either BSE or scrapie agent.

BSE infectivity survived in meat and bone meal produced by four of these procedures, and

these have now been modified or outlawed by the EU.  The scrapie-spiked study is still in

progress but it can already be seen that meat and bone meal produced by all processes,

except those involving steam under pressure, have produced infected meat and bone meal. 

<p>



<A NAME="18"><h2>Chemical and physical inactivation</h2></A>



It is well known that scrapie agent is relatively resistant to inactivation by conventional

microbiological decontamination procedures.  The purpose of this project is to determine 

whether the same is true for BSE agent, and to re-assess the status of some existing

procedures with regard to scrapie agent because of doubts about existing data.  To date, the

following have been established:<p>



<UL TYPE=DISC>
<LI>BSE agent survives exposure to formol saline.<p>

<LI>BSE agent is inactivated within 30 minutes by concentrations of sodium
hypochlorite that are known to be effective with scrapie agent.  Thus the
recommendation that applies to the inactivation of scrapie agent, <i>ie</i> exposure
to a solution containing 20,000ppm available chlorine for 1 hour, is applicable
to BSE agent.<p>

<LI>Solutions of sodium dichloroisocyanurate, containing the same levels of
available chlorine that were present in the effective sodium hypochlorite
solutions, are not effective with BSE agent.<p>

<LI>Exposure to 2M sodium hydroxide for 2 hours does not inactivate scrapie
agent but is effective against BSE agent, although it survived a 1 hour
exposure.  These data contradict those in the study which was the basis of the
American recommendation that a 1 hour exposure to 1M sodium hydroxide
can be regarded as completely effective.  However, the bioassays in this
present study were more sensitive than those in the American study.<p>

<LI>BSE and scrapie agents have survived porous-load autoclaving at 134-138<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C
for &#62;=18 minutes when exposed as 341-mg (average) macerates of infected
brain.  These data challenge the current UK standard for porous-load
autoclave decontamination of scrapie-like agents which is a cycle of 18
minutes at 134-138<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C.  The scrapie inactivation data upon which the current
recommendation is based were derived from experiments where 50-mg
macerates of infected brain were used.  The present data probably result from
the use of larger tissue samples but animal and human health authorities have
been unable to advise as to what the maximum weight of tissue is that might
be encountered in practice.<p>

<LI>BSE agent has been inactivated by a 30-minute exposure to gravity-displacement
autoclaving at 132<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C but the effect of a 1 hour exposure (a
procedure recommended currently in America for inactivation of scrapie-like
agents) is not yet known.  This experiment is still in progress.<p>

<LI>After mouse brain fixed in PLP has been exposed to concentrated formic acid
for an hour, an estimated 10<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>3.2</FONT></SUP> ID<SUB><FONT SIZE=-2>50</FONT></SUB>/g survive.

This is two logs greater than
that recorded for formol-fixed scrapie-infected brain.  Further experiments are
in progress to determine whether this is a property of 301V or is an effect of
the fixative.  The effect of formic acid treatment on PLP-fixed tissue is also
being assessed using BSE-infected cow brain and mouse brain infected with
either the 87V or ME7 strains of scrapie agent.<p>

<LI>Microwave irradiation does not inactivate scrapie agent.  However, an
interesting observation was that the difference in incubation periods between
IM and VM mice injected with irradiated inoculum was exaggerated compared
with recipients of infectious boiled inoculum.<p>

<LI>Mouse brain infected with the 22A strain of scrapie agent which was
immersed in ethanol for 48 hours remained infectious after porous-load
autoclaving at 136<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C for 18 minutes.  The same brain material immersed
in saline for 48 hours was inactivated by the autoclaving process.<p>
</UL>



<A NAME="19"><h2>Review of autoclave protocols</h2></A>



In 1984 the DoH recommended a porous-load autoclaving cycle of 134-138<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C for 18 minutes

for decontamination of CJD agent.  This was based upon studies using 50-mg macerates of

mouse brain infected with two mouse-passaged strains of scrapie agent (22A and 139A); both

strains had been inactivated by exposure to 136<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C for 4 minutes.<p>



In early experiments carried out at the IAH, BSE and scrapie agents were found to survive

partially when infected 341-mg brain macerates were exposed to 134-138<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C for &#62;=18

minutes.  This present study is designed to determine the effect of 50-mg compared with

375-mg sample weights when subjected to cycles at 134<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C, 136<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C and 138<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>o</FONT></SUP>C for 9, 18, 30 or 60

minutes using the 301V strain of BSE agent, and the 22A and 263K strains of scrapie agent. 

A further aim was to expose the three agents at comparable titre to an autoclaving regime

that is known to permit partial survival of 22A, in order to determine the ranking of

thermostability for the three agents used.<p>



The experiment is still in progress and it is too early to draw any conclusions.  However,

it is evident that 263K and 301V are surviving autoclaving cycles that fall within the scope

of the UK recommendations.  As anticipated, the larger tissue samples appear to be more

difficult to inactivate than the smaller ones.<p>

<H2>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and public health.</H2>







Concerning the article in the J. Public Health Medicine.  Volume

17 number 3, 1995, pages 261-268<P>







<UL><LI><B>W. J. Patterson </B> (Consultant in Public Health

Medicine)







<LI><B>S. Dealler</B> (formerly Senior Registrar at York

District Hospital.  now: 01282 474292)</UL>







<P>Summary:<BR> 







Symptomatic cases of BSE in British cattle now total more than

146,000.  As BSE is one of a group of transmissible and fatal

spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) affecting both animals and

humans this has raised concern regarding possible risks to human

health.  The infective agent in TSEs, thought to be a prion has

not been clearly described.  There are no early diagnostic

tests, incubation periods are prolonged (possibly up to 30 years

in humans) and the pathological process which leads to a rapidly

progressive and fatal encephalopathy has yet to be explained.  



  <P>It is not yet known if the BSE agent can cross the human

species barrier to infect humans.  It has now been transmitted

to 18 species and to 16 of these (possibly 17 if pigs are

included) by mouth.  



  <P>Given the importance of beef in the human diet, it is

essential that control measures to protect health are rigorous,

comprehensive and objective.  In this respect there are four

factors which are important in assessing risks.  These are the

likely magnitude of  the species barrier between cattle and

humans, the dose (single or cumulative) that are needed to

transmit the disease, the method of exposure (oral or

subcutaneous) and the likely period before symptomatic disease

appears.  



  <P>To assist knowledge and understanding in these areas we

recommend the wider involvement of public health professionals

in the existing nationally co-ordinated multi-agency research

programme.  We also recommend further studies into the oral

transmissibility of the BSE agent to primates, an acceleration

of the search for diagnostic tools and treatments for

established prion infection and enhanced surveillance of

neurological disease in humans. 







<P>It is now clear that probably a large percentage of the

population will have been exposed to BSE in the UK.



<P>Humans will have eaten 1,800,000 infected cattle by 2001 and

will have eaten tissues that have been shown to be infective in

other species, but inadequately tested in cattle.



Humans have already taken risks in eating bovine products that

have now been banned.  The recurrent banning of foods or

procedures by MAFF will not help the people that have been

exposed before the ban.  It is possible that further action such

as this by MAFF will seriously damage the public's respect for

its action.<BR>







<P>The article's most important part is to show that the World

Health Organisation's publicised opinions on how to decide

whether or not the exposure of a human to a specific amount of

an infective agent could not have been carried out as inadequate

information was available with which to decide the action.  As a

result of this it was important that Government action should

assume a tolerable level for human exposure to BSE to be very

low indeed, possibly 10,000 times less then the amount felt

acceptable by MAFF. 



Concerning the article in the British Food Journal 1995, volume

97, 3-18.







<P>Review:<BR>







<P>The most important aspect of the article seems to be the WHO

directives as to how to decide what levels of an agent should be

considered non-toxic to humans.  Clearly a wide error margin is

given by the WHO but still this would suggest the risk that is

being taken with BSE as being unacceptable in public health

terms.</P>















<H2>BSE: an update on the statistical evidence.</H2>

<P>The article explains that, as a fatal disease, with no method

of treatment, inadequate methods of diagnosis and no method of

prevention in any animal afer infection has taken place, this

subject should be studied closely.   Infectivity is presumed, if

like in other TSEs, to be present in many tissues and to not be

destroyed by cooking.  One of the major problems is in trying to

calculate the number of infected animals that are being eaten

and at what point in their incubation period this takes place. 

It seems that there is adequate data now available from MAFF for

this to found.  The major findings of the article are: 







<P>Cases of BSE are becoming severely under-reported.  For

instance only 40% of clinical cases of BSE reached UK Government

statistics in 1993.







<P>BSE may continue in the UK for many years, with cases born

each year, showing symptoms 3 to 8 years later.







<P>BSE may not be derived from the disease of sheep, scrapie and

if it is, we cannot rely on it to carry the same properties as

that disease.  The UK Government used the idea that BSE was

scrapie originally to suggest that BSE would not infect humans

although this was invalid at the time.







<P>1,800,000 cattle incubating BSE will have been eaten before

2001 even if no cases are born after 1991.  This figure assumes

that all cattle with BSE were always reported by farmers to

veterinary officers, that the VOs always accepted them, and that

histological diagnosis was always correct (up to 1991).  It is

therefore likely to be an underestimate of the true BSE

incidence.  Many of the younger cattle incubating BSE would have

been exported to Europe.







<P>The epidemiology of BSE in the UK is that of an infection

passed down from the mother to the offspring but where the

mother would show symptoms later in life.  It may be that BSE

cases that we see are derived from infections in their mother

and it was the mother that ate infected food. If this is true

then the total number of infeced cattle eaten in the UK will be

around 8,000,000 by 2001.







<P>UK Government advisors have suggested that there is little

risk from eating liver, kidneys, nerves and muscle from infected

cattle.  The article shows that this cannot be true if these

tissues contain the same amount of infectivity as is found in

other species with a similar disease.  







<P>The acceptable levels (UK Government) of infectivity to found

in food may be 10,000 times the amount that could be seen as

acceptable under WHO directives used for other potentially fatal

diseases.







<P>UK Governernment  Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens

reported in October 1994 showing that cattle that may be

infected should be treated as if they are infective.  They say

that some tissues should not be even touched (e.g. liver) that

the UK Government continues to tell its population as being

acceptable to eat.







<P>The risk to humans in Europe from BSE is unacceptably high

but cannot be stated precisely at this time.  The article states

again that the cumulative amounts of BSE in our diet in the UK

is expected to be between 10,000 times and 100,000 times the

amounts of scrapie that we would be eating.







<P>No directions are given as to whether bovine tissue in the UK

should be considered toxic.











<H2>Proposed link between transmissible spongiform

encephalopathies of man and animals.</H2>







Lancet November 4 1995, 1208-1209







<UL><LI><B>Heino Diringer</B>



Robert-Koch Institute, Nordufer 20, D-13353, Berlin, Gemany 030

4547 2214</UL>







<P>It is suggested that scrapie is the source of all TSEs in

animals and man but that, by passing from one species to another

the agent is either selected or changed in such a way as to

alter the range or type of disease that it might produce in a

further animal species.  







<P>For instance it is suggested that scrapie does indeed cause

the endemic types of CJD that seem to be present in some parts

of the world (e.g. Slovakia) and partly associated with PrP gene

aberrations.  However, when scrapie is transmitted to cattle, it

then becomes more infective to humans and is involved in the

production of sporadic CJD in many parts of the world.  







<P>The cases of GSS that are not fully penetrant may be because

the genes are correct but the agent (scrapie) is still required.

In cases of fully penetrant GSS perhaps the agent also remains

with the infected person. 







<P>Review:







<P>The argument is fairly reasonable in that it will be very

difficult to find groups that have not been exposed to meat at

all, even though they think they have not.  It will also take a

long time to be able to carry out statistical research to say if

beef is involved in sporadic CJD or not (because the controls

will also eat a lot of beef and the difference between the

groups will be small).  Diringer recommends research as the way

to find out what is going on but the current PrP research

avalanche may only be of some use if animal inoculation studies

are carried out similarly.

 <H3>Clinical Description</H2> <B> On 21 March 1996
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dr R G Will, of the National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Unit, wrote
the following letter to neurologists:</B> <P>

In the past few weeks we believe we may have identified a new
clinico-pathological phenotype of CJD which may be unique to the United Kingdom.
This raises the possibility of a causative link between BSE and CJD. These cases
have been very difficult to diagnose clinically because the clinical phenotype is
largely distinct from that previously seen in CJD. <P>

<dl><dt>It is essential that we identify these cases through the surveillance
system and the clinical and pathological features are:- <P>

<dd>An early age of onset or death (average 27.6, range 18-41) <P>

<dd>A prolonged duration of illness (average 13.1 months, range 7.5 - 24) <P>

<dd>A predominantly psychiatric presentation including anxiety, depression
withdrawal and behavioural change which 			progresses. Nearly all these
patients were referred to a 			psychiatrist early in the clinical
course.<BR> The first evidence of neurological involvement in 4 patients was
dysaestheesiae in the limbs and/or face. <P>

After a period of weeks or months the development of a 			cerebellar
syndrome with gait and limb ataxia.

<P> Forgetfulness and memory disturbance develop, often late in the clinical
course but progress with the development of 		sever cognitive impairment
and a state of akinetic mutism 		in the majority of cases.

<P> Myoclonus develops in the majority of patients and in some 		is
preceded by choreiform movements, but typical EEG 			appearances of CJD
are absent.

<P> <dd>Neuropathologically there is spongiform change, neuronal loss and
	astrocytic gliosis most evident in the basal ganglia and thalamus. 	The
most striking and consistent neuropathological feature is 		amyloid plaque
formation extensively distributed throughout the 	cerebrum and cerebellum.
</dl> It is essential that we prospectively identify any cases that fit this
clinico-pathological profile and it is also crucial to determine whether any such
case has occurred in the past. <P>

COULD YOU PLEASE NOTIFY THE CJD SURVEILLANCE UNIT OF ANY SUCH CASE WITH THIS
CLINICAL OR NEUROPATHOLOGICAL PROFILE, WHETHER OR NOT THE PRESENTATION IS IN THE
YOUNGER AGE GROUP. COULD YOU ALSO CHECK YOUR RECORDS AND NOTIFY ANY SIMILAR CASES
THAT MAY IN RETROSPECT FIT WITH THIS CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL PROFILE. <P>

Four of the recently identified cases were confirmed by brain biopsy. If you are
considering brain biopsy in any suspect cases of CJD it is essential to follow
the Department of Health guidelines which state that neurosurgical instruments
used on any case of CJD must be destroyed and not reused. <P>

The identification of a form of CJD that might be  causally linked to BSE will
result in widespread anxiety and concern. It is unlikely that there will be an
increase in neurological referrals, particularly as the early symptoms are
relatively non-specific. From a neurological perspective the early identification
of this potentially new form of CJD may depend on a history of evolving
psychiatric disturbance followed by clear evidence of cerebellar syndrome ±
memory disturbance. <P>

It is likely that neurologists will receive numerous requests for information and
advice. The DoH has a recorded information message for members of the general
public (Tel: 0800 344355) and can also provide information (Tel: 0171 972 5057).
<P>

I am most grateful for your cooperation with the CJD Surveillance System in the
past and I would be grateful if you could continue to notify the Surveillance
Unit of any suspect case of CJD. <P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Genetic defect triggers onset of the illness after age 30. It has no cure.  </I></CENTER><P>
Deseret News Archives,<BR>
Thursday, August 3, 1995  <P>
    At first, doctors thought the 41-year-old high school music director had multiple sclerosis because of his episodes of numbness, weakness and blurred vision
   But treatment did not help, and within a year he got worse: He needed a cane to walk, and he had plunged into depression. He was forgetful at school and had trouble concentrating, and he asked where his grandmother was even though she had been dead for 15 years.
   He also had trouble sleeping at night. And in the end, that was the key.<P>

   Genetic testing showed that the man had an extraordinarily rare, inherited disease that causes what one scientist calls ``industrial-strength'' insomnia for months or even a year before the patient dies.
   The music director died 15 months after his first symptoms appeared. Although he had not known of any prior cases in his family, researchers found he was distantly related to a previously reported family with the disease.<P>

   Now scientists report that by injecting brain tissue from the man into mice, they were able to transmit the disease to the animals. That confirms the idea that the disease, called fatal familial insomnia, belongs to a small group of neurological disorders caused by an abnormal protein called a prion.<P>

   Fewer than 10 families in the world are known to have the lethal inherited insomnia, said Dr. Paul Brown of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Md. A defect in a certain gene produces the disease after age 30.<P>
   In contrast to the case of the music director, insomnia is usually a prominent feature early in the disease, said Dr. Raymond Roos of the University of Chicago Medical Center, who with Brown and others reported the mouse experiment in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature.<P>

   ``It's a heavy-duty industrial-strength insomnia,'' Brown said. ``It's a lot worse than having trouble sleeping.''
   Because the insomnia makes them doze during the day, people with the disease often have trouble concentrating on the job and may get into traffic accidents, Roos said.
   The disease also brings episodes of fever, racing pulses, impotence, blood pressure fluctuations and unexplained sweating. Other problems can include unsteady gait, jerking in the arms or legs, depression and loss of mental powers.<P>

 Roos said he suspects patients might be able to live longer if their insomnia can be treated, noting that animal studies suggest that prolonged sleeplessness itself can be lethal.
   Scientists had prior indications that the inherited fatal insomnia was among the half-dozen human brain diseases caused by the prion protein. Such diseases can be inherited or can be transmitted by an unusual contamination, such as by tissue transplants.<P>

   The best known of these conditions is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which strikes about one in 1 million people in Western countries each year. It killed the choreographer George Balanchine, and some cases have been caused by injections of human growth hormone derived from cadaver pituitary glands. Doctors now use synthetic growth hormone instead.

Zurich, Switzerland.<P>


Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are neurodegenerative
diseases which affect many mammalian species including man, sheep and
cattle. The human forms of the disease have been classified into three
categories: familial, acquired or iatrogenic, and sporadic. Familial forms
are transmitted in an autosomal-dominant fashion, while acquired cases are
attributed to transplantation of tissues or administration of products
derived from individuals suffering from (unrecognized) TSE. Sporadic TSEs
are evenly distributed worldwide, and no exogenous or endogenous causes have
been identified. TSEs are readily transmissible to members of the same
species and in many instances cross-species transmission has been achieved,
albeit mostly with low efficiency. <P>

The nature of the agent responsible for TSEs, the so-called prion, has been
the subject of impassioned controversies. The prion is able to survive
conventional and even extraordinary desinfection procedures and appears to
be devoid of nucleic acids (1). The hypothesis that it is a modified,
pathogenic form of a normal host protein and that it multiplies by
converting the normal form into a likeness of itself has gained wide
acceptance since it was first proposed by Griffith (2) and cast into precise
molecular terms by Prusiner (3). The normal host protein, PrPC, which occurs
predominantly at the outer cell surface of neurons and glia, and its
modified form, PrPSc, are both encoded by the same singular gene (4,5) and
are believed to be conformational isomers (6).<P>
 The so-called "protein only"
hypothesis (7) is supported by much biochemical and genetic evidence and its
popularity surged when it became apparent that all known hereditary forms of
human prion diseases are tightly linked to one of a variety of mutations
within the open reading frame of PRNP, the gene encoding PrP (8,9) (Fig. 1),
and when it was shown that knockout mice lacking PrP are resistant to
mouse-adapted scrapie and do not propagate infectivity (10,11). <P>

The best-known form of human disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD),
mostly starts with rapidly progressing dementia and usually leads to death
in less than one year. Gerstmann-Str‰ussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS) is a
hereditary condition with slightly different histopathological features, but
with progressive cerebellar signs, followed by mental deterioration and
slower progression to death. Both diseases usually appear in the fourth to
sixth decade of life. Intraspecies transmissibility of prion diseases in man
is well-documented by the erstwhile occurrence of kuru, a CJD-like disease
which was transmitted by ritual cannibalism and reached epidemic proportions
in New Guinea (12), as well as by iatrogenic transmission of CJD to young
individuals by administration of pituitary hormones derived from cadaveric
glands, prior to the availability of recombinant hormones produced in E. coli. <P>

The broad spectrum of clinical and histopathological presentations in both
hereditary and sporadic prion diseases gave rise to speculations that other
"idiopathic" neurological disorders might be caused by prions. As a
consequence, screening for transmissibility and/or for PRNP mutations in
obscure neurodegenerative conditions became a respectable pastime for a
number of neuropathologists and led to the characterization of fatal
familial insomnia (FFI) as a prion disease, first by virtue of its linkage
to mutations in the PRNP gene (13) and now, as reported recently in Nature
and Lancet (14,15), by demonstration of its transmissibility to mice. <P>

FFI was first described by a research consortium including the neurology
research groups of Bologna and of Cleveland in a large North Italian
kindred, with as many as 29 affected individuals among 288 family members
over a period spanning six generations (16). The salient clinical trait is
the loss of the ability to sleep at ages varying between 40 and 60, along
with dream-like episodes.<P>
 This devastating disease, which is invariably
fatal within 6-18 months, progressively affects the autonomic and motor
systems. Positron emission tomography and histopathological examinations
revealed hypometabolism and selective neuronal loss, in many subjects
confined to the anterior ventral and mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus (9).<P>

The classical hallmarks of other prion diseases, such as spongy degeneration
of the cerebral cortex and deposition of PrP plaques, are not typical of FFI
(16). The subsequent identification of at least sixteen additional kindreds
in Italy, France, and the United States (P. Gambetti, pers. comm.) suggests
that FFI may be no rarer a disease than the more widely known GSS syndrome,
which occurs about once per 10 to the 8 individuals per year. <P>
The first breakthrough
in the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease came about
with the unequivocal demonstration that all cases of FFI co-segregate with
an Asp178ÆAsn178 mutation within the PRNP reading frame (13). Curiously, the
very same Asn178 mutation had also been described in some families
presenting with classical CJD (17). <P>
What then determines the remarkable
differences in the clinical and histopathological features of FFI and CJD?<P>

 An answer was suggested by Gambetti and colleagues (18). Codon 129 of the
PRNP gene is polymorphic and its distribution in the normal Caucasian
population is 37% for 129Met/Met, 51% for 129Met/Val, and 12% for
129Val/Val. The presence of one or the other amino acid in itself does not
predispose for prion diseases, however most cases of sporadic and iatrogenic
CJD are associated with homozygosity for one or the other amino acid (19).<P>

Amazingly, the combination of Val129 and Asn178 on one PRNP allele is
associated with familial CJD, but that of Met129 and Asn178 with FFI (18).
Moreover, the presence of a Met129 codon in the normal allele of FFI
patients is associated with a more severe clinical course of the disease (9). 
As mentioned above, transmission of prion disease between different species
is hampered by the species barrier; this has been attributed to differences
in the sequence of the incoming PrpSc and that of the recipient's PrPC which
would impede the presumed interactions required for conversion (10).<P>
 In the
case of transmission from hamster to mouse, the barrier was overcome by
introduction of multiple hamster PrP transgenes into the mouse (10,20);
similarly, transmission of CJD and GSS to mice (21) occurs more readily when
the mice carry human PrP transgenes, particularly in the absence of
functional mouse PrP genes (22). Because FFI, while associated with PRNP
mutations, does not show histopathology typical for TSE's, it was of
particular interest to ascertain whether or not this disease was
transmissible. Using different mouse strains as recipients, this was
recently shown to be so for one case of FFI by the groups of Tateishi and
Gajdusek (14) and for two additional cases by Collinge and his colleagues
(15) . <B>This promotes FFI to full membership of the growing family of human
prion diseases. </B><P>

Some features of these reports merit further comment. The case transmitted
by Tateishi, although phenotypically indistinguishable from FFI, was
somewhat atypical in that the PRNP coding sequence had a deletion on the
same allele carrying the FFI mutation (23). While Tateishi et al.
transmitted FFI to wild-type mice, Collinge et al. utilized wild-type mice
transgenic for human PRNP. In both reports, 12-20 months after inoculation
mice developed rapidly progressive clinical  symptoms leading to death
within few days and typical TSE histopathology, incidentally without showing
evidence of sleeplesness. <P>
In neither paper, however, was the titer of prions
in the brains of the inoculated mice determined by further transmission
studies. Although Tateishi and his colleagues found heavy deposits of
pathological PrP in the brain of all FFI-inoculated mice (and, provokingly,
show a picture of prominent thalamic PrP deposition!), Collinge et al. (15)
were unable to demonstrate protease-resistant PrP in their terminally sick
FFI-inoculated mice; the sensitivity of the assay would have permitted the
detection of PrPSc at a level 300 times lower that that found in mice
inoculated with CJD agent. However, since the titer of infectious agent may
have been low, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the relationship of
infectious agent to protease-resistant PrP.<P>

We believe that the next interesting, albeit time-consuming steps will be to
confirm that the inoculated mice succumbed to prion disease by
characterizing the infectious agent in their brain as a heat-resistant
entity whose propagation depends on the presence of PrP in the host and to
determine the infectious titers and PrPSc levels in subsequent transmissions
to mice of different PrP transgenotypes, i.e. human or murine. <P>

While genetic and biochemical evidence strongly supports the role of the PrP
gene product as constituent of the infectious agent, it is still unclear
whether the prion is identical with the protease-resistant entity designated
as PrPSc or with some other form of PrP. The biochemical characterization of
the infectious agent is rendered difficult by the fact that the ratio of
infectious units to PrP molecules even in highly purified preparations is
1:105 (24). The fact that this ratio may vary considerably in various
tissues and as a function of time after inoculation (25), as well as recent
findings (D. Riesner, personal communication) showing that PrP resistant to
protease but devoid of infectivity can be generated in vitro, suggest that
not all forms of protease-resistant PrP are infectious. 
Moreover, the
findings that mice may succumb to what is believed to be prion disease in
the absence of detectable levels of PrPSc (15), the great variability in the
extent of PrP deposition in sporadic CJD (26) and in atypical dementias with
PRNP mutations (27), as well as the lack of scrapie pathology in Prn-p
knockout mice chronically exposed to a continuous source of PrPSc (28) raise
the question whether the presence of PrPSc in diseased brain is an
epiphenomenon rather than a cause of neuronal degeneration.   <P>

<H3><A NAME="Alzheimer">Alzheimer</A> Scientist Receives Laskert Award</H2>
 for the Discovery of Prion diseases that affect humans,
CJD and GSS syndrome </CENTER>

<DL>
<P>December 1994 -- Stanley B. Prusiner, M.D., a professor of neurology and biochemistry at the University
of California, San Francisco, received this year's Albert Lasker Basic Medical
Research Award for his discovery of a new class of disease-causing agents called
prions (pronounced pree-ons). The Lasker Award is the most prestigious medical
research prize awarded in the United States.

<P>Dr. Prusiner first received funding from Alzheimer's Diseases Research (ADR) for his
pioneering research on the prion in 1986. Since then, he has received nearly $850,000
from ADR to support his investigations on the prion theory.

<P>Much of our knowledge about neurodegeneration, the destruction of nerve cells in the
brain and elsewhere in the body, has come from studies of neurodegenerative diseases
in animals. Scrapie, a disease affecting sheep, posed a remarkable challenge to
scientists because despite clear evidence that the disease is infectious ( meaning it
can be transmitted by transplantation or ingestion of affected tissue), the infectious
agent was not a typical bacteria or virus. Two diseases that affect humans,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) and  syndrome (GSS),
cause neurodegeneration similar to that seen in scrapie, and are also infectious under
certain conditions.

<P>Over the past decade, evidence for a unique infectious agent as the cause of scrapie,
CJD, and GSS has accumulated. Studies of these diseases led to the hypothesis that
this type of neurodegenerative disease is caused by an agent which differs from other
infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses and parasites. In 1982, Dr. Prusiner
introduced, amid controversy in the scientific community, the term "prion" to
distinguish the protein particles that cause scrapie, CJD, and <A HREF="#gss">GSS</A> from viruses.

<P>ADR first supported Dr. Prusiner's studies of the structures and properties of prions,
and studies that led to the purification and identification of the prion protein in
scrapie- infected brains. With continued funding from ADR, Dr. Prusiner has gone on to
study the two human diseases, CJD and GSS. It is known that the prion protein is
present in normal cells and that the gene that codes for the production of the prion
protein is part of a normal human chromosome. In patients with CJD and GSS, <A href="#gss">the gene
for the prion protein contains a mutation</A> that apparently alters the function of the
protein, resulting in neurodegeneration, dementia, and finally death.

<P>Through his prion work, Dr. Prusiner has furthered understanding of the role protein
shape plays in directing biological processes. There are many similarities between the
loss of brain function in prion diseases and in Alzheimer's disease, and it is likely
that an understanding of how prion diseases begin and develop will add to our
understanding of what happens to the brain in Alzheimer's disease.

<h3>
Linkage of a Prion Protein Missense Variant to <A NAME="gss"></A>Gerstmann-Straussler Syndrome</h2></center>
K.  Hsiao,...S.B. Prusiner et al<BR>

<em> Nature </em>, 338(6213), 342--345 (1989 Mar 23)



Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome is a rare familial neurodegenerative
condition that is vertically transmitted, in an apparently autosomal
dominant way. It can also be horizontally transmitted to non-human
primates and rodents through intracerebral inoculation of brain
homogenates from patients with the disease. <P>

The exact incidence of
the syndrome is unknown but is estimated to be between one and ten
per hundred million. Patients initially suffer from ataxia or
dementia and deteriorate until they die, in one to ten years.
Protease-resistant prion protein (PrP) and PrP-immunoreactive
amyloid plaques with characteristic morphology accumulate in the
brains of these patients. Current diagnostic criteria for
Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome incorporate clinical and
neuropathological features, as animal transmission studies can be
unreliable.<P>

Prion protein is implicated in the pathogenesis and transmission
of the condition and in scrapie, an equivalent animal disease. It
was discovered by enriching scrapie-infected hamster brain fractions
for infectivity. Because there is compelling evidence that the
scrapie isoform of PrP is a necessary component of the infectious
particle, it seemed possible that the PrP gene on the short arm of
human chromosome 20 in Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome might be
abnormal. <P>

We show here that PrP codon 102 is linked to the putative
gene for the syndrome in two pedigrees, providing the best evidence
to date that this familial condition is inherited despite also being
infectious, and that substitution of leucine for proline at PrP
codon 102 may lead to the development of Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome.

<P>

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers designed to amplify the
octapeptide repeat region of the bovine prion gene were used to test the
association of genotypes with bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) in
56 BSE-affected and 177 unaffected animals. Three alleles (A,B,C) were
detected as single-strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs) and two
alleles (1,2--representing six or five copies of the octapeptide repeat
respectively) were detected as amplified double-strand fragment length
polymorphisms (AMFLPs). Observed genotypes of SSCPs and AMFLPs were
analysed by chi-square. The SSCP genotypes of nuclear family members of
animals with BSE and BSE-affected animals were different (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt;
0.01) from unrelated animals of the same breed without BSE. No
genotypic differences were found between the BSE-affected animals and
their relatives (P &gt; 0.469). No AMFLP genotypic differences were
detected between BSE-affected animals, their relatives, unrelated
animals of the same breed or animals of different breeds (P &gt; 0.05).
These data suggest that BSE-affected animals and their relatives are
more likely to have the AA SSCP genotype than unrelated animals of the
same breed or animals of different breeds.

The mammalian prion protein (PrPC) is a cellular protein of unknown
function, an altered isoform of which (PrPSc) is a component of the
infectious particle (prion) thought to be responsible for spongiform
encephalopathies in humans and animals. <P>
We report here the isolation of
a cDNA that encodes a chicken protein that is homologous to PrPC. This
chicken prion-like protein (ch-PrLP) is identical to the mouse PrP at
33% of its amino acid positions, including an uninterrupted stretch of
24 identical residues, and it displays the same structural domains. In
addition, ch-PrLP, like its mammalian counterpart, is attached to the
cell surface by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol anchor.<P>
We find that
ch-PrLP is the major protein in preparations of an acetylcholine
receptor-inducing activity that has been purified greater than
10(6)-fold from brain on the basis of its ability to stimulate synthesis
of nicotinic receptors by cultured myotubes. The ch-PrLP gene is
expressed in the spinal cord and brain as early as embryonic day 6; and
in the spinal cord, the protein appears to be concentrated in motor
neurons. <P>
Our results therefore raise the possibility that prion proteins
serve normally to regulate the chemoreceptor number at the
neuromuscular junction and perhaps in the central nervous system as well.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Fractions enriched for acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity from chicken brain were
found to contain a protein that was approximately 30% homologous with mammalian prion
proteins [Harris, D. A., Falls, D. L., Johnson, F. A. & Fischbach, G. D. (1991) Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 88, 7664-7668]. To extend these observations, we recovered genomic clones
encoding a putative chicken prion protein (PrP). Like mammalian PrP molecules, the
candidate chicken PrP is encoded by a single-copy gene and the entire open reading frame is
found within a single exon. All of the structural features of mammalian PrP were found in the
chicken protein. When the N-terminal repeats of PrP were not considered, the chicken and
mammalian proteins were approximately 55% homologous, allowing for conservative
substitutions. Screening of a chicken genomic DNA library failed to identify a more closely
related chicken PrP homologue. These findings argue that the protein which purifies with
acetylcholine receptor-inducing activity is chicken PrP.

ChPrP is the chicken homologue of PrPC, the cellular isoform of the mammalian prion
protein. We have used sequence-specific antibodies to immunoprecipitate and immunoblot
chPrP derived from stably transfected cultures of neuroblastoma cells, as well as from
chicken brain and cerebrospinal fluid. We have also used mass spectrometry to characterize
fragments of the protein purified from conditioned medium. The majority of chPrP protein
present in neuroblastoma cells and on isolated brain membranes can be released by incubation
with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, indicating that these molecules are
attached to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Surprisingly, <B>most of
the surface-anchored molecules are truncated at their N-terminus distal to the
proline/glycine-rich repeats.</B>
<P>
 The corresponding N-terminal fragments are found in medium
conditioned by neuroblastoma cells, as well as in cerebrospinal fluid and a postmicrosomal
supernatant of brain. One of these fragments extends from Lys25 to Phe116. 35-45-kDa
forms of chPrP that can be metabolically labeled with [3H]ethanolamine can also be found in
extracellular media. We propose that the chPrP molecule undergoes at least two cleavages as
part of its normal metabolism: one within the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor and one
within or just N-terminal to the central hydrophobic domain.<B> The second cleavage lies within
a region of 24 amino acids that is identical in chPrP and mammalian PrP</B>, and represents a
major processing event that may have physiological as well as pathological significance.

The cellular prion protein (PrPC) is a glycolipid-anchored protein that is involved in the
pathogenesis of fatal spongiform encephalopathies. We have shown previously that, in <B>contrast</B>
to several other glycolipid-anchored proteins, chPrP, <B>the chicken homologue of mammalian
PrPC, is endocytosed via clathrin-coated pits </B>in cultured neuroblastoma cells, as well as in
embryonic neurons and glia (Shyng, S.-L., Heuser, J. E., and Harris, D. A. (1994) J. Cell
Biol. 125, 1239-1250). 
<P>
In this study, we have determined that the N-terminal half of the
chPrP polypeptide chain is essential for its endocytosis. Deletions within this region reduce
the amount of chPrP internalized, as measured by surface iodination or biotinylation, and
decrease its concentration in clathrin-coated pits, as determined by quantitative electron
microscopic immunogold labeling. Mouse PrP, as well as two mouse PrP/chPrP chimeras, are
internalized as efficiently as chPrP, suggesting that conserved features of secondary and
tertiary structure are involved in interaction with the endocytic machinery. Our results
indicate that the ectodomain of a protein can contain endocytic targeting information, and they
strongly support a model in which the polypeptide chain of PrPC binds to the extracellular
domain of a transmembrane protein that contains a coated pit localization signal in its
cytoplasmic tail.

Using CD spectroscopy we have investigated the effect of Cu2+ on the secondary structure of
synthetic peptides Octa4 and Hexa4 corresponding to tetra-repeats of the octapeptide of
mammalian PrP and the hexapeptide of chicken PrP. In addition, fluorescence spectroscopy
was used to estimate the dissociation constants (Kd), of Cu2+ binding by both peptides. Both
peptides exhibited unusual CD spectra, complicated by the high proportion of aromatic

induced an increase in random coil to resemble Octa4. The fluorescence of both peptides was
quenched by Cu2+ and this was used to calculate Kd's of 6.7 microM for Octa4 and 4.5 microM
for Hexa4. Other divalent cations showed lesser effects on the fluorescence of the peptides.

Mammalian prion protein (PrP) is a normal cellular protein (PrPc) which through
post-translational modification produces the infectious prion protein (PrPsc). We have
shown, using mass spectrometry, that synthetic peptides containing three or four copies of an
octapeptide repeat sequence (PHGGGWGQ), found in a highly conserved N-terminal domain of
PrP, preferentially bind copper over other metals. Peptides from the analogous region of
chicken PrP, which contains an N-terminal repeat domain of the hexapeptide (NPGYPH),
showed similar specificity for copper binding. In addition, gel filtration chromatography
demonstrated concentration dependent binding of copper to the mammalian tetra repeat PrP
peptide. These results suggest that PrP may be a copper binding protein in vivo. </BLOCKQUOTE>

The 14-3-3 family of proteins plays a role in a wide variety of cellular functions including regulation of protein kinase C and exocytosis. Using antisera specific for the N termini of 14-3-3 isoforms described previously and an additional antiserum specific for the C terminus of epsilon isoform, protease digestion of intact 14-3-3 showed that the N-terminal half of 14-3-3 (a 16 kDa fragment) was an intact, dimeric domain of the protein. Two isoforms of 14-3-3, tau and epsilon, were expressed in E. coli and their secondary structure was shown by circular dichroism to be identical to wild-type protein, and expression of N-terminally-deleted epsilon 14-3-3 protein showed that the N-terminal 26 amino acids are important for dimerization. Intact 14-3-3 is a potent inhibitor of protein kinase C, but the N-terminal domain does not inhibit PKC activity. Site-specific mutagenesis of several regions in the tau isoform of 14-3-3, including the mutation of a putative pseudosubstrate site to a potential substrate sequence, did not alter its inhibitory activity. Intact 14-3-3 proteins are phosphorylated by protein kinase C with a low stoichiometry, but truncated isoforms are phosphorylated much more efficiently by this kinase. This may imply that the proteins may adopt a different structural conformation, possibly upon binding to the membrane, which could modulate their activity. 14-3-3 proteins are found at high concentration on synaptic plasma membranes and this binding is mediated through the N-terminal 12 kDa of 14-3-3.

14-3-3 proteins have recently been implicated in the regulation of intracellular signaling pathways via their interaction with several oncogene and protooncogene products. We found recently that 14-3-3 associates with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) in T cells. We report here the identification of the 120-kDa 14-3-3tau-binding phosphoprotein present in activated T cell lysates as Cbl, a protooncogene product of unknown function which was found recently to be a major protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) substrate, and to interact with several signaling molecules including PI3-K, in T lymphocytes. The association between 14-3-3tau and Cbl was detected both in vitro and in intact T cells and, in contrast to Raf-1, was markedly increased following T cell activation. The use of truncated 14-3-3tau fusion proteins demonstrated that the 15 C-terminal residues are required for the association between 14-3-3 and three of its target proteins, namely, Cbl, Raf-1, and PI3-K. The findings that 14-3-3tau binds both PI3-K and Cbl, together with recent reports of an association between Cbl and PI3-K, suggest that 14-3-3 dimers play a critical role in signal transduction processes by promoting and coordinating protein-protein interactions of signaling proteins.

<h3>Association of a 14-3-3 protein with CMP-NeuAc:GM1 <A NAME="alpha">alpha</A> 2,3-sialyltransferase</h3>

CMP-NeuAc:GM1 alpha 2,3-sialyltransferase (ST-IV) was purified to homogeneity from rat brain. Microsequencing of the tryptic peptides derived from the purified enzyme revealed two amino acid sequences homologous to the 14-3-3 proteins. A polyclonal antibody was raised against purified ST-IV. A 33 kDa protein was co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain extracts with the anti-(ST-IV) antibody as detected by Western blot analysis. This protein was identified as a subtype of 14-3-3 family by an anti-(14-3-3) antibody. Screening of a rat brain lambda gt11 library using the anti-(ST-IV) antibody resulted in the identification of a cDNA clone coding for the subtype of 14-3-3 protein. These results indicate an association of the 14-3-3 protein with the sialyltransferase. Since the 14-3-3 protein has PKC inhibitor activities and the activity of sialyltransferases is, at least in part, regulated by PKC, the association of the 14-3-3 protein with ST-IV may indicate a role for this protein in the post-translational regulation of the sialyltransferase activity through the processes of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.

<h3><A NAME="Subcellular">Subcellular</A> localisation of 14-3-3 isoforms in rat brain using specific antibodies</h3>

The 14-3-3 protein family, which is present at particularly high concentrations in mammalian brain, is known to be involved in various cellular functions, including protein kinase C regulation and exocytosis. Despite the fact that most of the 14-3-3 proteins are cytosolic, a small but significant proportion of 14-3-3 in brain is tightly and selectively associated with some membranes. Using a panel of isoform-specific antisera we find that the epsilon, eta, gamma, beta, and zeta isoforms are all present in purified synaptic membranes but absent from mitochondrial and myelin membranes. In addition, the eta, epsilon, and gamma isoforms but not the beta and zeta isoforms are associated with isolated synaptic junctions. When different populations of synaptosomes were fractionated by a nonequilibrium Percoll gradient procedure, the epsilon and gamma isoforms were present and the beta and zeta isoforms were absent from the membranes of synaptosomes sedimenting in the more dense parts of the gradient. The finding that these proteins are associated with different populations of synaptic membranes suggests that they are selectively expressed in different classes of neurones and raises the possibility that some or all of them may influence neurotransmission by regulating exocytosis and/or phosphorylation.

The novel family of 14-3-3 proteins may be involved in the regulation of neuronal activity. During our search for proteins coordinately expressed with the prohormone proopiomelanocortin in the melanotrope cells of the Xenopus intermediate pituitary gland, we cloned and sequenced a pituitary cDNA encoding a Xenopus 14-3-3 protein. Alignment of the Xenopus protein with known mammalian, Drosophila and plant 14-3-3 polypeptide and with a mammalian protein kinase C inhibitor protein revealed that the neuron-specific 14-3-3-related proteins are highly conserved (60-88%) throughout eukaryotic evolution.

14-3-3 proteins form a highly conserved protein family whose members have been shown to activate tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases, inhibit protein kinase C and possess phospholipase A2 activity in vitro. We have isolated and analyzed a 14-3-3 protein cDNA clone (H14-3-3) from a human fetal brain cDNA library and found it to possess a high level of sequence identity with the bovine 14-3-3 eta protein cDNA in both the translated and untranslated regions, suggesting the presence of cis-regulatory elements in the untranslated regions of these mRNAs. The proteins encoded by these two cDNAs ar</h3>e 98.4% identical. Two different sized RNA species, approx. 1.9 and 3.5 kb in size that are expressed in a variety of tissues hybridize with this cDNA. However, only the 1.9 kb RNA is detected in the fetal brain. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from eight different human tissues shows that 14-3-3 protein mRNAs are expressed in many tissues in the body. In agreement with previous reports, the highest abundance of RNA hybridizing with this cDNA is seen in the brain.

A broad range of organisms and tissues contain 14-3-3 proteins, which have been associated with many diverse functions including critical roles in signal transduction pathways, exocytosis and cell cycle regulation. We report here the crystal structure of the human T-cell 14-3-3 isoform (tau) dimer at 2.6 A resolution. Each monomer (Mr 28K) is composed of an unusual arrangement of nine antiparallel alpha-helices organized as two structural domains. The dimer creates a large, negatively charged channel approximately 35 A broad, 35 A wide and 20 A deep. Overall, invariant residues line the interior of this channel whereas the more variable residues are distributed on the outer surface. At the base of this channel is a 16-residue segment of 14-3-3 which has been implicated in the binding of 14-3-3 to protein kinase C.

<h3>A fusicoccin binding protein <A NAME="belongs">belongs</A> to the family of 14-3-3 brain protein homologs.<br></h3>

The fusicoccin binding protein (FCBP) is a highly conserved plasma membrane protein present in all higher plants tested thus far. It exhibits high- and low-affinity binding for the fungal toxin fusicoccin (FC). We purified the active FCBP from a fraction highly enriched in plasma membrane by selective precipitation and anion exchange chromatography. After SDS-PAGE, the two FCBP subunits of 30 and 31 kD were detected as major bands. Amino acid sequence analysis of the 31-kD polypeptide displayed a high degree of identity with so-called 14-3-3 proteins, a class of mammalian brain proteins initially described as regulators of neurotransmitter synthesis and protein kinase C inhibitors. Thereafter, we affinity purified the 30- and 31-kD FCBP subunits, using biotinylated FC in combination with a monomeric avidin column. Immunodecoration of these 30- and 31-kD FCBP subunits with polyclonal antibodies raised against a 14-3-3 homolog from yeast confirmed the identity of the FCBP as a 14-3-3 homolog. Similar to all 14-3-3 protein homologs, the FCBP seems to exist as a dimer in native form. Thus far, the FCBP is the only 14-3-3 homolog with a receptor-like function. The conserved structure of the 14-3-3 protein family is a further indication that the FCBP plays an important role in the physiology of higher plants.

The 14-3-3 proteins comprise a family of highly conserved acidic proteins. Several activities have been ascribed to these proteins, including activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases in the presence of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, regulation of protein kinase C, phospholipase A2 activity, stimulation of exocytosis and activation of bacterial exoenzyme S (ExoS) during ADP-ribosylation of host proteins. In addition, a plant 14-3-3 protein is present in a G-box DNA/protein-binding complex. Previously, we isolated the BMH1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoding a putative 14-3-3 protein. Using the polymerase chain reaction method, we have isolated a second yeast gene encoding a 14-3-3 protein (BMH2). While disruption of either BMH1 or BMH2 alone had little effect, it was impossible to obtain viable cells with both genes disrupted.

The 14-3-3 family of proteins have recently been identified as regulatory elements in intracellular signalling pathways: 14-3-3 proteins bind to oncogene and proto-oncogene products, including c-Raf-1 (refs 2-5), c-Bcr (ref. 6) and polyomavirus middle-T antigen; overexpression of 14-3-3 activates Raf kinase in yeast and induces meiotic maturation in Xenopus oocytes. Here we report the crystal structure of the major isoform of mammalian 14-3-3 proteins at 2.9 A resolution. Each subunit of the dimeric protein consists of a bundle of nine antiparallel helices that form a palisade around an amphipathic groove. The groove is large enough to accommodate a tenth helix, and we propose that binding to an amphipathic helix represents a general mechanism for the interaction of 14-3-3 with diverse cellular proteins. The residues in the dimer interface and the putative ligand-binding surface are invariant among vertebrates, yeast and plants, suggesting a conservation of structure and function throughout the 14-3-3 family.

We present the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone of mRNA encoding human 14-3-3 protein, a protein kinase-dependent activator of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases and an endogenous inhibitor of protein kinase C. The 1,730-nucleotide sequence of the cloned cDNA contains 191 bp of a 5'-noncoding region, the complete 738 bp of coding region, and 801 bp of a 3'-noncoding region containing three canonical polyadenylation signals. The 14-3-3 protein eta chain cDNA encoded a polypeptide of 246 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight 28,196. The predicted amino acid sequence of human 14-3-3 protein eta was highly homologous to that of previously reported bovine and rat 14-3-3 proteins with only two amino acid differences. The sequence carries structural features as putative regions responsible for activation of tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases and for inhibition of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. Northern blot analysis demonstrated widespread expression of the 14-3-3 protein eta chain in cultured cell lines derived from various human tumors. These findings suggest the conservative functions of the 14-3-3 protein among species. Spot blot hybridization analysis with flow-sorted chromosomes showed that the human 14-3-3 protein eta chain gene is assigned to chromosome 22.

The highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed 14-3-3 family of proteins bind to a variety of proteins involved in signal transduction and cell cycle regulation. The nature and specificity of 14-3-3 binding is, however, not known. Here we show that 14-3-3 is a specific phosphoserine-binding protein. Using a panel of phosphorylated peptides based on Raf-1, we have defined the 14-3-3 binding motif and show that most of the known 14-3-3 binding proteins contain the motif. Peptides containing the motif could disrupt 14-3-3 complexes and inhibit maturation of Xenopus laevis oocytes. These results suggest that the interactions of 14-3-3 with signaling proteins are critical for the activation of signaling proteins. Our findings also suggest novel roles for serine/threonine phosphorylation in the assembly of protein-protein complexes.

<h3>A single <A NAME="Arabidopsis">Arabidopsis</A> GF14 isoform possesses biochemical characteristics of diverse 14-3-3 homologues</h3>

Arabidopsis cDNA clones of GF14 proteins originally were isolated on the basis of their association with the G-box DNA/protein complex by a monoclonal antibody screening approach. GF14 proteins are homologous to the 14-3-3 family of mammalian proteins. Here we demonstrate that recombinant GF14 omega, one member of the Arabidopsis GF14 protein family, is a dimeric protein that possesses many of the attributes of diverse mammalian 14-3-3 homologues. GF14 omega activates rat brain tryptophan hydroxylase and protein kinase C in a manner similar to the bovine 14-3-3 protein. It also activates exoenzyme S of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as does bovine brain factor activating exoenzyme S (FAS), which is itself a member of 14-3-3 proteins. In addition, GF14 omega binds calcium, as does the human 14-3-3 homologue reported to be a phospholipase A2. These results indicate that a single isoform of this plant protein family can have multiple functions and that individual GF14 isoforms may have multiple roles in mediating signal transductions in plants. However, GF14 omega does not regulate growth in an in vivo test for functional similarity to the yeast 14-3-3 homologue, BMH1. Thus, while a single plant GF14 isoform can exhibit many of the biochemical attributes of diverse mammalian 14-3-3 homologues, open questions remain regarding the physiological functions of GF14/14-3-3 proteins.

<h3>A binding sequence <A NAME="for">for</A> the 14-3-3 protein within the cytoplasmic domain of the adhesion receptor, platelet glycoprotein Ib alpha</h3>

The zeta-form 14-3-3 protein (14-3-3zeta) regulates protein kinases and interacts with several signaling molecules. We reported previously that a platelet adhesion receptor, glycoprotein (GP) Ib-IX, was associated with a 29-kDa protein with partial sequences identical to 14-3-3zeta. In this study, the interaction between GPIb-IX and recombinant 14-3-3zeta is reconstituted. Further, we show that the 14-3-3zeta binding site in GPIb is within a 15 residue sequence at the C terminus of GPIb-alpha, as indicated by antibody inhibition and direct binding of 14-3-3zeta to synthetic GPIb-alpha cytoplasmic domain peptides. The 14-3-3zeta binds to recombinant wild type GPIb-IX but not to the GPIb-alpha mutants lacking C-terminal 5 or more residues, suggesting that the C-terminal 5 residues of GPIb-alpha are critical. Similarity between the GPIb-alpha C-terminal sequence and the serine-rich regions of Raf and Bcr kinases suggests a possible serine-rich recognition motif for the 14-3-3 protein.

The 14-3-3 protein family plays a role in a wide variety of cell signaling processes including monoamine synthesis, exocytosis, and cell cycle regulation, but the structural requirements for the activity of this protein family are not known. We have previously shown that the 14-3-3 protein binds with and activates phosphorylated tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of neurotransmitter serotonin) and proposed that this activity might be mediated through the COOH-terminal acidic region of the 14-3-3 molecules. In this report we demonstrate, using a series of truncation mutants of the 14-3-3 eta isoform expressed in Escherichia coli, that the COOH-terminal region, especially restricted in amino acids 171-213, binds indeed with the phosphorylated TPH. This restricted region, which we termed 14-3-3 box I, is one of the structural regions whose sequence is highly conserved beyond species, allowing that the plant 14-3-3 isoform (GF14) could also activate rat brain TPH. The 14-3-3 box I is the first functional region whose activity has directly been defined in the 14-3-3 sequence and may represent a common structural element whereby 14-3-3 interacts with other target proteins such as Raf-1 kinase. The result is consistent with the recently published crystal structure of this protein family, which suggests the importance of the negatively charged groove-like structure in the ligand binding.

The Times: Britain: October 7 1996  
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY<P>

 SHEDDING their traditionally self-effacing image, farmers' wives are emerging as the shock troops of the countryside as anger grows over the Government's handling of the "mad cow" crisis.

<P>

Women were prominent in the crowd that jostled and jeered Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, after he refused to address them at a dairy show in Devon last week. They have also taken the lead in organising what is expected to be a large turn-out of farmers at the Tory party conference in Bournemouth tomorrow: they will warn the Government it is losing the votes of thousands of loyal rural supporters.

<P>

In the van of the swelling protest is Sandy Loud, 50, a dairy farmer's wife from Northdown Farm at Lewdown, near Launceston, a co-founder of the Somerset, Devon and Cornwall Network, which she runs with three other farmers' wives and a farmer's daughter. On the day before she confronted Mr Hogg, Mrs Loud had led a group of 80 farmers who ambushed his Cabinet colleague Roger Freeman at a private meeting with slaughtermen and cattle renderers at Honiton, shouting him down with cries of "cheat", "traitor" and "Roger the Dodger".

<P>

Mrs Loud said: "In fairness, Mr Freeman at least had the guts to listen to us and to address some of our concerns. Mr Hogg did not even have the courtesy to come out and talk to us."

At the weekend, the group faxed a letter to the Prime Minister, calling on him to speak personally to the farmers at Bournemouth. "Farmers are facing the biggest crisis this country has ever seen in its agricultural history, instigated by your Government."

<P>

The other members of Mrs Loud's campaign group, all in dairy farming, are Ruth Burrow, of Rill Farm at Ottery St Mary in Devon, Pat Bird of Middle Crackington Farm at Crackington Haven in Cornwall, and Jane Down and her mother, Mary, of Marshwood Farm at Chard in Somerset.

<P>

"It started soon after the Goverment's announcement last March that BSE might have passed to humans," Mrs Loud said. "Ruth got in touch after seeing me being interviewed on television. We decided there was a role for us to play because our husbands were so tied up in running our farms."

<P>

The Louds' constituency is Devon West and Torridge, whose sitting MP, Emma Nicholson, defected to the Liberal Democrats. "The Tories have got a brilliant young prospective candidate but the poor chap doesn't stand a chance because farmers feel so betrayed by this Government," she said.

<P>

Over at Ottery St Mary, Mrs Burrow said the last straw was the decision by the European Union at the end of last month to cut 10 per cent from the compensation paid to farmers for cattle that have to be culled and burnt. "Mr Hogg actually went to the EU and asked for the cut just to save the Treasury money," she said. "This was a kick in the teeth for farmers still saddled with thousands of unsaleable over-age cattle because of the Government's own ineptness in administering the cull."

<P>

At the 300-acre Marshwood Farm, Jane Down said the next three months would be critical for thousands of farmers as they faced the prospect of having to dig into precious supplies of maize and winter silage to feed unproductive animals doomed to end up in incinerators.

<P>

"We have got 50 old barren cows waiting to be culled," she said. "Soon they will be costing us about &#163;10 a head a week to feed."<HR>

<H3><CENTER>Vegetarians claim <A NAME="best">best</A> year for converting meat eaters</CENTER></H3>

BY MICHAEL HORNSBY<BR>The Times: Britain: October 7 1996<P>

 UP TO a million people turned vegetarian after the Government's disclosure in March of a possible link between BSE and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, it was claimed yesterday.

The Vegetarian Society, which will be 150 years old next year, also said it had increased its membership this year by 5 per cent to 20,000.

<P>

Ray Drake, the society's chairman, said in its annual report: "The year to May 31, 1996, saw what was probably the largest single conversion of people to vegetarianism in history." The claim was based on a poll by Gallup in April which found 7 per cent of the population, about four million people, professing to be vegetarian, compared with 5 per cent before the announcement on "mad cow" disease on March 20.

<P>

Tina Fox, the society's chief execu tive, said that after the announcement, "the number of telephone calls and written inquiries went up from a normal level of about 500 a week to several thousand.

<P>

"We think BSE will have a lasting effect, particularly as people were already turning away from beef because of research linking red meat to cancer and heart disease."

She added: "More companies are taking account of vegetarianism. Birds Eye, for example, recently launched a meat-free range of products on the basis of market research showing that 41 per cent of consumers are reducing meat eating.

"It is true that vegetarians are still dominated by women and young people but as women still do most of the shopping they can have a disproportionate impact."

<P>

The Meat and Livestock Commission, the government quango which promotes meat eating, conceded that beef consumption was still 18 per cent down on the pre-March level, but said many people had switched to other meats such as lamb and pork.


A spokesman said: "Overall consumption of meat has not changed much over the decades and is still around 63kg a head a year, about the same as 30 years ago." He added that many people claiming to be vegetarian ate meat "from time to time".<HR>

<BR>
</FONT>At least <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">400,000 over-age cattle are waiting
on farms to be culled</FONT></B> and destroyed in the battle against BSE
, more than twice the previous estimate.<BR>
<BR>
Acknowledging a &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">fresh emergency</FONT></B>&quot;,
Roger Freeman, the Public Services Minister, said measures would be announced
soon to raise the number of cattle being slaughtered from 35,000 a week
to 55,000 and to help the most hard-pressed farmers. The culling and burning
of all cattle over 30 months old is designed to reassure consumers that
no beef infected with &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad cow</FONT></B>&quot;
disease is entering the food chain. Some 600,000 animals have been destroyed
since early May.<BR>
<BR>
Only two months ago the Government put the backlog of condemned older cattle
at no more than 150,000 and was talking confidently of clearing them off
farms by early October. Now the target has been put back to Christmas.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Freeman's admission that the <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Government has
got its sums badly wrong</FONT></B> comes against a background of growing
anger among farmers facing the expensive prospect of having to feed and
house unproductive animals through the winter months. On Wednesday, Douglas
Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture, had to be escorted to safety by police
after he refused to address a crowd of mutinous farmers at a dairy show
in Devon. Up to 1,000 farmers are expected to lobby the Tory party conference
in Bournemouth on Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
Feelings have been further inflamed by the European Union's recent decision,
at the Government's request, to cut the compensation farmers receive for
culled cattle from an average of &pound;500 to &pound;450 an animal from
October 14.<BR>
<BR>
The move will save the Treasury millions of pounds. &quot;We are in this
fresh problem, this fresh emergency, because during the summer many more
dairy farmers decided that their animals should be culled than the agriculture
departments in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland believed would
happen,&quot; Mr Freeman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.<BR>

The Times ... October 05 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>For those who used to like bread and dripping, here's the recipe
for a truly flavourful meat dish that may shock the muesli martyrs<BR>
<BR>
This being the party conference season, it is time to fling a few bogey
words around &shy; socialism, poll tax, Clause 4. You know them as well
as I do; they were all once embraced, but are now shoved on to the back
burner, the gas turned down, and allowed to become cold and indigestible.<BR>
<BR>
Can I hurl another couple of embarrassing bogies at you? They are foods
which we once held dear and are now too ashamed to contemplate. They stare
up at us from the butcher's slab with demonic eyes. They are <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">beef
and pork fat</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
Beef first. People are becoming coy about their beef habits. To boast of
being a beef -eater these days is to risk the pitiful glance that the early
muesli martyrs gave to those who remained faithful to the fry-up. There
may well be nervous families huddling round a bit of rump at this very
moment, curtains closed in case the neighbours spot the mustard jar, put
two and two together and start throwing stones.<BR>
<BR>
Beef -eating is bad enough, but what about pig fat? Is there anyone left
in this country who will stand up and declare themselves to be fond of
a bit of bread and dripping? You might as well call for the stringing up
of cats. Somehow, we have been persuaded it is lethal, clogs the arteries
and gums up the works &shy; which it may well do if taken to excess. But
what has happened to a sense of moderation? Thrown out with the bathwater,
and the pork chops with a nice bit of fat on them.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, it is not many years since there existed a breed of pig, widely
farmed in Dorset, which was called the &quot;ice-cream pig&quot;. These
pigs were bred to have plentiful back-fat, which was removed at slaughter
and processed into ice-cream. Do you remember that glum warning which said,
&quot;this product contains non-dairy fat&quot;? Did you know exactly how
far removed from the dairy it was? I did not believe this when first told,
but then a farmer said to me: &quot;Why do you think Walls used to make
bacon and pork pies?&quot; So, 25 years ago, you and I <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">strolled
along the prom clutching a cornet, licking at our processed pork fat</FONT></B>
and thinking we'd never had it so good.<BR>
<BR>
Shunning all modern food fancies, and with the bravery of a man standing
up at the Tory party conference calling for a tax on blue rinse, I offer
a dish which fulfils all the requirements of the the modern, fatphobic
eater while actually bringing together these two bogey ingredients, beef
and pig fat. But I warn you, you will have to be brave, and trusting. I
have recently returned from the southwest of France and, pining somewhat
for the robust food, my hand fell on Paula Wolfert's The Cooking of Southwest
France, in which she introduces double-degreasing. Veteran motorists will
remember a technique for getting elderly cars over hills, called double-declutching.
Well, this recipe for &quot;Daube for Early September&quot; will get you
over the Fear-of-Fat hump that has been keeping you from some truly great
dishes. It takes two slow days to cook, and some occasional delicate attention.<BR>
<BR>
Buy a 3lb silverside of beef . It is a dense, meaty cut with little fat,
and is cheap. If there is any fat to be seen on it, remove it. Now, cause
your butcher to rock back on his heels by asking for 3lb of pork back-fat
with rind. You may be the first person in the last ten years to make such
a request. This is cheap, too; I paid 95p. Cut the silverside into half-inch
slices, having rubbed the joint with plenty of black pepper, but not too
much salt. Remove the rind from the pork back-fat (while marvelling that
man once devised a way of turning this into something that could be eaten
with a chocolate flake) and then cut the fat into chunks and, using a food
processor, turn it into a thick paste while adding a chopped onion or shallot,
parsley, garlic and pepper. It is not terribly attractive.<BR>
<BR>
Line a heavy, cast-iron casserole with the pork rind &shy; the skin side
must be inwards or it will stick &shy; and then put a layer of beef , a
layer of the pork fat mixture, and another of beef , till you have used
all the ingredients.<BR>
<BR>
Take a bottle of strong red wine and boil it for 15 minutes till it has
lost the alcohol (heartbreaking) and then add to the casserole. Put on
a tight-fitting lid, and place in a slow oven. After six hours, remove
it and allow to cool without the lid. The disgusting, flabby pork fat will
have risen to the top of the dish, there to await removal by you, patiently,
with a teaspoon.<BR>
<BR>
Spare no effort to remove every trace. But, although this is the point
at which we say goodbye to the pig fat, it will have left behind those
subtle but vital flavours that only animal fat can give to food. Then back
into the oven for another hour, another cooling, a further fat hunt. Now
you can remove the cool, clean beef slices to a serving dish.<BR>
<BR>
Strain the remaining juice to remove even more fat and rind, and then reduce
the juice till you have a sauce. You can even skim this to ensure that
&shy; watch my lips &shy; there is hardly any fat left in this dish. Yet
I promise you will find more depth, subtlety and honest flavour in these
slices of beef than you ever thought meat could contain.<BR>
<BR>
If you try this in winter, save the fatty pork rind for the birds. And
reserve a smug look of pity for those misguided souls who think fat-free
must mean bland.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#009F00">Michael Pescott in Dublin<BR>
<BR>
Sunday Times ... Sunday 6 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>JOHN MAJOR was embroiled in a new row with Britain's European partners
last night after he was accused of using <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">blackmail
and trickery</FONT></B> to scupper the workings of the European Union.<BR>
<BR>
The prime minister responded furiously by describing the remarks by Klaus
Hansch, president of the European parliament, as &quot;<B>intemperate</B>&quot;
and &quot;<B>deeply offensive</B>&quot; and accusing him of &quot;<B>unacceptable
behaviour</B>&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
After a special summit of EU leaders in Dublin, Major said: &quot;I told
him his remarks were offensive. I think he knows that.&quot; He accused
Hansch of not understanding the British parliament.<BR>
<BR>
Hansch, a German social democrat, said earlier: &quot;I fail to see why
14 governments should always have to sacrifice their vision of Europe and
their principles to keep on board a government which may jump ship in any
case.&quot; He accused the British government of using &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">blackmail
tactics</FONT></B>&quot; during its dispute with the EU over BSE (&quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; disease).<BR>
<BR>
An unrepentant Major told a press conference in Dublin last night that
he would continue to veto unacceptable proposals during the stalled &quot;Maastricht
2&quot; review of the EU's future.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I shall not hesitate to say no to ideas I believe to be wrong for
Europe as a whole and wrong for the interests of the UK,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
He then snubbed other EU leaders by failing to stay on for a working dinner
in Dublin Castle after the one-day summit. Instead, he flew back to Britain,
barely concealing his view that the informal meeting of EU heads, called
at French insistence, was a waste of time.<BR>
<BR>
Major had barely disguised his view of yesterday's summit as soon as he
landed in Dublin. Asked why leaders were meeting, he replied: &quot;We
are here because we are here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Malcolm Rifkind, the foreign secretary, represented Major at the banquet,
while Sir Stephen Wall, British ambassador to the EU, stood in for Rifkind
at another dinner for foreign ministers. Major believed his opposition
was vindicated by its lack of a formal agenda and decisions.<BR>
<BR>
The dinner was due to end at 9.30pm but Major's team said EU banquets usually
went on until late and he had to fly back to prepare for a television interview
today with Sir David Frost and Tuesday's start of the Conservative party
conference in Bournemouth. However, sources close to Major <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">derided
the summit and scoffed at the closing meal</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
One British source joked about the likely subjects: &quot;One head of government
will talk about 'my summer trip to America', another will be talk about
'my summer trip to Africa'.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Britain said other EU members were informed &quot;weeks ago&quot; about
Major's rejection of their dinner invitation.<BR>
<BR>
Last night Lord Tebbit, a leading Eurosceptic and former Tory chairman,
welcomed Major's decision not to attend the closing dinner: &quot;Maybe
Norma had promised him a nice meal at home or there was something on telly
he wanted to watch. This decision shows he is a rational human being.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Major was also reported by aides to be unhappy at last week's endorsement
of Labour by three socialist leaders attending the summit &shy; Holland's
Wim Kok, Austria's Franz Vranitsky Vranitzky and Portugal's Antonio Guterres.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They are socialists,&quot; he said. &quot;They would like a socialist
government [in Britain] because they think a socialist government would
give to Europe those things a Conservative government never would. I do
not intend to let the sort of socialism we have put aside come to the UK
from Europe.&quot;<BR>

Daily Telegraph ... Thursday 3 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Hundreds of angry farmers jostled Douglas
Hogg</FONT></B>, the Minister of Agriculture, yesterday in a protest against
the handling of the beef crisis.<BR>
<BR>
More than 200 beef producers <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">chanting &quot;Oggy,
oggy, oggy - out, out, out&quot;</FONT></B> vented their frustration about
delays in the Government's cattle cull and cuts in their compensation.<BR>
<BR>
At one stage the banner-waving crowd at the South West Dairy Show in Shepton
Mallet, Somerset, threatened to overwhelm Mr Hogg and his escort of ministry
and show officials. Police threw a cordon around Mr Hogg as one of the
farmers fell during the melee. <BR>
<BR>
Some producers <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">accused the minister of &quot;arrogance&quot;</FONT></B>
and called for his resignation for refusing to address the crowd after
meeting representatives of the National Farmers' Union and the Country
Landowners' Association for an update on the BSE crisis in the West Country.
Last week farmers accused the Government of &quot;betrayal&quot; for a
10 per cent cut in compensation for cattle killed under the cull. It means
that farmers expecting &pound;500 a cow will now receive &pound;50 less.<BR>
<BR>
The cut comes as the backlog of cattle builds up on farms. <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">The
backlog is about 450,000</FONT></B> - more than twice the Government estimated
number.<BR>
<BR>
So many cattle are awaiting destruction that the Government is running
out of cold stores to hold the carcases until they can be destroyed. <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Ministers
plan to hire fleets of refrigerated container-lorries and two freezer-ships</FONT></B>
to cope.<BR>
<BR>
Anthony Gibson, a senior farming official at the meeting, said farmers
had put various points to Mr Hogg who had nothing to offer in reply.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The cut in the compensation added insult to incompetence,&quot; he
said. &quot;The scheme hasn't worked properly. There was fury in the air
at the show and I have not seen anything like it in 20 years with the NFU.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most of the farmers here would be lifelong Conservative voters and
not the sort of people you would expect to see marching up and down with
banners and jostling a minister of the Crown.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He declined our suggestion that he should address the crowd of farmers
outside to defuse the situation. As a result there was some jostling and
unpleasant scenes when he emerged with his police escort.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Gibson said the minister did not explain why he did not want to speak
to the farmers. &quot;It made things worse and added to the frustration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A ministry spokesman said last night: &quot;Mr Hogg was not assaulted during
his visit during which he met farmers' representatives.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>Labour won the support of farmers' leaders yesterday for the establishment
of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">an independent agency</FONT></B> to protect
consumer confidence in food.<BR>
<BR>
After many years of defending the role of the Ministry of Agriculture,
which is responsible for food policy, the National Farmers' Union of England
and Wales said that the beef crisis had forced it to review its position.<BR>
<BR>
Sir David Naish, president of the NFU, told a farmers' fringe meeting in
Blackpool: &quot;The NFU is looking afresh at the concept of a food agency
- in particular how any such body could work effectively to balance the
interests of consumer and producer while being accountable, independent
and cost effective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The BSE crisis had led to demands for an agency independent of MAFF and
the NFU was now willing to discuss this with &quot;interested parties,&quot;
Sir David added.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Gavin Strang, the shadow minister of agriculture, welcomed the shift
in the NFU position. He said: &quot;The sooner we reach a consensus to
enable us to reassure the public about food safety the better.&quot;<BR>

</FONT>Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, was <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">jostled

of anger at the Government's handling of &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad

<BR>
Police and stewards had to surround Mr Hogg to prevent him from being manhandled
as placard-waving farmers surged foward chanting &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Hoggy,
Hoggy, Hoggy, out, out, out</FONT></B>&quot;. Several protesters were knocked
to the ground in the mel&eacute;e. One witness said: &quot;I don't know
what they would have done if they had got hold of him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Hogg was guest of honour at the South West Dairy Show at the Royal Bath
and West Showground at Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Anger erupted when some
farmers could not get into a packed meeting of the minister, members of
the National Farmers' Union and the Country Landowners' Association.<BR>
<BR>
Anthony Gibson, the NFU's regional director, said: &quot;The mood was turning
nasty and I suggested to Mr Hogg that he should go out on the balcony of
the auditorium and speak to the farmers outside. But he refused and this
made matters worse.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After a loudspeaker appeal for calm, Mr Hogg, <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">looking
shaken</FONT></B>, was led to the main ring to present cattle prizes as
farmers crowded round him. He left 15 minutes later.<BR>
<BR>
Feelings are running high after a decision last week by the European Union,
at the Government's request, to cut 10 per cent from the compensation paid
to farmers for culled cattle.<BR>
<BR>
There is discontent among farmers over the high number of old cattle still
awaiting slaughter under the cull scheme set up after fears emerged that
the human disease <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> was linked to
BSE.<BR>
<BR>
* British fishermen are breaking EU conservation rules on a huge scale,
according to a report by a respected industry pressure group.<BR>
<BR>
The study estimates that 40 per cent of the catch landed by Scottish trawlermen
is in breach of limits on the type, quantity and size of fish that can
legally be brought ashore. It says that illicit catches are landed in remote
parts. In major ports they are loaded on lorries at night.<BR>
<BR>
The widespread cheating is alleged in a report by the Scottish Council
for Development and Industry, a body that embraces industrialists, trade
unionists and politicians that seeks to promote Scotland's prosperity.
It blames &quot;absurd&quot; EU regulations rather than the fishermen.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>The Consumers' Association is seeking to revitalise its role as
a campaigning political pressure group.<BR>
<BR>
The organisation, which publishes the Which? group of magazines and has
almost 750,000 members, is doing the rounds of the party conferences touting
a manifesto called Making Markets Work, which catalogues the reforms the
association would like the next government to initiate.<BR>
<BR>
Stephen Harris, director of communications, said yesterday: &quot;We are
trying to get back to the role CA had in the 1970s. During the 1980s consumerism
became confused with consumption. Legitimate consumer concerns were pushed
aside while attention focused on how much money people had and how much
they were spending. We still see that with all the talk about the 'feel-good'
factor.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Harris said the present Government clearly attached high value to the
interests of industry and other producers. &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">They
attach very low value to consumer interests</FONT></B>. The deregulation
initiative is a much clearer indication where this Government is coming
from than the Citizen's Charter,&quot; he said. &quot;If consumers had
even an equal footing with producers in the Government's consideration
there would not have been the <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">terrible mess in
the Government's reactions to the BSE crisis</FONT></B>,&quot; he claimed.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Harris said the association had identified six key areas. Campaign teams
have been established in the fields of communications, health, including
food, personal finance, public utilities, redress, and transport. &quot;From
now on we intend to punch our weight,&quot; Mr Harris said.<BR>

* A call for higher standards among professional bodies involved in drafting

In a survey of 51 wills, reported in Which?, a panel of legal experts rated

<H3><CENTER><A NAME="Dairy">Dairy</A> cattle, slowing milk production, and BSE</CENTER></H3>

Listserve 3 Oct 96
<P>

Most of the european dairy cattle are slaugthered only because of a reduction
in their milk productivity. This happens when they have had only 1 or 2 calves
in the Netherlands, after 3 or 4 calves in Germany or perhaps a bit later in the
UK. When a cow becomes suffering from any disease, the milk productivity drops.<P>

In the case of BSE this will happen most probably slowly but pronounced and
often with the consequence of the slaughtering of a infected cattle only a few
weeks before other symptoms become detectable.
Therefore  it is very important to know the quantitative correlation between the time point before they are killed because of BSE and the quantity of milk, they produced. 
<P>
It is very strange, that this correlation has never been published.
If my hypothesis is correct and many older dairy cattle are killed because of an
unrecognized BSE infection, then the britsh calculations of the mean incubation
time of BSE, the frequence of maternal transmission and the duration of the BSE
epidemy in the future are badly underestimated.

<BR>
</FONT>Sandy Loud is a lifelong Tory who, like thousands of others, will
be in Bournemouth tomorrow for the Conservative conference.<BR>
<BR>
But she will not be sitting in the hall in her best frock, or craning her
neck for a better view of John Major. Mrs Loud, 50, will be outside, at
the centre of a noisy protest of farmers and their wives, making ministers
feel uncomfortable.<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Anger at the BSE crisis</FONT></B>, now in its
seventh month, has intensified with the recent cut in compensation for
culled cattle. Mrs Loud's feelings are expressed in the slogan on a sweatshirt
- <B>This Cow Isn't Mad. She's Bloody Livid</B>.<BR>
<BR>
Her husband and sons run the 500-acre Northdown Farm at Combebow, Devon,
and she is a member of the SDC [Somerset Devon Cornwall] Network, an increasingly
active group of West Country farmers' wives who, after months of letter
writing, are turning to direct protest.<BR>
<BR>
The women were at Honiton last week when Roger Freeman, the minister chairing
the Cabinet's BSE committee, was barracked. The following day, at Shepton
Mallet, Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Secretary, was surrounded by 500
farmers. &quot;At Bournemouth we will want someone - preferably Major -
to come out and talk to us. If they don't address us in a proper manner,
I cannot say what will happen,&quot; she said.<BR>
<BR>
The group was created in March amid fears that whole herds would be slaughtered.
Mrs Loud returned from a dismal day at market to find her husband Tony,
53, and sons Richard, 29, and Martin, 28, sitting in the kitchen. The cows
had been milked but that was all. &quot;They were talking about whether
it was worth going on. At that moment I thought nobody is going to treat
my family like this,&quot; she said.<BR>
<BR>
She has transformed her kitchen into a campaign centre. The table is piled
with paperwork and the phone rings constantly. &quot;We get people who
are desperate, 'What do I do? I've got 40 cows I can't sell. I can't feed
them, I haven't got any more money'. There have been <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">26
suicides among farmers</FONT></B> since this all started.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Whatever happens in Bournemouth, Mrs Loud believes that it is <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">too
late for the Conservatives to regain farmers' confidence</FONT></B>. &quot;There
is tremendous bad feeling. Farmers are Conservative voters but they won't
vote Conservative now.&quot;<BR>

Daily Telegraph ... Monday 7 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Dr Klaus Hansch, the German president of the European Parliament
who clashed with John Major at the Dublin summit, was last night the subject
of a <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">volley of abuse from fellow MEPs</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The previously little-known Dr Hansch infuriated Mr Major before the summit
by accusing the Government of &quot;blackmail tactics&quot; during the
beef crisis. Mr Major took the first chance to confront the German socialist
face to face in Dublin and told him his remarks were &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">deeply
offensive</FONT></B>&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Last night Lord Plum, leader of the 18 Conservatives in the European Parliament,
said he was appalled at the behaviour of the man elected to represent him
and all parliamentarians at EU summits. &quot;To use the word blackmail
is an <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">insult to the British Prime Minister and
the British Government</FONT></B> and he should not make such comments,&quot;
he said.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Hansch had failed to recognise the measures the British Government had
taken to eradicate BSE in Britain, added Lord Plum. &quot;He had better
get his facts right before he starts making statements like that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Edward Macmillian-Scott, Conservative MEP for North Yorkshire, said Dr
Hansch had behaved &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">outrageously</FONT></B>&quot;.
The job of president &quot;does not give him the licence to meddle in national
politics. He has damaged the reputation of the parliament&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Major's attack on Dr Hansch - telling him that some senior representatives
of the European Parliament completely failed to grasp British policies
- was one of the most outspoken he has made on a fellow European politician.
&quot;He took the point very clearly that I was talking about him and not
about other people. I think the points I made had some impact,&quot; said
Mr Major after the Dublin meeting.<BR>

</FONT>Thousands of servicemen and women may face medical checks as the
Ministry of Defence launches an inquiry into reports that British troops
were <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">exposed to pesticides during the Gulf war</FONT></B>
because they were <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">not given protective clothing</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
A senior officer admitted yesterday that the army's &quot;can do&quot;
philosophy may have got out of hand, with junior ranks simply being told
to &quot;get on with it&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
The MoD admitted last week that far more <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">potentially
dangerous organophosphate insecticides</FONT></B> (OPs) were used in the
desert than had been realised, and that this was almost certainly one cause
of the mysterious &quot;Gulf war syndrome&quot; for which veterans are
demanding treatment and compensation.<BR>
<BR>
But the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, still refuses to confirm the
existence of such a syndrome. &quot;We have set up the most comprehensive
medical investigation, firstly to see whether Gulf war veterans are more
ill - in greater numbers, greater proportions - than the population as
a whole, and, if they are, if there is one linking theme,&quot; he said
yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Portillo admitted that &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">certain pesticides</FONT></B>&quot;
were used. &quot;I would hope that whatever precautions were appropriate
were taken.&quot; Documents disclosed at the weekend by Labour's defence
spokesman, David Clark, indicate that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">dangers
were increased by lack of equipment</FONT></B>. In one report, Sergeant

Shedding their traditionally self-effacing image, <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">farmers'
wives are emerging as the shock troops of the countryside</FONT></B> as
anger grows over the Government's handling of the &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; crisis.<BR>
<BR>
Women were prominent in the crowd that jostled and jeered Douglas Hogg,
the Agriculture Minister, after he refused to address them at a dairy show
in Devon last week. They have also taken the lead in organising what is
expected to be a large turn-out of farmers at the Tory party conference
in Bournemouth tomorrow: they will warn the Government it is losing the
votes of thousands of loyal rural supporters.<BR>
<BR>
In the van of the swelling protest is Sandy Loud, 50, a dairy farmer's
wife from Northdown Farm at Lewdown, near Launceston, a co-founder of the
Somerset, Devon and Cornwall Network, which she runs with three other farmers'
wives and a farmer's daughter. On the day before she confronted Mr Hogg,
Mrs Loud had led a group of 80 farmers who ambushed his Cabinet colleague
Roger Freeman at a private meeting with slaughtermen and cattle renderers
at Honiton, shouting him down with cries of &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">cheat</FONT></B>&quot;,
&quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">traitor</FONT></B>&quot; and &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Roger
the Dodger</FONT></B>&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Mrs Loud said: &quot;In fairness, Mr Freeman at least had the guts to listen
to us and to address some of our concerns. Mr Hogg did not even have the
courtesy to come out and talk to us.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At the weekend, the group faxed a letter to the Prime Minister, calling
on him to speak personally to the farmers at Bournemouth. &quot;Farmers
are facing the biggest crisis this country has ever seen in its agricultural
history, instigated by your Government.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The other members of Mrs Loud's campaign group, all in dairy farming, are
Ruth Burrow, of Rill Farm at Ottery St Mary in Devon, Pat Bird of Middle
Crackington Farm at Crackington Haven in Cornwall, and Jane Down and her
mother, Mary, of Marshwood Farm at Chard in Somerset.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It started soon after the Goverment's announcement last March that
BSE might have passed to humans,&quot; Mrs Loud said. &quot;Ruth got in
touch after seeing me being interviewed on television. We decided there
was a role for us to play because our husbands were so tied up in running
our farms.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Louds' constituency is Devon West and Torridge, whose sitting MP, Emma
Nicholson, defected to the Liberal Democrats. &quot;The Tories have got
a brilliant young prospective candidate but the poor chap doesn't stand
a chance because farmers feel so betrayed by this Government,&quot; she
said.<BR>
<BR>
Over at Ottery St Mary, Mrs Burrow said the last straw was the decision
by the European Union at the end of last month to cut 10 per cent from
the compensation paid to farmers for cattle that have to be culled and
burnt. &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Mr Hogg actually went to the EU and
asked for the cut just to save the Treasury money</FONT></B>,&quot; she
said. &quot;This was a kick in the teeth for farmers still saddled with
thousands of unsaleable over-age cattle because of the Government's own
ineptness in administering the cull.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At the 300-acre Marshwood Farm, Jane Down said the next three months would
be critical for thousands of farmers as they faced the prospect of having
to dig into precious supplies of maize and winter silage to feed unproductive
animals doomed to end up in incinerators.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have got 50 old barren cows waiting to be culled,&quot; she said.
&quot;Soon they will be costing us about &pound;10 a head a week to feed.&quot;<BR>

</FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Up to a million people turned vegetarian
after the Government's disclosure in March of a possible link between BSE
and</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</FONT></B>,
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">it was claimed yesterday</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The Vegetarian Society, which will be 150 years old next year, also said
it had increased its membership this year by 5 per cent to 20,000.<BR>
<BR>
Ray Drake, the society's chairman, said in its annual report: &quot;The
year to May 31, 1996, saw what was probably the <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">largest
single conversion of people to vegetarianism in history</FONT></B>.&quot;
The claim was based on a poll by Gallup in April which found 7 per cent
of the population, about four million people, professing to be vegetarian,
compared with 5 per cent before the announcement on &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; disease on March 20.<BR>
<BR>
Tina Fox, the society's chief execu tive, said that after the announcement,
&quot;the number of telephone calls and written inquiries went up from
a normal level of about 500 a week to several thousand.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We think BSE will have a lasting effect, particularly as people were
already turning away from beef because of research linking red meat to
cancer and heart disease.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
She added: &quot;More companies are taking account of vegetarianism. <B>Birds
Eye</B>, for example, <B>recently launched a meat-free range of products</B>
on the basis of market research showing that 41 per cent of consumers are
reducing meat eating.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It is true that vegetarians are still dominated by women and young
people but as women still do most of the shopping they can have a disproportionate
impact.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Meat and Livestock Commission, the government quango which promotes
meat eating, <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">conceded that beef consumption was
still 18 per cent down on the pre-March level</FONT></B>, but said many
people had switched to other meats such as lamb and pork.<BR>
<BR>
A spokesman said: &quot;Overall consumption of meat has not changed much
over the decades and is still around 63kg a head a year, about the same
as 30 years ago.&quot; He added that many people claiming to be vegetarian
ate meat &quot;from time to time&quot;.<BR>

Reuter Information Service   Oct 17, 1996
<P>    LONDON ( 01:37  a.m. EDT) - Britain's advertising watchdog on Wednesday accused the Vegetarian Society of being alarmist and inaccurate in a campaign it launched against meat.
    One of the society's advertisements showed the rear view of a bull and carried the caption: "If you eat burgers, here's a couple of half pounders you might recognise."<P>

    It suggested parts of the body, including testicles, feet and the rectum, were often found in meat products and that meat had been linked to a range of diseases.  After receiving complaints from farmers and meat groups, the Advertising Standards Authority said the advertisements had used "inaccurate and emotive language."<P>

Daily Telegraph ... Wednesday 16 October 1996
<P>


Douglas Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture, hit back yesterday at critics who want him sacked for his handling of
the beef crisis and blamed "scaremongering" press coverage for damaging Government efforts to restore
consumer confidence.

He accused tabloid newspapers of indulging in sensationalism instead of putting across a "balanced and accurate
message" on mad cow disease.<P>

Mr Hogg warned meat industry leaders in London that, despite signs of recovery in the marketplace, the crisis was
so serious that it would lead to "a permanent drop in the consumption of beef". He defended the
Government's efforts to give consumers "the facts", saying that ministers, the Government's Chief Medical Officer
and other officials had all given regular briefings together with Prof John Pattison, the independent chairman of
the Government's Spongiform Encaphalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC).<P>

It was a rousing defence from a minister who last week was given a vote of no confidence by farmers'
leaders. Yesterday Mr Hogg had to listen to more criticism when the meat manufacturers accused the Government
of giving most BSE cash aid to farmers and none of it to them.

The Times: Politics & Government October 9 1996  BY JAMES LANDALE

<P>

 ALMOST a thousand farmers gathered at the conference in Bournemouth yesterday to protest at the Government's handling of the BSE crisis


Despite a pledge by Douglas Hogg to give the beef industry an extra compensation package worth &#163;45 million, farmers left the demonstration dissatisfied with the Agriculture Minister's performance. Many called for his resignation.

<P>

John Major cleared time to hold talks with farmers' leaders and promised to do everything he could to ease their problems. But while farmers said the 1 1/2 -hour meeting had been useful, they said their patience was exhausted and demanded further action.

The Prime Minister, who met Sir David Naish, presi dent of the National Farmers' Union, and a small group of farmers, said: "I absolutely understand why there are so many farmers out there today and sympathise with their position."

<P>

Sir David said: "We have been patient but our patience is exhausted. We need now to see our actions, which we have put to the Prime Minister, brought to bear." One of the farmers' demands is for a restoration of the basic compensation price for each cow slaughtered, which was cut from an average of &#163;500 per cow to &#163;450 ten days ago.

<P>

Outside the conference hall, farmers were sceptical. A sea of banners and placards declared: "Fire that chinless Hogg now" and "No more Hogg-wash".
Inside, farmers said that no one had fought as hard for the industry as Mr Hogg.

THE TIMES: FOREIGN NEWS October 9 1996 ...  FROM ROGER BOYES

<P>

 GERMANS, once the carnivores of Europe, are turning into vegetarians.


That is official, according to the German Vegan Society yesterday. It calculates that a fifth of the nation now eats little or no meat. Political analysts are wondering if this will have a long-term impact on the electoral prospects of Helmut Kohl, the Chancellor.

<P>

The shift in eating habits, which contrasts with Herr Kohl's fabled pig-stomach menus, has been prompted in part by fear of "mad cow" disease, although meat-eating has been in decline since the late 1980s. But vegeterianism marks more than a change of diet. It is the beginning of the end of a national obsession.


No political rally is complete without sausages; no wedding, christening or funeral is authentic without a banquet of hams or pork knuckles. Children feel betrayed if their lunch pack does not contain a sandwich with pork or beef dripping. Teenagers fall in love over beefburgers.

<P>

The marriage of Gerhard Schroeder, the Lower Saxony prime minister and likely challenger to Herr Kohl in 1998, fell apart partly because his wife was a militant vegetarian. The politician used to have his chauffeur stop at sausage stands on the way to work to catch up with his meat intake. When he started to live with a young carnivorous journalist, public sympathy swung behind him.

<P>

Until recently, every man, woman and child in Germany consumed 56lb of sausages a year. Now, however, Germans are searching for interesting ways of eating Brussels sprouts and broccoli. The biggest growth is in part-time vegetarianism, dropping meat consumption to once or twice a week.

<P>

People aged under 39 bought a third less meat last year than in the year before. Hareico, a well-known sausage and meat manufacturer, has added soy sausages and soy nuggets to its range. Karl-Georg Ferber, the product manager, said: "I believe in the future of veggie schnitzels and burgers."

<H3><CENTER>Mad cow disease an 'act of <A NAME="God">God</A>' </CENTER></H3>
The Times: Britain: October 9 1996
 BY MICHAEL HORNSBY<P>

 "MAD cow" disease was "an act of God" and the Government should not be blamed for it, a senior official in the Ministry of Agriculture told MEPs yesterday.



While the Government might have responded differently to the disease with hindsight, the overreaction of some European Union countries had made the crisis worse, Richard Packer, the ministry's Permanent Secretary, said.

<P>

Speaking in Brussels at a European Parliament committee of inquiry into BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Mr Packer said: "Was the British Government responsible for the whole disastrous mess? No it wasn't.



"In the main it was an act of God, if you like. Some of the things we have done we might with the benefit of hindsight have done differently. To that extent the British Government accepts responsibility &#173; but that is not very much of the responsibility."

<P>

Douglas Hogg, the Minister of Agriculture, had been asked to address the inquiry but he refused because he said he was attending the Tory party conference in Bournemouth.


To Jos&eacute; Happart, a Belgian Socialist MEP, who wanted to know who was to blame for the BSE crisis if it was not the British Government, Mr Packer replied: "I do not accept that when something goes wrong it is necessarily somebody's fault.

<P>

"It is true in the case of BSE that not all our controls were 100 per cent effective and to that extent we have a share of the responsibility. But that is a small share. It does not follow that if we take &#173; hypothetically &#173; 1 per cent of the blame, that 99 per cent is spread around somewhere else."

<P>

Tom, as you probably know, beef consumption has fallen less in the UK than anywhere else in Europe despite the fact that the BSE epidemic is concentrated here. I'm afraid most people still aren't too worried about BSE. <br><br>This may be partly due to the fact that everyone knows that although contaminated feed was banned for herbivores in 1988, the ban wasn't enforced until 1995 (approx. 50% compliance until then). Also, the contaminated feedstocks were still produced but diverted to pigs, chicken, and fish feed. However, the government deliberately misled the public into believing that the feed was no longer produced, consequently most everybody who switched out of beef in 1988 &nbsp;went to pork, chicken and fish and ate BSE anyway. To put it another way, 99% of us over here have eaten the stuff for 8-9 years unawares. I guess a lot of people now have a fatalistic attitude.<br><br>I don't eat beef or its by-products at all, have lots of vegetarian stuff, sea (not farmed) fish, and fruit. I drink skimmed milk (Soya milk is not easily obtainable over here), coffee, tea, beer, wine. It's not possible to avoid English cheese as its included in so many vegetarian products, but I always buy foreign cheese otherwise. Not as much fruit juice as I should because its expensive (food prices here are about double yours). <br><br>You have to be <b>really</b> careful about beef by-products, for instance the filler in stores own brand crab and shrimp paste is beef lard, biscuits often contain &quot;non-dairy&quot; fat (=beef fat), and also some ice-cream (I sent you an article on that). Fortunately more people are avoiding beef by-products and there is an increasing number of vegetarians, so manufacturers are switching into non-animal derived alternatives to obtain Vegetarian society approval for their products, or else be able to label the as &quot;suitable for vegetarians&quot;. ALWAYS READ THE SMALL PRINT ON THE PACKAGING!<br><br>Its the silly things that catch most people out, for instance most bread contains beef fat, I only eat the brands approved by the Vegetarian Society. I completely avoid all processed meat such as sausages, salami, meat pies, etc. This all contains MRM (mechanically recovered meat) which is the brains, offal, guts, etc steamed out and reconstituted. Even ham sold over here is pig MRM which has been steamed out, coloured, flavoured, and pressed.<br><br>Having said all that, my wife and I are in the minority here and are looked upon as &quot;slightly odd&quot; for bothering about BSE. As over there, its the young that take it more seriously.As I have mentioned before, the human health aspects of BSE are simply not an issue at the moment. It's mainly politics, especially at this time of the year when the party conferences.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="Bad">Bad</A> News in the British System</H3>
</CENTER>A London Correspondent 10.8.96
<P>

<B>Publishing or not publishing research research:</B><BR>

As the research is funded externally from MAFF the results may well become
public. The Barclay Brothers, who are both fabulously rich and eccentric
(not to mention publicity shy), are probably the main funders. They are
anti-establishment and would encourage publication.<P>

<B>Bad news and British elections:</B><BR>
If there is bad news coming in a few weeks it could well have a political
impact. The Conservatives would prefer to wait until the last minute for
the next election (May 97), but really bad BSE news might force
their hands to go for this Autumn before it breaks. You ought to mention
this on your web page. Remember that BSE is mainly a Europe/farming issue
in this country at the moment and the government would prefer to keep it
that way. The government has been remarkably
successful in diverting publicity away from the human health implications.<P>

<B>Releasing CJD data:</B><BR>
It is obvious that MAFF will have to release the data sometime as the EU
have said it is a prerequisite to lifting the beef export ban, the same
applies to the number of suspected cases known by the CJD monitoring centre
which is also being withheld. I have no doubt that the intention is to push
back any further revelations about CJD and humans until after the next
general election, but Collinge may baulk them if he can't be silenced.
We are too placid for civil unrest over here, there are virtually no guns
or anything in public hands in the UK. The possibility of riots or the like
is remote.<P>

<B>Is UK health system ready for v-CJD caseload?</B><BR>
The government has run down our health service to the extent that over 75's
are no longer admitted under any circumstances and it looks like the London
hospitals will shut there doors for 3 hours every day in a rotation to try and
manage the winter sickness peaks. The last time this happened was in the
second world war when there were genuine resource shortages. This time it
is just that the government wants to kill the Health Service for reasons of
its political dogma.
<P>
Even a minor (just a few thousand cases in a year) CJD outbreak would blow
the health system, resulting in the need for dramatic measures such as
euthanasia and activation of the civil defence network to manage the
crisis. It is just a mechanism for managing large scale crisis whilst the
democratic processes (such as they are over here) are suspended. It is
called "a state of emergency".
<P>
 MAFF is suppressing BSE information, the CJD center
is suppressing the number of suspected cases, and now the civil defence
organisation has been activated. I suspect that a valid analogy would be
the way that the government suddenly started enforcing the abattoir rules
(announced in 1988) in 1995, just six months before the CJD/BSE link was
made public. Now there may be more bad news on the way, but the government
will be desperate to "keep the cat in the bag" until after the general
election.
<P>
A counselor (bereavements)
who works for a county council,  went to a meeting which
appears to have been a wake-up meeting for the civil defence organisation.
The Chief Medical Officer of the county told all those present, in no
uncertain terms, to stop eating beef. If CJD turns into an epidemic the
hospitals will be overwhelmed as victims can take years to die, so
euthanasia will be necessary with counseling for survivors.
The civil defence organisation may be on
standby to handle a major CJD outbreak, probably a precautionary move.

Associated Press ...13 October 1996<P>

WASHINGTON -- The government soon will be doling out federal dollars to farmers and ranchers to help fight pollution from manure and other sources. Even before it starts, the program is under attack as a potential cash cow for corporate farms.
<P>

Several lawmakers, including Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle, are joining advocates for small farmers in criticizing rules proposed Friday by the Agriculture Department for distributing the $200 million newly available each year.

<P>

By failing to set clear limits on who can collect, the critics contend, the rules leave the way open for taxpayer dollars to help corporate farms build pollution controls that the Clean Water Act already obliges them to install. The department denies the allegation. The rules failed to spell out who should qualify, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman admitted, but he promised that wealthy operations will get nothing.

<P>

''I have no intention of awarding large-scale operations any of this assistance. Period,'' he said in an interview. The voluntary Environmental Quality Incentives Program, created by the 1996 farm bill, pays up to 100 percent of the cost of building manure containment lagoons or to switch to farming practices that lower pesticide use.

<P>
Payments are limited to $10,000 per person per year, with a cap of $50,000.
During debate on the farm bill, the Senate wanted to set size limits to coincide with those of the Clean Water Act. It dropped precise language after Glickman pledged to come up with limit definitions.
Instead, Friday's proposals left it to state conservationists to decide.

The Agriculture Department scheduled a nationwide round of public hearings starting next week. It will use the information to come up with guidance to the states on the program's administration.

<P>

Critics say state conservationists -- federal employees who will run the program on a state level -- will be vulnerable to intense lobbying. The program will become unmanageable, they say, because 50 standards will prevail, not one.
''This could turn a very useful conservation program into corporate welfare that will drive family farmers out of business and poison the landscape all over rural America,'' said Ferd Hoefner, Washington representative for the Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, an advocacy group based in Pine Bush, N.Y.

<P>

The critics also include Democratic Sens. Daschle, D-S.D.; Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the Agriculture Committee; Tom Harkin of Iowa; Russ Feingold and Herb Kohl of Wisconsin; and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota.

In some of the recent postings it was speculated that true incidence
of BSE is much higher than reported incidence, and Germany is
obviously one of the "candidate" countries with only four cases
officially acknowledged.
<P>
 All I can say is that in the last 2 1/2 years, any  cow that  came into our
clinic (which services an area of roughly 100 km around Munich) with
behavioral abnormalities or obvious CNS involvement went to post
mortem (including brain histopathology) if she did not recover
(which would be extremely unlikely in the case of BSE).
<P>

Prof. Braun in Zurich, on the other hand, has seen many cases in his
clinic. I see no reason whatsoever why practicing veterinarians in
southern Bavaria would not refer suspect cases to our clinic if they
did occur. In a retrospective study of brains submitted to veterinary
investigation centers for rabies diagnostics with negative results
not a single case of BSE was detected.

 I saw an absolutely ghastly statement [from Gibbs et al. J. Neurol.Neurosurg.Psychiatry 1994; 57: 757-8] in Prusiner's Ann Rev Microbiol v48
1994 article: surgical EEG electrodes, used unknowingly on a CJD incubator
and used subsequently on two children and _18 months later_  on a monkey,
giving rise to disease in all three.  One supposes neurosurgery tools would
be given a good cleaning between operations.<P>

Dr R G Will (1996) Letter to Neurologists, 21 March, states: "If you

</CENTER>Listserve 10.9.96
<P>

It also appears that many countries (including USA) may be burying 
BSE. The European joke is that BSE may be called JCB in many
countries.  
<P>
Explanation:JCB is the
the initials of  Johnathan C. Bamford, the original manufacturer of
mechanical diggers.
 
Today,  the term JCB is used here as a generic term for the large
mechanical diggers used in road- and tunnel- making, although many
firms make such equipment today.  JCBs are also used to dig graves
for the burial of animal- and human- remains.<P>

Hence the joke: BSE may be JCB, and the sicker joke (for countries
which do not perform brain histopath routinely on humans dead of CNS
disease), CJD may be JCB.
 
Background:<BR>
We hear that cows which show nervous signs which fail to respond
to treatment for hypomagnesaemia, lead toxicity, tetanus, acidosis
etc are treated  by JCB (killed and
buried without notification of the veterinary authorities) !
 
Thus, many countries, especially those which do not have BSE as a
Notafiable Disease (with free investigation and full compensation
payable) can honestly say that BSE has not been reported in those
countries. THat does not say that those countries are FREE of BSE.<P>
 
Apart from brain biopsy (rarely used), most countries have no
reliable premortem diagnosis of BSE or CJD at this time. Thus,
without routine postmortem brain histology, statistics on
national incidence of BSE or CJD incidence must be highly suspect.
And before brain histopath, the carcass/corpse must be submitted to
the lab.

British beef</FONT></H3>
<FONT COLOR="#009F00">By David Brown, Agriculture Editor, in Paris<BR>
<BR>
Daily Telegraph ... Tuesday 22 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>The Meat and Livestock Commission has asked
the Government for &pound;15 million in cash aid because it has run out
of money to fight the collapse of beef sales in Britain.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>The commission, a statutory body funded by levies from farmers
and abattoirs to promote sales of beef, lamb, pork and bacon, has warned
ministers that unless it gets the money soon to pay for intensive marketing
campaigns, it cannot prevent a &quot;catastrophic&quot; and permanent 25
per cent contraction of the British beef industry.<BR>
<BR>
This would lead to a string of bankruptcies among farmers and meat processing
plants, it says. The commission's financial plight emerged yesterday at
the Sial international food exhibition in Paris - one of the world's biggest
food shows - where it was trying gamely to promote British beef even though
there was not a scrap of it to be found thanks to the EU ban on British
exports.<BR>
<BR>
The commission, <B>which is also seeking more than
&pound;2 million in marketing money from the EU</FONT></B>, said it had
used up the last of its reserves. Much of the money went into its beef
mince marketing campaign, launched in the summer. This cost &pound;2.5
million, but partially reversed a sharp drop in sales of mince after the
beef crisis broke in March.<BR>
<BR>
But Mr Curry said yesterday that this campaign was not as successful as
it should have been because the Treasury refused to chip in another &pound;1.5
million. The commission, he said, had spent more than &pound;8 million
promoting beef this year - about &pound;2 million more than usual. But
he added: &quot;Make no mistake, if we are to meet the current challenge
of the market place over the next two years, we will need to spend a lot
more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tony Pexton, deputy president of the National Farmers' Union of England
and Wales, backed the Commission's plea. &quot;Beef farmers are finding
it hard enough just now without having to come up with extra money. I met
a farmer the other day who had received no income since May due to the
beef crisis and there are plenty of others like him.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
About 130 British beef exporters were represented at yesterday's show -
even though they had no beef to sell. Nevertheless, most were in optimistic
mood. Ian Smith, export sales executive of McIntosh Donald of Portlethen,
near Aberdeen, said: &quot;We have been keeping in close touch with our
continental customers since the beef crisis broke.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The French would have our beef back tomorrow if they could. They
are complaining that they cannot get alternative supplies of the right
quality of beef.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
‘ A Liberal Democrat MP has reacted angrily to the disclosure that most
beef given to Armed Forces personnel is not British.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Wallace, MP for Orkney and Shetland, said military chiefs must change
their purchasing policy in the light of a written parliamentary answer
which revealed that most beef eaten by the forces comes from South America
or Eastern Europe.<BR>

</FONT><B>French importers called on the Scottish
Office yesterday to lift BSE restrictions on an abattoir which have halted
their lamb supplies</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The Edinburgh abattoir belongs to Scotch Premier Meat - part of the ANM
Group - which supplies specially prepared lamb for the French market. The
plant was forced to stop exporting lamb eight days ago because it also
kills cattle which are being destroyed under emergency measures to restore
confidence in beef.<BR>
<BR>
The Scottish Office said the lamb must be processed in a separate plant
- even though the abattoir is designed so that the sheep and cattle do
not have any contact with each other. Yesterday, French importers were
lining up to sign a letter asking the Scottish Office to change its mind.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="#009F00">By Alison Maitland in Paris<BR>
<BR>
Financial Times ... Tuesday October 22 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>There cannot have been a worse year to promote British meat abroad.
But the UK meat industry yesterday staged a nimble double act at the Sial
international food fair in Paris as it struggled gamely to overcome its
difficulties.<BR>
<BR>
Downstairs at the Meat and Livestock Commission's stand in the fresh food
hall, Mr Colin Capon, a freelance chef from East Sussex, was regaling a
polyglot audience with a demonstration of British lamb and pork cuisine.
The absence of beef, because of the European Union's export ban, was cheerfully
passed over.<BR>
<BR>
Upstairs, meanwhile, Mr Don Curry, chairman of the meat commission, was
arguing forcefully for a &pound;17m injection of funds from the government
and the EU for a promotional campaign to restore British beef to its former
glory - and in the bargain to save billions of Ecus on beef stockpiling.<BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;No individual food item has faced the mammoth
challenge that the beef industry faces now,&quot; said Mr Curry. &quot;We
can't accept that our industry is going to shrink by 20 per cent for ever.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>Before the BSE crisis broke seven months ago, the commission
spent &pound;6m a year on beef promotion. Beef also features in a generic
television and magazine meat advertising campaign by the commission that
costs up to &pound;20m a year. The industry body is funded by levies on
farmers and slaughterers and fees from commercial service companies.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Curry, calling for &pound;15m from the government over two years and
a further &pound;2m from the EU, said that beef promotion since the crisis
had &quot;drained the coffers&quot; and that substantial new funding was
needed for advertising. &quot;We need to mount a heavyweight campaign.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He admitted it might be difficult persuading the government. In June, the
Treasury blocked a request for &pound;1.5m towards the commission's new
quality mince scheme. Mr Curry said that promotion had helped to halve
the 40 per cent drop in retail mince sales immediately following the &quot;<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad
cow</FONT></B>&quot; crisis - but said consumer awareness was still not
high enough.<BR>
<BR>
Encouraging consumption, he said, was a better approach than stockpiling
beef in EU intervention stores, at an expected cost to EU taxpayers over
the next two years of nearly Ecu2.5bn. Consumer demand for traceable meat
meant that much of this beef would never find a market.<BR>
<BR>
The Scotch Premier Meat stand was notable for its lack of prime beef. But
Mr Brian Noble, sales manager, was there to keep the lines open to customers
in Italy, France, the Netherlands and Belgium.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They say they would buy our beef tomorrow, if they could,&quot; he
said.<BR>

<CENTER><H3>Housecats  <A NAME="rendered">rendered</A> to pet food may recycle BSE</H3>
</CENTER><A HREF="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~listserv/archive/BSE-L.html">Listserve 10.23.96</A> 
<P>

Assuming that a tiny fraction of cats with BSE-FSE ever get diagnosed as such (vestibular disorder more likely, no diagnosis at all likliest), there would be a potential for re-cycling the disease should these infected cats be non-discriminately rendered for pet food:

From Summer 1996 Earth Island Journal v11, #3 pg 27-31:
<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The rendering plant floor is piled high with raw product.  Thousands of dead dogs and cats; head and hooves from cattle, sheep, pigs and horses; whole skunks; rats and raccoons -- all waiting to be processed.  In the 90-degree heat, the piles of dead animals seem to have a life of their own as millions of maggots swarm over the carcassess."<P>

"Rendering polants process decomposing animal carcasses, large roadkill and euthanized dogs and cats into a dry protein product that is sold in the pet food industry. One small plant in Quebec, Ontario renders 22,000 pounds of dogs and cats per week... The fur is not removed and dead animals are cooked together with viscera, bones and fat at 115 C for 20 minutes."<P>

"Each year in the US, 286 rendering plants quietly dispose of more than 12,500,000 tons of dead animals, fat and meat wasts. ... Baltimore's Valley Proteins "hogger" vat contained an eclectic mix of body parts ranging from dead dogs, cats, raccoons, possums, deer, foxes, snakes, a baby circus elephant, and a police quarterhorse.... In an average year, Baltimore's pound hands over 21,888 dead animals to Valley Proteins [which] sells inedible animal parts and rendered material to Alpo, Heinz, and Ralston-Purina [US pet food manufactureres]"<P>

"Valley Protein maintains two production lines -- one for clean meat and bons and a second line for dead pets and wildlife.  However, VP President Smith reported, that the [final] protein material is a mix from both production lines.  Thus the meat and bone meal made at the plant includes materials from pets and wildlife, and are about five percent of that product goes to dry-pet-food manufacturers."</BLOCKQUOTE>

What are the practises for disposing of dead cats in Britain?

<HR width = 55%><CENTER><H3>Still legal to produce pet food containing MBM in the UK</H3>
</CENTER>London Correspondent 10.21.96
<P>

It is still legal to produce pet food containing MBM in the UK.: Quotation from CHRON.HTM, the official MAFF BSE chronology which can be
located on the <A HREF="http://www.open.gov.uk/maff/bse/bseindx.htm">MAFF website</A>:


29 March 1996<BR> 
                The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (Amendment) Order 1996
(SI 1996  No 962) prohibits the sale or supply of any mammalian meat
and bone meal,  or any feeding stuff known to include mammalian meat and
bone meal, for the   purpose of feeding to farm animals, including horses and
farmed fish. This  requirement was introduced on the advice of the independent
Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.<P>

Mammalian meat and bone meal may not be fed to farmed animals including
horses and fish, so it CAN still be fed to domestic animals, pets,
fox-hounds, zoo animals, birds of prey in captivity, and anything else not
on a farm. <P>

Quotation from the UK BSE eradication submission to the EU, which is also
available on the MAFF website:<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Para 6.9.5. From 29 March 1996 the sale or supply of mammalian meat and
bone meal for feeding or for incorporation into feed for any farmed
livestock, fish or equine animal was prohibited, as was  the incorporation
of mammalian meat-and-bone meal into any carnivore diet  if livestock feed
is produced on the same premises.  In addition to the set schedule and in
order to ensure compliance with the new legislation, all 160 mills were
visited on 29 or 30 March to discuss the implementation of the new
legislation and all were visited again between 4 and 30 April to collect
samples. Contamination of poultry meat and bone meal  with apparent
mammalian material was suspected on one premises, samples taken at the time
and since have proven to be positive.  Investigations into this mill and
the supplier of the meat and bone meal are in progress; a prosecution may
follow.</BLOCKQUOTE>

The key phrase is "..... prohibited, as was the incorporation of mammalian
meat-and-bone meal into any carnivore diet if livestock feed is produced on
the same premises", so mammalian meat and bone meal CAN still be
incorporated into carnivore feed as long as livestock feed ISN'T produced
on the same premises. <P>

To summarise, it is still legal to produce animal feed containing mammalian
meat and bone meal and it is still legal to feed it to anything except farm
animals, horses, and farmed fish. Horses are included, of course, because
we export them for the frogs to eat. I'm afraid Rover and Tiddles are
practically certain to be eating stuff which is now banned from the human
food chain.

</CENTER><A HREF="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~listserv/archive/BSE-L.html">Listserve 10.20.96</A>
 Another potential question for cat-owners:  do you still use a household
 kitchen utensil for dishing out catfood as before and how do you wash it.

<P>
This query makes me go pale! How many of us use a kitchen
knife, or spoon or fork to dish out petfood which contains meat (and
brain ?).  Bloody hell, I do it all the time, and merely wash the
spoon/fork/knife, as for kitchen cutlery. This gives me nightmares, but my (I know, most unhygienic)
practice will cease forthwith.

<P>

Since only the UK has BSE and since all infected MBM has been removed
from all food chains one need worry no more. Anyway if I were you, I would worry not about microscopic traces left on
washed kitchen utensils but about dry dogfood that contains MBM since
it's easy to inhale dusty MBM (I mean 'gravy') when feeding your
pooch. Strange though that dogs, which have consumed vast quantities of MBM in
petfoods, never once succumbed to a TSE. Unlike cats.


<CENTER><H3>Out of <A NAME="Africa">Africa</A>: new theory for BSE origins</H3>
</CENTER><A HREF="http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~listserv/archive/BSE-L.html">Listserve 10.21.96</A>
The UK may have imported
significant quantities of MBM from Africa in the 80's. BSE has
never been seen in cattle worldwide without a UK link  so it is not an indiginous disease of domestic
cattle. The greatest variety of cattle species in the greatest number of
ecological niches is Africa. We know that at least one African bovine,
greater kudu, is very very suceptible to BSE with a 12 to 18 month
gestation period between infection and clinical disease. <P>

Now even nicer is that one can easily postulate a good reason for an
apparently detrimental disease to be good news for a migrant herd of
cattle in Africa. Good enough to maintain the 'bad genes' that promote
suceptibility or easy spread of BSE. As the herds migrate from one
grazing area to another they pass through the territories of resident
big cats. These big cats usually time their breeding to coincide with
the arrival of the herds and they are very hungry when they arrive.
Since cats are actually not very good at catching their prey the result
ought to be that the herds are chased around by the hungry cats all day
and all night and so would have inadequate time to feed and chew the
cud. Any farmer will confirm that this takes the majority of the day if
the cattle are to thrive. <P>

How useful it would be if one percent of the herd, upon being stirred up
by a hungry lion, would show inco-ordination and spasticity enough for a
lion to spot and so be selected for a ready, quick and easy kill (ie
*classic* BSE symptoms). One wildebeast carcass keeps a pride of lions
quiet for the rest of the day allowing the herds to graze in peace. So a
short burst of running, a quick kill, and ideal conditions for a
peaceful graze for the rest of the day for all the other ruminants.
Since one will get caught eventually anyway, the herd has actually lost
nothing, and gained a great deal.<P>

And if the wildebeast can arrange (and evolution produces amazing
things) that the TE they carry is particularly infective to big cats,
well they win both ways. <P>
<HR width = 55%>
Where did this African MBM came from? <P>
<HR width = 55%>
It was not given, This was some years ago and when MBM was identified as
the most likely source of transmission. It was commented that MBM comes
from all over the world and some examples of sources were given. One was
57,000 tonnes from 'Africa'.  Presumably a search through dock records (eg Southampton) could confirm this.<P>

Would any slaughterhouses or abattoirs in East Africa  have been big enough for an economical production of
MBM? Any country with a well developed ranged cattle
industry would have adequate amounts of raw materials to justify a MBM
plant, certainly near ports. World protein prices
were very high around 1980, and I would have thought it would have been
economical to produce and export this product. Indeed given the ease by
which wildlife protein (normally unsalabe in the West) could be
converted into cash by this method, makes it perhaps more plausible.
Small scale plants are easily made with rudimentary equipment. Basically
it's only shred/boil/(sun)dry, and it's not very hard to organise
collection.
<HR width = 55%>
But reverting to your interesting postulate about felines and TE
trannsmission; indeed, whilst staying out in the bush for months on end, I
observed many times over, that either very young newborns, or grown up but
suffering from ataxia's of unknown etiology were the preferred prey of
hunting groups of lion.
<HR width = 55%>
To be truthful I have heard this said on wildlife films. The assumption
being that parasitic worms of some unknown description were responsible.
It could, of course, be that the wild form of BSE is also a cause for
this along the lines I suggested.

<CENTER><H3>Chronic Wasting Disease: Research <A NAME="Directions">Directions</A></H3>
</CENTER>
<PRE>22 Oct 1996
<A HREF="mailto:jmiller@nadc.ars.usda.gov">Dr. Janice M. Miller</A> 
Ames Iowa Research Station</PRE>


The scrapie project here has 2 primary aims
at this time.  The first is to do transmission experiments.  Dr. Cutlip previously <B>inoculated cattle with
U.S. sheep scrapie</B>.  He has subsequently done a second passage
(cattle to cattle) and got exactly the same syndrome, i.e., clinical signs
unlike BSE (lethargy and ataxia), no histological lesions of BSE, and
accumulation of the abnormal prion protein only within neurons.  He also
tried to transmit the disease to mice by intracerebral inoculation but that
was not successful.  We know the mice were susceptible because
inoculation with the original sheep scrapie brain (the same that was used
to inoculate cattle) produced typical scrapie lesions and prion protein
staining by immunohistochemistry.  So, that aspect of "bovine scrapie"
also differs from BSE.

The next experiments planned will focus on Chronic Wasting Disease. 
We plan to inoculate several different species (not determined as yet, but
we have never discussed inoculation of pigs or chickens) intracerebrally
to see what the transmission potential of that disease is and to discover
what the disease will look like if it is transmitted.   We got such a surprise
with the scrapie to cattle experiment that we don't presume to anticipate
what the results might be.

The second focus of research is being conducted by Dr. Mary Jo
Schmerr,  a biochemist.  She is working on use of the
<B>capillary electrophoresis technique for detection of prion protein</B>.  She
has perfected the technique but the problem remains of preparing the
specimen for examination.  Currently she is using the same procedure
used to extract prion protein for the western blot technique.  That method
is cumbersome, time consuming and expensive, which is very limiting for
application on a large scale.  Her objective is to develop a procedure that
could be applied to examination of various products and tissues.  Even if
she is successful we don't see much chance for an antemortem
application because the problem is accessing a tissue that has prion
protein.   In sheep the lymphoid tissue is a possibility but the practicality in
a field situation is questionable (in my opinion).<P>

 With regard to the <B>tonsil biopsy</B> issue, we have not attempted that
method.  However, I have been doing immunohistochemistry on
specimens collected by 2 other research groups.  In general, the results
are disappointing because most of the specimens have not contained
lymphoid tissue so can't be interpreted.  It appears that biopsy of
pharyngeal tonsil is an expertise that only the Dutch have at the moment. 
Palatine tonsil is easy to obtain after death but I think it would be
impossible to biopsy because the location would be inaccessible in a live
animal (sheep or cow).  One pathologist finally blocked in the whole area
of pharyngeal tonsil, from a dead animal, and he told me that even then
the amount of lymphoid tissue is minimal, so we are not too excited at
present about the future of tonsil biopsy as an antemortem test.  Perhaps
with proper instruction, though, it would be more successful.

<P>
<B>Transmission of CWD to ferret, mule deer, mink, ferrets, goat and squirrel monkey. </B>

 Dr. Elizabeth Williams, who authored the
original descriptions of this disease in mule deer and in elk, indicated that deer-to-ferret occurs.  At a meeting
in Colorado  last year she discussed experimental transmissions and
said the disease went into mule deer, mink, ferrets, and squirrel monkey. 
he mule deer work was probably done at Colorado and the other animals
were likely inoculated by Dr. Richard Marsh at Wisconsin.  They
also had transmission to one goat  but the incubation period was 6 years.  In contrast, the intraspecies transmission to mule deer took only 18 months.

To our knowledge
these trials have not been done.

<B>Presence of the 14-3-3 protein in CSF of cattle.</B>  <BR>
Tthe
bovine samples mentioned in Harrington's article were supplied by the ARS
research group at Pullman, WA, because Dr. Cutlip told me he had not
sent NIH any samples from our cattle, although he had collected some
material for that purpose.  It wouldn't be surprising
for the cattle inoculated with TME to be positive for the protein because
they certainly have classical lesions.  The article mentions a positive
result in 1 animal that had clinical signs but no characteristic lesions and I
assume that was the scrapie animal referred to.  If that sample came
from Dr. Robinson at Pullman, it was probably one of the cattle he
inoculated with "bovine scrapie" brain from an experiment done many
years ago but only recently published (Clark et al, Am J Vet Res
56:606-612, 1995). 
<P>
 That first sheep to cattle experiment was similar to
Dr. Cutlip's, with a similar outcome, although less overall succes (only 3
of 10 inoculates developed clinical signs).  It wasn't published at the time
because no one believed the cattle could develop clinical CNS disease
without classical scrapie histopathology.  Later, with the prion protein as
a marker, the transmission was verified.   We know that Dr. Robinson
also has inoculated cattle with sheep scrapie and he could have sent the
NIH people some CSF from one of those.  
<P>
We have not seen any
pathology reports on the cattle he inoculated with the sheep scrapie
material so I can't comment on whether or the cattle had typical spongiform lesions
or not.  Dr. Robinson inoculated some cattle using brains from 3 of the
same sheep used by Dr. Cutlip but he also inoculated some other cattle
with material from different sheep that were obtained locally.  We've
seen unconfirmed reports by Dr. Robinson that some of the cattle in his
experiments had typical BSE lesions.  However, the paper hasn't been
written so we don't know if the communication between Dr. Hadlow (the
pathologist) and Dr. Robinson was accurate. 
<P>
 Dr. Robinson is now in
Austria so publication of the work has been delayed and at this point we
aren't really sure what happened.  It will be important to find out whether
there are some strains of U.S. scrapie that produce typical BSE and
some that don't.  Right now some people are assuming that results of the
U.S. experiments can be extrapolated to the stuation in England and are
concluding that BSE didn't come from scrapie. <B> That conclusion seems
premature in my opinion.</B>  The first experiment was done with two sources
of material, one scrapie sheep and <B>one goat that had contracted scrapie
by contact with sheep.</B>  Dr. Cutlip used a pool of 9 sheep brains for his
experiment, although only 6 were later verified as scrapie cases.

It would be surprising to find the 14-3-3 protein in CSF of
"bovine scrapie" cases, when neuronal damage is not apparent. 
However, we do see massive accumulation of the prion protein inside of
neurons in these  animals, so there could be significant damage occuring
that is not detected by routine histopathological observation.  Regarding
the question of pathology in Dr. Robinson's TME inoculates, as I
understand it the pathology was the same as that reported by Dr. Marsh
in his cattle.  Dr. Hadlow has stated, however, that in his opinion the
lesions produced in cattle by TME are even more severe than those of
BSE.  He spent 6 months in England studying BSE so I think his
observation has merit.
<P>
<B> References for CWD. </B> <BR>
There are an additional 3 articles published by Dr. Williams.  The first 2 are the
original descriptions (mule deer in 1980 and elk in 1982).  The other
article, which is a review of the disease, appeared in Rev. sci. tech. Off.
int. Epiz. 11:552-567, 1992.  <B>Another paper will appear in the Journal of
Wildlife Diseases in January, 1997, by Dr. Terry Spraker</B>, et al.  It
describes the occurrence of CWD in free-ranging cervidae of Colorado
and Wyoming.   That information has not been published previously,
although Dr. Williams alludes to it in her 1992 article.  I only know about it
because I did the immunohistochemistry as part of the confirmation
process.

It has now been six months since a British government report suggested 
that mad cow disease -- a disease prevalent in British beef -- could be 
transmissible to humans.  This initiated a media frenzy which crippled 
the British beef industry and sparked questions regarding the safety of 
the food supply throughout the world.  This frenzy has escalated to 
become 3the biggest crisis the European Union had ever had according 
to European Commissioner for agriculture Franz Fischler.
<P>
        However, few people challenged the veracity of the claims or the 
quality of evidence.  While the British government tried to calm such 
food-related fears, a ban on British beef products was proclaimed by the 
European Union.  European domestic politics interceded.  The result -- a 
British blockade of legislation and a threat to leave the European 
Union.  Negotiation focused on doing something  -- rather than doing the 
right thing.  
<P>
        Now, new evidence has surfaced, including a University of Oxford
study 
focusing on the decreasing prevalence of BSE in cattle further weakening 
any potential link to humans. 
        This issue highlights the difficulty of accurately communicating
and 
disseminating health information.   Even today, years since public 
discussion began on BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and a 
microscopically similar disease in humans CJD (Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
Disease), misinformation continues to dominate the discourse.  The power 
of the rhetorical repetition of BSE as simply mad cow disease 
permeates the public minds fostering an erroneous conclusion that humans 
will get  it from ingesting meat from cows or sheep/lamb.
<P>

        Different groups shirk responsibility.  The medical community
calls mad  cow disease a veterinary issue.  The veterinarians say it is a 
government/public health issue.  The government, having no clear 
communication strategy, acknowledges it as a scientific dilemma and 
blames the media.  The media is keen to report it while the political
and 
medical reporters vie to write the lead story. All this makes good
news.  
<P>
        Yet, U.K. and Swiss farmers watch as their herds are untimely
culled and 
beef demand diminished.  At the same time, French cattle farmers blocked 
roads and marched their 3healthy2 cattle around the Eiffel Tower in 
protest of policy and the falling demand and price of beef.
        Today, there are fewer mad cows since the governmental report
was 
released, but the same mystery shrouds the unaccountable human deaths. 
<P> 
Europeans are consuming one-third less beef, while the verifiable facts 
suggest only cows die of Mad Cow Disease.  There has yet to be a single 
documented case of CJD - the purported human equivalent  - from 
ingesting meat from beef, lamb or related dairy products.  (Similarly, 
the theorized infectious agent in cattle -- a prion -- has never been 
identified in any meat for human consumption.)
<P>
        Nonetheless, earlier this summer in the United States, the
Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (the CDC), in an effort to assuage 
concern that this could happen in the United States, issued a statement 
heralded in a lead in the nation1s paper of record in the New York 
Times: There is no evidence that anyone in the United States has died 
of the mad cow disease that has killed eight people in Britain, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today. [emphasis
added]   
<P>

Of course, this similar statement could be made anywhere in the world, 
given its inaccurate implication of causation.  The only proven 
victims of BSE/mad cow disease are the cattle they infect, as the 
pejorative name suggests.
        Unfortunately, discovery of information, specifically scientific
and 
medical breakthroughs, does not occur overnight in a way that fits into 
neatly succinct stories or soundbites preferred by the popular media. 
<P>
        Although there has been a four-fold increase in medically
related news 
during the past two decades news in the New York Times, we are all 
limited on where to find the best and most accurate information.  The 
25,000 scientific/medical journals published throughout the world do not 
inform each of us, nor do our health care providers as we continue to 
get about 85% of our health information from non-medical sources.  
<P>
        As we rely upon government to provide accurate health
information, the 
reality is that we have a knowledge deficit.  Instead, tabloid 
television, talk shows and other forms of infotainment fill the 
knowledge gap with their own kind of substance abuse. What gets lost is 
the public's right to know the facts, prior to acceptance of fallacious 
claims that grab attention but fail to meet the test of sound logic.  
The result is an absence of public confidence.
<P>
        Suffice it to say, all hold fast to the ideal that to make the
best 
decisions in health and other vital areas of life, we need accurate 
information presented to us objectively and ethically.  Advocating such 
an outlook unites all of us dedicated to the art of effective health 
communication.
        Absent clear leadership from government, we have no choice but
to hope 
the media and all those who are involved in discovery and dissemination 
of health related information can rise to the task and serve as an 
ethical compass in helping the public digest such material as part of 
our daily diet. 
<P>
        If neither the government nor the media begin to think of the 
consequences of the current laissez-faire approach to communicating 
health, a similar disaster lurks on the horizon.

The Times ... October 23 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Up to 2,000 farmers will gather in London today to bring their grievances
to the attention of MPs at the State Opening of Parliament.<BR>
<BR>
A rally at Central Methodist Hall, followed by a lobby of the House of
Commons, will reflect the mood triggered by what farmers see as <B>inept
handling of the BSE crisis</FONT></B>. In recent weeks rural protesters
disrupted the Tory party conference in Bournemouth and the police had to
rescue Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, and William Hague, the Welsh
Secretary, from angry farmers.<BR>
<BR>
Martin Howlett, who keeps about 150 beef cattle at Deer Park Farm at Luckett,
Cornwall, was in Bournemouth and plans to be in London today. &quot;Farmers
have always grumbled but usually to each other in the pub or at market,&quot;
he said. &quot;Taking to the streets is not the first thing we think of,
unlike the French. We prefer to talk through prob lems but <B>desperation
is setting in</FONT></B>.&quot; Anger is strongest among beef farmers,
such as Mr Howlett, who feel they are being punished for a problem not
of their making. He has not had a single case of BSE, essentially an affliction
of dairy herds, but has been hit by low prices just the same.<BR>
<BR>
Feelings are running particularly high in southwest England, where cattle
are the lifeblood of farming. It is also the region with the biggest backlog
of cattle over 30 months old awaiting slaughter and incineration because
they are deemed to be at higher risk of developing BSE.<BR>
<BR>
Farmers like Mr Howlett are, for the most part, lifelong Tory voters but
say they will not turn out at the next election. Sir Robert Hicks, the
retiring Tory MP for Cornwall South East, said: &quot;I have warned the
Prime Minister that there are up to eight marginal Tory seats of an essentially
rural character in the West Country south of Bristol where a swing of 5
per cent or less would be enough for them to change hands.&quot; Sir Robert's
seat, which would be vulnerable to a 6.5 per cent swing, might not be safe.<BR>
<BR>
The National Farmers' Union said yesterday that 60,000 hill farmers were
suffering dramatic income losses because of the effect of BSE. Farmers
were being forced to market their cattle for up to 30 per cent less than
a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
Kevin Pearce, the NFU's northeast regional policy adviser, said: &quot;In
early sales, hill farmers have been selling steers and heifers for fattening
for between &pound;325 and &pound;400 a head, which is up to <B>&pound;150
less than last year</FONT></B>.&quot; Cattle sold for slaughter are fetching
between &pound;425 and &pound;500, compared with up to &pound;675 last
autumn. Farmers with cattle over the age of 30 months, which can no longer
be sold for food, are facing even sharper price falls.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Cattle <A NAME="cull">cull</A> backlog bigger than
forecast</H3>
By Maggie Urry 
Financial Times ... Friday September 27 1996<BR>
<BR>
The government admitted that the backlog
of cattle awaiting slaughter under its scheme to eradicate BSE,
or mad cow disease, appears &quot;substantially&quot;
higher than earlier estimates of about 180,000.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Roger Freeman, the public services minister, said the revised
estimate was so high that the &quot;figure
does not seem credible&quot;. He added: &quot;The emergency
continues. It seems to be worse than we forecast.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Freeman declined to reveal details of the estimate, derived from a survey
of farmers. However, trade estimates suggest that the backlog may be as
high as 300,000.<BR>
<BR>
More than 550,000 cattle have been killed since
May, when the government began killing cattle over 30 months
old in an attempt to eliminate bovine spongiform
encephalopathy from the national herd.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Freeman, who is in charge of the cull programme, said that the government
was thinking of increasing the rate of culling by contracting
refrigerated ships to provide storage space for carcases.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Freeman said the government was considering accepting National Farmers'
Union proposals for a queuing system for cattle going to slaughter.<BR>
<BR>
He added that the government's target of clearing the backlog by Christmas
was still achievable. Officials will spend the next few days trying to
understand the reasons for the size of the new estimate.<BR>
<BR>
The rate at which animals are being slaughtered has increased from 23,000
a week in mid-August to 35,000 this week. It is expected to rise to 55,000
a week.<BR>
<BR>
There is evidence that the increase in
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the
degenerative brain condition which has been linked to BSE, may well be
real rather than simply the result of doctors looking more carefully for
it, a study by the Office of National Statistics suggested. Cases of CJD
have risen from about 20 to 30 a year in the early
1980s to the 30 to 50 range since 1989.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Farms face sharp <A NAME="fall">fall</A> in profits</H3>
By David Brown, Agriculture Editor<BR>
<BR>
Daily Telegraph ... Friday 27 September 1996<BR>
<BR>
Farmers were told yesterday to &quot;plan
for leaner times&quot; as their profits looked set to fall over
the next few months from last year's record levels.<BR>
<BR>
The beef crisis, falling world prices
for grain and proposed cuts in EU subsidies were blamed. The accountants
Deloitte and Touche Agriculture said the money-spinning days that had boosted
farming fortunes since 1992 were coming to an end. Profits were expected
to fall by more than two-thirds this year to an average of &pound;42 an
acre.<BR>
<BR>
This compares with record average profits of &pound;145 an acre achieved
last year with high prices for cereals, potatoes and other vegetables.
This was 29 per cent better than the previous year. The beef, dairy and
sheep sectors also performed well. Profits were
boosted handsomely by EU subsidies, mainly in the arable sector.<BR>
<BR>
The company said this performance was due to an exceptional combination
of circumstances and was &quot;unlikely to be repeated&quot;. These conditions
produced record overall UK farm profits of &pound;4 billion, &pound;1 billion
higher than the 1994 figure. The amounts are based on the accounts of some
of the firm's best farming clients, covering more than 200,000 acres of
farmland in England and Wales.<BR>
<BR>
Vincent Hedley Lewis, national partner at Deloitte and Touche Agriculture,
said farmers would have to cut their production costs further and &quot;plan
for an increasingly volatile world where prices and political decisions
can reduce profits&quot;. The impact of the beef crisis on beef and dairy
farms had to be taken into account, he said. Wheat and barley prices could
fall by 15 per cent due to large harvests.<BR>
<BR>
If the EU carried out its threat to reduce arable area subsidies by seven
per cent and overall costs rose by three per cent, as expected, this would
hit profits. The National Farmers' Union of England and Wales was in broad
agreement with the figures yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
John Malcolm, chief economic adviser of the NFU, said: &quot;The
livestock sector alone has been severely affected this year.
A lot of beef cattle are produced on dairy farms
and so there has been an impact there. Potatoes which were fetching
&pound;200 a ton at the farm gate this time last year are now selling for
about &pound;60 a ton. That's a big drop.&quot;<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>More cold storage sought in BSE
cull</H3>
by Valerie Elliott, Whitehall Editor<BR>
<BR>
The Times ... September 27 1996<BR>
<BR>
The Government is urgently considered hiring
freezer ships and more cold-storage warehouses to clear the 200,000-plus
backlog in the battle against BSE.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Freeman, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, admitted yesterday
that the Government was failing to meet its targets
for the cattle cull. Delays have been caused by the shortage
of cold-storage space to house the unrendered cattle carcasses before incineration.<BR>
<BR>
The Intervention Board has now drawn up a list of free refrigerated space
throughout the country and is negotiating the
possible lease of at least two refrigerated ships. Last night
a Whitehall source sug gested that one ship might be docked in Belfast
harbour and another at docks within easy reach of the South West of England.<BR>
<BR>
Last night Mr Freeman declined to reveal the precise
figure of the backlog, but it is &quot;substantially
higher&quot; than the previous backlog
of 180,000. Sir David Naish,
NFU president, said the NFU had always been concerned that the Government
was underestimating the backlog.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Government target for a UK throughput of 40,000 cattle a week
by mid-October must be increased substantially &shy; and earlier &shy;
by using every possible means of cold storage and direct incineration.
Red tape and lengthy environmental assessments
must not stand in the way of greater efficiency.&quot;<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>England's farmers harvest record
profit</H3>
by Jon Ashworth<BR>
<BR>
The Times ... September 27 1996<BR>
<BR>
Farmers in England have just closed their books on their most
profitable year, thanks to a combination of high prices for produce,
world shortages and EU aid payments. But celebration would be premature:
the bad news is, it is all downhill from here.<BR>
<BR>
Plummeting wheat and potato prices, and a slump
in beef sales, are set to take their toll of farming profits
this year, according to a study by Deloitte &amp; Touche, the accountant.
But conditions are still better than in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
when agriculture came under severe pressure.<BR>
<BR>
Last year, average net farm income increased 29 per cent to a record &pound;363
a hectare, Deloitte &amp; Touche found. Income ranged from &pound;717 a
hectare, for the most profitable farms, down to &pound;104 a hectare.<BR>
<BR>
Much of the gain was through sharply improved prospects for wheat and other
combinable crops, which account for 62 per cent of typical farm production
in England. Grazing land, mainly dairy farming, accounts for about 14 per
cent.<BR>
<BR>
David Turner, a senior manager with Deloitte &amp; Touche Agriculture at
Cambridge, said world grain shortages and high oilseed prices had fuelled
farming incomes. The pound's weakness had made British produce more attractive
to overseas buyers.<BR>
<BR>
The figures do not include the impact of the BSE
scare, which struck late in March, close to the end of farmers'
financial years. The dairy sector had a &quot;pretty good&quot; year, helped
by higher milk prices, while sheep and pigs had shown an improvement.<BR>
<BR>
Disappointing world grain harvests had boosted sales of wheat, the UK's
biggest crop. China showed a huge upturn in demand.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Turner said better farm management played a big part in the gains.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Farmers 'betrayed' by <A NAME="cut">cut</A> in payouts for cattle cull</CENTER></H3>

By David Brown, Agriculture Editor Electronic Telegraph
<P>

FARMERS accused the Government of "betrayal and incompetence" over the beef crisis yesterday after the EU cut 10 per cent off their compensation for culled cattle at Britain's request.<p>
 The cut, approved by the EU Commission's beef management committee in Brussels, will save the Treasury millions of pounds a year on the bill for the destruction of all cattle more than 30 months old. The operation was designed to reassure consumers that no beef infected with mad cow disease will enter the food chain.<p>
 It means that farmers expecting £500 for a slaughtered animal will get £450. Since March 550,000 cattle have been killed under the scheme, more than double the number expected by the Government. Although the EU meets about 70 per cent of the cost of this cull - which is separate from the "selective" cull of up to 147,000 allegedly high risk animals which was suspended by the Government last week - Britain pays more than 50 per cent because some costs are deducted from its EU rebates. <p>
 Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales, protested about the cut to the Prime Minister and to Douglas Hogg, Minister of Agriculture. Relations are now at their lowest between farmers' leaders and the Government over the crisis. Sir David said: "Through no fault of their own, tens of thousands of farmers, holding back hundreds of thousands of cattle on their farms, not only face the mounting costs of winter feeding but also the prospect of lower returns when their cattle are finally slaughtered. Farmers will consider that betrayal has been added to incompetence." <p>
 Only 24 hours earlier Roger Freeman, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, admitted that the Government had got its sums wrong about the backlog of cattle awaiting destruction in the over-30 month scheme. The Government thought it was dealing with a backlog of 170,000 cattle - but the figure is nearer 450,000 according to informed sources.<p>

</CENTER>
THE INDEPENDENT 16 Oct 96     By ANTHONY BEVINS, Political Editor
<P>
 A change in government policy suggests that millions of British domestic
   cats are being fed BSE-contaminated food.

   A minister has announced a ban on all production of pet food in any building
   used for the manufacture of livestock feed.<P>

   Angela Browning, an agriculture minister, has confirmed to the Commons in a
   written reply that mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM) - powdered residue
   from culled and rendered cattle - is used in pet food. But she has also told
   Martyn Jones, a microbiologist and Labour MP: 'Because of our concerns that
   pet food containing MBM might present a possible risk of cross-contamination
   of livestock feed, new measures to prevent this were introduced on 1
   August.'<P>

   'The Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy order 1996 now prohibits the
   production of this material (pet food containing MBM) on the same premises
   as livestock feed unless this takes place in a separate building and there
   is no contact with equipment or vehicles used in the production of livestock
   feed'<P>

   Mr Jones said last night: 'This is an astounding revelation. This stuff is
   so risky that they are not even allowed to bury it. Instead, they are
   getting rid of it by passing it on to pet food manufacturers.
   'It is probably being used in every cat food, as a filler - duck, liver,
   tuna, you name it. The Government is quite clearly trying to get out of a
   hole by getting rid of it in this way.'<P>

   A Ministry of Agriculture spokesman said last night that there was no risk
   to household pets from MBM in pet food 'because they are meat-eaters'.
   But a Commons select committee investigation into BSE was told in April that 72
   cats had tested positive for a form of spongiform encephalopathy.<P>

   The committee was also told that while the high-risk specified bovine
   material - such as spinal cord - would be incinerated, 'sides of meat will
   be rendered into meat and bone meal which will then be disposed of, either
   by landfill or incineration.' There was no mention of MBM being used in pet
   food.<P>

   Mr Jones asked Mrs Browning earlier this week how much MBM from bovine
   sources was being used in pet food, and the minister told him that no
   figures were available. The spokesman said: 'You will have to ask the
   manufacturers.'<P>

   But the August ban on joint pet food and livestock feed manufacture also
   required 'that all movements and use of MBM have to be recorded and
   accompanied by appropriate documentation.'<P>

   Mr Jones said he was dismayed by the ministry response 'They have claimed
   from day one of this BSE crisis that it was caused by meat and bone meal. We
   also know that cats can be infected. He added: 'If the risk is so great, why
   are they feeding it to our pets?'<P>

   Pet food manufacturers denied yesterday that their products might be
   contaminated with BSE, but the MP who first raised the fears insisted that
   important safety questions had not been answered.
<P>

   The Pet Food Manufacturers' Association (PFMA), whose members sold a billion
   pounds' worth of cat and dog foods last year, said that the suggestion by
   MartynJones, a microbiologist and Labour MP, that BSE-infected 'meat and
   bone meal' (MBM) - produced from grinding down cattle carcasses - could end
   up in pet food was 'a misunderstanding'.<P>

   Anxious pet owners inundated the RSPCA and the PFMA with calls yesterday,
   seeking advice.

   Under a government order, pet food containing MBM may not be prepared on the
   same premises as food for cattle or sheep. But the Ministry of Agriculture,
   Fisheries and Food (Maff) said yesterday that this was done to avoid cattle
   being fed meat remains, and that it did not imply that MBM might be
   contaminated with BSE.<P>

   However, the measure has clearly been taken so that there is no possibility
   of BSE-infected products being passed back into cattle feed. This
   'recycling' is believed to have caused the original epidemic, which has so
   far led to almost 164,000 cases of BSE being diagnosed, and an estimated
   700,000 cattle which were developing the disease being passed as fit for
   human consumption. MBM is made from such cattle. The agent that causes BSE
   is not killed by the manufacturing process.<P>

   Dogs appear to be immune to BSE, but cats have developed a version, called
   feline spongiform encepalopathy (FSE). Since the first case was identified
   in 1990, 71 FSE cases have been reported, all in the UK. But there has been
   a sharp decline in cases: last year there were eight, but this year there
   has been just one. This fall mirrors the BSE epidemic, whichin 1992 saw
   36,000 cases in cattle. So far this year there have been 5,219 cases.<P>

   Mr Jones said yesterday that a number of questions remained unanswered about
   the material being used in petfood.

   'Some petfood representatives have said that I have accepted that I
   misunderstood the situation. That is not true. Having spoken to them, there
   are still questions to be answered.'

   Sir: If the mammalian meat and bone meal in cat food could pass BSE to

<P>

Sir: Dr Grant's letter (11 October) suggests that the Ministry has
   persistently refused to co-operate with Dr Narang on the development of
   tests for BSE. This is simply not true.<P>

   In 1990, Maff assisted Dr Narang with trials to validate a test on brain
   sections he had developed at that time. It was not taken any further because
   theresults did not show it to be significantly better than other tests
   already available.<P>

   Since then Dr Narang has developed a diagnostic test on urine for BSE. Far
   from refusing to co-operate with Dr Narang we are in discussion with him
   regarding a trial to see whether his new test works, under the scrutiny of
   an independent observer.

   We would hope to reach agreement with Dr Narang in the near future. The
   results of the trial should be published once complete.<P>

<BR>
</FONT><B>Cattle carcasses could be destroyed in
mobile microwave ovens</FONT></B>, according to plans being studied by
the Ministry of Agriculture as it attempts to stem the <B><bovine
spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B> epidemic.<BR>
<BR>
Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food officials are studying proposals
from BRC Environmental Services, of Hainault, Essex, that its &quot;<B>microwave-induced
pyrolysis</FONT></B>&quot; process could destroy carcasses on farms without
the risk of fumes escaping. The company believes its process, developed
over the last six years, could be more efficient than conventional incineration
techniques, according to a report in Professional Engineering magazine.<BR>
<BR>
The process is being examined by engineers at the Harper Adam college at
Newport, Shropshire, before the ministry decides to fund a pilot project.
Cavin McDonald, BRC's engineering director, said yesterday that the system,
&quot;a combination of a microwave and a pressure cooker&quot;, would raise
the temperature of the carcass in excess of 135C for more than 20 minutes.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It would be a high enough temperature to ensure that the prion protein
[thought to be responsible for BSE] would be destroyed,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
Water vapour would be distilled; methane gas given off could be burned
to provide electricity for the microwave; fats could be recycled and the
resultant carbon char could be safely deposited in landfills, Mr McDonald
said.<BR>
<BR>
The company has spent &pound;7 million developing technologies to recycle
waste, beginning with processes to retrieve oil from tyres. Dr Richard
Green of Harper Adam College, said yesterday: &quot;We believe the system
is reasonably likely to be successful, raising the temperature where all
organic material would be destroyed with no emissions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What we propose to do initially is to look at the technology BRC
are developing and see whether it can do what we would want it to. Then,
if Maff are prepared to fund it, we would build a pilot unit.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A ministry spokesman said: &quot;We have accepted a detailed proposal from
BRC and Harper Adam College and are considering it.&quot;<BR>

The Times ... October 19 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>John Major admitted yesterday that the Government's high borrowing
was a &quot;blot&quot; on the economic horizon in the clearest pointer
so far that he accepts substantial tax cuts will be impossible to achieve
in the Budget next month.<BR>
<BR>
The Prime Minister's public acknowledgement that the state of government
debt was &quot;a problem&quot; follows an even bleaker private assessment
by Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, at Thursday's Cabinet meeting. As Mr
Clarke called his Treasury team together for weekend talks at Dorneywood,
his official country residence, it emerged that he had warned Cabinet colleagues
that his options were severely circumscribed both by the size of the deficit
and the demands on spending budgets.<BR>
<BR>
With ministers anxious to avoid pre-election rows over cuts, the Chancellor
is understood to believe that only modest reductions in the levels of public
spending planned a year ago can be contemplated. That will disappoint the
Tory Right, which has been pressing for heavy cuts to fund a pre-election
tax bonanza.<BR>
<BR>
The Dorneywood gathering is expected to conclude that 1p is probably the
most that Mr Clarke will be able to afford to knock off income tax. He
has told colleagues that he cannot take risks with the financial allocations
to schools and the health service in the run-up to the election.<BR>
<BR>
Amid indications that discussions within the Cabinet's spending committee
have become tense and difficult, Mr Clarke's warning to the Cabinet during
a general discussion about the economy was said to have been firm. <B>The
BSE crisis had had a big impact on his room for manoeuvre, he said. It
has already taken &pound;1 billion off this year's spending contingency
reserve and will take at least the same next year.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>Lower tax revenues have meant that Mr Clarke's hopes of cutting
the budget deficit this year have not been realised. The deficit in the
first six months of the financial year was &pound;19.8 billion, after removing
privatisation proceeds, compared with &pound;20.1 billion last year.<BR>
<BR>
Although Mr Major delivered an optimistic message about the overall state
of the economy during talks with businessmen yesterday, he made plain that
he would not take any short-term risks that might accelerate a revival
of inflation.<BR>
<BR>
He said that inflation was &quot;as much under lock and key as I can ever
remember it&quot;. But he then added: &quot;The only economic blot on the
horizon is the size of the fiscal deficit. That is a problem.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>In the past ten years more than 150 thousand cows have developed
BSE (<B><bovine spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B>).
The vast majority of veterinary scientists and micro-biologists agree that
cattle developed this disease after eating cattle cake containing meat
and bone meal derived from sheep with scrapie &shy; a spongiform encephalopathy
known for at least 200 years. The disease had &quot;jumped the species
barrier&quot;. Which posed the question &shy; if it went from sheep to
cattle where else could it go?<BR>
<BR>
In April 1989 pet food makers stopped using offal that included potentially
infective BSE material. This specified bovine offal (SBO), which is brain,
spinal chord, spleen, thymus, tonsils and intestines, was banned from use
in human food in November 1989. Pets were protected before people. Before
1986, scientists and doctors recognised encephalopathies in mink and feline
SE has been found in 72 cats, all born prior to 1989. No one has found
encaphalopathy in dogs. A few zoo animals were infected, perhaps because
they were fed on infected sheep or cattle heads.<BR>
<BR>
Cattle cake may have transmitted BSE to elans, oryx and kudu &shy; relatives
of our domestic ruminants. All zoo animal infections also occurred before
1989, the critical year.<BR>
<BR>
Good quality dog or cat food from one of the &quot;big name&quot; manufacturers
is the best way of feeding your pet. That's what I am doing. Do it yourself
beef -free diets are quite likely to lead to deficiencies and create extra
problems.<BR>
<BR>
The BSE panic has made British beef the safest in the world &shy; whether
it is prime steak or something in a carton or can for your cat or dog.
The potentially suspect bits have been removed for incineration before
anybody &shy; human or pet &shy; gets near them. Beef used in pet foods
has to reach standards that would make it fit for human consumption.<BR>
<BR>
My dog is having canned food and her daily bone. I am eating beef &shy;
medium rare. Not as overdone as the BSE hysteria. Perhaps the best way
to restore confidence in British beef is to tell the rest of the world
&quot;if you want the best and safest beef, buy British.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>An Order preventing the heads of sheep and goats going into the
food chain will come into force on Sunday, 15 September 1996. The Heads
of Sheep and Goats Order 1996 will make it an offence to sell any part
of sheep or goat heads for human consumption. This is a precautionary measure
based on the advice of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee
(SEAC) which was announced on 24th July 1996. Over ninety nine per cent
of heads are already destroyed and do not go into the food chain.<BR>
<BR>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>
<BR>
Notes for Editors<BR>
<BR>
1. The Order will be made under the Animal Health Act 1981. It prohibits
the sale for human consumption of any part of a head of a sheep or goat,
and of food containing any part of such heads. It also prohibits the sale
of any part of such heads for use in the preparation of food for human
consumption, and the use of any part of such heads in the preparation of
food for human consumption.<BR>
<BR>
2. The heads are required to be removed immediately after slaughter and
stained with the dye Patent Blue (E131, 1971 Colour Index No. 42051). Removed
heads must be consigned to approved premises and disposed of as if they
were specified bovine material by rendering and incineration.<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>So many <B>dead cows are piling up</FONT></B>
under the Government's emergency measures to resolve the beef crisis that
ministers are having to <B>hire convoys of mobile
freezer lorries</FONT></B> to move them around the country.<BR>
<BR>
Up to <B>500</FONT></B> freezer containers will be
needed to hold about 25,000 dead cattle at any one time until rendering
plants can be found to destroy them. Each articulated container holds about
50 cows.<BR>
<BR>
The plan is to gather as many containers as possible in &quot;<B>secure
parking areas</FONT></B>&quot; and attach them to the mains to keep the
freezer units going, according to one senior Government official.<BR>
<BR>
Trials involving up to 50 freezer containers have already started around
Shrewsbury, Shropshire, and Bridlington, East Yorks.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, as the backlog of cattle more than 30 months old awaiting
slaughter mounts up on farms, the Government is close to signing a deal
to <B>charter two freezer ships to hold 15,000 tons
of beef</FONT></B> until this, too, can be incinerated.<BR>
<BR>
These ships are expected to be used to hold carcasses from Northern Ireland.<BR>
<BR>
So far, more than <B>560,000 cattle have been slaughtered</FONT></B>
under the cull of cattle more than 30 months old scheme designed to restore
consumer confidence in beef by removing all older animals from the food
chain.<BR>
<BR>
But <B>43,000 carcasses are stockpiled</FONT></B>
awaiting destruction in rendering plants that have been working flat-out
in a vain attempt to meet demand.<BR>
<BR>
Now storage space on land is running out, even though the Government is
spending hundreds of thousands of pounds converting grain stores in former
aircraft hangers into huge freezers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ministers thought they were faced with a backlog
of 170,000 animals awaiting slaughter</FONT></B> on farms - but <B>the
true figure is nearer 400,000</FONT></B>. The limits of the rendering plants
and the shortage of temporary storage space for the dead cattle threaten
the Government's plans to wipe out the backlog by more than <B>doubling
the current slaughter rate</FONT></B> from about 25,000 to 55,000 cattle
a week.<BR>
<BR>
‘ Nearly 85 per cent of dairy farmers want to go ahead as soon as possible
with the selective cattle cull halted by the Government a fortnight ago,

yesterday.<BR>

</FONT>Groupe Chez Gerard, the exclusive restaurant group, yesterday served
up a 23pc increase in full-year, pre-tax profits to &pound;2.86m. The group
has nine London restaurants so far and is to open another City outlet in
the spring.<BR>
<BR>
Refurbishment at three restaurants, plus preparation for the new opening,
has pushed capital expenditure over &pound;4m this year, which has been
funded without recourse to borrowing.<BR>
<BR>
Chairman Neville Abraham said the group was eyeing provincial cities such
as Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds for further outlets, as well as expanding
further through London.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Abraham and his co-founder Laurence Isaacson predicted turnover, currently
&pound;16.4m, would reach &pound;19m by next year, claiming: &quot;We are
the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Cameron Mackintosh of the restaurant business
- we've got nine successful shows running in the West End.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Faced with the</FONT></B> <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad

an aggressive marketing strategy, pushing its &quot;Carnivores' Club&quot;
for steak and chips connoisseurs. Mr Abraham said the club had been a success
and no one had cancelled through fear of BSE.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>The company says it caters for the Sinky and Dinky - single

Financial Times ... Tuesday October 1 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B>A tax on eating meat</FONT></B> has been
proposed by a leading US environmentalist as a way of releasing urgently
needed grain supplies for direct human consumption.<BR>
<BR>
The controversial proposal, in a new book by the Washington-based Worldwatch
Institute, is one of several radical ideas for resolving what is portrayed
as <B>an imminent crisis in world food supplies</FONT></B>
as the population burgeons.<BR>
<BR>
The book, Tough Choices, is the institute's contribution to the United
Nations World Food Summit in Rome in November.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Lester Brown, the author and president of the institute, says <B>world
grain stocks may continue to be dangerously low for some time</FONT></B>.
The only remaining big reserve is the 640m tonnes - or 36 per cent of the
world grain harvest - which is used as feed for livestock, poultry and
fish.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If the world's affluent cut their consumption of grain-fed livestock
products by 10 per cent, they could free up 64m tonnes of grain for direct
human consumption, enough to cover world population growth for some 27
months,&quot; says Mr Brown.<BR>
<BR>
A tax, he argues, would moderate grain price rises which can be life-threatening
for the world's poor.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Such a tax, unpopular though it would be, might be accepted if it
became the price for economic and political stability in the world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Brown's views are based on a <B>prediction that
the world is entering an era of food shortages</FONT></B>, as environmental
problems such as water and land shortages and global warming put severe
constraints on agricultural output.<BR>
<BR>
He is known as a pessimist in the world food debate; others argue that
food production will keep abreast of population growth in most regions
over the next 25 years.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Brown clashes with the World Bank and the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organisation, contending that their predictions of continued growth in
grain output have proved too optimistic in the past five years.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Nikos Alexandratos, head of global perspective studies at the FAO, responds
that production was disrupted by the break-up of the former Soviet Union,
volatile output in the US and set-aside policies in the European Union.
But these factors do not detract from FAO expectations of &quot;modest&quot;
output growth of 1.5 per cent a year to 2010, he said.<BR>
<BR>
Among Mr Brown's other suggestions is a &quot;stiff&quot; tax on converting
land out of crops. &quot;This would at least force those planning to use
highly productive cropland for industrial or residential construction to
weigh alternative sites seriously.&quot;<BR>

Daily Telegraph ... Thursday 3 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><B>Hundreds of angry farmers jostled Douglas
Hogg</FONT></B>, the Minister of Agriculture, yesterday in a protest against
the handling of the beef crisis.<BR>
<BR>
More than 200 beef producers <B>chanting &quot;Oggy,
oggy, oggy - out, out, out&quot;</FONT></B> vented their frustration about
delays in the Government's cattle cull and cuts in their compensation.<BR>
<BR>
At one stage the banner-waving crowd at the South West Dairy Show in Shepton
Mallet, Somerset, threatened to overwhelm Mr Hogg and his escort of ministry
and show officials. Police threw a cordon around Mr Hogg as one of the
farmers fell during the melee. <BR>
<BR>
Some producers <B>accused the minister of &quot;arrogance&quot;</FONT></B>
and called for his resignation for refusing to address the crowd after
meeting representatives of the National Farmers' Union and the Country
Landowners' Association for an update on the BSE crisis in the West Country.
Last week farmers accused the Government of &quot;betrayal&quot; for a
10 per cent cut in compensation for cattle killed under the cull. It means
that farmers expecting &pound;500 a cow will now receive &pound;50 less.<BR>
<BR>
The cut comes as the backlog of cattle builds up on farms. <B>The
backlog is about 450,000</FONT></B> - more than twice the Government estimated
number.<BR>
<BR>
So many cattle are awaiting destruction that the Government is running
out of cold stores to hold the carcases until they can be destroyed. <B>Ministers
plan to hire fleets of refrigerated container-lorries and two freezer-ships</FONT></B>
to cope.<BR>
<BR>
Anthony Gibson, a senior farming official at the meeting, said farmers
had put various points to Mr Hogg who had nothing to offer in reply.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The cut in the compensation added insult to incompetence,&quot; he
said. &quot;The scheme hasn't worked properly. There was fury in the air
at the show and I have not seen anything like it in 20 years with the NFU.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most of the farmers here would be lifelong Conservative voters and
not the sort of people you would expect to see marching up and down with
banners and jostling a minister of the Crown.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He declined our suggestion that he should address the crowd of farmers
outside to defuse the situation. As a result there was some jostling and
unpleasant scenes when he emerged with his police escort.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Gibson said the minister did not explain why he did not want to speak
to the farmers. &quot;It made things worse and added to the frustration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A ministry spokesman said last night: &quot;Mr Hogg was not assaulted during
his visit during which he met farmers' representatives.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
</FONT>Labour won the support of farmers' leaders yesterday for the establishment
of <B>an independent agency</FONT></B> to protect
consumer confidence in food.<BR>
<BR>
After many years of defending the role of the Ministry of Agriculture,
which is responsible for food policy, the National Farmers' Union of England
and Wales said that the beef crisis had forced it to review its position.<BR>
<BR>
Sir David Naish, president of the NFU, told a farmers' fringe meeting in
Blackpool: &quot;The NFU is looking afresh at the concept of a food agency
- in particular how any such body could work effectively to balance the
interests of consumer and producer while being accountable, independent
and cost effective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The BSE crisis had led to demands for an agency independent of MAFF and
the NFU was now willing to discuss this with &quot;interested parties,&quot;
Sir David added.<BR>
<BR>
Dr Gavin Strang, the shadow minister of agriculture, welcomed the shift
in the NFU position. He said: &quot;The sooner we reach a consensus to
enable us to reassure the public about food safety the better.&quot;<BR>

</FONT>The Consumers' Association is seeking to revitalise its role as
a campaigning political pressure group.<BR>
<BR>
The organisation, which publishes the Which? group of magazines and has
almost 750,000 members, is doing the rounds of the party conferences touting
a manifesto called Making Markets Work, which catalogues the reforms the
association would like the next government to initiate.<BR>
<BR>
Stephen Harris, director of communications, said yesterday: &quot;We are
trying to get back to the role CA had in the 1970s. During the 1980s consumerism
became confused with consumption. Legitimate consumer concerns were pushed
aside while attention focused on how much money people had and how much
they were spending. We still see that with all the talk about the 'feel-good'
factor.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mr Harris said the present Government clearly attached high value to the
interests of industry and other producers. &quot;<B>They
attach very low value to consumer interests</FONT></B>. The deregulation
initiative is a much clearer indication where this Government is coming
from than the Citizen's Charter,&quot; he said. &quot;If consumers had
even an equal footing with producers in the Government's consideration
there would not have been the <B>terrible mess in
the Government's reactions to the BSE crisis</FONT></B>,&quot; he claimed.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Harris said the association had identified six key areas. Campaign teams
have been established in the fields of communications, health, including
food, personal finance, public utilities, redress, and transport. &quot;From
now on we intend to punch our weight,&quot; Mr Harris said.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Cow to calf BSE risk 'is <A NAME="lower">lower</A> than thought'</CENTER></H3>
By David Brown, Agriculture Editor Daily Telegraph ... Monday 7 October 1996<P>

 
The risk of cows passing BSE to their calves is lower than scientists
feared, according to
findings by Government scientists.
 
They are expected to dismiss maternal transmission as a factor of minimal
importance and
to strengthen forecasts that the epidemic will have ended by 2001. Experts
at the Central
Veterinary Laboratory in Weybridge, Surrey, are keeping full details of the
results
confidential until the findings of a research project, which will end in
November, are
published.<P>

 
Germany and other EU countries are pressing Britain to go ahead with the
selective cull of up
to 147,000 cattle, which was suspended by the Government, partly because
some of these
animals are offspring of BSE victims. The Government's Spongiform
Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee highlighted evidence this summer that BSE could be passed from
cow to calf.<P>

 
This was based on interim results of research co-ordinated by the Central
Veterinary
Laboratory. The work involved the study of 303 calves born from cows that
fell victim to BSE
and 303 others born to healthy cows. All calves in the study have to be
slaughtered to enable
their brains to be inspected for signs of the disease. The last batch of
calves will be
slaughtered in November.<P>

 
Some calves have fallen victim to the deadly brain illness - but now
scientists believe that
the genetic make-up of the animals may have had more to do with their
deaths than maternal
transmission. A senior source close to the work said yesterday that
individual animals may be
more genetically susceptible to contracting BSE than others particularly if
they were exposed
to the food suspected of causing BSE in the first place<P>

<h3><center>Science Published in <a NAME="Newspapers">Newspapers</a>  -- a few minor problems</center></h3>

Listserve Comment ... 7 Oct 96<P>

Below is flaming example of the defectilve scientific publication system  we actually have
_instead_ of Roland Heynkes' sensible proposal for a prompt dissemination
of scientific results even if in draft form.
<P>
 The cow-to-calf 'findings'  above is a deliberate leak from the Central Veterinary
Laboratory.  I would characterize it as in extremely poor scientific taste,
done out of obvious economic and political motivations.  No sign of an
actual document written up or submitted, much less published, no author
identified, no outside review, no data cited, no opportunity for opposing
interpretations, no details on which gene even [if one was identified,
rather than, say, a common bull].  Indeed, the experiment won't even be
completed for a month.  And the affected animals "may be" more genetically
susceptible to contracting BSE than others -- not a strong claim even.
Some of this could be the fault of the newspaper's account.<P>
 
However, the story is certainly provocative.  'Maternal transmission' has
always included maternal inheritance, as pointed out by Stuart Neilson.
Perhaps cows with this genotype are able to transmit maternally through
placenta.  The study would seemingly only provide correlations, not
causation.   Herds may be severely inbred if artificially inseminated, hard
to see how they could be all that different.  While the leak seeks to
reassure us, I wonder instead how prevalent that genetic susceptibility is
in English herds.  The last sentence in the article quotes the 'senior
source close to the work'  as implying that some animals may be contracting
BSE even if they are _not_ exposed to the tainted food, a la sporadic CJD.<P>

<H3><CENTER> <A NAME="Strain">Strain </A>types and prion glycosylation: commentary on Collinge briefing</CENTER></H3>

Listserve 10.7.96
<P>

<PRE>There is one passage that has some unintended potential for being confusing:
 
 "...shape of the PrP protein: Collinge said that the position of various
glycosolated sugars was a "good candidate" for
 the cause of different strains of various prion diseases."</PRE>
 
I think what Collinge intended here is 'heterogeneity' of the overall
glycoslylation end product.  The glycosylation apparently always takes
place at the asparagine 'positions' 181, 197 in the amino acid sequence.
These regions have been highly invariant in eutheran and metatheran mammals
for some 135,000,000 years. In fact, even the chicken has DCFNITV  for
N=181, only a V to F change.<P>
 
The biochemistry issue here is that dozens of enzymes are needed to attach
[and on turnover degrade] the highly complex branched and bulky
carbohydrate moieties to the prion protein.  These might reasonably be
expressed at different levels in different brain regions of different
genotypetic backgrounds for different neural functions at different ages in
different species.   No one knows how the basic glycoslyation end product
varies across species, in either composition or linkages, never mind the
subtleties. Few labs want to do nanomolar glycolyslation analysis.<P>
 
This situation is further compounded in PrP mutants, polymorphisms, the
resulting heteroligomers, and especially the transgenic animal.  While the
human prion gene is placed in these knockout mice, _none_ of human
glycoslyation enzymes are, so mice glycosylation enzymes [which might not
even be homologous to those of humans] are working across a species
barrier.  The end product is regretably chimeric: protein sequence human,
CHO pattern more or less mouse.<P>

Also worth mentioning are possibilities involving the extent and character of glycosylation in uptake, transmission, aggregation, and stability.  The latter two involve interaction with heat shock chaperone protein and possibly RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts, new role in Alzheimer's).
<P>

On the subject of heat shock protein and prion aggregation equilibria, I call everyone's attention to an interesting paper in JBC [July 1996 pg 16856] in which NOS (nitric oxide synthase, maker of the well-known neurotransmitter) is completely and specifically knocked out in scrapie infection.  The authors suggest an indirect effect, whereby malfunctional prion aggregate ties up hsp necessary for NOS to stay in a working configuration.  This fits well with the emerging story of endgoenous prion disease in yeast.
 
Obviously, when the prion is grown up in E coli for the Swiss 3D studies,
glycosylation is completely missing [or dead wrong].  However we can be
confident in the normals hosts that the sugars are fully exposed to solvent
and contribute [perhaps ominously] to solubility.<P>
 
Prusiner's group did some excellent studies on glycosylation and their
position has gone back and forth on its significance (currently it's
forth).  They found an absolutely appalling mixture of glycosylations.<P>
 
I myself am also of the opinion that heterogeneity of the overall
glycoslylation end product is  a "good candidate" for
the cause of different strains of various prion diseases.  One can imagine
a prion from species X with such-and-such a gylcosylation infects species Y
but can only convert host prion efficiently in this-or-that region of the
brain, which produces new infectious prion with yet-another glycosylation
that then is self-recognizing in later transmissions.  In this sense, there
may a memory of the origin of the infection retained in the brain regious
exhibiting susceptible prion glycosylations.

7.10.96 <A HREF="mailto:carthur@independent.co.uk">Charles Arthur</A>, The Independent
<P>
Last week Charles Arthur and other science writers from British national dailies had a
three-hour conversation with Professor John Collinge, of St Mary's Medical
School. He is a member of SEAC but probably better known as one of the
British leaders in the field of prion diseases.<P>
 
This is long (very, very long), but I think the information is interesting.
One point: Professor Collinge was uncomfortable at the idea of getting a
million requests for more information from people around the world about
his work. Maybe readers could refrain unless he covers something that is
very specific to their work from inundating him. (I leave this to the
scientists to know where standard scientific enquiries tip over an edge.)<P>
 
We covered a fair amount of old ground, but some new, certainly to me. I'll
just report the interesting things as they arose, since it might be hard to
organise otherwise. I've left out a lot of standard stuff about CJD (some
is sporadic, some inherited) which would be in any standard text. Quotes
are transcribed from my shorthand. Remarks in [square brackets] are my
comments. I'll call the classic form of CJD "N-CJD" to distinguish it.<P>
 
The main focus was on the transgenic mice which he is working on. These
have human PrP genes. They are meth-meth homozygotes; by coincidence -
rather, I think, than planning - this is the same gene pairing as all the
British vctims of v-CJD.<P>
 
Collinge emphasised that the SEAC scientists had worried when they
identified v-CJD that it was not new, and that scientists from other
countries would tell them so. The WHO meeting in the summer put them clear
on that. "The meeting showed that nobody had seen it before. Once that
worry [that v-CJD was not novel] was discounted then we really could feel
it was different."<P>
 
There is now a clinical case in a 50-year-old [to be confirmed after death;
this extends the previously understood age range of v-CJD.] Collinge
emphasised the strong consistency of pathology between cases of v-CJD,
contrasting N-CJD which he said "varies a little bit".<P>
 
He made the point about his 1991 paper showing that meth-val heterozygote
humans are less - possibly not - susceptible to prion diseases. This has
been shown in human growth hormone cases.
        But he said that in 1991 he had spoken to a vet: "Cows generally
have no variations in that part of the gene [comparable to the meth-val
codon variation in humans].. It looks as though all cows are equally
susceptible. This is not true for sheep, mice and humans."<P>
 
        Mice. "It's very hard to transmit CJD [N-CJD] to ordinary mice. You
can wait up to 18 months for it to occur. But if you put [N-CJD] into these
transgenic mice, they all get sick." Though all the mice are presently
meth-meth, he is also breeding val-val and meth-val strains.
        "We haven't tried oral transmission of [N-CJD] to these [meth-meth]
mice."<P>
 
We then discussed species barriers, and how you would show that a disease
didn't pass. This quickly moved on..
        "If you take ordinary mice and inject them with BSE, it kills them
quite efficiently, they become sick from 350-700 days. If you then give
their brains to a fresh set of mice, they become ill and die in about 140
days." The brains of the transgenic mice that were injected with BSE will
be fed to another group of transgenic mice. "Maybe [the first group]
haven't lived long enough [to show signs of the disease]."
        Brief discussion of the shape of the PrP protein: Collinge said
that the position of various glycosolated sugars was a "good candidate" for
the cause of different strains of various prion diseases. He noted that the
3-D structure of the mouse prion protein, published recently, doesn't
include codons 106-126 "which we think are the most important".
        He added, "We're not far off having the structure of the human
protein. We hope to have that by early next year."<P>
 
        Back to the BSE experiments on the transgenic mice. (It being a
discussion with journalists, the questions leap around a lot.) "If the mice
get sick next weeek, then it means that the species barrier is no better
than between cows and mice. The other thing is that we have only injected a
few dozen mice. But millions of the human population have been exposed to
BSE.<P>
        "If you look at the [human] data and interpret it in the most
optimistic way, then the barrier [between cows and humans] is at least as
good as between cows and mice. But that's not such a good result."<P>
 
[At this point we journalists started to sense a distinct lack of
"feel-good" factor about what we were being told: the news, from Collinge's
perspective, was not good and was probably going to turn bad. I had
previously thought that he was fairly neutral in this debate, but this
conversation showed me that he thinks that v-CJD *is* BSE in humans.]<P>
 
        "We have injected some v-CJD brain into transgenic mice. We've
transmitted more than 20 cases of normal CJD [N-CJD] into transgenic mice.
If v-CJD looks very different and resembles BSE [in the neuropathology]
then we can draw the connection.
        "The Edinburgh Neuropathology Unit [Moira Bruce strain typing
experiments] might not get a result at all because they're trying to do it
across the species barrier."
        "We should get a result in the v-CJD transgenic mice fairly soon."
He was reluctant at first to say how long ago they were injected.
Eventually he said it was more than 200 days ago.<P>
 
There was then a long discussion about possible treatments, and about the
function of the PrP protein. I will omit this, as I don't think it sheds
any light on the debate in hand. Apart from a couple of points of general
interest, which I'll just quote.
        "PrP is normally turned over [destroyed] in the body in the course
of a few hours."
        "If you increase production of the protein too far then you cause
the disease." (Prusiner team experiments.)
        re treatments: there are two living v-CJD patients, but trying
drugs out on them would not be ethical, he suggested. "The fact that they
are going to die doesn't mean that you have the right to make their lives
miserable."<P>
 
Some discussion of kuru: the shortest incubation period was about 5 years,
while cases are still occurring now - about 6-8 each year - with incubation
periods of 40 years. Most occurred about 10-15 years after exposure at the
feast.<P>
 
BAck to BSE and v-CJD. "If it's BSE, then you have to add on the species
barrier [to the time between exposure and clinical signs]. It looks as
though this [barrier] is at least moderate. That can at leasts double it
[incubation], so it might be 10 years before something happened.
        "If you suppose that v-CJD is BSE in humans: BSE appeared in 1985
and built up. Either way it's depressing. If v-CJD comes from the early
part of the epidemic then that's 10 years ago. The bad news from that is
that the number of cases of BSE built up to thousands a year in 1990.
       "Alternatively,if we're saying the few cases coming through are from
an incubation of 5 years, that suggests there's a very small species
barrier.
        "The level of exposure [of humans] has been so high. I wasn't
expecting to see anything for 10 years." [Not clear if this is 10 years
from BSE or 10 years from now.]
        He said that his concern was raised by the cases of v-CJD in two
teenagers at the end of last year. "I rasied it at a very senior level that
this could be the start of something." [He declined to say what level that
was, or when exactly.]
        "When we sat down in 1990 and discussed this [possibility that BSE
might transmit to humans] we said 'It will look like kuru'. People who
received growth hormone treatments also got a kuru-like illness." [They
were young, like the v-CJD victims.]<P>
 
Here he said something which I think is very significant to a lot of the
discussions that have been bouncing back and forth on BSE-L. I've
capitalised it just to catch the eye of any drifters. It's worth
considering the implications.<P>
 
"IT SEEMS TO BE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE ROUTE [OF INFECTION]."<P>
 
Were incubation periods shorter in younger kuru victims? "We suspect that
there's age-specific sensitivity. I think it's quite likely that there's
age-specific susceptibility. Kuru was a disease mainly of young children
and young women. But it was women and children who were involved in the
cannibalistic feasts and their preparation. The men ate muscle rather than
brains.
        "The pathogenicity of the agent is extremely high in this
situation. Everybody who sits down at one of those feasts dies of kuru."
 
[The journalists were starting to feel spooked. Still, we asked, couldn't
v-CJD be something else?]<P>
 
"It's hard to believe that this disease [v-CJD] isn't due to a novel animal
prion. First because it's a new strain. If you propose that it's sporadic
CJD [N-CJD] then you have to assume that all these people separately
developed this new strain spontaneously in a short time.
        "The probability against that is astronomical. [To explain it
rationally] You simply have to look for a common source of exposure."
        On this [rather worrying] note he said that he thought the "BSE is
scrapie in cattle" theory/hypothesis "was unfortunate" because it prevented
people taking the idea that BSE could pass to humans seriously enough.<P>
 
        He pointed out that it was quickly shown that BSE could pass
through food to cats - and suggested that many cases went unreported: those
which were recorded tended to be near veterinary hospitals, which one would
expect to be geared up to recognise the illness better than country vets.<P>
 
        Thus on the expected number of v-CJD cases we should expect: "I
would be surprised if we were not looking at larger numbers. There were
only 10 or so cases of BSE in its first year."
 
        The most likely culprit, he said, was mechanically-recovered meat
because until last year this contained vertebrae - and those were not
cleaned of spinal cord in an expert manner. Abbatoir workers use bandsaws,
not scalpels.<P>
 
MAFF (UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) is trying to do an
audit of which foods contained brain and spinal material in the past decade
or so. It's not clear how much food manufacturers etc are cooperating.
 
        Spending more on BSE research earlier in the epidemic might not
necessarily have produced more information. "I don't think you solve these
things by throwing money at them. It's driven by a number of people who are
intrinsically interested in the subject."<P>
 
The questions jumped around some more. v-CJD might have some effect on the
peripheral nervous system: "Patients have pains in their limbs."
        PrP also seems to be a "housekeeping" gene - that is, it's always
switched on/expressed. "The level of expression doesn't change through the
disease. There's no evidence that the [insoluble plaque] deposits cause
problems." The cause of the "spongy" holes is still not clear either.<P>
 
        And while we do know a lot about CJD, we still don't know if it is
triggered by a cumulative dose or a single incident. Normal people have
absolutely no "prion" or "flipped" PrP.
        I asked about the cofactor hypothesis (that something else helps to
flip the protein; that it's not just spontaneous.) Wouldn't this explain
why the transgenic mice hadn't developed a TSE, whereas normal mice did?
        He said that the cofactor idea weasn't supported by his
experiments, because you can pass N-CJD to normal and transgenic mice. The
PrP gene doesn't seem to need a cofactor. [Either that, or it's a
gene-expressed protein that humans and mice share? I still wonder.]<P>
 
        Finally: "It's depressing in that I think that v-CJD is BSE. It's
hard to think what other explanation there might be. And we don't know if
it's a cumulative dose which causes it.
        "On the good side, we know more about this than about any
comparable brain disease, so we could get real therapies in the next 5-10
years - something that would stop it in its tracks. We'll have to wait and
see about the epidemic in humans.
        "If we take the cat evidence at face value, then maybe the same
will happen in humans. That would be the most optimistic outcome."<P>
 
        And on that jolly note, we said our goodbyes.

Listserve 10.7.96
<P>

A comment on the mention of cannibalism, which has
become deeply entrenched in this topic and which has little basis in
recorded observation. This new version is certainly one of the most detailed
I have seen:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"Kuru was a disease mainly of young children and young women. But it was
women and children who were involved in the cannibalistic feasts and their
preparation. The men ate muscle rather than brains.
The pathogenicity of the agent is extremely high in this situation.
Everybody who sits down at one of those feasts dies of kuru."</BLOCKQUOTE>
 
In reality, these feasts were not observed (by Gajdusek or any other
visitor), but surmised. The nature of the feasts, lists of participants and
other details were not collected. Despite this lack of any first hand
evidence, these feasts are recorded in numerous scientific papers with a
level of detail that increases with each repetition. They can not be relied
on as accurate evidence of CJD risk factors.<P>
 
What WAS observed was the ritual preparation of deceased tribal members. The
skin, flesh and contents were removed from the skull with a range of stone
and wooden (bamboo?) implements. By custom this was carried out by women and
pre-pubescent boys. The gruesome black-and-white footage I have seen shows
the process in some detail on what appears to be a disinterred corpse, not a
fresh corpse, and in a manner that is not in the least reminiscent of food
preparation - the object of attention was the skull, whilst the flesh and
brain fell unheeded to the ground.<P>
 
It is clear that women and children (both shown in the footage) were exposed
to raw brain through lacerations to their hands, inhalation of spray and
ingestion from their hands. It appeared to me that the flesh was re-interred
and the bones taken elsewhere, as is common in Swat, Tibet, Venice or Greece
(all of which I have also observed) and any number of other contemporary
burial customs. Whilst it is possible that cannibilistic rituals took place,
there is no hard evidence for it and none whatsoever of the "men ate the
flesh and women at the brain" variety.<P>
 
It is my belief that this is a misinterpetation of burial custom and nothing
more. As this is not an area I have any particular expertise in, I will add
that there is a growing body of literature that disputes the existence of
any ritual human cannibalism, some of which details this particular example.
Reports of cannibalism (viz. Ceausescu, Idi Amin, the Aztecs, Native
Americans) tend to serve a political purpose.<P>
 
The last sentence, "everybody who sits down at one of these feasts dies of
kuru" is unsupportable. Rates of kuru were high, but it was not the leading
cause of death. Precise epidemiological evidence linking kuru to particular
forms of exposure is not available, but certainly indicates that the
majority of those exposed to ritual preparation did NOT die from kuru.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>New <A NAME="fears">fears</A> over link between cows'
milk and child diabetes</H3>
Chris Mihill, Medical Correspondent<BR>
<BR>
The Guardian ... Friday 4 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
A controversial <B>theory that cows' milk
can trigger diabetes<</B> in some children was given further weight
today with the results of a laboratory study.<BR>
<BR>
Insulin dependent diabetes develops when the body's immune system destroys
the beta-cells that make insulin.
One theory is that cows' milk can make children's immune systems destroy
the insulin-producing cells.<BR>
<BR>
Researchers from St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, and the University
of Rome, say in the Lancet that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">people with insulin
dependent diabetes</FONT></B> seem to have <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">immune
systems that are primed to attack cows' milk protein</FONT></B>, called
beta-casein, which resembles a beta-cell.<BR>
<BR>
In tests 51 per cent of those with diabetes had cells that reacted to beta-casein,
but only 2.7 per cent of healthy people reacted to the milk.
&quot;The association between insulin dependent diabetes and early consumption
of cows' milk may be explained by the generation of a specific immune response
to beta-casein,&quot; the researchers conclude.<BR>
<BR>
However, other researchers in the Lancet urged caution, saying the link
is plausible but unproved.
Leonard Harrison, from Melbourne University, Australia, points out that
only a small proportion of people exposed to cows' milk in the first year
of life develop diabetes.
He said: &quot;Much more research is needed.&quot;

Scrapie was very rare, with the first case reported in 1981. There has been a pronounced increase in cases over the past
3 years, with 21 new flocks affected up to 29th August 1996 i.e. it is rising epidemically. The reason for this is unclear.
Farms are emptied of sheep, the meat not used, the sheep slaughtered, and farms left empty for 2 years. Certain breeds
are particularly affected and an affect has been seen due to the anxiety resulting from BSE in the UK. The rise is not felt to
be purely due to BSE anxiety and the author things that something else has happened to cause the epidemic, so far
unknown.

<P>

Someone else has mentioned the "kuru" issues, so I will mention the Collinge
conjecture that mechanically-separated meat is the most infectious bovine
food product, because it may have contained bits of spinal cord.<P>
 
Note that MSM could not be responsible for the BSE epidemic, since cows are
not fed this meat (it would require double rendering). Therefore the
conjecture of infectivity would relate only to human food. This may seem
obvious, but I want to make sure a witchhunt for MSM does not start as a
result of this conjecture.<P>
 
Also note that brains themselves would most likely be the most infective
food product for either cows or humans.
 
Although bovine MSM normally contains some bits of bone and marrow, spinal
tissue would only be possible if MSM were prepared from vertebrae. However,
poultry MSM is normally made from whole body skeletons and could contain
such material routinely (although we're not worrying about chicken TSE's
currently!).
<HR>
I have seen and heard this "200,000 times" infectivity statement many times
in the past, and have used it myself in talking to others.
 
But please note there is NO scientific basis for this particular number. It
could just as easily be as low as 1,000 times or as high as 1,000,000,000 times.<P>
 
In order to quanitify the infectivity ratio of this size, an experiment
would have had to be run on at least 200,000 animals to arrive at a score of
"Oral: 1, Injected: 200,000". Obviously our knowledge is based on scores or
hundreds of animals, not millions. Consequently the "200,000" is a
"plausible" conjecture, based on the scientific evidence of an infectivity
rate at least 100x higher in injection than in the oral route.<P>
 
As a point of comparison, if the actual infectivity rate were an expectation
of 1 case in 1443 tests, then, in an experiment involving 1000 animals,
there would be a 50% chance of finding NO cases developed.

I came across this article yesterday by Lev Goldfarb and Paul Brown  in the

Medline [though 35 other articles on prions by these two oauthors are

 It has a nice review of iatrogenic CJD, including some incidence rate data
by country for growth hormone CJD.  58 cases, incidence 0.1% US, 0.7% UK,
1.9% France.  4 cases from infertility treatment with gonadotrophin, all in
Australia.
There is also a good table on genetic CJD, showing for each mutation, age
of onset,  duration, and clincal pathology [highly variable].
 
Most striking quotes:
 
"In Central Slovakia, CJD is the fifth most common cause of death."
[Recall that while E200K M129 is the genetic basis there, it seems of
recent origin and is in a high scrapie area.]
 
"Thus far, CJD transmission via blood or blood derivatives has not been
proven, despite the fact that infectivity can be regularly shown in the

<P>

Worldwide the incidence of Creutzieldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is about 1 per million population per year. The rate in Austria was once much lower than this (average 0 18 per million for 1969-85) but in the last 10 years it has risen to one of the highest in Europe, 1 25 per million in 1995 (figure; g <I>Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry </I>1996; 61: 139-42).
<P>

Prof Herbert Budka and colleagues from the Institute of Neurology in Vienna attribute the increase to more effective case finding: &quot;Austria is a small country with a high necropsy rate and well developed neurology and neuropathology services&quot;. There has been a similar increase in the incidence of CJD in the UK which has also been attributed to increased awareness of the illness, particularly in older people. None of the Austrian patients reported had the new variant CJD described earlier this year in the UK, although two women died unusually young (at the ages of 27 and 30) but without any of the other features associated with the new variant.

<H3><CENTER>Mice may <A NAME="not">not</A> hold secret to human risk of mad cow disease</CENTER></H3>
London Observer Service ... Oct 12, 1996
<P>

John Collinge's mice are doing nicely. For the
first 500 days of their lives, their coats have remained shiny, their noses pink and their
appetites healthy.

And that's good news, because Collinge's rodents carry a secret that has important
implications. Each creature has been genetically altered so that it is now susceptible to the
human brain ailment, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).<P>

In addition, each has been inoculated with a heavy dose of brain matter taken from cows
affected by the condition's cattle equivalent, bovine spongiform encephalopathy -- BSE, or
mad cow disease.

The aim of this experiment is simple. Mice without human genes succumb to BSE within 200
days. The fact that "humanized" mice don't yet have CJD symptoms shows there must be a
"reasonable species barrier" between people and cattle. This barrier may limit mad cow
disease's spread to the British population.<P>

The findings of Collinge have been eagerly anticipated, for his understanding of prions, the
protein-like entitites responsible for both CJD and BSE, is unsurpassed in Britain and his
experiments at Imperial College, London, are rated as being of crucial importance. His
research should reveal whether BSE will spread to only a few humans or to devastating
numbers.<P>

But in spite of the comforting implications of his experiments' initial results, Collinge's
message has a startingly gloomy content.

"For all I know, all 50 of my mice could come down with CJD next week," he says. "However,
they may all die of old age in about another 200 days. That would have to be good news -- of a
sort."<P>

Such a result would not prove that humans are unaffected by a bovine prion disease. It would
simply mean that the species barrier between cow and human is sufficiently strong to prevent
that transmission happening within the average lifetime of a mouse. It may still occur over a
longer period.<P>

This is almost certainly the case, adds Collinge. "The new cases of CJD in humans have a
startlingly uniform pathology: early age of onset, psychiatric disturbances and a relatively
long period before death occurs, about 14 months. This indicates a single cause -- BSE --
though we cannot yet say whether it will lead to 20 or 100,000 deaths a year."<P>

Then there's the question of who succumbs and who survives. Collinge, a key member of the
British government's BSE task force, says he doubts that the new victims' youth was related to
their predeliction for hamburgers. "I think young people are just going to turn out to be more
susceptible in general."<P>

However, his research has revealed that about half the British population has a genetic mix of
brain prions that should enable them to resist BSE. "Of course, that leaves out half the
population who do not have the right brain prion mix, and they will be the ones who provide
the pool of victims."<P>

The most encouraging part of Collinge's message is that, far from being helpless in the face of
an inexorable killer, science is well equipped to fight back. He says the knowledge gained
through trying to understand the unusual biology of prion diseases is paying off.<P>

"That knowledge means we can now think realistically about selecting drugs that could counter
the effects of CJD. There is certainly hope in that part of the story."

<H4><CENTER>Test on 'humanised' <A NAME="story">vermin</A> may give warning of an epidemic</CENTER></H3>
Roger Highfield .. Daily Telegraph ... Saturday 12 October 1996
<P>
MICE that are part-human may soon provide the answer to the most pressing medical
questions of the day. Have the 14 cases of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease been
caused by mad cow disease, and, if so, what are the risks of a human epidemic?<P>

Within weeks, Prof John Collinge's team at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, is
likely to have some of the first answers, thanks to experiments on mice that contain human
brain proteins.

Breeding this "humanised" colony, the result of years of genetic engineering, was possible
thanks to backing from the Wellcome Trust, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences
Research Council and the millionaire brothers David and Frederick Barclay.<P>

Spongiform disease is thought to strike when prion protein flips into a rogue form.  Another human protein called p53, could have a self-replicating alter ego linked to many cancers. "  Once in
that form," said Prof Collinge, "it has the ability to recruit more of the normal protein,
setting up a chain reaction so that all the protein in the brain ends up in a distorted form." As
self-replicating protein runs wild, it forms toxic deposits called plaques. Meanwhile, the
brain is drained of the normal version of the prion protein it relies on.<P>

All that stands between an epidemic and the discovery that 440,000 infected cattle went into
the food chain before the offal ban is what scientists call the "species barrier". The obvious
way to measure its height - to expose people to BSE - is unethical. A second approach is to sit
back and watch the pattern of CJD cases that unfolds, correlating it with exposure to BSE.
That could take years. Prof Collinge's method is to humanise mice so they are as susceptible to
CJD as humans, expose them to BSE, and see how they fare.<P>

When normal mice are injected with BSE, the first fall victim to disease after about 350 days
and the last after 700 days, with an average of 400 days. If an extract is taken from any of
these mice and used to infect others, the latter group succumbs more quickly and
simultaneously, after 140 days.

The species barrier has been breached. "Once you have triggered prion production in an
animal, it makes its own infectious prions which are much more dangerous to other animals of
that species," said Prof Collinge.<P>

Comparing the incubation period of the first group of mice with that of the second reveals a
difference of 250 days. This is the height of the barrier between mice and cows. To measure
the barrier between humans and cows, Prof Collinge bred mice containing human prions.
Unlike ordinary mice, they are very susceptible to CJD. "They all get sick at around 200
days," he said.<P>

'Even if cross-infection is highly inefficient, such that we could inject
thousands of mice and never see any get sick, you could still get transmission
to significant numbers of people'

The humanised mice even make human prions. "Now we can see whether the cow prions can
persuade human protein to make the human infectious prion agent." Prof Collinge challenged
his humanised mice with BSE. "If they get sick at all, it must mean that BSE can convert the
human protein," he said.<P>

The experiment has been running for more than 500 days, showing it is no pushover for the
BSE agent to convert human prions to the infectious form.

The worst-case scenario would be for all the rodents to succumb in the next few days. Then the
species barrier would be 300 days - the 500 days this experiment has run, less the 200 days
it takes humanised mice to succumb.<P>

The barrier between humans and cows would then be at least as good as that between mice and
cows, if not a little better. That, alas, is cold comfort. "<B>Nine grams of bovine brain fed to a
mouse will kill it</B>," said Prof Collinge. "<B>If the species barrier between cattle and humans were
no better than between cattle and mice, we could be in serious trouble.</B>"<P>

Even the most favourable scenario - the mice live to a great old age of around 700 days - is
unsettling. "We only inoculated 50 mice, when tens of millions of people have been
exposed to BSE," he said. "Even if cross-infection is highly inefficient, such that we could
inject thousands of mice and never see any get sick, you could still get transmission to
significant numbers of people."<P>

Another experiment on humanised mice could prove as significant. Some 200 days ago, they
were exposed to the new variant of CJD that triggered the crisis.

This experiment has already run for the time it takes for other forms of CJD to strike and
should conclude more quickly than another experiment in Edinburgh, where normal mice are
used to compare strains. If Prof Collinge's humanised mice succumb in a similar way to BSE,
"we may be able to draw a direct connection".

<BLOCKQUOTE>Collinge says his research has revealed that about half the British
population has a genetic mix of
brain prions that should enable them to resist BSE. "Of course, that leaves
out half the
population who do not have the right brain prion mix, and they will be the
ones who provide
the pool of victims."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

I disagree with the conclusions of the above paragraph, which I take as saying
met/val or val/val or some such at codon 129 won't be in "the pool of
victims."  Collinge was just trying here to get a little of the bad news in
the open while still offering some hope, so as not to throw the populace
into a panic.<P>
 
Instead, I think we are simply seeing progressive CJD (early age of onset,
rapid decline) at the start of the epidemic in the most susceptible genetic
background.   Other populations would be looking at later onset, different
symptoms, and slower progression of the disease.  For example, they could
look like cases of sporadic CJD rather than v-CJD.<P>
 
 As I read the middle-ground scenario in Table 30 in Dealler's "Lethal
Legacy", 142,000,000 individual meals were eaten in which 10,000 or more
lethal infectious units (IU)were present in that serving.  As I read Table
29, again the middle-ground scenario, 18,000,000 people would have been
exposed to a cumulative dose of 1,000,000 IUs or more.  I also see in Table
5 significant numbers of under-2 calves showing BSE whereas Anderson et al
quote an experiment with cows receiving 330 grams intra-cerebrally first
showing symptoms at 40 months.<P>
 
I would expect codon 129 to only modulate some parameters of the illness,
not be all or none:<P>
 
For example, D178N  M129 has a mean age of onset of 49 years, mean duration
of 15 months, and presents in decreasing frequency dementia, ataxia,
myoclonus, spongiform cerebral cortex, ...<P>
 
whereas  D178N  V129  has a mean age of onset of 45 years, mean duration of
22 months, and presents in decreasing frequency insomnia, dysautonomia,
ataxia, myoclonus, and thalamic nuclei atrophy.<P>
 
Sporadic and iatrogenic CJD are similarly enhanced, but by no means
exclusively so, I recall in homozygotes over heterozygotes.
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>Is anti-sens prion mRNA a <A NAME="therapy">therapy</A>?</CENTER></H3>
Listserve 10.12.96
<P>
Could anti-sense oligonucleotides be used to catch prion protein mRNAs?<P>
 
Yes, this is a good therapeutic proposal that could easily be tested in
mice.  For all I know, the experiment is under way as we speak.  Promising
results have been published with other diseases.  There is no technical
problem is producing anti-sense oligonucleotides in quantity.<P>
 
A variation on this is to permanently knock out _one_  copy, more or less,
of the prion gene (ie on one chromosome).<P>
 
On the hopeful side, anti-prion mRNA, meaning mRNA complementary to the
normally transcribed strand, would be expected to accomplish
down-regulation of prion mRNA promoter and lower prion production itself
and so abnormal prion.   Gene dosage experiments, such as the 7x
experiments of Prusiner, suggest that higher prion levels lead to
exaggerated susceptibility and more rapid course of disease.  Transfection
under the control of a friendly promoter might produce a steady flow in
situ of the desired oligonucleotides.  Prion turnover is fairly rapid so
buildup might be slowed.  Even a total absence of prion takes some years to
bring symptoms, so knocking back to half the steady-state level might be
the best of both worlds.<P>
 
On the less hopeful side,  Collinge noted that prion mRNA is produced
constitutively in adults; however, this is not true in neurodevelopment, as
Prusiner discusses in the AnnRevMicrob 48 1994.  In other words, cells have
the potential to respond by some feedback mechanism to curtailment of prion
production by trying harder (ie, more transcription starts, more
translations per mRNA, etc), maybe resulting in the same end levels of
production, especially over time.  Then there is the matter of the
blood/brain barrier, establishing the safety of any intervention, and early
identification of people who might benefit.<P>
 
Remember that while the prion gene is present in only one copy per
chromosome, some other gene of unknown function is already producing mRNA
rather complementary to the prion anti-sense strand. Your  prion anti-sense
oligonucleotides might interfer with this gene by binding to its anti-sense
strand, with unkown effects. <P> 

 In  Stephen Dealler's 'Lethal Legacy" in tables 13-13  are plotted  the log of
infectious units per gram of tissue versus percent of incubation time to
overt symptoms, the result was roughly  log-linear.<P> 

No cow data.  Mouse and sheep spleen were at 100% final infectivity
[800,000,000 and 10,000 IU, resp.] and steady (flat) 30% of the time into
the incubation period for displaying overt symptoms.<P> 
 
Mouse brain: infectious titre increased steadily beginning at 40% of the
incubation period but peaked and flattened at 75% at 10,000,000,000 lethal
infectious units injected to the same species [IU] per gram.<P> 
 
Sheep brain: increased steadily with flatter slope with the earliest data
point shown 65% of incubation period, so from 10,000 IU per gram to
120,000.  Mink, goat, hamsters data is given as well.<P> 
  
We don't eat mouse brain or spleen in the US but I hope they are disposing
of these animals properly (incinerating under controlled conditions).  One
asymptomatic mouse has enough units to kill every mammal on the planet.
<P>
I would recomment to anyone purchase of the Dealler's book 'Lethal Legacy'
for 6 pounds paperback: there are 32 tables in the back. Bloomsbury, ISBN 0 7475 2904 3.

<CENTER><H3>Beef <A NAME="blamed">blamed</A> for causing CJD deaths</H3>
</CENTER>
The Times: Britain: October 24 1996<BR>
BY NIGEL HAWKES, SCIENCE EDITOR
<P>
POWERFUL evidence that "mad cow" disease has passed to people through contaminated beef has been produced by a new biochemical test, scientists announced yesterday.

The test shows that the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which has been diagnosed in 14 people is quite different from other versions of the disease &#173; but virtually identical to BSE.

<P>

While not formal proof that eating beef gave the victims the disease, the scientist who led the research, said: "All lines of evidence converge on this conclusion."

Professor John Collinge added: "I think we should take it very seriously. We cannot predict how many future cases there may be. We need to start talking very seriously about developing therapeutic drugs in case the worst-case scenario arises."

<P>

The test developed by Professor Collinge and his team from Imperial College and St Mary's Hospital in London is the first to identify a molecular "marker" for the new strain of CJD and it may ultimately make it possible to diagnose the condition from blood samples. At the moment, CJD can be formally diagnosed only after death.

<P>

It will also help scientists to determine whether sheep thought to have scrapie might actually have been infected with BSE and pose a threat to public health. BSE, CJD and scrapie all belong to the same family of fatal brain diseases known as spongiform encephalopathies, which cause the victim to become unsteady and confused.

<P>

The new research is unlikely to force any change in government policy, however, since for the past six months that has been based on the assumption of a link between infected beef and the new variant of CJD. The Department of Health said: "This is the first time that we have had experimental evidence to support our view that there may be a link between BSE in cattle and the new strain of CJD. The evidence is not conclusive, but it is persuasive."

<P>

The findings are likely to increase European pressure on the Government to accelerate the cull of British cows, but farmers insisted that British beef was safe to eat. Sir David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, said: "This will cause concern, but the findings merely confirm what was already suspected. Ever since March 20, the safeguards which have been put in place have assumed a worst-case scenario. It does not seem to me that anything more needs to be done."

<P>

Professor Collinge's team started work on the test after a number of CJD patients were found to have unusual symptoms. CJD usually affects older people, but these patients were younger and scientists concluded that they had probably become ill from infected beef. It was not, however, possible to prove that they were suffering from a distinct strain of CJD. Professor Collinge's team has discovered that not only was their variant quite different from other versions of CJD, but it was identical to BSE &#173; and to BSE transmitted to mice, cats and macaque monkeys.

<P>

The test will now be used to investigate whether other species, most especially sheep, have caught it. There are fears that sheep may be carrying BSE after being fed food contaminated with infected material from cows. If so, they could pose just as great a health risk as beef.

<P>

The research could also clarify whether BSE originally came from scrapie, as has long been supposed, or whether it arose independently in cows and was spread through contaminated feed.
The test developed by Professor Collinge &#173; who has published his findings in the scientific journal <I>Nature</I> &#173; is based on comparing the size of proteins in the brain. All the spongiform encephalopathies are believed to be caused by an aberrant form of the prion protein, and the test provides a way of distinguishing between versions of this rogue protein.

<P>

The prions are extracted from the brain, placed on a jelly-like material, and subjected to an electric field which makes them migrate across the gel, leaving a pattern. The team reports that the pattern from "new" CJD is quite different from that of normal CJD. It is, however, closely similar to that of BSE.

<P>

So far the test has been used only on brain tissue, but the team believes that samples from lymph nodes or tonsils may also harbour enough of the rogue prion to show up positive. Ultimately, even blood samples may be used.

<P>

Families affected by CJD welcomed the new research last night. Clive Eves, chairman of the CJD Support Network, said: "This is a substantial step forward. It is essential that the health service prioritises early diagnosis of CJD, given the rapidity of this new variant."

<P>

Professor Collinge declined to guess how many cases of new variant CJD may appear. Much depends on the "species barrier" between cows and human beings. Experiments at his laboratory with mice genetically engineered to carry human prions have been encouraging: none of the mice has developed the disease. Professor Collinge says that suggests a reasonable barrier &#173; "But we have to remember that we are only testing 50 mice, while millions of people eat beef."

An attempt to compare the electrophoretic patterns of PrPsc from various forms of CJD and to
compare these with that from BSE infection in cats, mice, and macaque monkeys. What was
found was that the pattern depended on the glycosylation of the prion protein to some degree
but that there was a further pattern that was still different between 4 separate human groups
when the glycoside chains were removed. It was not noted as to the inefficiency of the enzyme
used to remove the glycoside chains. The most important finding was that the cats, mice and
macaque monkeys had the same pattern as humans with new variant CJD. It was explained how
this could have taken place and how this might indicate that this was derived from BSE. The
introduction is a good explanation of the arguments concerning the presence or absense of any
nucleoside with the prion protein to make the infective agent.
<P>
 What is mentioned but not
brought forward much is the fact that, if glycosylation is so important, then there may well be
methods of both diagnosis and treatment for this sort of disease (published by Dealler. Medical
Hypotheses 1994;42:69-75). 
<HR>

<H4>Dealler's reading of Aguzzi and Weissmann commentary</H4>


This explains in layman's language what the previous paper had said. It puts forward the idea
that it is the glycosylation that decides the strain of the agent (published by Dealler. Medical
Hypotheses 1994;42:69-75). As such it might be possible to look for the glycosylation
factors in the peripheral tissues of the animals and use that as a method of diagnosis. They put
forward that we should now assume that variant CJD is derived from BSE until evidence
appears aginst this.

AGIs are produced by plants and microorgansims in the environment. They are absorbed from the gut, distributed
throughout the body and are concentrated inside cells. AGIs alter the glycan chains of cellular glycoproteins (CGP)
during their formation so that the same CGP produced by different clones of cells (and hence with different glycan
chains) becomes structurally the same. Prion protein (PrP), a CGP, is rendered indestructable to cellular mechanisms
(as PrPi) by the TSE infective process; it is suggested that AGIs could both cause and prevent this by altering the
primary structure of PrP. HIV envelope protein, gp120, carries glycan chains that are decided by the clone of the cells
by which it is produced. Each cellular clone would be expected to add a specific group of glycan chains, making the
gp120 antigenically separate. As HIV infection progresses, infected clone numbers rise, the antigenic diversity of
gp120 may rise as would antibody production, trying to keep pace. Antigenically stimulated CD4+ cells carrying HIV
genes, increase HIV production with gp120 antigenically different from its stimulant. AGIs prevent the glycan diversity
and may prevent the extension of HIV infection.

The article explains that, as a fatal disease, with no method of treatment, inadequate methods
of diagnosis and no method of prevention in any animal afer infection has taken place, this
subject should be studied closely. Infectivity is presumed, if like in other TSEs, to be present
in many tissues and to not be destroyed by cooking. One of the major problems is in trying to
calculate the number of infected animals that are being eaten and at what point in their
incubation period this takes place. It seems that there is adequate data now available from
MAFF for this to found. The major findings of the article are: 
<P>


*  Cases of BSE are becoming severely under-reported. For instance only 40% of clinical cases
of BSE reached UK Government statistics in 1993. 


*  BSE may continue in the UK for many years, with cases born each year, showing symptoms 3
to 8 years later. <P>

*  BSE may not be derived from the disease of sheep, scrapie and if it is, we cannot rely on it to
carry the same properties as that disease. The UK Government used the idea that BSE was
scrapie originally to suggest that BSE would not infect humans although this was invalid at the
time. <P>

*  1,800,000 cattle incubating BSE will have been eaten before 2001 even if no cases are born
after 1991. This figure assumes that all cattle with BSE were always reported by farmers to
veterinary officers, that the VOs always accepted them, and that histological diagnosis was
always correct (up to 1991). It is therefore likely to be an underestimate of the true BSE
incidence. Many of the younger cattle incubating BSE would have been exported to Europe. <P>

*  The epidemiology of BSE in the UK is that of an infection passed down from the mother to the
offspring but where the mother would show symptoms later in life. It may be that BSE cases
that we see are derived from infections in their mother and it was the mother that ate infected
food. If this is true then the total number of infeced cattle eaten in the UK will be around
8,000,000 by 2001. <P>

*  UK Government advisors have suggested that there is little risk from eating liver, kidneys,
nerves and muscle from infected cattle. The article shows that this cannot be true if these
tissues contain the same amount of infectivity as is found in other species with a similar
disease. <P>

*  The acceptable levels (UK Government) of infectivity to found in food may be 10,000 times
the amount that could be seen as acceptable under WHO directives used for other potentially
fatal diseases. <P>

*  UK Governernment Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens reported in October 1994
showing that cattle that may be infected should be treated as if they are infective. They say that
some tissues should not be even touched (e.g. liver) that the UK Government continues to tell
its population as being acceptable to eat. <P>

*  The risk to humans in Europe from BSE is unacceptably high but cannot be stated precisely at
this time. The article states again that the cumulative amounts of BSE in our diet in the UK is
expected to be between 10,000 times and 100,000 times the amounts of scrapie that we
would be eating. <P>

*  No directions are given as to whether bovine tissue in the UK should be considered toxic.

<CENTER><H3>Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and <A NAME="public">public</A> health.</H3>
</CENTER>
<PRE>W. J. Patterson, S. Dealler
J. Public Health Medicine. Volume 17 number 3, 1995, pages 261-268</PRE>

Symptomatic cases of BSE in British cattle now total more than 146,000. As BSE is one of a
group of transmissible and fatal spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) affecting both animals
and humans this has raised concern regarding possible risks to human health. The infective
agent in TSEs, thought to be a prion has not been clearly described. There are no early
diagnostic tests, incubation periods are prolonged (possibly up to 30 years in humans) and
the pathological process which leads to a rapidly progressive and fatal encephalopathy has yet
to be explained. <P>

It is not yet known if the BSE agent can cross the human species barrier to infect humans. It
has now been transmitted to 18 species and to 16 of these (possibly 17 if pigs are included)
by mouth. <P>

Given the importance of beef in the human diet, it is essential that control measures to protect
health are rigorous, comprehensive and objective. In this respect there are four factors which
are important in assessing risks. These are the likely magnitude of the species barrier
between cattle and humans, the dose (single or cumulative) that are needed to transmit the
disease, the method of exposure (oral or subcutaneous) and the likely period before
symptomatic disease appears. <P>

To assist knowledge and understanding in these areas we recommend the wider involvement of
public health professionals in the existing nationally co-ordinated multi-agency research
programme. We also recommend further studies into the oral transmissibility of the BSE
agent to primates, an acceleration of the search for diagnostic tools and treatments for
established prion infection and enhanced surveillance of neurological disease in humans. <P>

It is now clear that probably a large percentage of the population will have been exposed to
BSE in the UK. 

Humans will have eaten 1,800,000 infected cattle by 2001 and will have eaten tissues that
have been shown to be infective in other species, but inadequately tested in cattle. Humans
have already taken risks in eating bovine products that have now been banned. The recurrent
banning of foods or procedures by MAFF will not help the people that have been exposed before
the ban. It is possible that further action such as this by MAFF will seriously damage the
public's respect for its action.<P>

The article's most important part is to show that the World Health Organisation's publicised
opinions on how to decide whether or not the exposure of a human to a specific amount of an
infective agent could not have been carried out as inadequate information was available with
which to decide the action. As a result of this it was important that Government action should
assume a tolerable level for human exposure to BSE to be very low indeed, possibly 10,000
times less then the amount felt acceptable by MAFF.

<CENTER><H3>Farmers demand <A NAME="urgent">urgent</A> action to lift ban on beef </H3>
</CENTER>
The Times: Britain: October 24 1996<BR>
BY MICHAEL HORNSBY, AGRICULTURE CORRESPONDENT
<P>

MORE than 2,000 farmers voiced their anger over the Government's handling of the BSE crisis at a protest rally in London yesterday and called for urgent negotiations to get the European Union ban on British beef lifted.
Sir David Naish, the president of the National Farmers' Union, drew loud applause as he declared: "I am appalled at the extent of government mismanagement and stupid delays that we have experienced throughout this whole catastrophic affair."

<P>

Farmers drove by coach from all over the country to the Methodist Central Hall, many carrying banners proclaiming "British beef is best" and "Give Hogg a roasting" &#173; a reference to Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, whom they blame for worsening their plight. Sir David later delivered a box of beef joints, steak and mince from Devon cattle to 10 Downing Street. Similar unsolicited gifts of British beef were presented to the embassies of EU states in London.

<P>

The rally was overshadowed by the release of new scientific evidence pointing strongly to a link between recent cases of a new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and "mad cow" disease in cattle.

<P>

Sir David said: "Essentially the findings merely confirm what was already suspected. All the safeguards which have been put into place since the possibility of a link was disclosed on March 20 have assumed a worst-case scenario. Consumers need have no doubts about the safety of beef in the shops."
At the rally, Sir David called on the Government to proceed with a selective cull of 120,000 cattle identified as being at special risk of developing BSE, as agreed at the EU summit in Florence in June. That, he said, was the key to getting the export ban lifted.

<P>

"Repeated signals from our minister that there will be no significant selective cull &#173; that the UK has changed its mind &#173; are taken in the rest of Europe as meaning that the UK is breaking the Florence agreement."

<P>

To cheers, he added: "So, let us get on with the Florence agreement. Let us give ourselves the chance to export. Get your MP, particularly if he is a Conservative MP, to tell the minister to stop prevaricating."


Mr Hogg announced at the end of September that the plans for a selective cull had been suspended. He saw no point in the cull because most EU states were determined to maintain the beef ban whatever Britain did.

<BR>
</FONT>British scientists today publish the <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">strongest
evidence</FONT></B> yet that the new strain of a fatal human brain disease
is caused by BSE.<BR>
<BR>
Their research, a further blow to the embattled beef industry, shows that
the new strain of Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease that has affected 12 young
people in Britain over the past two years is wholly distinct from other
types.<BR>
<BR>
It also opens the possibility of a live blood test for <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>
in the next couple of years. The findings will help to determine whether
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">bovine spongiform encephalopathy</FONT></B> (<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad
cow</FONT></B> disease) has crossed the &quot;species barrier&quot; into
sheep, posing a potential further threat to human health.<BR>
<BR>
Professor John Collinge of the Imperial College School of Medicine at St
Mary's Hospital, London, said his team's research, published in Nature
magazine today, should be taken seriously. &quot;We can't predict how many
further cases of new <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> there will
be, but we need to start thinking very seriously about developing therapies
and drugs in case the worst case scenarios come to pass,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
On March 20, the UK government triggered the beef crisis by announcing
that the victims of the new <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> strain
were likely to have got it by eating infected cattle material, before certian
types of offal were banned from the human food chain in 1989.<BR>
<BR>
The Department of Health said yesterday: &quot;This is the first time we
have had any experimental evidence to support our view that there may be
a link. It's not totally conclusive, but it's persuasive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The findings will be considered by the government's advisory committee
on BSE and <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> at a meeting later this
month, in case further health measures are needed.<BR>
<BR>
However, Prof Collinge said the government was already working on the assumption
that BSE could harm humans and measures were in place to protect public
health.<BR>
<BR>
Cattle organs such as the brain, spleen and spinal cord were banned from
the human food chain in 1989 because of the possibility they could contain
BSE.<BR>
<BR>
The research team identified a molecular &quot;marker&quot; or signature
that distinguishes the new variant of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>
and is also seen in BSE in cattle and other infected animals.<BR>
<BR>
Prof Collinge said the molecular markers could identify <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>
strains in days rather than the one to two years previously needed in tests
on mice.<BR>
<BR>
The research is published as the Meat and Livestock Commission today holds
a &quot;festival of British beef&quot; to try to restore confidence in
the safety and quality of the meat.

Daily Telegraph ... Thursday 24 October 1996<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>Farmers risk losing public sympathy over the beef crisis by <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">constantly
complaining</FONT></B>, Douglas Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, said yesterday.<BR>
<BR>
He also accused farmers of ignoring the &quot;unprecedented&quot; &pound;3
billion in aid being poured into the industry by the taxpayer.<BR>
<BR>
The attack came after more than 2,000 farmers gathered in London to lobby
Parliament in protest at the Government's handling of the beef crisis.
Many of the protesters carried placards calling for Mr Hogg to be sacked.<BR>
<BR>
Mr Hogg sent a letter to Sir David Naish, President of the National Farmers'
Union of England and Wales, spelling out the level of cash aid farmers
were receiving.<BR>
<BR>
It said: &quot;There can be no greater measure of the Government's commitment
to the industry and to rural communities. It is a credit to the British
people that, as taxpayers, they have been prepared to stand by farmers
in this way.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This kind of support goes well beyond that received by other sectors
who have gone through periods of real difficulty, for example the construction
industry.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To overlook these facts, and in particular, the scale of the assistance
that has been given to British agriculture, is to risk losing public sympathy,
and could do great damage to the reputation of British farming.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Senior Whitehall officials described the letter as a &quot;s<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">top
whingeing and count your blessings message</FONT></B>'. Sir David had earlier
delivered a scathing attack on what he called &quot;Government mis-management&quot;
of the beef crisis. He said it was a &quot;catastrophic affair&quot;.<BR>
<BR>
Sir David accused Mr Hogg of taking steps which worked against the agreement
on beef reached by the Prime Minister at the Florence Summit in the summer.<BR>
<BR>
This, he said, had hindered efforts to persuade the European Union to lift
the export ban on British beef.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Nearly 700,000 animals have been slaughtered so far<BR>
<BR>
</B>Two weeks ago the NFU ruling council passed a vote of no confidence
in Mr Hogg's abilities as farms minister.<BR>
<BR>
But Downing Street sources have made it clear that the Prime Minister will
not tolerate any interference on who he chooses to have in his Cabinet.<BR>
<BR>
It was a measure of Mr Hogg's anger at yesterday's protest that he released
the text of his letter, which also took stock of the steps taken by the
Government to resolve the crisis, and to provide financial aid to farmers.<BR>
<BR>
The Government, he said, had implemented the much-criticised culling programme
of cattle more than 30 months of age, at the request of the NFU.<BR>
<BR>
Nearly <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">700,000 animals had been slaughtered so
far</FONT></B> under this scheme and another &pound;16.6 million aid had
been approved to increase the slaughter rate to as many as 55,000 cattle
a week.<BR>
<BR>
On Oct 8, he said, the Government had introduced another &pound;29 million
of additional cash aid.<BR>
<BR>
The Government had introduced a calf processing scheme in which farmers
were paid &pound;103.47 for every surplus calf they killed. Nearly 300,000
had been killed so far under this scheme.<BR>
<BR>
Another &pound;110 million in additional aid had been agreed at the July
meeting of the EU Council of Farm Ministers. This produced increases of
&pound;19.70 a head in beef special premiums, and &pound;23.13 a head in
suckler cow premiums.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, Mr Hogg said that the Government had paid temporary aid to
the rendering industry of &pound;118 million and &pound;110 million to
slaughterhouses.<BR>
<BR>
He said: &quot;These measures amount to an unprecedented level of support
for the farming community. The total bill to the taxpayer is likely to
run to almost &pound;3 billion.&quot;

</FONT>The first experimental evidence that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">mad

<BR>
Scientists have discovered a critical similarity between the new type of
<B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</FONT></B> which has

in cattle.<BR>
<BR>
The finding adds powerful backing to claims that <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">BSE

<BR>
The characteristic signature sets the new strain distinctly apart from
other forms of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> - but it is almost
indistinguishable from the molecular hallmark of BSE.<BR>
<BR>
Scientists see this as strong supportive evidence that the new <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>
variant <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">arose from BSE in beef</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
The Government said last night that the findings did not require any additional
measures to protect the public or restrict the consumption of British beef.<BR>

Roger Freeman, the minister co-ordinating the Government's response to
the BSE epidemic, said present measures had been introduced after the new
variant of <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> was first acknowledged
earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
But Labour's health spokesman, Chris Smith, called for an immediate Government
statement on the implications of the research, to be published in the magazine
Nature.<BR>
<BR>
Prof John Collinge, who made the discovery, called for his test to be used
to find out whether scrapie, a similar disease in sheep, originated from
BSE in cattle. &quot;If BSE is in sheep it should be treated with the same
respect as BSE in cattle,&quot; he said.<BR>
<BR>
A team of scientists led by Prof Collinge at the Imperial College School
of Medicine at St Mary's, London, examined the prion protein, the infectious
agent that appears to cause BSE and <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B>.<BR>
<BR>
They developed a test that identifies the molecular differences between
the strains of prion, and found that the prion present in patients with
&quot;new variant&quot; <B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">CJD</FONT></B> were almost
identical to the prions found in cattle with BSE.

 <CENTER><H3><A NAME="New">New</A> research bolsters support for EU ban</H3>
</CENTER>The Times: Britain: October 25 1996<BR>
FROM CHARLES BREMNER IN BRUSSELS
<P>

THE latest evidence of a human link to mad cow disease was viewed across Europe yesterday as further proof that no British beef should be sold abroad without tougher measures to eradicate BSE in Britain.

<P>

The media and politicians greeted the scientific findings of John Collinge's team as fresh vindication of the beef ban, imposed last March. The reaction, as usual, was strongest in Germany, where officials said the research had reinforced their belief that the ban could not be lifted for a long time.

<P>

<I>Suddeutsche Zeitung</I> said: "The message is clear: there is not the slightest reason to ease up the fight against BSE ... Perhaps London will listen at last to serious researchers in its own country." <I>Bild</I> said: "Thank goodness German politicians did not wait for more and more evidence but acted in good time." Germany was first to impose a ban on British beef last March.

<P>

In France, <I>Liberation</I> said the apparent proof that humans could be infected by eating beef should serve to ensure that politicians were kept under the pressure of public opinion to take the strictest measures.

<P>

The European Commission, which co-ordinates EU action against BSE, said there appeared no reason to change its approach to the British beef crisis. It repeated its demand, shared by all 14 other member states, that Britain immediately implement the selective slaughter of 140,000 cattle, which it promised in the agreement on easing the ban in Florence in June. The Government suspended the cull in September after scientists reported that BSE would die out without further measures early in the next century.

<P>

Gerry Kiely, the spokesman for Franz Fischler, the Farm Commissioner, said: "In terms of the pace at which the ban is lifted, the first step is totally in the hands of the British Government." Since 1989, the Commission had acted on the assumption that there could be a link between BSE and CJD, and the latest British findings showed that the approach of the Florence accord was correct, he said.

<P>

Britain's suspension of the cull has been greeted with incomprehension. Herr Fischler said that the new British findings "show how serious the crisis is. We must make sure all the measures which have been put in place are maintained, because now we have to face the fact that the disease can be transmitted to people."

<P>

Britain is preparing to apply to the EU to start lifting the ban for cattle from certified BSE-free herds in Northern Ireland. With emotions stirred again by the latest report, the Government is expected to delay its formal request for the action, British sources said. The Commission is not happy with a British proposal to implement the selective slaughter only in Northern Ireland in return for EU approval to renew exports from the province.

<P>

The Commission is itself under criticism for its handling of the epidemic. The European Parliament, which is leading the attack, yesterday agreed to extend for three more months a committee of inquiry which is investigating the alleged mishandling of the epidemic by the Commission and Britain.

BY MICHAEL HORNSBY The Times: Britain: October 25 1996 
<P>

DOUGLAS HOGG, the Agriculture Minister, said yesterday that he saw no need for any new safeguards arising out of the latest scientific evidence on a link between BSE and the fatal CJD brain disease in humans.

"We have been working on the assumption for a long time now that BSE was capable of being transmitted," he told <I>The Times.</I> "Therefore the measures that we first put in place at the end of the Eighties, and subsequently reinforced, were directed to guarding the public against any risk.

<P>

"Now what Professor Collinge has done is to provide evidence which tends to corroborate the assumption which we previously had made for working purposes. So I see no need for further measures."

The Prime Minister came to Mr Hogg's support, telling BBC Television's <I>Breakfast News</I> that beef was "perfectly safe". He added: "So there ought to be no fresh public concern because the action that would be necessary has been taken, in some cases six or seven years ago, and enlarged upon fairly recently.

<P>

"There is no need for any more action and, because the action has been taken, there is no need for the European Union to panic."
John Pattison, head of the scientific committee advising the Government on BSE, also said he would eat beef "without any reservations", because of the safeguards that were in place.

<P>

                     LONDON--A team of British scientists today announced new evidence
                     linking a fatal degenerative brain disease that has killed 10 people in
                     Britain since 1994 with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), a
                     neurological condition popularly known as "mad cow disease" that has
                     infected more than 150,000 British cattle.<P>
                     ››››› The researchers have developed a test that reveals strong
                     similarities between proteins thought to be responsible for the
                     human disease--a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
                     (vCJD)--and those connected with BSE. "This is the most suggestive
                     evidence so far that the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease came
                     from BSE," says Byron Caughey, a biochemist at the National
                     Institutes of Health's (NIH's) Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Montana.
                     Not all experts agree, however.<P>
                     ››››› At a press conference this morning, John Collinge of Imperial
                     College School of Medicine at St. Mary's Hospital, London, explained
                     that the simple test distinguishes differences between the infectious
                     proteins, or prions, isolated from the brains of infected humans or
                     animals. The researchers break down prions with an enzyme and
                     separate them according to the number of sugar groups attached to
                     them. The relative abundances of proteins with different numbers of
                     sugar groups produce patterns characteristic of BSE, classical
                     Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the new vCJD strain. Collinge's report
                     will appear in tomorrow's Nature.<P>
                     ››››› Collinge's team found that the prion pattern of vCJD--which
                     has stricken victims up to age 45--resembles the BSE pattern far
                     more closely than that of people suffering from classical
                     Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a more common, albeit rare, condition that
                     tends to strike older people. But because the new test requires brain
                     tissue, it is normally only possible to run after a patient has died. The
                     team is now hoping to detect the proteins in another body tissue that
                     could be sampled while a patient is still alive. They are analyzing
                     lymph nodes and tonsils, where prions replicate. Collinge hopes to
                     have results on such a test in a matter of months. With a test
                     potentially able to detect the disease early on, "we should think
                     seriously about developing therapeutics," says Collinge.<P>
                     ›››››But some experts are greeting the findings with caution. "It's
                     an interesting idea but not persuasive," says Paul Brown, a
                     neuroscientist at NIH's main campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Brown
                     says he's skeptical that differences between prion forms revealed in
                     the new test account for variations in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and
                     he's waiting for results of experiments in transgenic mice. The mice
                     produce the human prion that, when altered, is linked to vCJD. The
                     mice were injected with brain tissue from vCJD victims, but so far,
                     none have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Final results are due
                     next year.

 <CENTER><H3>Laboratory mice carry <A NAME="secret">secret</A> of human BSE risk </H3>
</CENTER>
The Times: Britain: October 25 1996  BY NIGEL HAWKES, SCIENCE EDITOR<P>

A GROUP of elderly mice in a London laboratory could be the key to the future spread of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The longer they live, the lower the risk of a massive epidemic.



The mice are genetically engineered to produce a human version of the prion protein implicated in the brain disease. More than 18 months ago, they were injected with material from the brain of a cow with BSE.

The experiment is designed to show whether, and how soon, the humanised mice succumb to the disease. Normal mice do so after an average of 400 days; these mice are still healthy &#173; although some have died of old age &#173; after more than 500 days.

<P>

That looks encouraging, but it is subject to a number of caveats, according to John Collinge of Imperial College and St Mary's Hospital, whose 23-strong group of scientists is conducting the experiment. He knows that if these humanised mice are challenged with CJD rather than BSE, they get sick quickly &#173; in about 200 days. This is because their prions are human, and CJD is a human disease: there is no "species barrier" to jump. The way to measure the height of that barrier is to compare the time taken for the mice to succumb to BSE with the 200 days it takes them to die from CJD.

<P>

The barrier between cows and mice, measured in this way, is 250 days. Since the humanised mice challenged with BSE are still alive at 500 days, we know that the barrier between humans and cows is as large, if not larger. The longer the mice stay healthy, the higher that barrier must be, and the lower the number of people who will acquire BSE from beef.

<P>

If mice eventually die of old age without developing any symptoms, the experiment will continue by taking extracts from their brains and injecting them into other mice. If the first group are incubating CJD, their brains might cause the disease more swiftly in the second group.

<P>

Even if all the mice survive, humans could still be in danger. "We only infected 50 mice to start with," Professor Collinge said. "If the disease affected, say, one in a thousand, I wouldn't see it. But there could still be 50,000 people infected in Britain."

<P>

Just who those people would be could depend on a genetic lottery. The evidence is that only about half the population is likely to be susceptible, because of the particular prion genes they carry.

<P>

Prions are found in all higher creatures, and are en coded by a gene consisting of 800 nucleotide bases, the "letters" of the genetic alphabet. There are two versions of the gene, called V and M.

<P>

Each person carries two copies of each gene, one maternal and one paternal, allowing three possible combinations: MV, MM, or VV. Half the population has MV; the other half divide equally between MM and VV. Almost all cases of CJD occur in people with two identical copies: MM or VV. Those with a mixture of M and V seem to be immune.

<P>

The probable reason is that a mixture is less easily converted to the rogue form of the prion which causes the disease. Infection with CJD occurs when a rogue prion getting into the body acts as a "seed", encouraging abnormal changes to other prions, and eventually loss of brain function and death.

<P>

In theory, drugs to counter the process are possible. Professor Collinge said that what was needed was to establish a test-tube system in which the prion changes could be observed. "Then you could use modern techniques to screen thousands of different compounds to see if they would stop the change taking place. Once you find one, you try to improve it, and eventually you would have a drug that would stop the process."

 <CENTER><H3>Conference <A NAME="message">message</A> falls on empty seats</H3>
</CENTER>
The Times: Britain: October 25 1996 BY ROBIN YOUNG<P>

 AS PARTY poopers biochemists take some beating. More than 600 invitations to the Festival of British Beef in London were issued; with headlines everywhere about Professor Collinge, BSE and death from CJD only 200 people took them up.

<P>

"We hoped there would be more people here," said the chairman of the Meat and Livestock Commission, Don Curry, as speeches began to rows of empty seats in the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre, Westminster. "With 130,000 catering outlets around the country it is sometimes difficult to get our message across."

<P>

Here then, for the benefit of those who unfortunately could not attend, is the message: "Professor Collinge's research has not changed a thing. The safeguards that have been put in place were already based on the worst case assumption that there was a link between BSE and CJD. So far as safety is concerned, this research has no implications."

<P>

Having disposed of the bad news, how about some good news? "The quality of British beef has never been better," Mr Curry gamely insisted. "Retailers are reporting sales 85 per cent of pre-BSE scare levels. No other product could have withstood the publicity beef has suffered and still come out so strongly."

<P>

Kevin Taylor, the Agriculture Min istry's deputy chief veterinary officer, told the conference that his wife causes chaos in restaurants by refusing anything but British beef on grounds of safety. "Gives a whole new meaning to 'mad cow'," muttered a restaurateur in the audience.

<P>

Bob Gledhill, deputy editor of <I>Caterer &amp; Hotelkeeper</I>, tried to reassure the audience by putting media scares in context. BSE made so many headlines, he suggested, only because "mad" and "cow" were such conveniently short words, and because pictures of dairy cattle came much cheaper than news photographs.

"Sales of beef will recover," promised Michael Gottlieb, chairman of the Restaurateurs' Association of Great Britain, admitting that sales through his own Smollensky's restaurants were still only half of what they had been in 1989.
