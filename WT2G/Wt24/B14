BOB BYRNES '68<p>

DIRECTOR OF ATHLETICS<p>

<p>

     A 1968 Manhattan graduate, Byrnes is now in his ninth year as the College's Director of
Athletics.  <p>

     Since he arrived back in Riverdale in May of 1988, Byrnes has presided over a renaissance period
in Manhattan College athletics.  The men's &amp; women's basketball programs have both earned NCAA
Tournament bids during his tenure, while numerous athletes have received All-America honors for
both their athletic and academic achievements.       <p>

     Before returning to Manhattan, Byrnes spent 13 years with the Morrison-Knudsen Company, one
of the largest engineering and construction firms in the nation.  He served as the director of labor
relations for the Cleveland-based subsidiary, M-K Ferguson Company, handling matters related to
labor negotiations, Equal Opportunity Employment, Affirmative Action and staff training. <p>

     A native of Garrison, New York, Byrnes earned his undergraduate degree in physical education
with a minor in biology.  He also holds an MBA from City University in Seattle, Washington.<p>

     Byrnes' Manhattan College athletic career included service to the Jaspers' club football squad,
where he served as a two-year captain and performed as both a defensive tackle and an offensive
end.  He was an assistant coach in 1969 and helped lead the Jaspers to a 6-2 season.<p>

     Upon graduation, Byrnes began a teaching and coaching career at Queen of Peace High School
in North Arlington, New Jersey.  He also served as the school's Director of Athletics from 1970 to
1973.  Under his coaching, Queen of Peace registered state tournament appearances in baseball and
basketball, and captured the Parochial "B" State Championship in football (1972).<p>

     In addition to his responsibilities at Manhattan, Byrnes is also a member of the Metropolitan
Intercollegiate Basketball Association, the committee that makes the selections for the annual
National Invitation Tournament (NIT).  He also serves as the chairman of the Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference (MAAC) men's basketball committee.     <p>

     The 51-year-old Byrnes and his wife, Patricia, are residents of Northvale, NJ.  The couple have
four children: Bob 23, Carolyn, 20, Brian, 18, and Darren 13.  Both Carolyn and Brian currently
attend Manhattan.<p>

JOHN "DOC" JOHNSON<p>

HEAD TRAINER <p>

    <p>

      There are few faces at Manhattan College more familiar than John Johnson's.  The registered
physical therapist came to the College 50 years ago and has tended to the school's athletes ever since.<p>

      A graduate of the Swedish Institute of Physiotherapy in 1937, Johnson spent time as a therapist
for the Air Force and an athletic trainer for the Navy's pre-flight schools in Ottumwa, Iowa, before
coming to Riverdale.  The Cresskill, New Jersey resident, is also the long-time trainer of the New
York Giants of the National Football League.<p>

      His work and manner have not gone unnoticed at Manhattan.<p>

Johnson was conferred with the Diploma of Benefactor by the Brothers of the Christian Schools in
1983 and was elected to the Manhattan College Hall of Fame in 1985.  In 1990, "Doc" was given
the "Distinguished Service Award" by the Manhattan College physical education department.  Both
the men's and women's basketball teams honor their most valuable player with the "John Johnson
Award" each season.

              <h2><center>MANHATTAN COLLEGE SIGNS LONG ISLAND HURLER</h2></center>
<hr>

	<p>Tom Foley, a 6'1" righthanded pitcher from Bayport-Blue Point 

High School, has signed an NCAA National Letter of Intent to join 

Manhattan College next fall.

	<p>Foley becomes the fourth Bayport player to sign with the 

Jaspers since 1994.   Other signees include shortstop Jeff Rowett, 

the 1995 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Rookie of the Year; his 

brother, second baseman Kevin Rowett; and pitcher Steve VanCura.

<p>Foley is currently the #1 starter at Bayport.

<p>"We're delighted that Tom is following in the footsteps of 

these other fine Bayport baseball players," explains fourth-year 

Manhattan head coach Gary Puccio, a Sayville native.  "He has the 

ability to help us with the continued improvement of our program."

                                <left>         <h3>  November 19, 1996</h3>  </left>

  <center><b> <h2>      JASPERS SIGN TWO RECRUITS</h2> </b> </center>
                      <hr>

   <p>  Mars Mellish, a 6'1 guard from St. Peter's High School in New 

Brunswick, New Jersey, and Durelle Brown, a 6'7" forward from 

Kingswood H.S. in West Hartford, Connecticut, have signed NCAA 

National Letters of Intent to join Manhattan's men's basketball 

team next fall.

  <p>   Mellish, a native of Liberia, Africa, averaged 18 points, nine 
rebounds and five assists last season for coach, Bob Greene.  A 

three-year starter at both backcourt positions, Mellish earned All-

Middlesex County and All-State honors last year.  He currently 

holds the County record for three-pointers made in a game (10).

   <p>  "Mars is an extremely athletic guard who has a knack for 

putting the ball in the basket," Jasper head coach John Leonard 

explains.  "He's considered a tremendous outside shooter and a 

tenacious defender.  He is also a terrific young man, someone who 

will fit in with us right away."

 <p>    Brown, who hails from New Britain, CT, averaged 22.9 points, 

6.5 rebounds and 3.1 assists as a power forward for coach Andy 

Krugman last season.  

   <p>  "Durelle has a complete understanding of the game.  He can 

score and has great passing skills for a player his size," Leonard 

comments.  "He also happens to be one of the nicest kids I've ever 

recruited.  He will be a welcome addition to our Jasper family."

	<h2><center>LADY JASPERS SIGN THREE RECRUITS FOR THE 1997-98 SEASON</center></h2><hr>
	<p>The Manhattan College women's basketball program has received signed National Letters of Intent from three players who will join the team for the 1997-98 season.  Jen Hardy, a 6'5" center/forward from Littleton High School in Littleton, Colorado; Kayla Pirtle, a 6'3" guard/forward from Elmsworth Junior College and Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Kim Michael, a 5'10" guard from Western Guilford H.S. in Greensboro, North Carolina, will all join the Lady Jaspers next season.
	<p>Hardy averaged 12.5 ppg and 7.5 rpg as a junior and earned All-Conference and Honorable Mention All-State honors.  She helped lead Littleton to a 20-3 record and a quarterfinal appearance in the Colorado State Championships, the third consecutive year that the team that went to the final eight.
	<p>Pirtle will join the Lady Jaspers following her second and final season at Elmsworth J.C. in Iowa Falls, Iowa.  Originally from Washington H.S. in Cedar Rapids, Pirtle averaged 13.5 ppg and a team-high 9.4 rpg in '95-96 and was an All-Conference selection.  She set a single-season school record with 110 blocks and helped lead Elmsworth to a 26-4 record and a trip to the Final Eight of the National Junior College Athletic Association Division II Championships.  Pirtle earned All-Tournament Team honors at the NJCAA's.
	<p>Michael averaged 20.1 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 5.1 apg and 5.2 spg as a junior at Western Guilford.  In three seasons, she helped lead her teams to a combined 81-12 record and appearances in the Eastern Regional Finals in '95-96 and the North Carolina State Championship Game in '93-94.  Last season, Michael was named the Mid-State 2A Conference Player of the Year and earned All-Guilford County and All-Region honors.
	<p>"We're very excited to have all three players join us next season," says Lady Jaspers' head coach, Michele Sharp.  "All three players will add depth to our team.  This may be the best recruiting class that we've assembled since I've been here."

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>MANHATTAN COLLEGE WOMEN'S LACROSSE SEASON PREVIEW</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>1997 Season Outlook</H3>

<P>
<HR></P>

<P>After posting a 3-5 mark as a club team, the Manhattan College Lady
Jaspers' lacrosse squad will move up to the Division I varsity level for
the 1997 season. The team features 11 returning players from the 1996 team
and will compete for the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Championship.
</P>

<P>Leading the offensive charge for Manhattan will be sophomore Lori Graham,
who was the Lady Jaspers' leading scorer in '96 with 35 points (29 goals,
6 assists). She will be joined on attack by returning seniors Amy DeVito,
Marisa D'Onofrio and junior Liz Martinez. Newcomers looking to made an
impact include junior Colleen Dowling, sophomore Laureen O'Keefe and freshman
Nancy Murtha. </P>

<P>&quot;We have a quick offense that can run the fast break and exploit
the one-on-one situations,&quot; head Coach Danielle Caro reveals. </P>

<P>The midfield is anchored by sophomore Tara Ruzzier. Ruzzier's speed
allows her to contribute on the attacking end without giving anything up
defensively. &quot;She's our best one-on-one defender,&quot; Caro says.
&quot;She is so quick, that even when she gets beat, she recovers before
her opponent realizes it.&quot; Sophomore Jess Sofsian and the freshman
duo of Liz Bogart and Alisha De La Cruz will join Ruzzier to form an explosive
midfield unit. Freshman Brigit McTigue, who is just learning the sport,
will also challenge for playing time in the midfield. </P>

<P>Defensively, Manhattan is led by junior goalkeeper Daphney Mickle. &quot;Daphney
has earned the respect of her defenders and the team has complete confidence
in her,&quot; Caro says. Junior Krystyn Meyers and sophomore Monica Gorham,
&quot;are the quarterbacks of the defense. They make the decisions and
communicate it to their teammates. I really expect them to be smart and
to lead by example,&quot; Caro states. The defensive unit also features
senior Kristyn Simon, sophomore Heather Devine, and newcomers Amy Wright
and Denise Murphy. </P>

<P>Coach Caro is looking forward to the team's inaugural Division I season.
&quot;The improvement the team showed last season was unbelievable. Eight
players had never played lacrosse before last season, and four of them
were regular starters. If they continue to improve at the same rate this
season we'll be able to challenge for the MAAC title,&quot; Caro predicts.
</P>

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%"></P>

<P>After finishing a disappointing fourth place in the Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference last season, the Lady Jaspers hope to bounce back from their
17-27 record. Mid-season injuries to shortstop Lindsay Hill (hand) and
pitcher Carrieann Ciccone (wrist) were a main cause of Manhattan's woes.
</P>

<P>&quot;If we can start out and remain healthy, I feel this team can improve
and be competitive with top MAAC teams,&quot; predicts Hannon.</P>

<P>With only 10 returning players and one recruit, the Lady Jaspers will
need to rely on walk-ons for depth and consistency. </P>

<P>&quot;Unfortunately, we began the fall season with only a handful of
seasoned players. However, the walk-ons stepped up and performed as well
as the veterans, playing with a lot of heart and desire. The whole team
did what it took to win games,&quot; adds Hannon.</P>

<P>With the graduation of pitchers Carrie Wujcik and Beth DeBrosse, the
Lady Jaspers will rely on the arm of Ciccone, a junior. After performing
well in Florida, a broken wrist sidelined Ciccone until mid-season. </P>

<P>&quot;Carrieann throws the ball well and is very consistent,&quot; says
Hannon. &quot;She may not overpower batters, but she will fool them.&quot;
</P>

<P>Newcomer Heather Marshak will be the team's #2 hurler in 1997. As Manhattan's
first West Coast player (she hails from Santa Monica, California), Marshak
throws the ball hard and should provide the Lady Jaspers with a very powerful
1-2 punch. She will also see time at first base. </P>

<P>Hill, a senior and one of the team's co-captains, is a four year starter.
The former Mid-East Region All-American and All-MAAC player finished third
on the team in batting in 1996 and will again be the starting shortstop
in 1997. Colleen Mannion, the other senior co-captain, will anchor the
outfield. She will be switching from left field to center 1997. </P>

<P>After receiving the MAAC Rookie of the Year Award, sophomore Jen Fisher
will resume the catching duties for the Lady Jaspers. A stalwart behind
the plate, Fisher played in all 44 games last year and is the top offensive
returnee after leading the team in batting with a .361 average. Sophomore
Colleen Talt, who will be used as Fisher's back-up, will also be a utility
infielder. The third co-captain and inspirational leader will be junior
Michelle Komorowski. She will return to her natural position at second
base after spending time in both the infield and outfield last season.
Junior Kelly Wiedenhaefer will begin the season as the starting first base
person. Rounding out the infield will be sophomore third base person Emily
Lloyd. A strong fielder, she batted a solid .264 with 12 RBI as a freshman
and should be a solid contributor with the bat. </P>

<P>Joining Mannion in the outfield will be sophomore Jen Maxwell. After
sitting out the fall season with a shoulder injury, Maxwell should be starting
in right field. Senior walk-on Marjorie Cote, who batted .273 (fourth on
team) in the fall, earned herself a starting spot in left field. Senior
Patricia Ward and sophomore walk-on Julie Theret will also be contributing
in the outfield. </P>

<P>&quot;The team has plenty of talent,&quot; Hannon suggests. &quot;We
had a successful fall season and hope to continue that trend in the spring
when I expect to this team to challenge for the MAAC title.&quot; </P>

<CENTER><P><B><U><FONT SIZE=+2>1996-97 MANHATTAN COLLEGE TRACK &amp; FIELD
PREVIEW</FONT></U></B></P></CENTER>

<P>Entering his fourth year as head coach of the combined Manhattan College
men's and women's track &amp; field program, Dan Mecca has set high goals
for the 1996-97 indoor and outdoor seasons. But, to maintain the high level
of success and tradition set by previous Jasper and Lady Jasper teams,
Mecca must do so without the services of some of his top performers from
the recent past. </P>

<P>&quot;We may have lost several great athletes from last year's squad,&quot;
says Mecca. &quot;But, there is a considerable amount of talent on both
the men's and women's teams to make this season an interesting one.&quot;
</P>

<P>The losses from last year's team include Michael Williams, the 1995
NCAA indoor 800m champion; Conroy Daley, the 1996 IC4A indoor &amp; outdoor
triple jump champion and indoor long jump champion; and Dahlia Henry, holder
of six Manhattan College records. </P>

<P>However, there is a strong nucleus returning. The men's team returns
All-East triple-jumpers Ron Gonzalez and Joe Sciuto, as well as former
Irish National Hammer Throw champion, Ron Quinlan, who was a redshirt last
year. The Lady Jaspers return two-time Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference
Cross Country champion, Margaret McParland, as well as All-East performers,
Sophia Tasker and Dine Potter. Last summer, Potter became the first female
athlete in Manhattan College history to participate in the Olympic Games.
She competed for her native country of Antigua &amp; Barbuda. </P>

<P>Considering the talent that returns, Mecca remains optimistic about
the upcoming season. </P>

<P>&quot;This should be one of the stronger teams we've had in a long time,&quot;
Mecca suggests. &quot;Hopefully, the veterans will continue to perform
at a high level, while some of the underclassmen will also make strong
contributions.&quot; </P>

<P><B><U>WEIGHTS </U></B></P>

<P>The Jaspers should remain strong in a throwing department once again
headed by Quinlan, an All-East performer in the hammer prior to his one-year
hiatus. Junior Josh Marler, a winner in the weight throws at the both the
Jasper Relays and the Greater Boston Track Club Meet last season, returns
for his second season at Manhattan. Sophomore Joe Esposito also returns
in the shot put. Christer Hagberg, a sophomore transfer from Sweden by
way of Central Arizona J.C., was the 1996 Junior College National champion
in the hammer and finished third in the discus. He also placed second at
the 1996 Swedish Junior National Championships in the discus. </P>

<P>The Lady Jaspers return both of their throwers from last year. Senior
Vicki Rutigliano, the College record holder in the hammer, qualified for
the NCAA &quot;B&quot; standard last season. She will compete in all of
the throwing disciplines. Junior Kim Elphick, also a member of Manhattan's
volleyball team, will also compete in a variety of throwing events. Joining
that tandem this season will be freshman LaCole Fields. Fields placed second
in the shot put at the 1996 New Jersey State Championships. </P>

<P><B><U>JUMPS</U></B></P>

<P>The Jaspers suffered a big loss with the graduation of Conroy Daley,
the indoor IC4A champion in both the triple and long jump, and the outdoor
champion in the triple jump. Despite his loss, however, the Jaspers should
remain strong in this area. </P>

<P>Senior Ron Gonzalez, last season's triple jump champion at the indoor
Metropolitan Championships, returns for his final season. Gonzalez earned
All-East honors in the triple jump at last season's outdoor IC4A's and
is expected to repeat that performance again this season. Sophomore Joe
Sciuto, also an All-East honoree in the triple jump last year, also returns.
Sciuto, who also excels in the high jump, cleared a personal-best 6'9&quot;
at Princeton's May Day Invitational last. He also won the event at the
outdoor Metropolitan Championships. Also returning is sophomore Lee Burns,
who has cleared 6'8&quot; in the high jump. The trio will be joined by
sophomore transfer Christian Haar and freshman Greg Somerville, also a
member of Manhattan's soccer team. </P>

<P>The Lady Jaspers will be bolstered by the return of seniors Jacinda
Agantovich and Cassandra Grant. Grant, now in her third season following
a her transfer from Fairleigh Dickinson, has set College records in both
the indoor and outdoor long jumps. Agantovich holds Manhattan records in
the indoor and outdoor high jumps as well as in the heptathlon and pentathlon.
</P>

<P>Another senior, Melanie Clary, who usually competes in the middle distances
and sprints, will also see some activity in the jumping events, as will
Elphick. Freshman Catherine Fecinta, the 1996 Connecticut State Champion
in the 100m hurdles, also joins the squad.</P>

<P><B><U>POLE VAULT </U></B></P>

<P>Senior Sean McKenna is the Jaspers' lone returning pole vaulter. McKenna,
who took second at the Metropolitan Championships and first at the Columbia
Invitational last year, has a personal-best 15'9&quot; in the event. </P>

<P>Freshman Frank Renda, who will also compete in the pole vault, begins
his first season with the Jaspers.</P>

<P><B><U>DECATHLON/HEPTATHLON </U></B></P>

<P>Newcomer Pontus Lundkvist, a sophomore from Karlstad, Sweden, is poised
to become one of Manhattan's top decathletes. Lundkvist enters Manhattan
having won Sweden's national junior championship in the decathlon five
times and having placed 12th in the 1996 World Junior Championships. Gonzalez,
the College record holder in the pentathlon, will also be competing in
this area. </P>

<P>On the women's side, Agantovich, the College record holder in both the
pentathlon and heptathlon, and Clary, the runner-up in the pentathlon at
last year's indoor Met's, comprise a formidable duo. Fecinta, who placed
second in the heptathlon at the 1996 Connecticut Championships, will also
help in this area.</P>

<P><B><U>SPRINTS </U></B></P>

<P>With key sprinters Sean James and Dane Edwards having graduated, the
Jaspers will rely on a number of returnees to fill the void. Among them
are juniors John Sullivan and Nick Brucella, and sophomores Niall Dunne,
Michael Perretta and Sha-Keith Mills. Last year, Perretta placed second
in the 100m event at the May Day Invitational at Princeton. Dunne competed
in the mile relay, hurdles and 500m last year, while Sullivan, Mills and
Brucella were frequent members of Jasper relay teams. Sophomore Jullien
Thomas also returns after anchoring the Jaspers' 4x100m outdoor Metropolitan
champion relay team. Jumpers Gonzalez, Burns and Sciuto will also compete
in some sprint and hurdle events. Incoming freshmen Chris Johnson and Neville
Rose will also be counted on to contribute. </P>

<P>Conversely, the Lady Jaspers return most members of a strong sprint
team that includes several College record holders. Leading the way are
senior Dine Potter and junior Sophia Tasker. In 1995, Potter set Manhattan
records in the 200m, 400m, and 500m indoors, as well as the 200m and 400m
outdoors. Potter became the first Manhattan College female athlete in any
sport to participate in the Olympic Games when she represented her native
country of Antigua &amp; Barbuda last summer. She ran in both the 4x100m
and 4x400m relay events. </P>

<P>Tasker, another record-breaker, displayed great speed in establishing
the College's indoor 55m record. She also helped set several Manhattan
relay records. </P>

<P>Jumper Cassandra Grant will also contribute to the sprinting squad in
various events. Another top returnee is senior Aisha Grant (no relation),
a member of Manhattan's record-setting 4x100m relay team. Sophomore Aliann
Pompey, who finished first in the 400m at the Manhattan College Invitational
and was a key contributor in several relay events as a freshman, also returns.
</P>

<P>Rounding out the women's sprint squad are incoming freshman Fecinta
and Tiffanie Poole. </P>

<P><B><U>DISTANCE </U></B></P>

<P>To say the Jaspers will miss Michael Williams would be a huge understatement.
Williams put Manhattan Track &amp; Field back in the national spotlight
with his victory in the 800m at the 1995 NCAA Indoor Championships. His
graduation, as well as that of classmate George Higgins, an All-East performer
in the 1000m last season, leaves the Jaspers with a young distance team.
</P>

<P>Juniors Sean Lynch and sophomore Nick LaRosa (a transfer from Virginia
Tech), performed admirably during the 1996 cross-country season. They will
head a squad that features junior Bob Youker, as well as sophomores Karl
Byrne, former 5000m Connecticut State champion Geoffrey Howard, Brian Nelan,
Nick O'Connor, former Pennsylvania State mile champion Kevin Tomascik,
Rich Vincent, and sprinter/distance runner Sha-Keith Mills. Incoming freshmen
Chris Waddle and Barry Alexander will add depth to this young and inexperienced
group. </P>

<P>The Lady Jaspers distance runners will be led again (and for the last
time) by senior Margaret McParland. A two-time Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference cross country champion and a multi-Metropolitan champion in
several events, McParland will be putting the finishing touches on an outstanding
collegiate career. </P>

<P>Despite the return of McParland, the Lady Jaspers must still replace
Dahlia Henry, a Manhattan record holder in six events including the indoor
500m and the outdoor 800m. The Lady J's do return a number of talented
distance specialists including senior Carolyn Byrnes, junior Kristen Ruso,
and sophomores Elizabeth Chace, Andrea Sauer and Josephine Solimene. The
Lady J's will also be joined by senior transfer Kristen Kroger (from the
University of Massachusetts), and freshmen Dana Bodnarchuk, Lisa Edwards
and Jali Taccone. Edwards was the Lady J's top finisher at the 1996 Metropolitan
Cross Country Championships and finished third at the MAAC Championships.
</P>

<P><B><U>CONCLUSION</U></B> </P>

<P>With a strong nucleus of athletes returning, Mecca believes that success
should continue. </P>

<P>&quot;Despite the losses of Michael Williams and Conroy Daley, both
of whom were national-caliber athletes, the men's team still has the capability
to be stronger than last year,&quot; Mecca reveals. </P>

<P>The women's team, with most of their record-breakers returning, should
also experience similar success. </P>

<P>&quot;The women's team has some fine athletes returning, but they aren't
the only ones I'm expecting to see contribute,&quot; Mecca says. &quot;Our
freshman should be strong enough to help keep the team's performance at
a high level.&quot; </P>

<P>Overall, it appears that the 1996-97 edition of Manhattan College track
and field will again produce its share of winners. </P>

<H1>What is SHPE?</H1>

<HR>

<H2>History</H2>

<P>
The society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded
in Los Angeles, California, in 1974 by a group of engineers employed
by the City of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a national
organization of professional engineers to serve as role models
in the Hispanic community.
<P>
The concept of Networking was the key basis for the organization.
SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network
that would grow to encompass the nation as well as reach countries
outside the United States. Today, SHPE enjoys a strong but independent
network of professional and student chapters throughout the nation.
<H2>Objectives</H2>

<P>
The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers endeavors to:
<UL>
<LI>Promote the advancement of Hispanic engineers and Scientists
in employment and education.
<LI>Increase the number of Hispanics entering the engineering
and science fields.
<LI>Provide scholarships and educational grants to students and
support programs that enhance the Hispanic student's educational
goals.
<LI>Encourage improvement in the quality of education and promote
programs that prepare students for technical careers.
<LI>Develop an effective early outreach recruitment mechanism
to advise and encourage Hispanic students to pursue higher education
in the engineering and science fields.
<LI>Develop a retention program at the university and college
level to assist students completing their engineering degree programs.
<LI>Develop within established SHPE student chapters, peer work/study
programs to guide, counsel, and tutor lower division engineering
and science students.
<LI>Work closely with the community to promote career awareness,
self-esteem, and national pride. SHPE members are encouraged to
participate in local activities, advisory boards, and to serve
the community in general.
<LI>Inform the general public of technical contributions and achievements
of Hispanic Americans.
<LI>Provide a forum of exchange of technical information.
<LI>Develop and participate in programs with industry and educational
institutions that benefit professionals and students seeking technical
careers.
<LI>Provide members with the opportunities to expand their career
abilities through conferences and workshops. Members are encouraged
to join and participate with professional associations in their
respective fields of expertise. Many members serve on the boards
of these professional associations.

<p><h2><b>crew (kru), n. </b>1. a sport practiced in rowing boats where the participants
willfully awake before dawn and run to practice where they spend
one to two hours sitting on a hard wood seat and pull on oars to such a level as to cause their
bodies to go into oxygen debt, resulting in the
 formation of lactic acid in their blood, which causes substantial pain and discomfort in all major 
muscle groups.  This activity is usually 
performed twice a day  in the name of fun and is conducted under the demonic supervision of a
person called "coach" , with the help of his 
trained servants named "coxswain".</h2><br>

the next two hours, eight rowers and their 
coxswain seek a perfect blend of group precision and personal achievement.  That's the mental
rush of rowing and the early morning goal
is to reach beyond one's physical limits while keeping the shell moving steadily towards that
unspoken dream.</h2>

<h2><b>Head Coach:   Tom Delaney</b></h2>
<body>
<p> It is more than fitting that the Dad Vail honor Coach Tom Delaney of Manhattan College
this year.  Tom Delaney has been coaching at the Riverdale, 
New York campus since 1970, some years in extremely adverse conditions.   <p>Manhattan was
one of the three founding colleges of the Dad Vail Regatta.  In 1934, coached by Skippy Walz,
Manhattan competed against Marietta and Rutgers in Philadelphia at the first regatta.  The
Jaspers have been there ,
more or less, ever since.
<p>Tom Delaney was inducted into the Athletes' Hall of Fame at Manhattan College in 1992. 
Here is Tom's introduction at that event: Any discussion of Manhattan Crew will begin and end
with Tom Delaney, its coach for the past twenty-two years.  During his days as a student at
Manhattan, Tom became involved with crew, first as a team  member, and then as a coach.  His
impact was immediate.  He led Manhattan to its first Metropolitan Inter-Collegiate Rowing
Association team championship. He won the Varsity Four with Coxswain and was second in the
Varsity Eight.  He won the Dad Vails Regatta Varsity Four with Coxswain in Manhattan's first
entry in the event since 1939.  He helped expand the size of the crew team 
by serving as freshman coach in his senior year.
<p>After graduation, he competed in the U.S. Nationals and Canadian Henley at the Intermediate
and Senior levels and was a consistent finalist and medalist for the New York Athletic Club. 
Tom competed in the trials for the United States team and was a medalist in the major head of
the river races in Boston, Philadelphia  and Connecticut.  He also competed and won the Empire
State Games.
<p>From 1974-1979, Tom served as Secretary and then President of the Metropolitan
Inter-Collegiate Rowing Association.  He was a founding member, secretary and member of the 
Board of Directors of the Empire State Rowing Association.  From 1986 to the present, he has
been the head coach of the summertime E.S.R.A. games.
<p>As a coach, Tom began women's crew at Manhattan.  He established the Manhattan College
Crew  organization and Newsletter.  He was the organizer of the M.A.A.C. Rowing School's
Regatta.  
The numerous events, awards and regattas that Tom's teams have won over the years are
especially remarkable when you consider that virtually all of the team have never participated in
crew prior to Manhattan.
<p>However, it wasn't until September 25, 1978 that Manhattan realized just how much Tom
Delaney meant to the crew team.  It was on that day that the boat house burned  down and with
it, all of the team's equipment.  With virtually no insurance, Tom set to rebuilding the team from
the ground up...literally.  No fund raising event was left untried.  Row-a-thons, cake sales,
raffles, were all used to get the team back on the water as soon as possible.
<p>At the tenth anniversary dinner of the fire, the papers wrote that "Tom Delaney and the boat
house fire of 1978 are examples of the courage, dedication and team spirit that have become the
trademark of Manhattan Crew.  Today, Manhattan Crew is one of the most respected rowing
programs in the metropolitan area.  The fire of excellence that still drives students to the Harlem
River and that continues the fine tradition of rowing for  Manhattan College is embodied in their
coach, Tom Delaney." <p>Tom has recently steered his crew out of troubled waters once more. 
The lease expired on the Manhattan Boathouse and the crew found itself homeless again.  They
have relocated to a building on campus which means they now have to travel 25
minutes to Orchard Beach in New Rochelle to practice and compete. <p>Other coaches have
discovered that Tom is a great source of help when they have a problem securing boats or
equipment.  Always ready to lend a helping hand, Coach Delaney can be counted on to row that
extra mile for any coach or school in distress. <p>An official at Manhattan commented that
"Tom exemplifies crew.  It just flows out of him.  He is an outstanding  fund raiser and always
manages to take his crews to compete in Florida every year."
<p>Delaney's gifts of hard work and persistence are never more evident than in fund raising for
his crews.  The Manhattan crews are well supplied with boats and all necessary equipment thanks
in a large degree to Tom.
<p>The Dad Vail has been very fortunate to have been a recipient of Tom's time and talents.  He
has been the Chairman of the Dad Vail Seeding Committee since its inception.  Every year he
works until the wee hours patiently collecting data from all the  regional regattas and getting the
information to the Dad Vail Secretary in time for the planning of the regattas heats.
<p>Never discouraged no matter what the obstacles, Tom recently was heard to remark, "Every
day a little more goes wrong, but we'll get there, we always do." <p><h5><i>This biography was
printed in the Official Dad Vail Program on May 12-14, 1995.</I></h5>

<h2>Varsity Coach:  Kevin Murphy</h2>



       <p> Coach Kevin Murphy started his crew career as a Gael, rowing as a Iona College varsity
heavyweight for 4 years. There he received a bronze medal in the men's heavy four at Dad Vail's
in  '83.  He soon earned the opportunity to row for The New York Athletic Club.  Kevin was a
member and co-captain for the NYAC for ten years.  He was part of a crew that earned 4 national
Championships, including 1 Canadian Henley Championship, and participated in two Olympic
trails.  Kevin received National Championship medals in nearly every heavyweight event, both
sweeps and sculls, from intermediate to elite.  He took his winning tradition back to Iona and
coached the Gaels in 1987 to a gold medal performance and a semi-finalist performance in the
Men's pair and the men's heavy four respectively.    After a seemed hopeless dedication to Iona,
Kevin has come to his senses and is now married to a Manhattan Grad, class of  '88, and has
three sons.  He is the latest addition to the Manhattan College Crew Coaching Staff and we all
benefit from his enthusiasm and dedication.

<h2>Men's Novice Coach:  Ben Colangelo</h2>
<p>Ben Colangelo graduated from Manhattan College  in 1980 with a B.E.E.E. and in 1984 with
a B.S.C.E.  Ben currently resides in New Rochelle, New York.   <p>While he was  an
undergraduate, Ben was a coxswain that participated at all  the Champion  Rowing Regattas. 
After graduation Ben went on to cox at the New York Athletic Club in New Rochelle, New
York.  Ben's interaction with
rowing did not stop after his time at the N.Y.A.C.  Ben was a founding member of the Empire
State Rowing Association and in 1985 he served on the Board of Directors of the Empire State
Rowing Association (E.S.R.A.).  Then in the summer of 1987, Ben coached at E.S.R.A. where
five out of six of his boats medaled at the Empire State Games. Then in December of 1990, Ben
returned to Manhattan to coach the Novice Men's team where he has coached ever since.  
<p>Ben is currently working for CTE Engineers in FT. Lee, New Jersey where he works as a
Project Manager/Structural Engineer.  Ben just returned to the team after a 5 month assignment
in Charleston, South Carolina.
<p>As the Novice Men's coach, Ben welcomes "all who want to try rowing.  No experience is
needed.  The larger the group the more fun and exciting learning to act as a team can be."

<h2>Women's Novice Coach: Stephen  Famularo</h2>
<p>Stephen Famularo graduated from Manhattan College in 1995 with a B.S. in Civil
Engineering.  He then went on to UC Berkeley where he graduated in 1996 with a  M.S. in
Coastal Engineering.
While at Manhattan, Stephen rowed all 4 of his undergraduate years at the Dad Vail level.  In
1994, Stephen was 7 seat of the Manhattan Lightweight 8 that finished 5th that year.  While a
member of the Manhattan Crew team, he served as the teams Vice President from 1993-1994.
<p>This is Stephen's first year coaching at Manhattan, where he coaches the Novice Women's
team.  While a graduate student at UC Berkeley, he was a rowing coach for Berkeley High
School Women's Crew.

</center><hr>
<p>In the early 1930's, a group of Manhattan College students began an unfunded intramural
rowing program.  As interest spread, crew was picked up as a varsity sport at Manhattan.  The
team's first coach, Allan Walz, was succeeded by his son in the mid  30's, who later became
coach of a 1952 Olympic gold medalist.  The Jaspers of the 1930's were led by Tom Carhart '37,
still an ardent supporter, and Bill Galligan '38, who recently competed in Manhattan's Alumni
Row.  After Coach Walz moved on, Dan Mattheus took over until financial instability and the
lingering effects of World War II, temporarily disbanded the team in 1948.  
<p>In 1965, with the support of former varsity rowers and the dedication and perseverance of
Jaspers such as Joe Humphry, Vinnie Lewis, Bob Malafronte and Jim Sullivan, Manhattan Crew
was revived as a club.  Borrowing boats from Jack Sulger of the New York Athletic Club, the
team grew in size, until finally, with the help of Tom Welby and Brother Edward O'Neill, it
bought its first boat in 1967 for $3000.  Because of the small budget, the team was coached by
volunteers, predominantly Manhattan alumni (a tradition that continues today) and competed
only in local races.  This changed dramatically in 1970-1971 when coach Jack Cozza and team
members Jim Cassidy, Tom Groark, Tom Welby, John Danaher and current head coach, Tom
Delaney won gold in a borrowed boat at the prestigious Dad Vail Regatta in Philadelphia.
When Coach Cozza retired the following season, Tom Delaney, then a senior on the
team, took over the head coaching responsibilities.  Under his leadership and with the help of
Steve Quheliano, later to become a Team USA coxswain and coach at the '88 Olympics in
Korea, the team moved to Fordham's boathouse on the Harlem River.  In 1977, as the men's
team continued to grow, a women's team was started, led by Kathy McCarrick and current
Manhattan College trainer Lisa Toscano, both also members of the first Lady Jaspers basketball
team.  The teams of this era continued to experience substantial success, including sending a
lightweight 4+ to the finals of the Dad Vail. 
<p>In the fall of 1978, the team was struck by disaster.  A fire in the Fordham boathouse
destroyed
all but one Manhattan shell.  But once again, Manhattan College Crew did not die.  A group of
extremely dedicated rowers led by Jerry Houlihan, a US and Canadian national champion, Eddie
Ortiz, Bob Coords and Brendan Widen and assisted by Dr. Jerome Cashman and Brother Stephen
Sullivan galvanized a group of individuals to once again revive the team.  Through various
fund-raisers, including a cocktail party and T-shirts labeled "Manhattan Crew is All Fired Up",
the
team leased a Con-Ed building on the Harlem.  Manhattan engineering students like Mike Russo
and John Tesko designed and built new docks and the team, once again, began the rebuilding
process.  In 1979, the team christened a new boat "Jasper Spirit" to represent the qualities and
values that keep Manhattan College Crew alive.
<p>During the  80's, the team continued to prosper.  The school won eight Metropolitan team
titles
and from  85-'89, Manhattan College had the top lightweight men's program in the area.  With
the help of an increased budget from the athletic department, alumni contributions and the
coaches' generosity of time and money, the team has upgraded to top of the line racing
equipment and has continued its dominance of the Metropolitan area into the  90's.
<p>Recently, the team has experienced another bout with adversity.  In the spring of 1994, the
boathouse the team had occupied for the last ten years was condemned, forcing the team to move
temporarily to the Iona boathouse in Pelham, NY and trailer boats over from the New York
Athletic Club each morning.  In the spring of 1996, a northeaster blew two racing shells off the
club's trailer, putting them out of commission for the rest of the season.  The team, though, did
not go out of commission.  Even with decreased water time, earlier hours and extensive damage
to boats, Manhattan College Crew has pushed on.  During the last three years the women's team
has swept the MAAC and a men's 2+ has medaled at the Dad Vail Regatta.  In light of all these
events, along with the team's refusal to quit, another shell has been christened the "Jasper Spirit"
to recognize that the attitudes of perseverance, dedication and sacrifice for the sake of the team
are still alive and well. 
<p>Much of the team's success and commitment can be attributed to the 1995 Dad Vail Regatta
Coach of the Year, Tom Delaney.  Tom has epitomized the Jasper Spirit in both his rowing and
his personal life.  It is to him that the program, and all of its members past and present, owes its
deepest thanks.

At the final meeting of the International Student Association last semester, the officers for 1996 - 1997 were elected.  Due to the withdrawal of our newly elected president, new elections were held at the first scheduled ISA meeting of the present semester.  As a result, the ISA officers for this year are:
<p>
Omar Koreitem - President<br>
Ghassan Sabra  - Vice President<br>
Jeffy Cherian   - Secretary/Treasurer<br>
<p>
With a year of experience under their belts, the officers are poised for a semester of exciting activities.  Among them are our usual restaurant visits, movie screenings, and perhaps a mixer later this semester or early next year.  
<br>
The club has been meeting every other Wednesday in Miguel Hall Room 214.  Our next meeting will be this Wednesday, October 16th at 3:30pm in preparation for our first restaurant visit.  We hope to see you there!!

<i>Trip to Thai Restaurant A Go!</i><br>
<p>
On Friday, November 1, the ISA will sponsor its first trip downtown to have dinner at a Thai Restaurant.<br>
We have been looking at several restaurants in the Village and Chinatown.  Ideally, we are looking for a restaurant which is inexpensive and has authentic (and delicious) food.  Several students have gone to these restaurants and will be reporting back to us this week.  If you are interested in joining us, please sign up in the International Student Advisor's Office in Magill Hall - Room 207A.<br>
<P>  

As always, we will meet outside Thomas Hall at 5:45 pm that Friday evening and take the subway to the restaurant together.  The International Student Association will supply subway tokens the anyone who accompanies us.  EVERYONE is encouraged to join us for an evening of good food and good company.

<p>
<i>Open House Set for Sunday, October 27th</i>
<p>
The Manhattan College campus will be playing host to hundreds of high school students who have expressed interest in attending the college when the annual Fall Open House takes place later this month.  Sponsored by the Admissions and Financial Aid Office, Open House is designed to give these prospective students a preview of what it's like to study and live here.  

The day will kick-off at noon in the Chapel of De La Salle and his Brothers with Br. Thomas Scanlan, President of Manhattan College extending a warm welcome to our guests.  Afterward several informative sessions will be presented by Mr. Jack Brennan, Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid, and other campus administrators.  At 1:00, everyone is invited up to Draddy Gymnasium where all of the academic departments, student life offices, clubs, and extracurricular organizations will have exhibits on display designed to showcase all of the various programs, activities, and events available to anyone who attends the college.
<p>
As always, the International Student Association and the Office of the International Student Advisor will be staffing a table in the gym.  We would like to extend an invitation to any of our members who would like to join us to come to the gym on Sunday, October 27th between 12:30 and 3:30 pm.  We look forward to seeing you there!!

<h2><center>THANKS GIVING DINNER</h2></center>
<hr>
<p><b>
On November 21st, ISA (International Student Association) and ACAC (African Caribbean American Club)<br>
organized their first annual Thanksgiving Dinner in Plato's Annex.<br>
Food from several cultures was served by members of both clubs.<br>
One Drum provided the entertainment by performing many African tunes.
<P>
The party was a huge success!<br>
It all started when the presidents of both clubs welcomed everybody<br>
and blessed the food. The presidents made a promise to make this event<br>
an annual one. Judging from the crowded audience, the smiles on every<br>
one's face and the great food that was served, this dinner is going<br>
to be one of the fall's main events on campus!

<IMG SRC="essent.gif" ALT = "EPRI-NRCEC: Essential Community Services"> 

	<p>Clean drinking water, effective wastewater treatment and safe and efficient healthcare facilities are vital services needed in all communities.  These safeguards protect the public health, strengthen the community infrastructure, and provide a foundation for economic growth.  Yet increasing concerns about the adequacy of existing services are posing serious challenges to local communities.  These concerns are felt not just in the United States, but internationally as well. </p>

<p><center><IMG SRC="usage.gif" alt = "Usage Chart"> </center></p>
	
	<p>Water and wastewater utilities and healthcare industries are major electricity users, requiring an estimated 125 billion kWh (kilowatt hours), or about 5% of the U.S. market annually.  With their needs for new and improved technologies clearly established, their use of electricity is expected to increase over the next 15 years.</p>

<H4>Community Environmental Center</H4>

	<p>To address these concerns, the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) Industrial and Agricultural business area established the Northeast Regional Community Environmental Center (NRCEC) in 1994.  The NRCEC, located at Manhattan College in New York City, has quickly become a national and international leader in developing and deploying electrotechnologies.  Its mission is to accelerated use of innovative electrotechnologies by facilitating partnerships among electric utilities, industry, and research associations.  The NRCEC directs these types of activities through <b>EPRI's <i>Municipal Water and Wastewater (MWW) Program</i></b> and the <b><i>Healthcare Initiative (HCI)</i></b>.</p>

<title> Description</title>
</head>
<body>
<dd> This Study presents examples of the diversity of the major plant groups and is designed in a way that the user can browse all or specific plant descriptions.  It is intended as a resource  for students at all levels, grades 9 through college, as well as amateurs who appreciate plants as gifts of nature.   Whereas the Study provides the basic information necessary to pursue advanced areas of the plant sciences and may be considered as a requirement for Biology majors at the baccalaureate level, it also contains links to more extensive data at other Web sites. <p>
 
<dd>The html files  have been designed for quick downloading.  The .gif files of some graphics range from 2 - 30 K and there are some digitized photographs that may be as large as 80 K. A notation appears in the text describing these components as "larger .gif files" which would require more download time.  Also, some plant examples are linked to other Internet sites for further information. 
<body><hr>

<H3> Installing Network Drivers</H3>

This document is intended for users connecting their
Windows95 computers to JasperNet. The ethernet card used
in all examples is the Kingston EtherRx LC supplied in the
Student Connectivity Package.
<br>
Users are expected to have correctly installed the Student
Connectivity Package network card.
<P>

<H4> 1.0 Installing Win95 Hardware Support </H4>
<P>
	Make sure you have your Windows95 media (CD or disks).
<P>
   1. Open the "Control Panel" and open the "Network" folder.
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_1.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
   2. Select "Add".
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_2.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
   3. Select "Adapter" and hit "Add"
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_3.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
   4. From the Select Adapter window, chose <I>Novell/Anthem</I>
on the left and <I> NE2000 Compatible </I> and the right. Hit "OK".
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_4.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
   5. The Network Control Panel will appear as shown below.
Select "NE2000 Compatible". Select <I> Identification </I>
and enter/configure as you want (it really doesn't matter, 
what you call your computer etc.)
<br>
It is then necessary to configure the card settings. Go back to
"Configuration" and hit "Properties". 
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_8.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
	6. Select "resources" and setup your IRQ and IO address, 
and hit OK.
<P> THE ETHERNET CARDS COME FACTORY SET TO IRQ=3 and IO=300.
IF THIS CONFLICTS WITH ANY HARDWARE ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU MUST
CHANGE IT. WE RECOMMEND IRQ=10 AND IO=280. YOU THEN HAVE TO SET 
THE ETHERNET CARD SETTINGS TO MATCH YOUR WINDOWS95 SETTINGS.
THIS IS DONE IN DOS MODE USING 
<I> QSTART </I> , FROM THE KINGSTON DISK, OR 
<I> SETUP </I>, FROM THE JASPERNET DISK (see the Kingston docs.
for more information on setting the IRQ and IO).
<p>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_6.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
	7. Follow  all on-screen prompts.
<P>
At this point you have added the hardware support. You now have
to add the "Protocol Support"  (ie TCP/IP aka INTERNET).
<P>
<H4> 2.0 Installing Protocol Support : TCP/IP </H4>
You  have to setup the correct protocol support. You should
install TCP/IP ( Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
<P>
	1. From the "Network" folder hit "Add". Select "Protocol" 
hit "Add" again.
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_7.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>

	2. Select "Microsoft" and "TCP/IP" then hit "OK".
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_10.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
	3. From the "Network" folder select "TCP/IP" and hit
"Properties".
<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_11.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>
	4. From the "IP Address" page select <I> Obtain IP
address automatically </I> ( this is where your registration 
comes in, <B>until you register your TCP/IP will not work</B> 
you will probably get DHCP errors, but at least you've set it up. 
Register your ethernet address at <A href="http://reg.manhattan.edu">
http://reg.manhattan.edu </A>).

<P>
<CENTER> <IMG SRC="win95_12.gif"> </CENTER>
<P>

Select "OK", and follow the instructions. (Did I mention 
having your Win95 media handy?)

<P>

<A NAME=winipcfg> </A>
<H4>  3.0 Determining your Ethernet (NIC) Address </H4>
<P>
Your ethernet address was printed on the back of the ethernet card, but if
you didn't write in down run the command:<br>
<T> <B><I> winipcfg </I></B> <br>
(it should be in your WINDOWS directory).
Your 12 digit ethernet address will be of the form:
<B>00C0F00D97CE </B> (leave the dashes out when you register).
<P>

<H4>
As of September 9, 1996 the <I>Student Connectivity Package</I> is
available to the general student body through the office of Residence
Life in Jasper Hall room 222. The package was designed by the 
Networking & Information Systems Group to allow student's with
personal computers connect to JasperNet, the campus network. The
package contains a Kingston EtherRx ISA 10BaseT Ethernet adapter,
a 10' RJ-45 patch cable, a specially design installation program,
and documentation describing how to install and configure the
adapter card.

While
the package is specifically geared toward personal computers running
MS-DOS & Microsoft Windows v3.x / Windows for Workgroups v3.x it can
be used by people running Microsoft Windows 95 with a few configuration
notes and changes. Students wishing to purchase the <I>Student Connectivity
Package</I> should pay the $49.95 fee to the Bursar's Office and bring
the receipt to Residence Life in Jasper Hall room 222. The instructions
that are contained within the package should be followed to the letter.

Printing to local printers from the version of Windows that resides 
on the network is broken.  You may use the DOS version of Pegasus 
Mail if you wish to print out your electronic mail. The command is 
simple 'MAIL'....

Date sent:      Fri, 1 Sep 1995 10:15:42

It would seem that there are severe problems with the Windows Hewlett 
Packard DeskJet printer drivers. The problem affects only those 
people that run Windows from the Novell Network, and have a local 
Hewlett Packard DeskJet printer attached (via LPT1) to their personal 
computers.


Our technical support staff is currently working on correcting the 
problem.  Once the problem has been corrected, everyone will be 
notified of the changes that will be needed/made.

<PRE>
From:		"Michael F. McNamara, Network Mgr" <MCS1/MFM>
Subject:		Warning: Virus Information Enclosed
Date:		Thu, 19 Oct 1995 12:07:17

Please read the following very carefully.. important information!

   In the past two months since the start of the fall semester there 
has been a growing problem of computer virii infecting machines 
throughout the college campus, most notably in the computer labs. 
Most of these virii are harmless, however, a growing number of them 
are very dangerous and have been known to destroy the entire contents 
of peoples local hard disks.  While some virii can be spread through 
the network, and more noteably the Internet, most are spread on 
floppy disks.  The Novell NetWare Servers are monitored by virus 
software that has been installed for sometime, however the local 
workstations must be checked individually.

There are a few hints or pointers that should be observed :

- check your machine for virii on a daily basis
- be careful exchanging disks with other people (especially students)
- before you turn on your machine make sure that there isn't a floppy
  disk already inside the diskette drive. this is the #1 way people
  infect their machines.
- make diskette backups of critical data
- have a bootable system disk for emergencies

The McAfee Virus Scanner is licensed for use at Manhattan College, 
and can be found in the following two locations:

Internet ftp://ftp.mancol.edu/pub/msdos/antivirus/scni226e.zip
Novell NetWare Servers g:\updates\public\scni226e.zip

You should copy this file down to your local hard disk and then 
unarchive it with the command 'pkunzip scni226e', there is an 
installation program that should then be run with the command 
'install'.

If you're logged into the Novell Network you can quickly check your 
machine and disketts with the following command :

scan c: /boot

If you need to check floppy diskettes, just replace the 'c:' with 
'a:' and run the command again.  If you would like the program to try 
and remove a virus add the '/clean' parameter and run the command 
again.. (eg. scan c: /boot /clean)

From:		"Michael McNamara, Network Mgr" <mfm@mancol.edu> 
Subject:	FYI::Logging Out of Novell Servers
Date sent:	Mon, 11 Sep 1995 09:35:58

There has always been a problem of people logging into the Novell 
NetWare servers and then attempting to logout, finding that their 
local path statements where gone.  Well with the latest update of 
network drivers that Julio is performing.. I've put in a 'backdoor' 
that will allow us to finally fix this problem.  The command 'LO' 
will now log people off the network and reset their local path 
statements to what it was before they logged into the network. 
It will NOT attempt to unload the network drivers!  This might cause 
people's machines to hang or crash if they've loaded drivers after 
the last network driver.

This will only work if the evironment variable LPATH is set in the 
AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  This environment variable is included in the 
ODI driver updates.

Date sent:	Mon, 20 Nov 1995 12:06:40

You've been identified as having an insecure NetWare password. 

Please consider the following when selecting your password :

 -  don't use a first or last name
 -  don't use a common word found in a dictionary
 -  don't use just numbers
 
 -  use a combination of words/letters and numbers
 -  change your password every 90 days or when prompted by
    the system to do so.. failure to change your password
    after the grace login period will lock you out.
    
Please don't use 'jasper'.....     

Please select a new password as soon as possible.

The command to change your password is SETPASS, and
it can be executed at the DOS prompt. Follow the prompts
carefully and slowly. Make sure to verify your new password.

The Academic Computer Center only schedules and performs major upgrades
or installations twice during the calander year.  The first window appears
after the second summer semester, usually in the month of August.  The
second window appears during the winter recess in the months of December
and January.  We realize that these periods can cause unwanted down time
and problems for our users, but feel that the improvements gained as a
result of the work being performed will outweigh the initial dismay on
the part of users.<BR>

The Novell NetWare Server <B>MCS2</B> will be offline for maintenance on
both of these days.  This means that there will be no services for any
workstation that connects to MCS2 as it's primary file server. When you
start your workstation on either of these mornings it will most
likely complain about "File Server Not Found" or it won't accept your
password or username. You can simply ignore the messages and use your
workstation as a standalone machine (granted you have the applications
installed locally on your hard drive).<BS>
<P>
If you desperately need to access
some of the applications that are available on the network you may call
Julio Rodriguez at extension 706. Simply introduce yourself and explain
that you'd like to connect to the alternate backup server. He'll talk you
through what you'll need to do in order to connect to the alternate server.
Please be aware that there will be no printing, email, or tcp/ip services
on the alternate server... ONLY APPLICATION PACKAGES.

The Novell NetWare Server <B>MCS1</B> will be offline for maintenance on both
of these days.  This means that there will be no service for any workstation
that connects to MCS2 as it's primary file server.  When you start your workstation
on either of these mornings it will most likely complain about "File Server Not
Found" or it won't accept your password or username. You can simply ignore the
messages and use your workstation as a standalone machine (granted you have the
applications installed locally on your hard drive).<BS>

If you desperately need to access
some of the applications that are available on the network you may call
Julio Rodriguez at extension 706. Simply introduce yourself and explain

Please be aware that there will be no printing, email, or tcp/ip services

<PRE>
We can only provide the email addresses of people on our systems.
Unfortunately, we have no way of knowing the email addresses of
people outside our computer systems.

You can check our homepage at http://www.mancol.edu/email.html,
this will provide you with the email addresses of people at this
institution. Other colleges and universities usually provide a
similar service on their world wide web servers. I would suggest
you try their WWW site.  If you know the last two stanzas in the
domain name of the school you can figure out the WWW site name.

Example:
 mcs3.mancol.edu  -> www.mancol.edu
 whatever.iona.edu -> www.iona.edu
 whatever.mit.edu  -> www.mit.edu

You can even try contacting the postmaster of the institution,
and request some help or information. Again apply the same method
above to determine the postmaster's email address.

Example:
 mcs3.mancol.edu  -> postmaster@mcs3.mancol.edu
 whatever.iona.edu  -> try postmaster@iona.edu
 whatever.mit.edu -> try postmaster@mit.edu

If you familiar with Unix, you can try a 'whois' command on the
domain name from a Unix login prompt. (eg. whois mancol.edu) will
return the domain information for Manhattan College.

THE EASIEST WAY TO DETERMINE SOMEONE'S EMAIL ADDRESS IS TO ASK THEM

There is an ICON on the Windows desktop to perform this function.

The system will ask you to enter your old password, then it'll ask
you for a new password, and lastly it'll ask for confirmation of
your new password. The password you select should be longer than
five characters and should be something that you'll remember.

Where are you logging in from now? You probably typed you password in 
incorrectly, those few times... O's look alot like 0's(zeros)...be
sure to carefully and slowly type in your passwd...if you enter your
password incorrectly more than five times, the system will lock your
account for 25 minutes fearing that someone is trying to break into
your account...after 25 minutes you can try logging in again.

That server only offers electronic mail... you must exit windows and 
the system will log you back into the applications server where you'll
find all the latest and greatest TCP/IP applications.  Please bear in
mind that TCP/IP services are provided to support student research.

There is no access to the Novell NetWare Network from external 
points, you may wish to use the VAX/VMS system. It has dialup
access although it also has a very ugly and old mail system.

Use of the Novell NetWare Network requires a personal computer
that is located on campus and networked to the campus backbone.

No.. There is no dialup system for this service.

The system hasn't changed at all... your using a new system.

You can still access the Academic VAX/VMS system from dialups 
however, there is no access to the Novell Network from dialups.

Plans are in the works to network the campus dormitories, when this 
is complete you will be able to access the internet and the campus 
network through your personal computer via a network card.

There is no remote(dialup)access for using the Novell NetWare Network.

We aren't an ISP (Internet Service Provider) and as such we don't 
provide PPP or SLIP services.  There are many providers in the local 
area that will be of help to you for a certain charge.

If you do have an ISP and POP3 mail is available through your ISP, you 
may set your POP3 server as mcs3.mancol.edu and recieve your email 
through the college while using an external access point.

Mail folders are provided to help you organize saved messages. Instead
of dumping every mail message you've ever recieved into one folder you
can split them up into different folders this way it'll be easy to
find something later down the road, when you might need it again.

The online help is quite extensive and should be very helpfull..

Read messages are automatically stored in the Main Mail Folder.

You can learn best by fiddling with these services. The lab 
workstations located in both the DeLaSalle Computer Laboratory
and the Research & Learning Center all have Internet access
via the TCP/IP applications installed in Windows.

What is the reason the mail system gives for returning the mail 
messages? Electronic mail is quite complex and it is possible that 
they're rely-to addresses are setup incorrectly.  Are they MX mail 
addresses (are they really short)? What are the addresses? Check the 
headers in the mail that you're recieving and see what the actually 
address is.. not the default reply-to address but the FROM address.

While email is alot faster and more reliable than postal mail, there
can sometimes be problems with delivery between certains systems.

<B>Subject:</B> Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade Plans<br>
<B>Date sent:</B> Mon, 21 Aug 1995 13:04:28<br>

<P>
Some network users have expressed an interest in the much
publicized Windows95. While Windows95 marks an important turning 
point in the personal computer market, it shouldn't be regarded
as a MINOR upgrade. The product is scheduled to be released this
week on the 24th of August.  We will be reviewing Windows95 in the 
near future and hope to devise an upgrade plan and schedule. Prudent 
system administration dictates that we not yet jump on this 
bandwagon.<BR>

<P>
Until that time, NO SUPPORT will be provided for Windows95 users.
Feel free to implement it at your own risk on your local computers 
but you may experience problems with connectivity to or use of the 
Novell NetWare Network including both Internet access and electronic
mail.<BR>

<B>Microsoft Issues Boza Virus Customer Advisory</B></A><BR>
Microsoft has learned that Microsoft Windows 95 is the target of a new computer virus, the
"Boza" virus. McAfee, an anti-virus software vendor, has posted a update to address this
virus, and Symantec will do so shortly.

<H3>Overview</H3>
<UL>
The Manhattan College community has been a part of the Internet since 
March 30, 1992. In the begining days, the DEC VAX (MANVAX) was the only
platform that enabled people to send and receive Internet mail (E-Mail).
Soon afterwords, the IBM PC-RT Unix Workstations were upgraded to the
current IBM-RS/6000 Unix Workstations, and they too could communicate 
with the outside world.  Only recently has there be an exploding awareness
of the Internet and its abilities.  As a direct result the Novell NetWare
Network was also given the ability to communicate on the Internet. While
each of the above mentioned platforms still has the ability to communicate
with the Internet, the Novell NetWare Network has become the preferred choice
by the majority of users.

------------------------------

Subject: Introduction.

This is a periodic posting on how to get information about the Internet and
how to get information about connecting to the (US) National Science
Foundation's NSFNET through an NSF-affiliated regional network, or to get
commercial Internet service through a commercial service provider.

Because the contents of the documents referred to in this posting are
constantly being updated, this posting only describes how to obtain a
current copy rather than providing the data directly.

In this document, electronic mail addresses, commands that you should use
and other such references are indented by a single TAB character
(may appear on your screen as some number of spaces, typically 8)
When you use the reference, do not include the TAB.

------------------------------

Subject: Table of Contents.

        1. Introduction.
        2. Table of Contents.
        3. The Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC).
        4. Internet documents and specifications.
        5. Commercial networks.
        6. Contributors.

------------------------------

Subject: The Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC).

The Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) makes current
documentation on the NSFNET available via a mail server, by anonymous ftp,
gopher, WAIS and the World-Wide Web.  If all else fails, you can contact
them by phone.  The InterNIC has a wealth of documents on the Internet; by
the time you finish reading the introductory ones, you probably won't need
this posting any more!

+ Getting information via electronic mail. (some sort of E-mail access needed)

If you're on some sort of network that can send and receive electronic
mail from the Internet, you can get various documents from the InterNIC's
automated mail server.  Send mail to

        mailserv@is.internic.net

and leave the "Subject" line blank.  Here's a suggested initial message:

        begin
        help
        index
        send about-infoguide/about-infoguide
        end

Be sure your mailer puts out a valid "From:" line that the server can
respond to!  If you have problems with the reply (eg. you don't get
a reply within a few days), try sending the same message with the line

        reply YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS

after the begin line.  Make sure YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS is one that can
be replied to from the Internet.  Ask your site's postmaster for
help, if you need to.


+ Using Gopher (Internet access needed)

Use your "gopher" client program to connect to
        gopher.internic.net

eg. on a typical Unix machine, try
        gopher gopher.internic.net

or, if you do not have a gopher client installed, you can use a
"telnet" client program to connect to 
        gopher.internic.net 

eg.
        telnet gopher.internic.net

When you get the login: prompt, reply

        gopher

+ Using the anonymous File Transfer Protocol (FTP) (Internet access needed)

Use your FTP client program to connect to
        is.internic.net

eg.
        ftp is.internic.net

When you get the login: prompt, reply

        anonymous

and follow the instructions on your screen.


+ Using Wide Area Information Services (WAIS) (Internet access needed)

source name: internic-infoguide
server name: is.internic.net

+ World-Wide Web (WWW) (Internet access needed)

With your WWW client (eg. Lynx, Mosaic or WWW), give the reference

        http://www.internic.net/


------------------------------

Subject: Internet documents and specifications.

General Internet information documents are available from the
DDN Network Information Center (which is part of the Internet).
There are several "For Your Information (FYI)" documents
published as part of the Internet "Request For Comments (RFC)" 
series of documents.  These can be helpful in getting a better 
understanding of the Internet and its services and organization.  
Experienced, novice, and would-be Internet users can all benefit 
from reading these documents.

Included among these are:

  RFC-1325 FYI-4: Answers to commonly asked "new Internet user" questions
  RFC-1462 FYI-20: "What is the Internet"
  RFC-1208 Glossary of Networking Terms
  RFC-1207 FYI: Answers to commonly asked "experienced Internet user" questions
  RFC-1178 Choosing a Name for your Computer
  RFC-1150 FYI on FYI: Introduction to the FYI notes

To learn how to retrieve RFCs, get the following document by anonymous
ftp from isi.edu:

        in-notes/rfc-retrieval.txt

You can also get the information by sending electronic mail to

        rfc-info@isi.edu

with the body of the message:

        help: ways_to_get_rfcs

------------------------------

Subject: Commercial networks.

The Internet is composed of many networks, not just those sponsored or
affiliated with the US Government. There are also commercial Internet
service providers.  Commercial firms that might not meet requirements for
connecting to a US Government-related network can still connect to the
TCP/IP Internet via commercial service providers not affiliated with the
NSFNET or the DDN Internet.

For a list of dialup Internet service providers, send email to
info-deli-server@netcom.com with the single line query:
        Send PDIAL

For a list of Internet service providers that offer Integrated
Services Digital Network (ISDN) high-speed dialup access
at 64kbps or higher, try
        http://alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn

For a list of Internet (and UUCP) service providers, see the frequent
posting "How to Become a Usenet Site" in the news.admin.misc,
news.announce.newusers and news.answers newsgroups.  (Archive-name:
usenet/site-setup) You can also get this document by anonymous ftp from
rtfm.mit.edu, or by sending mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with the
single line request:
        send usenet-by-group/news.announce.newusers/How_to_become_a_Usenet_site

O'Reilly and Associates has a mail server that provides a list
of Internet Access providers who offer dedicated line connections.
Send e-mail to:
        dlist@ora.com
with an empty message body. If you have problems getting the
information from dlist, send email to mj@ora.com

If you have access to the WWW, you can get more info on
network providers in different countries from the rather
large list of all registered WWW servers at:
        http://www.w3.org/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Geographical.html

<center><b><h2>POLICY ON DIAGNOSTIC TESTING WITHIN THE SRC</h2></b></center>

<hr>
<p>
There will be no diagnostic testing administered within the SRC.  We
 are not in control of other departments, and thus, cannot guarantee
 that such testing is being completed by other groups, such as the 
Counseling Center.  The SRC, in its interpretation of the ADA and
 Section 504, believes that either all students requesting diagnostic 
testing receive these services, or no student will be administered
 diagnostic exams.  There are no plans to initiate diagnostic testing on
 campus slated for the foreseeable future.

<center><h2><b>DIFFERENTIATING FEE VERSUS NON-FEE BASED PROGRAMS</h2></b></center>

<hr>
<p>
In an effort to make certain there is no confusion between the two programs,
 listed below are the characteristics of the fee-based program.
<p>
Characteristics specific to the fee-based program:
<p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Approximately one hundred hours<i> (academic year)</i> of enhanced 
small group, process-oriented workshops.
<p>
<li>Enhanced intervention with tutors
<p>
<li>A three tier payment above the normal tuition and room & board fees
</ul>
</ul>
Any student enrolled in the fee-based program may opt out at any stage of the
 semester, although  students wishing to withdraw during any given term, will
 be subject to the same fiscal penalties and time lines associated with dropping 
a course.  Students wishing to join the fee-based program, must do so prior to
 the start of an academic term.

<hr>

<ol>
<li>A needs assessment will be conducted annually <i>(June)</i>, and the needs assessment will include the 
following components:
<p>
<ul>
<li> A review of the students registered with the SRC, scheduled to return for the fall semester.
<p>
<li> A review of the incoming students<i> (freshman & transfer)</i>, pre-registered with the SRC.
<p>
<li> A meeting with the Assistant Provost, Director of the Computer Center, and the Director of the 
Library, to ascertain common needs and update a listing of current adaptive equipment on campus.
</ul>
<p>
<li>The narrow band of specialties often associated with many of the hard and software 
manufacturers of adaptive equipment, may at times leave only a single vendor offering a specific 
product.  If this is the case, it must be documented by contacting a minimum of two other vendors 
within the same	field.
<p>
<li>All purchases are subject to the parameters set forth by the Business Manager.
<p>
<li>Whenever possible, both hard and software will be placed within an integrated setting, such as
 one of the computer labs on campus.
<p>
<li>Whenever possible, both hard and software will be available to the Manhattan College community 
at large, when not being used by a special needs student.
<p>
<li>All items purchased for use by special needs students are the property of Manhattan College.

FACULTY:	Adjustments may in no way alter the integrity of your curriculum components.  The SRC counts
on your input to maintain its efficacy, regarding its mandate to create an environment built on equal access for
special needs students.  The best plan of action is usually created during office hours, with a faculty member and
student in attendance, without the intervention of an SRC member; think of the adjustments on this form as
guideposts.  ALL ADJUSTMENTS ARE FOR THE CLASS AND SEMESTER SPECIFIED BELOW.
PLEASE DO NOT CARRY OVER ADJUSTMENTS TO OTHER CLASSES OR SEMESTERS.

<center><h2><b>AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES
GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE</h2></b></center>

<hr>

<p>
Manhattan College has adopted an internal procedure which provides for
 the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints alleging any action
 prohibited by the U.S. Department of Justice regulations implementing 
Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  Titled II states, in
 part, that no otherwise qualified disabled individual shall, solely by reason
 of such disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits
 of, or be subjected to discrimination in programs or activities sponsored by
 a public entity.  
<HR SIZE=5>
<p>
Complaints should be addressed to the Director of the Specialized Resource
 Center, Miguel Hall, Room 300A, (718) 920-0101, who has been designated
 to coordinate ADA compliance efforts.
<p>
<ol>
<li>A complaint should be filed in writing, containing the name and address
 of the person filing it, and briefly describing the alleged violation of the regulations.
<p>
<li>A complaint should be filed within 10 workdays after the complainant becomes
 aware of the alleged violation where a specific incident or occurrence happens.
<p>
<li>An investigation conducted by the ADA Coordinator, as may be appropriate, shall
 follow the filing of a complaint.  The investigation shall be informal but thorough,
 and afford all interested persons and their representatives, if any, an opportunity to 
submit evidence relevant to the complaint.
<p>
<li>A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and a description of the
 resolution, if any, shall 	be issued by the ADA Coordinator and forwarded to the
 complainant no later than 10 workdays after its filing.
<p>
<li>The ADA Coordinator shall maintain the files and records relating to the 
complaints filed.
<p>
<li>The complainant can request a reconsideration of the case in instances of
 dissatisfaction with the resolution.  The request for reconsideration should be
 made within 10 workdays to the Colleges EEO/AA Officer, Ms. Vicki Cowan.
  A written determination as to the validity of the complaint and a 	description 
of the resolution, if any, shall be issued by the EEO/AA Officer and forwarded 
to the complainant within 10 workdays after the request for reconsideration.
<p>
<li>If a grievance is against the ADA Coordinator, the ADA Grievance Procedure
 is followed except the complaint should be filed with the Colleges EEO/AA Officer
 and the request for reconsideration should be filed with the President.
<p>
<li>The right of a person to a prompt and equitable resolution of the complaint filed
 hereunder shall not be impaired by nor shall the use of this procedure be a prerequisite
 to the pursuit of other remedies. 
<p>
<li>These rules shall be construed to protect the substantive rights of interested 
persons, to meet appropriate due process standards, and to assure that Manhattan 
College complies with the ADA and implementation of the regulation.

Scanlan, F.S.C.</I></A><P><IMG SRC="b-scanla.jpg"><BR><P>Br. Thomas J. Scanlan, F.S.C., was appointed president of ManhattanCollege in 1987. Prior to his appointment, Br. Scanlan was vicechancellor and chief executive officer of Bethlehem University,Bethlehem, West Bank, a private, independent institution sponsoredby the Vatican and directed by the Institute of the Brothers ofthe Christian Schools.<P>Since Brother's arrival on the Riverdale campus, his energy andvitality have been far-reaching. In addition to an extensive campusrenovation program, he spearheaded the construction of the EastHill Student Residence, the largest housing facility in ManhattanCollege history. The 730-bed, 11-story structure offers studentsthe most up-to-date features in quality living. Br. Scanlan'sguiding hand can be seen in the rejuvenation of the athletic programas well. Increased funding for scholarships and staff have onceagain brought Manhattan's teams to competitive prominence.<P>In 1987, Brother was awarded the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifici Crossfrom Pope John Paul II for service to the Catholic Church in theHoly Land. A 20-year veteran in the field of education, Br. Scanlanwas director of finance and education for the New York Provinceof the Brothers of the Christian Schools from 1978 to 1981, wherehe presided over the Province's 14 educational institutions. Heserved for eight years at Queen of Peace High School, North Arlington,NJ; first as a member of the faculty, then as vice principal,and from 1972 to 1975, as the principal. During the late '70s,Brother was an instructor in organizational behavior for the ManhattanCollege School of Business.<P>A member of Phi Beta Kappa, Br. Scanlan earned a doctorate inorganizational behavior from Columbia University; a Master's degreefrom New York University, and a bachelor's degree from The CatholicUniversity of America. His many professional affiliations includemembership with the Academy of Management, the Association ofCatholic Colleges and Universities, Chief Administrators of CatholicEducation, Christian Brothers Regional Finance Committee and NewYork Coalition for Responsible Investment.<P>Br. Scanlan served on the boards of Caritas Baby Hospital, Bethlehem,Israel; La Salle Academy, New York; and the Public Library ofNorth Arlington, NJ. <P><A NAME="mission_statement"><B>MISSION STATEMENT</B></A><P>Manhattan College, overlooking Van Cortlandt Park in Riverdale,is a private, independent institution of higher learning whichembraces qualified men and women of all faiths, races, and ethnicbackgrounds. Established in 1853, the College is founded uponthe Lasallian Catholic tradition of excellence in teaching, respectfor individual dignity, and commitment to social justice inspiredby the innovator of modern pedagogy, John Baptist de la Salle.<P>The mission of Manhattan College is to provide a contemporary,person-centered educational experience characterized by high academicstandards, reflection on values and principles, and life-longcareer preparation. This is achieved in two ways: by offeringstudents programs which integrate a broad liberal education withconcentration in specific disciplines in the arts and sciences,or with professional preparation in business, education and engineering;and by nurturing a caring, pluralistic campus community.<P>The learning experience at Manhattan College is enriched by cooperativeprograms with other institutions, by postgraduate professionalprograms and by capitalizing on its location on the edge of thecultural center and global marketplace that is New York City.<BR><BR><P><A NAME="almamater"><B>ALMA MATER</B></A><P>Hail to thee, our Alma Mater! Of Thy fame we sing today;<P>And our hearts exult within us, as this tribute we thee pay.<P>For we love thy sacred precincts, thy fair banners bright andgay;<P>And thy name shall live in honor, Old Manhattan ever more.<P>And thy name shall live in honor, Old Manhattan ever more.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="steeple.gif"><BR><BR></CENTER><P><A NAME="jasper"><B>What's A Jasper?</B></A><P>The unique nickname of the Manhattan College athletic teams, theJaspers, comes from one of the College's most memorable figures,Brother Jasper of Mary, F.S.C., who served at the College in thelate 19th century.<P>One of the greatest achievements of Brother Jasper was that hebrought the then little-known sport of baseball to Manhattan Collegeand became the team's first coach. Since Brother was also thePrefect of Discipline, he supervised the student fans at ManhattanCollege Baseball games while also directing the team itself.<P>During one particularly warm and humid day when Manhattan Collegewas playing a semi-pro baseball team called the Metropolitans,Brother Jasper noticed the Manhattan students were becoming restlessand edgy as Manhattan came to bat in the seventh inning of a closegame. To relieve the tension, Brother Jasper called time-out andtold the students to stand up and stretch for a few minutes untilthe game resumed.<P>Since the College annually played the New York Giants in the late1880s and into the 1890s at the Polo Grounds, the Manhattan Collegepractice of the &quot;seventh inning stretch&quot; spread intothe major leagues, where it has now become a time-honored custompracticed by millions of fans annually. <BR><BR><BR><BR><I>Brother Jasper of Mary, F.S.C.<BR><IMG SRC="b-jaspen.jpg"></I><P><A NAME="tradition"><B>TRADITION<BR></B></A><P><A NAME="manhattan_college_history"><B>Manhattan College History</B></A><P>Manhattan College was founded 141 years ago by the Brothers ofthe Christian Schools. The first Brothers to arrive in the UnitedStates came from France in 1848. These young Frenchmen, four inall, established St. Vincent's Academy on Canal Street in NewYork City and later moved to Manhattanville, a tiny hamlet locatedin the hen rural upper section of Manhattan Island. Occupyinga plot of ground east of Broadway and north of 131st Street, thenew school opened on May 5,1853, and was renamed the Academy ofthe Holy Infancy. In 1861, it became known as Manhattan Academy.By the time the Academy was chartered as Manhattan College in1863, a total of 45 students was enrolled and pursuing courses.<P>The need for a more serene atmosphere in the face of a growingNew York City populace motivated the Brothers to relocate theCollege's campus to its present site in the Riverdale sectionof the Bronx. This move was completed in 1923.<P>Today, Manhattan College has grown to include the diversity offive undergraduate schools: Arts, Sciences, Business, Engineering,and Education and Human Services, as well as a Graduate Division.Full-time undergraduate enrollment is approximately 3,000 studentsin 42 major fields of study. Including graduate and evening sessionstudents, Manhattan College's total enrollment is some 3,500.<P>The College's 47 acres include: the main campus, located on ManhattanCollege Parkway; the engineering campus, located at West 240thand Corlear Avenue; and the West Hill campus, located in the Fieldstonsection of Riverdale.<P><A NAME="quad"><B>The Quadrangle</B></A><P>If there is one place on the campus that can be considered thehome of Jasper tradition, it has to be that small patch of grass,trees and slate known as the Quadrangle. Although often overlookedtoday, it is here that revered customs inspired generations ofstudents.<P>The Senior Walk, the path that splits the Quad, runs from MemorialHall to the steps of the Chapel. Seniors always had the specialright of reserving this walkway for their own use and underclassmenhonored this privilege, patiently waiting for their turn to thisslight eminence.<P>In April, the Quadrangle is the scene of Manhattan's Moving-UpDay ceremonies. On this day, all the classes move up a notch.The ceremonies also include the introduction of the new StudentGovernment officers, the handing over of the deed to Senior Walkto the Senior Class president, and the tapping of new membersof the Pen and Sword Honor Society. All the ceremonies conductedon this day hold a high place in Manhattan tradition.<P><A NAME="student_life_mission_statement"><B>Student Life MissionStatement</B></A><P>The Student Life Division aims to recruit, retain, and throughservice oriented staff and programs, promote adjustment and enhancethe total personal-educational experience of a qualified and pluralisticstudent body.<P>Reflective of the Lasallian tradition of education of the wholeperson, Student Life personnel provide programs, advisement andservices for the educational, financial, emotional, occupational,athletic, physical, social and religious needs of the community.<P>Our mission includes the provision of a caring and safe campusenvironment and an enriched commuter and residential living andlearning experience. Student Life programs reflect the College'scommitment to social justice, moral values and leadership anddevelopment opportunities through moderated student clubs andorganizations. Direction and assistance is provided through disciplinedguidance, and policies and procedure, that engender respect bothfor individual dignity and the rights of others in promoting studentdevelopment. The mission also includes a commitment to serve andto help students develop quality, value based relationships withtheir peers and families as well as with the entire ManhattanCollege community.<BR>

The SecurityOffice is also responsible for the &quot;Lost and Found&quot;and parking.<BR><P><B>THE SECURITY EMERGENCY NUMBER IS 7333.<BR></B><P>Since residence halls serve as private residences for a numberof students, security is an important concern. The College maintainsa security force of over thirty members with twenty-four hourcoverage at the Main Campus, the West Hill campus, and Overlook.You are encouraged to observe the following common sense guidelines:<P>(1)Do not prop open fire doors or any door which is a locked entrance.<P>(2)Lock your room door and always carry your key (or your combinationin your head). If a room overlooks a roof, balcony, sidewalk,or ledge, or is otherwise easily accessible, the windows shouldalways be locked before leaving the room.<P>(3)Do not loan keys and do not give out your room combination.Report lost or misplaced keys immediately.<P>(4)Carry your College ID card at all times and please produceit for security officers and Residence Life staff upon request.These requests may seem a nuisance, but your safety is their reasonfor asking.<P>(5)Report strangers or suspicious behavior of persons unfamiliarto you in the building. The College authorizes no one to canvassor peddle in the residence halls. If you suspect such activity,contact a staff member immediately or call Campus Security atExt. 7333.<P>(6)Report incidence of vandalism, theft, or property destructionto the Residence Life Staff immediately. <BR><P>While every effort is made to safeguard the contents of the residents'rooms, the College is not responsible for theft or other lossfrom rooms. We advise you to keep a list of serial numbers ofstereos, etc. In addition, residents should check their familyinsurance policy to determine if stolen property is covered.<P>Personal Safety Tips -Riverdale is not a high crime area, butit is always smart to take precautions.<P>(1)Use public walkways - walk on well lit paths. Avoid short cutsand dark or isolated spots.<P>(2)When walking between the main campus and the West Hill campus,use Waldo Avenue which is patrolled by Fieldston's private securityagency.<P>(3)Don't walk alone - get a friend to walk with you especiallyat night.<P>(4)Look alert - watch for suspicious people. Report any loiterersto Security to protect others.<BR><P>Campus Watch<P>Campus Watch is a student volunteer group which provides the campuswith late night patrols and an escort service. Campus Watch isan integral part of the overall safety program.<BR><P>Parking<P>Any person associated with Manhattan College who parks a motorvehicle on campus grounds must register that vehicle at the CollegeSecurity office, De La Salle Hall, room 105 and obtain a parkingpermit and brochure listing facilities and regulations.<P>There is no student parking on the main campus. Any temporaryexception to the above must be made BEFOREHAND with the Securityoffice. Any unauthorized student vehicle parked in restrictedareas on College property will be ticketed by Campus Securityand its owner will be subject to the assigned penalty.<P>In an emergency situation, e.g., blocked fire lanes, deliverylanes or parking in a restricted area, the College reserves theright to have the vehicle towed away at the owner's expense.<P>A limited number of bike racks are provided in the lower forecourtfor members of the College community. Proper security precautionsshould be taken.<BR><P>All students with permits may park in general lots. Recommendedtimes are 7:00 A.M. - 6:00 P.M.

<HTML><HEAD><title>Student Handbook</title><META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0"></HEAD><BODY><P><A NAME="student_activities_organizations"><B>STUDENT ACTIVITIESAND ORGANIZATIONS <BR></B></A><P>To be eligible to participate and/or run for office in any Collegeor student organization, a student must be enrolled in an academicprogram, have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average, and not beon academic or disciplinary probation.<P><A NAME="student_government"><B>Student Government</B></A><P>Student Government is the elected voice of the Manhattan Collegestudent body. It provides an opportunity for students to developleadership and responsibility. It serves as a link between theadministration, faculty and students, fostering mutual cooperationand understanding. Members are responsible for the developmentof a varied calendar of events for the College. They also allocateand oversee money for extracurricular activities of the generalstudent body and student organizations under Student Governmentjurisdiction.<P>Any student or group of students shall have the right to a hearingbefore the Student Government executive, legislative, or judicialbranches on any question over which the Student Government hasjurisdiction.<P>On an organizational level Student Government is divided intothree branches: executive, legislative and judicial.<P>Executive Branch<P>Known as the Executive Committee, it is composed of the president,the executive vice president, the administrative vice president,the corresponding secretary, the recording secretary and the treasurer.Its purposes, as defined by the Constitution, are to superviseand coordinate all executive commissions and to take appropriateaction to maintain effective student government. In addition,the Executive Committee is charged with proposing, initiatingand undertaking programs in the student interest with the assistanceand majority approval of the Legislature.<P>Legislative Branch<P>Composed of popularly elected officials including the presidentsof the four class organizations, the Legislature meets at leastevery other week. As the largest body of student representativeson campus, it has the primary responsibility of reflecting studentthought. Each of the five divisions of the College (Arts, Sciences,Business, Engineering, and Education and Human Services) is representedin its membership. Chaired by its speaker, the Legislature legislateson all matters of student concern and amends and gives approvalto all bills including the budget allocations of student organizations,the social calendar and all projects of the Executive commissionsand Committee. The Legislature has three standing committees:Elections, Activities and Rules.<P>Judicial Branch<P>The judicial function of the Student Government is administeredby the Student Court which consists of a chief justice and a maximumof six associate justices. Appointed by the Executive Committeewith the approval of 2/3 of the Legislature, the Court hears andadjudicates all infractions of Student Government regulationsand all those applicable provisions of the Student Handbook.<P><A NAME="cocurriculare"><B>Cocurricular Organizations</B></A><P>One of the more meaningful facets of college life is the co-curricularprogram. It serves as an important supplement to the prescribedcurriculum and in doing so enriches the student's learning andexperience.<P>The co-curricular program extends the formal classroom situationto an informal activity through which the student is exposed toothers who share his or her interests and career goals. In additionthe student has the opportunity to satisfy individual tastes andacademic curiosity.<P>These organizations are funded by their sponsoring departments.The advisor is listed next to the organization.<P>American Chemical Society...........................................Dr. Suzanne Rudnick<P>American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics................Dr. Joseph Augustus<P>American Institute of Biological Sciences...........................Dr. Lance Evans<P>American Institute of Chemical Engineers...........................Dr. Joseph Reynolds<P>American Institute of Plant Engineers................................Dr. P.J.

Plans to meet these conditionsmust be approved by the Director of Student Activities.<P>Last call for alcoholic beverages must be at least 45 minutesbefore the end of the event; no alcoholic beverages will be servedduring the last 30 minutes of the event. <P>Signs which indicate the legal drinking age and make referenceto the penalties for violators of the law will be clearly posted.Intoxicated individuals cannot be served under any circumstances.<P>No open containers of alcoholic beverages are allowed on campusother than at authorized events.<P>All Manhattan College students should conduct themselves in accordancewith the rules of conduct promulgated by the College. Violationsof these rules render the organization, individual or sponsorsubject to disciplinary action. <P>No organizations, including fraternities and sororities may awardalcoholic beverages including kegs as prizes in raffles or contests.<P>The sponsoring organization will be held responsible for any damagethat occurs during the event. <P>Entertainment may be provided by the sponsoring club or organization.The Director of Student Activities must be notified of any entertainmentplans. <P>A &quot;cover charge&quot; or admission charge may be collectedby the sponsoring organization if entertainment is provided andwith the permission of the Director of Student Activities, subjectto the laws governing copyright regulations.<P><B>FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE PROCEDURES COULD RESULTIN PENALTIES IMPOSED BY THE STUDENT COURT OR FORFEITURE OF THERIGHT TO USE COLLEGE FACILITIES.<BR></B><P><A NAME="scheduling_events"><B>Scheduling of Events</B></A><P>Student organizations wishing to sponsor an event must fill outa Room Reservation Form obtained from the Director of StudentActivities Office. When a final date is approved, the Directorof Student Activities will sign the form and return a copy tothe organization officer. <P>The deadline for reserving rooms with the Director of StudentActivities is five school days prior to the event. However, toensure that a suitable date is granted, most groups reserve dateswith the Director of Student Activities before the start of thesemester during which the activity is to take place. <P>If food or beverages will be served, Food Service must be contactedpromptly after the room has been reserved. Failure to do so willresult in cancellation of the event. <P>At the time of reserving a room, sufficient funds must be availablein the sponsoring organization's College account to cover allcosts related to an event. If not, the money must be depositedin the Bursar's office and a receipt brought to the Director ofStudent Activities Office before final approval is granted.<BR><P><A NAME="financial_operations"><B>Financial Operations</B></A><P>All student organizations using any of the College facilitiesare required to deposit their funds with the Bursar and to maintainan account in the Controller's Office. <P>Check requisitions, vouchers, and petty cash vouchers must besigned by the organization's treasurer. In the case of those studentorganizations that are funded by Student Government, the signatureof the Treasurer of Student Government and the Director of StudentActivities must be obtained before the Controller's Office willhonor the disbursement of funds. <P>The Controller, the Director of Student Activities, and the StudentGovernment Treasurer are authorized to require an audit of anorganization's account at any time. <BR><P><A NAME="purchases"><B>Purchases</B></A><P>A requisition for any and all items or services must be made outand signed by the organization's Treasurer, the Student GovernmentTreasurer and the Director of Student Activities and then submittedto the business office. The Business Manager sends the requisitionto the Controller's Office. The Controller checks the organization'saccount and, if the budget allows, he approves the requisition.It is returned to the Business Office for a purchase order tobe sent to the vendor. It is at this point that the College assumesfinancial responsibility for the item. Anyone who procures ororders any material or service directly from a vendor is personallyresponsible for the cost.<P><A NAME="petty_cash"><B>Petty Cash</B></A><P>Petty Cash vouchers should be used only when absolutely necessary.The reimbursement of these expenditures will be made when pettycash vouchers are submitted with the signature of the organization'sTreasurer and, if funded by Student Government, the signaturesof the Student Government Treasurer and the Director of StudentActivities. <P>The voucher must be accompanied by receipted bills. If receiptedbills are unobtainable, the voucher must be accompanied by anitemized list of expenditures. No cash disbursements in excessof $25 will be made.<P><A NAME="contracts"><B>Contracts</B></A><P>Contracts entered into by an individual student or by any studentorganization that are not also signed by the Director of StudentActivities are not contracts with Manhattan College. The contractingparties are, therefore, personally responsible in such cases,and the College will not in any way enter into the contractualliability. No organization is legally entitled to commit itselffor more money than it has in its account. Verbal agreements maybe considered legal; therefore Student Organizations should meetwith the Director of Student Activities before contracting withany party.<BR><P><A NAME="membership_lists"><B>Membership Lists</B></A><P>Each organization is responsible for furnishing a list of officersand the names of all members of the club or fraternity to theoffice of the Director of Student Activities.<P><A NAME="recognition_of_new_clubs"><B>Recognition of New Clubs</B></A><P>Students interested in forming a new club on campus should followthese procedures:<P>1. Student organizers must first meet with the Director of StudentActivities or her designee to discuss goals and objectives ofthe new group.<BR><P>2. A constitution must be written stating the purpose and othermatters of the organization. Examples of constitutions are availablein the Director of Student Activities Office.<BR><P>3. The signatures of at least 15 full time undergraduate studentsof the College must be obtained. These students must be in goodacademic and disciplinary standing. These student must be enrolledin an academic program on the campus where the organization isbased. All students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average,but no student may be on academic and/or disciplinary probationregardless of the cumulative grade point average. These studentsmust be willing to join the proposed organization if it is approved.<P>4. The proposed constitution, 15 signatures, and a letter froma faculty member or administrator who is willing to serve as thegroup's advisor is then presented to both the Director of StudentActivities or her designee and the Speaker of the Student GovernmentLegislature. The proposed constitution is then reviewed by theActivities Committee of the Legislature, and a recommendationis made as to the advisability of having such a club on campus.<BR><P>5. If approved by the Legislature, the club is given an orientationperiod which will last for fifteen (15) school weeks beginningwith the date of Legislature approval. Summer and winter intercessionswill not count towards the orientation period. The advisor isofficially appointed by the Director of Student Activities atthis time.<BR><P>6. After approval, the organization's final constitution and clubroster must be provided to the Director of Student Activities,the advisor, and the Speaker of the Legislature. During the orientationperiod, the new organization's leadership must meet with the Directorof Student Activities, their Faculty Advisor, Student GovernmentTreasurer, and the Activities Committee. Organizations are noteligible for Student Government funding during the orientationperiod, but they may fund-raise.<BR><P>7. After an organization is approved, all members must remainin good academic and disciplinary standing in order to maintainactive status. A student who has been placed on academic and/ordisciplinary probation or suspension, regardless of the gradepoint average, may not participate in any activities or hold office.People who are not enrolled as students may not participate inactivities unless they are open to the public. <BR><P>8. If club members comply with the regulations and proceduresdescribed above, the club automatically becomes officially recognizedat the end of the orientation period. All organizations and theirmembers must follow all Student Government and College policiesand procedures to remain in good standing.<P>Students interested in forming a new fraternity or sorority mustfollow all the procedures outlined above and, in addition, theymust submit their proposed constitution to the Chair of the Inter-GreekCouncil. This Chair may make a recommendation to the Student GovernmentLegislature regarding approval of the new Greek organization.After a new Greek organization is approved, the fraternity orsorority must follow all policies of the Interfraternity Council,Student Government, and the College to remain in good standing.<BR><P>The College encourages students to participate in a wide varietyof student organizations. Involvement in student groups and clubsbenefits both the individual and the College. Official recognitionis granted to those organizations whose purposes, goals, activities,and programs are consistent with the educational mission of theCollege. The College reserves the right to deny official recognitionwhen in its judgment a student organization's purposes, goals,activities, and programs are in opposition to the mission of theCollege. If in the course of legitimate activities of a recognizedorganization conflict with the mission of the College arises,care must be taken to ensure that any action be competent andrespectful. Recognition of a student organization does not initself imply that the College endorses the views or actions ofthe organization as a group or of its individual members.<P><A NAME="activity_advisors"><B>Activity Advisors</B></A><P>Advisors are faculty and/or administrative staff members appointedto student groups by the Director of Student Activities. A studentgroup may request that a specific person be appointed as advisorof the group if a new advisor is required.<P>The advisor is expected to see that the organization functionsprudently; however, veto power is not exercised. This power isvested in the Director of Student Activities ordinarily and inthe Vice President for Student Life extraordinarily. Studentsshould realize that the advisor has the right to be consulted,to advise and to warn in all matters concerning the organization'sactivities. Students are expected to conduct the business of theorganization in such a way as to promote mutual respect betweenthe advisor and themselves. The advisor, or duly appointed representative,is expected to be present at any event sponsored by the organization.The advisor should discuss with the Director of Student Activitiesany action proposed by the group that would in the advisor's opinionadversely affect the organization or Manhattan College.<BR>

Residence Life isresponsible for staffing, programming, and housekeeping servicesin the four residence halls on campus. The staff strives to maintaina positive community atmosphere in these residences and is availableto assist you with your living and learning experiences here atManhattan.<P><A NAME="area_coordinators"><B>Area Coordinators</B></A><P>The Area Coordinator of your area is the person responsible forthe total operation of the building. The Area Coordinator is afull time professional trained in both counseling and residencehall management. The Area Coordinator directly supervises allResidence Hall staffs and reports directly to the Director ofResidence Life. Area Coordinators are available 24 hours a dayto handle any resident student emergencies and are available duringdaily office hours for any other resident concerns. Area Coordinatoroffices are located in East Hill and Overlook Halls.<P><A NAME="resident_directors"><B>Resident Directors</B></A><P>The Resident Director (RD) of your building or area is the personresponsible for the residence life program in your area. The RDsupervises the Resident Assistants in your area, and he/she isvery familiar with student needs and concerns in a community livingenvironment. Most of our RDs are employed by the College in otherareas during the day and work in the residences at night. AllRDs maintain evening office hours. Please check times with yourResident Assistant.<P><A NAME="resident_assistants"><B>Resident Assistants</B></A><P>Resident Assistants (RAs) are probably the most visible membersof our staff. Since your RA is a student living on your flooror in your area, she/he is attuned to your particular needs. TheRAs are concerned with two main areas of responsibility: first,they are paraprofessionals working at promoting an atmosphereconducive to academic achievement, social growth, and the developmentof personal and group responsibilities; second, they assist residentspersonally or through appropriate referrals with academic, personal,and social problems which confront typical college students.<P>Resident Assistants (RAs) are undergraduate members of the ResidenceLife Staff who have successfully completed an extensive selectionprocess and training program. An RA lives on each floor/sectionof the residence halls and is available to offer peer assistanceand direction to residents when needed. RAs also serve as resourcepersons within the halls, answering questions about the campus,explaining and enforcing college policies, sponsoring floor and/orhall programs and activities, and promoting a sense of communityon the floor and in the building.<P><A NAME="rsa"><B>Resident Student Association (RSA)</B></A><P>All resident students are members of the RSA. The purposes ofthe Association are:<P>-To act as the organized representative body of the resident studentsmaking their views known on matters directly affecting residentstudent affairs.<P>-To help organize, promote, and direct academic, social, cultural,and recreational activities for the general welfare of the residentstudents.<P>All residents, including freshmen, are eligible for election asRSA representatives. Election of representatives is early in theFall session. Upperclass resident students are eligible for electionas officers. Election of officers is held in the Spring session.<BR><P>Residents are urged to take an active part in the Associationas the RSA is your organization. The RSA meets regularly and themeetings are open to all residents. See your RA for meeting information.You are encouraged to attend. Get involved. RSA wants you.<P><A NAME="res_development"><B>RESIDENT-STUDENT DEVELOPMENT ANDPROGRAMMING<BR></B></A><P><B>An Overview<BR></B><P><B>Residence Hall Living</B><P>The administration of residence life fully participates in theoverall educational mission of the College. First and foremost,the residence halls are communities of learning. This means thatthe policies, guidelines and resources dedicated to our college-administeredhousing are coordinated to help meet the personal needs of studentsin their quest for academic advancement. We take it as our taskto ensure each students' right to study and live freely, to guaranteean open environment where the exchange of ideas happens easilyand spontaneously, to be an active and powerful force in the developmentof student leaders within the residence hall sphere of influence,and to secure a living/learning environment especially one whichis focused on the formation of a community of individuals.<P><B>Student Programming in Residence Life</B><P>The concept of programming in Resident Life departments is usuallyakin to the kind of programming done by television executives.It means an encompassing, programmatic approach to meeting themultiple (recreational) needs of students while satisfying ourmission to educate and develop each student.<P>Programming then, is the systematic approach to on-campus andin-hall events and activities. These events and activities canrange anywhere from outdoor, Spring Barbecues to athletic competitions,from lectures by visiting professors to presentations on studyskill improvement or resume writing. On a departmental level thereare also a number of specific programs implemented which meetdevelopmental needs of residents while allowing them a close-upview of the administration of their living/learning environment.<P>1.

Interestedresidents should contact the Director of Residence Life for informationon a 12 month contract and rates.<P>All students may apply for residency during the intersession periodprovided they are enrolled in classes. There is a flat rate perweek. Applications are available through the Office of ResidenceLife. Students who do not live in East Hill or the Overlook residencehalls will be temporarily assigned to a room or apartment otherthan your own. The meal plan is not in operation.<P>The College reserves the right to rent freshman designated roomsduring the intersession period. First year students are advisedto bring their belongings home during the intersession period.Any belongings left in Freshman rooms is at the students' risk.<P><B>Room Changes</B><P>Room changes can only be requested by submitting a properly completedRoom Change Request Form to the Office of Residence Life. No roomchanges are permitted during the first two weeks of the semester.After the two week moratorium is over, applications should bereturned to the Director of Residence Life for processing andexamination of available spaces. <U><B>Anyone who completes anunauthorized room change will be assessed a $50 fine.</B></U><P><B>Damage Account Deposits </B><P>All resident students are required to deposit $300.00 into a securityaccount to insure that any damages to the residence hall propertieswill be repaid. This money will not be part of the student's normalBursar account; rather it will be kept separately and monitoredby the Office of Residence Life. A refund (less damages) willbe made to the student if a) the student graduates, b) the Collegeterminates the student's registration, c) the student withdrawsbecause of illness (doctor's certificate is mandatory), d) forunusual circumstances (approved by the Director of Residence Life),e) the contract of residency is fulfilled (the student has remainedin residence until the end of the academic year). Leaves for otherreasons do not fulfill residency contract obligations and willresult in forfeiture of deposits. Charges which are incurred duringthe period before termination of college residence will be placeddirectly on the student's Bursar Account. Heavy fines will belevied upon anyone who leaves non-college property in residencehalls rooms after the official closing of the residence halls.<P><B>Room and Board Downpayments / Room Selection</B><P>Each returning resident must pay a $200.00 down payment on theirFall semester's room and board when requesting Fall residency.This deposit is due in relation to the room selection processwhich occurs each spring. Dates are communicated to all residentstudents at their campus address. Freshman students are not permittedto &quot;homestead&quot; their first year assignment and are requiredto participate in the room selection process to choose their proceedingFall assignment. This $200.00 should be deducted by the studentwhen she/he pays her/his Fall bill. This down payment is refundableonly if the student cancels his/her residency before the announceddeadline.<P><B>Room Inspections</B><P>You are asked to use your room in a manner that will leave itin good condition for the next resident. Care should be takennot to damage walls or woodwork with nails, screws, glue, etc.The Office of Residence Life reserves the right to deny housingfor the following year to any residents who leave their room inunacceptable condition.<P>No construction work or painting may be done by the residentswithout explicit permission from the Office of Residence Life.The necessary forms for approval can be obtained in the Officeof Residence Life. Unfinished lumber and lofts are not permittedin any Residence Hall Room.<P>In order to insure that proper responsibility for cleanlinessis taken by residents, all rooms will be inspected by Staff membersfour times a semester. During these inspections, staff will checkfor the following conditions:<P>(1) general condition and safety <P>(2) furniture safe and clean<P>(3) approved changes or paint work<P>(4) no empty cans or bottles <P>(5) illegal appliances <P>(6) open containers of food <P>(7) smoke detectors in good operating order<P>(8) garbage appropriately disposed<P>(9) dishes washed <P>(10) ovens cleaned<P>Space heaters and dart boards are not permitted in any of theresidence halls. If your room fails inspection, you will be givena warning and a second inspection date. Second failures will receivea fine. Multiple failures could result in removal from residence.<P><B>Room Keys and Locks</B><P>The room keys and door keys you receive are the property of theCollege. You may not make or obtain unauthorized duplicate keys.<P>If you lose a key, report it at once to your RA. The lock willbe changed, new keys will be issued to each resident, and thecost will be assigned to the person who lost the key. On requestpush-button door combinations will be changed for a $25.00 fee.<P>Students who fail to return their keys at check-out will be assessedthe cost of replacing the lock (usually $50.00) plus $5 per key.Lost front door keys or key cards are assessed at $25. Keys mustbe returned at check-out even if you are returning to the sameroom in the following year.<P>Unauthorized use of room keys or door combinations is prohibitedand will result in disciplinary action.<P><B>Room Repairs</B><P>When routine repair work is needed in your room, tell your RAso that he/she can file a work request. If the problem is an emergency,call the Office of Residence Life, Ext. 7438, or Physical PlantExt. 7480 during business hours or Security (Ext. 7333) othertimes.<P><A NAME="rules_regs"><B>RULES AND REGULATIONS<BR></B></A><P>The Residence Halls are provided as a service primarily intendedto support and foster the educational experience. It is our intentionas well to provide a positive community atmosphere which willenhance personal and social growth. You are expected to conductyourself in a mature manner with respect for the privacy and rightsof roommates and neighbors. Failure to observe the rules and regulationsstipulated may result in disciplinary action including cancellationof room assignment.<P><B>Absences</B><P>A resident who expects to be absent from the halls for four consecutivedays or more while school is in session is urged to inform his/herRA, giving him/her information where he/she could be reached inan emergency. As a precautionary measure, inquiry is made intoall unreported absences.<P><B>Advertising</B><P>Residents may not use their rooms via the college telephone, themail system, the college computer systems, or other means forany commercial advertising endeavor or response, other than foran approved campus activity.<P>Authorization for canvassing will be given only to Manhattan Collegeorganizations and to Manhattan College students. The canvass mustbe for an activity which is of interest to a large number of residents.Requests for permission to canvass must be submitted to the Directorof Student Activities Office at least two days in advance. Authorizedcanvassing will carry written authorization from the Directorof Student Activities Office, and this will be shown to anyonewho questions them as a matter of security. Any others whetherstudents or not who are unauthorized, will be reported for yourprotection to the RA or to the Security Office (Ext. 7240 or 7333.)<BR><P><B>Cooking</B><P>Cooking is permitted only in those units and/or halls equippedwith kitchens. Cooking in any other residence hall room is strictlyforbidden. Hot plates, toaster ovens, electric skillets, etc.,will be confiscated.<P><B>Credit Hours</B><P>To remain in residence, you must be registered for at least 12credit hours or be involved in a College approved Co-op position.Exceptions are made for students on 12 month housing contracts.Students planning Co-op positions should confirm their residencyarrangements by asking the College Co-op Advisor to inform theOffice of Residence Life of their situation. Students on Co-opleaves are guaranteed housing when they return but they are notguaranteed specific spaces. Requests are honored whenever possible.<BR><P><B>Damages</B><P>The terms of the residency contract clearly state the responsibilitiesof the student for keeping the room or apartment in good order,free from damage, and locked.<P>The cost of repair or replacement of damaged furnishings or residencehall property in a student's room will be charged to the responsibleoccupant or occupants if they can be identified; otherwise allthe residents of the room will be assessed the damage.<P>When damages occur on a particular floor or hall in a public area,the persons responsible will be assessed if they can be identified;otherwise all of the floor or hall residents will be assessed.<P>Damages to public lobby areas will be assessed to the personsresponsible if they are identified; otherwise the repairs willbe charged to the smallest possible group that can be fairly identified.<P><B>Fire Safety</B><P>Fire safety equipment such as smoke detectors, fire extinguishers,fire alarm pull boxes, and emergency exit routing signs have beeninstalled in each residence hall. These items are there to helpsave your life if a fire ever occurs. Hopefully, such a situationwill not happen, but if it does, your life, plus up to hundredsof other lives, could depend on one or more of these devices.Therefore, it is VITAL that these items be in working order atall times.<P>College policy and state law require each residence hall to havethree fire drills each semester. It is a violation of City lawand College policy to stay in the building during a fire drill.Any time the alarm sounds, PLEASE leave your room immediately,closing the door behind you, and follow your specified evacuationroute. DO NOT USE the elevators.<P>Any individual found responsible for issuing a false alarm, ordamaging safety equipment, will be prosecuted by the College judicialprocesses. Penalties including loss of residence, suspension fromthe College, or legal action, may be imposed.<BR><P>The campus Fire Marshal recommends:<P>1.Keep the key to your room on a bedside table.<P>2. Please count how many doors to the firestairs (exit).<P>3. Feel the door and door knob if it is hot, do not open the door.If there is smoke, crawl on your hands and knees to the firestairs(exit). NEVER use the elevator.<P>4. Take your key with you. You may want to get back into yourroom where it is safer.<P>5. Close all doors behind you. Smoke in stairwells is caused byleaving doors open. <P>6. If you are forced to stay in your room, do the following:<UL><LI>a) Open the window for fresh air.<LI>b) Do not break the window.<LI>c) If there is smoke outside, you will need to close the window.<BR></UL><P>Hazards that should be avoided are: <BR><P>1. Smoking in bed.<P>2. Faulty electrical equipment. <P>3. Disposal of cigarettes in waste baskets. <P>4. Throwing objects out of windows. This includes the throwingof lighted cigarettes, cigars or matches as this can easily beblown into a room on a lower floor thereby causing a fire.<P>5. Cooking in rooms is not permitted. <P>6. Electric blankets and space heaters are not permitted.<BR><P>If you have any questions, please call the Physical Plant.<BR><P><B>THE USE OF CANDLES, OIL LAMPS OR OPEN FLAMES OR THE BURNINGOF INCENSE IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED IN THE RESIDENCE HALLS.</B><P><A NAME="guest_visitor_policy"><B>GUEST AND VISITOR POLICY</B></A><P>(A guest is defined as anyone who does not reside in the building)<P>The residence hall policy and procedures related to guests andvisitors exist to allow residents to have guests in a manner thatdoes not infringe upon the comfort or rights of other residentsand maintains an appropriate level of safety and security in theresidence halls. The following is the Manhattan College guest/visitorpolicy:<P>1. Regardless of the length of his/her stay, the guest is expectedto abide by all College policies.<P>2. The host is responsible for the actions of his/her guest atall times.<P>3. Residence Life Staff may have a guest removed immediately shouldhe/she fail to abide by College policies.<P>4. Roommates are required to check with one another to confirmthat guests/visitors are not an inconvenience to their livingenvironment at any time.<P>5. Visitation during exam week is limited to current members ofthe Manhattan College Community. No late night visitation passeswill be approved during break periods, Intersession, and holidayperiods.<P>6. Visitation is limited to 2 guests before 8:00 P.M. during Intersessionand other vacation periods.<P>7. Security and Residence Life Personnel, at their discretion,may deny access to enter a hall to any guest. <BR><P>Overnight Guests in all Residence Halls:<P>Overnight guests/visitors of the opposite sex are not permitted.Visitors of the opposite sex who need to stay overnight shouldhave arrangements made in advance by their host to stay in otherresidence hall accommodations with members of the same sex. Arrangementsare made by completing the &quot;Late Night Early Morning VisitationForm&quot; as described under the Late Night Guest Policy.<BR><P>1. The host must make arrangements in advance with their ResidentDirectors to have their overnight guests registered.<P>2. It is the responsibility of the host to meet his/her guestin the lobby and remain with them at all times during their stay.<P>Overlook and East Hill Procedures for Visitation 8 a.m.-8 p.m.<BR><P>1. Any current Manhattan college student (resident or commuter)may enter the halls by showing their I.D. to Security. If thestudent remains in the building after 8 P.M., he/she must comedown to Security with their host and sign in properly.<P>2. Visitors who do not possess a current Manhattan College I.D.must adhere to the after 8 P.M. policy.<P>Policy for Guests Arriving after 8 p.m.until 11:30 p.m.<BR><P>1. It is the responsibility of the host to meet his/her guestin the lobby and remain with their guest at all times.<P>2. All guests must have the Security Officer register them bysigning the guest registration book at the Security station. Everyguest must leave a valid form of current picture identification(i.e., drivers license, student I.D.).<P>3. When the guest leaves the hall, he/she must be escorted tothe lobby by the host and must be signed out in the guest registrationbook. The I.D. will be returned and the Security Officer willinitial that the I.D. was returned.<P>4. One resident may sign in a maximum of three guests during anevening. After midnight the maximum is lowered to one. Largergroup sign-in will be reported to the resident life staff by securityin Overlook and East Hill.<P>5.

All other after 8 p.m. visitation rules apply.<BR><P><B>Roommate Courtesy</B><P>As members of the Manhattan College community, resident studentsare expected to respect the rights and privacy of their roommates.The needs and rights of all roommates take priority over the rightsof one member of a room or suite to have a visitor in their roomfor any period of time.<P><B>Roommate/Suitemate Agreement:</B><P>Residents should bring to the attention of their roommates situationswhich they feel uncomfortable with including guests, visitorsor any other aspects of sharing a living environment. It is highlyrecommended that residents take the time to complete the Roommate/SuitemateAgreement exercise in this handbook. This exercise will help youto better understand your own needs and the needs of the peopleyou are living with. Residents are expected to adhere to requestsfrom their roommates regarding their concerns on privacy and theuse of their rooms or apartments. Residence Hall staff membersare committed to assisting and enforcing policies related to roommatecourtesy.<P>Any resident student who has difficulties resolving conflictsrelating to the issues of roommate courtesy should contact theirResident Assistant for support in bringing everyone together fora discussion regarding the resolution. Repeated problems shouldbe reported to your Resident Director for follow up. Repeat offenderswill be referred to the College judicial system for sanctioning.<P>The roommate/suitemate agreement is meant to be used as an aidto Manhattan College resident students for clarification and developmentof issues facing people sharing a residence hall space. A ResidentAssistant can facilitate this agreement or roommates /suite-matesmay choose to determine the issues on their own initially.<P>Sharing a room or suite with at least one other person can beone of the major challenges of college life. &quot;Rooming&quot;with other people can be very rewarding, and often college roommatesbecome lifetime friends. However, just as with any other relationship,there must be a high level of trust and clear expectations. Thisform is offered as a guide to help roommates/suitemates establishtheir own needs and the needs of others. It is also recommendedfor returning students who may want to reevaluate their time schedulesor alter previous patterns.<P>Select a mutually convenient time for all involved and agree tocomplete the guide as thoroughly and honestly as possible. Finishthe process as early in the semester as possible. There are noright or wrong answers - only individual preferences.<BR><P>1. Whose and what furniture, wall hangings, plants etc. will bein the room.<P>2. Will the room / suite be divided? (my corner, shelf, your side,closet?)<P>3. How will cleaning tasks be completed? (Take turns or each personis responsible for their own areas.)<P>4. Will we have a phone? If so, whose name will it be in? Howwill costs be shared? Does anyone have special needs or requestsabout message-taking etc.?<P>5. Time schedule? What times are reserved for sleep? study time?relaxation? What times do people wake up and when do people haveclasses? Any special needs or preferences?<P>6. Will we have a refrigerator? If so, who takes responsibilityand how are the payments split?<P>7. What will be the room/suite policy regarding cigarette smoking?For roommates/guests?<P>8. Based on the College guest policy, how will guests be handled?Do roommates request advance notice? If overnight guests are expected,what special arrangements will be made and when?<P>9. Based on the College Alcohol Policy, when and by whom willalcohol be used in the room/suite?<P>10. What articles can roommates feel free to borrow or use, ifany? Stereo, tapes, laundry detergent, food, etc.? What articlesare strictly off-limits?<P>11. Are there any special topics which need to be addressed? Howshould &quot;violations&quot; of these agreements be addressed?<BR><P><B>Quiet Hours</B><P>To maintain an atmosphere conducive to academic achievement thefollowing quiet hours have been established. Sunday through Thursdaystarting at 11pm. Friday and Saturday at 1am. Quiet hours aredefined as not being able to hear any sounds outside of a particularsuite/room.<P>In all halls it is essential that noise be kept to a reasonablelevel so that residents can exercise their rights to study andsleep without disturbance. TV's, radios, and stereos should bekept low enough so that they will not disturb others. This isespecially important on the Main Campus so as not to disturb dayand evening classes.<P>The College fully recognizes the student need for recreationaloutlets, and is cognizant of the role TV's and stereos play inleisure time activities. In line with this awareness, the Collegepermits you to import these things for your use. Those residentstudents, however, who operate these devices in an abusive orirresponsible manner place themselves in jeopardy of forfeitingthe continuance of the permission granted.<P>Residents of Overlook Manor are asked to show consideration forour neighbors. Stereos, musical instruments, etc., are never tobe played on the balconies or fire escapes. You are asked to beaware of, and observe, the City noise ordinances which prohibitnoise of such volume that it interferes with the rights of others,particularly at night. <B>When returning to the residence hallsin the evening, particularly with a group of friends please rememberthat voices carry and disturb others. Please make every effortto avoid yelling and maintain a quiet approach.</B><P><B>Pets</B><P>With the exception of fish in aquariums of 20 gallons or less,no animals are permitted in the residence halls.<P><B>Smoking</B><P>City and state law prohibit smoking in all common areas of theresidence halls.<P><B>Residence Life Office Staff</B><P>Joseph Pirrello, Director of Residence Life &amp; Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs<P>862-7438<P>Gail Dray, Assistant Director for Operations <P>862-7196<P>Eleanor McGrath, Secretary <P>862-7438<P>Chris Taylor, Area Coordinator, East Hill <P>862-7343<P>Karin McClelland, Area Coordinator, Overlook <P>862-7251<BR><P><B>Housekeeping Supervisors</B><P><B>East Hill Residence</B><P>Susan McCarthy <P>862-7801<P><B>Main Campus</B><P>Betty Fallon <P>862-7136<P><B>Overlook Manor</B><P>Pat Hunt <P>862-7107<BR><P><B>College Extensions in The Residence Halls</B><P><B>Chrysostom Hall</B><P>1st Floor <P>862-7592 <P>2nd Floor <P>862-7537 <P>3rd Floor <P>862-7539 <P>4th Floor <P>862-7598<BR><P><B>Jasper Hall</B> <P>1st Floor <P>862-7527<P>2nd Floor <P>862-7531<P>3rd Floor <P>862-7595<P>3rd Floor Wing <P>862-7591<P>4th Floor <P>862-7508<P>4th Floor Wing <P>862-7532<P>5th Floor <P>862-7526<P>5th Floor Wing <P>862-7525<P>6th Floor <P>862-7544<BR><P><B>Pay Phones in the Residence Halls</B><P>Chrysostom Hall <P>Lobby <P>549-9814 <P>549-9676<BR><P>Jasper Hall<P>Lobby<P>548-9515 548-9659<P>549-9758<BR><P><A NAME="calendar_dates"><B>IMPORTANT CALENDAR DATES</B></A><P>1996 - 97 Academic Year<BR><P>August 24<P>First Year Students and Transfer Students Move In<P>Barbecue for dinner meal<P>August 25 <P>Upper classmen Move In/ First Meal Dinner<P>August 26 <P>Classes Begin<P>September 2 <P>Labor Day Holiday - No Classes<P>October 14 <P>Columbus Day Holiday - No Classes<P>October 15 <P>Monday Class Schedule<P>November 28-29 <P>Thanksgiving Holiday - No Classes<P>December 14 <P>Residence Halls close until Jan 21<P>January 21 <P>Residence Halls Open<P>February 2 <P>MC Winter Commencement<P>March 24-31 <P>Spring Break/Easter - No Classes<P>May 6 <P>Last Class<P>May 8-14 <P>Exams<P>May 18 <P>Graduation<BR><P><B>IMPORTANT CALENDAR DATES</B><P>1997 - 98 Academic Year<BR><P>August 23 <P>First Year Students and Transfer Students Move In<P>Barbecue for dinner meal<P>August 24 <P>Upper Classmen Move In/ First Meal Dinner<P>August 25 <P>Classes Begin<P>September 1 <P>Labor Day<P>October 13 <P>Columbus Day <P>October 14 <P>Monday Class Schedule<P>November 27-28 <P>Thanksgiving Holiday<P>December 5 <P>Last Class<P>December 8-13 <P>Exam Week<P>December 15 <P>Break Begins<P>January 20 <P>Classes begin<P>March 16-20 <P>Spring Break<P>April 10-13 <P>Easter Break<P>April 14 <P>Monday Schedule<P>May 5 <P>Last Class<P>May 7-13 <P>Exams<P>May 17 <P>Graduation<BR>

They are summarized here for the convenience of students.Students are expected to be familiar with these statements.<BR><P><A NAME="attending_classes"><B>Attending Classes</B></A><P>Students are required to attend all classes for which they areregistered. Students are responsible for any absence from classes.Students are responsible for fulfilling all course requirementsand completing all course requirements; they will likewise beheld responsible for the entire content of the course.<P>When a student has four un-excused absences, the teacher willnotify the Dean of the School in which the student is registered.The student will be invited to an interview to discuss the reasonbehind the absences. The Dean may refer the student to formalcounseling to assess the underlying causes, may advise withdrawalfrom a course, or may issue a letter of warning if a student'sscholastic record is endangered.<P>If a student is absent from a test or quiz, the teacher is notrequired to provide a substitute test or quiz. Students who areabsent from a laboratory cannot expect that any special arrangements(e.g., setting up apparatus, etc.) will be made to enable themto complete the laboratory work that they missed.<P><A NAME="final_examinations"><B>Final Examinations</B></A><P>To protect students as they complete course requirements and preparefor final examinations, there is a policy which states that thereshall be no testing in at least the last week of classes. Eachschool should set the policies on the nature and scope of testingin the final exam week.<P>A student should normally take one final exam on any given day.In exceptional circumstances, he/she may have to take two finalexams in one day. If a student has more than two final examinationsscheduled for the same day, he/she may ask the instructor(s) toarrange an alternative date.<P>Members of the senior class who have been inducted into the College'sacademic honor society, Epsilon Sigma Pi, may be excused froma final examination at the discretion of the course instructor.All course instructors are provided a list of members of EpsilonSigma Pi prior to the final examination period in the fall andspring semesters.<P><A NAME="withdrawing_courses"><B>Withdrawing from Courses</B></A><P>The deadline for withdrawing from a course is two weeks beforethe final day of classes during the fall and spring semesters.Permission to withdraw from a course may be granted only by theDean of the School in which the student is registered. It is thenrecorded on the student's transcript.<P>Students should also be aware that withdrawing from a course afterthe Add/Drop period (consult the official calendar in the ManhattanCollege Catalog) will usually mean that they will have to makeup the credits at some other time with an additional tuition charge.<BR><P><A NAME="course_syllabus_grading_methods"><B>Course Syllabus andGrading Methods</B></A><P>Students should be aware that all course instructors are requiredto provide to them, at the beginning of every course, a syllabusfor the course, including all course requirements and a statementof how the final grade will be determined.<P><A NAME="contesting_final_grade_course"><B>Contesting Final Gradein a Course</B></A><P>If a student believes that his/her final grade in a course isnot consistent with the statement provided at the beginning ofthe course of how the final grade will be determined and withthe grades on tests, quizzes, and other assignments graded duringthe course, he/she should first discuss the matter with the courseinstructor. If the student and the instructor cannot resolve thematter in this discussion, the student may discuss the matterwith the department chairperson. Copies of all graded tests, quizzes,and other assignments will be needed.<P>In the event that the student is not satisfied with the outcomeof the discussions with the course instructor and the chairperson,he/she may make a written request within three weeks after thebeginning of the next regular semester to the chairperson fora formal consideration of the problem. Included in the requestwill be an outline of the student's specific complaints. The chairpersonwill make a detailed investigation and will notify the studentand the course instructor in writing of his/her findings.<P>The student may appeal the findings of the chairperson to theDean of the School in which the course was offered. The Dean willrespond to the student in writing and will preserve the documentationof the process.<P>Students should be aware that only the course instructor may changea grade.<P><A NAME="change_of_address"><B>Change of Address</B></A><P>Students are required to keep the College informed of both permanenthome and local address. All changes of address should be reportedto the respective Dean of the student's school as soon as practicable.<P><A NAME="confidentiality_student_records"><B>Confidentiality ofStudent Records</B></A><P>Manhattan College recognizes the need for a carefully consideredpolicy concerning information that should be part of a student'spermanent record and the conditions of its disclosure. As specificallyindicated in the policy statement that follows, the privacy andconfidentiality of all student records shall be preserved. Sincecertain material is necessary for persons within the College tofunction effectively, and since such material is, therefore, guardedlyreleased from absolute confidentiality, members of the administration,the faculty, the staff of the College and the students are boundto respect confidential records on students to which they haveaccess in the course of their official capacity. This policy statementis intended to include all departments of the College. <P>A survey of the kinds of records kept throughout the College indicatesthat the following groupings of records can be made: <BR><P>1. Official academic records are maintained in the Office of theRegistrar and include the completed forms of registration foreach semester in residence, the records of grades and creditsreceived in courses at the College, or accepted here from anotherinstitution, and other documents directly relating to academicprogress and status at this College.<P>2. Disciplinary records are maintained in the Office of the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs and include information about dispositionof charges of infractions against College codes of conduct anddiscipline.<P>3. Financial records are kept in the Bursar's Office.<P>4. Financial aid records are maintained in the Financial Aid Office.<P>5. Student employment records are maintained in the PlacementCenter and are confined to applications for employment and financialaid and supporting letters of reference, notices of action onsuch applications and evaluations of performance and financialaid history of each student.<P>6. Medical and health records are maintained in the College Infirmary.<P>7. Psychological and counseling records are maintained in theCounseling Center. <P>Students have a right to know the information contained in theirofficial academic, disciplinary or placement records, and accessto any of these records is limited only by reasonable regulationsas to time, place and supervision. When the original is shown,examination should be permitted only under conditions that willprevent its alteration or mutilation. <P>If a student challenges the accuracy of the official academicrecord or if the student believes the content is misleading orotherwise in violation of his/her privacy or other rights, he/sheshall request the Registrar to correct or delete any such inaccurate,misleading or otherwise inappropriate data contained therein.The student shall be afforded a full hearing and fair opportunityto present evidence relevant to the issues and may be assistedor represented by individuals of his/her choice who are membersof the College community. Wherever possible, the Registrar willcorrect the record. If there still remains a difference, the student'swritten objection(s) will be included in the record and made anofficial part thereof. <P>In the case of placement records, letters of recommendation datedafter January 1, 1975, may be seen by the student. <P>No entry may be made on a student's official record, academicor disciplinary, and no document or entry may be placed in thoserecords without notice to the student, with the exception of publishedgrades or announcements of honor. A document or entry suppliedby or at the request of a student may be placed in the student'srecord without additional notice to him or her. <P>Information from official academic records may not be releasedto anyone except with the prior written consent of the student,except as stated below, and subject to the right of the studentto bar disclosure to a particular inquirer or class of inquirers.<P>1. Manhattan College considers all students &quot;dependent&quot;unless they specifically inform the institution that they are&quot;independent.&quot; <P>2. Administrative officers and faculty members may have accessto official academic records for internal educational purposesand for research in which anonymity is guaranteed. <P>3. The following data may be given to any inquirer either in person,by mail or telephone:<BR><UL><LI>dates of registered attendance<LI>nature of degree granted<LI>school or division of enrollment<LI>current status<LI>dates of degrees granted and awards received<LI>date of birth may be confirmed<LI>marital status<LI>religious order may be confirmed<LI>campus box number may be confirmed<LI>home address may be confirmed<LI>telephone number may be confirmed </UL><P>Persons from outside the College shall not be permitted accessto a student's records or greater information than provided hereinunless subpoena or other legal process is served on the College.Following such service, the College shall immediately notify thestudent affected. In addition, the College will comply with suchprocess only upon advice of counsel. To fully protect the confidentialityof student records, counsel for the College will be asked to advisea prudent course. <P>No record shall be kept of the political views of students orof student membership in any organization other than academic,honorary, professional or social organizations. In the case ofpolitical organizations, only the names of officers will be recorded.<P><A NAME="financial_obligaitons"><B>Financial Obligations</B></A><P>Tuition charges are paid once each semester and are indicatedin the current catalogue for each of the programs offered in thevarious Schools or Divisions of the College. Tuition charges coverthe total number of credits prescribed in a particular academicyear (fall and spring semesters) for each full-time program listedin the current catalogue. Credits in excess of the total numberprescribed in the College catalogue incur additional tuition chargesat the rates specified in the catalogue. <P>Supplementary bills for such additional charges are issued duringthe spring semester. It is the responsibility of each studentto ascertain whether he/she has registered for more credits thanare allowed in the catalogue. <P>Transfer students whose programs may require them to take creditsin excess of the number specified by the catalogue are requiredto pay extra charges for credits which are in excess. Studentswho repeat courses that they have failed and thereby take creditsin excess of catalogue provisions will, likewise, be requiredto pay supplementary charges. Students in the advanced coursesof AFROTC are not required to pay for credits earned in thesecourses. <P>Students on full or partial scholarships are required to pay supplementarycharges during the spring semester if they take credits in excessof those prescribed in a particular academic year for the regularfull-time program outlined in the catalogue. <P>Tuition charges for the Summer Session are exclusive of chargesfor the academic year and are made on a per-credit-hour basis.<P>The College may, after due consideration, decide to suspend atany time a student whose fees and charges are in arrears.<P><A NAME="id_cards"><B>I.D. Cards</B></A><P>Each student must carry a student identification card (I.D.),which will be issued by the Office of the Director of Campus Eventswhen the student first enters Manhattan College. If a commuterI.D. card is lost, arrangements for replacement may be made inthe Office of the Director of Campus Events. If a resident cardis lost, arrangements for replacement may be made in the FoodService Office. There is a replacement charge for new I.D.s. <P>The l.D. card must be presented to any member of the administrationor faculty, elected members of Student Government, residence lifestaff member, campus security officer, or food service supervisorwho may request it in the performance of assigned duties. <P><A NAME="liability"><B>Liability</B></A><P>The College is not normally responsible for the loss of personalproperty in any building owned by the College. However, any lossshould be reported promptly to the Security Office, De La SalleHall, room 105.<P><A NAME="publicity_posting_procedures"><B>Publicity and PostingProcedures</B></A><P>The Office of the Director of Student Activities and the StudentGovernment require that posting of materials must conform to thefollowing standards: <BR><P>1. Notices should be no larger than 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot;, mustbear the name of the posting and sponsoring organization(s), andare to be stamped in the lower left-hand corner by a member ofthe Executive Committee of Student Government or the Directorof Student Activities.<P>2. All notices must be placed on Student Government bulletin boards(any board that is not directly outside a College office). Theyare not to be placed on doors, mirrors or painted walls. Onlyone notice to a bulletin board is permitted. An exception to thisrule is a notice used in conjunction with the display board inThomas Hall. <P>3. Posters, greater in size than that defined for a flier, alsostamped and initialed by a member of the Executive Committee ofStudent Government or the Director of Student Activities, andbearing the name of the posting and sponsoring organization(s),may be hung from the lower edge of bulletin boards or on unpaintedsurfaces. <P>4. All notices/posters must be removed by the posting organization24 hours after the scheduled event with the exception of weekendevents; in such a case, the notices must be removed by 5 P.M.,Monday. <P>5.

Personal ads may be placed on Student Government bulletin boards.Notices are to be no larger than 8 1/2&quot; x 11&quot; datedand signed by the person placing the ad. The ad must be removedafter two weeks. <P>7. In no case shall anyone within the College community interferewith the distribution of fliers that comply with the establishedposter policy procedures of the College, in accordance with NewYork State Law, by any recognized student organization or anyother organization within the College community.<P>8. After the distribution of fliers, the posting organizationis urged to cooperate with custodial personnel in eliminatingany litter that is created.<P>9.

Posters or fliers advertising any activity at bars, restaurants,or other establishments serving alcohol are not allowed to beposted on campus.<P>13. No fliers advertising alcohol as per provisions #10 and #11of the Publicity and Posting Procedures shall be passed underthe doors of underage residents of the college, be left on carsparked in any Manhattan College parking lot or anywhere withinthe parking areas, or be sent to the campus mailbox of any resident,club, organization, or any other campus mailbox. Any individualor organization found in violation of this or any other policyregarding the advertisement of alcohol on this campus is subjectto mandatory fines that are twice the amount of the normal fineper offense, and additional sanctions levied at the discretionof the Student Court or the Office of the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs<P>14. Student Government, Director of Student Activities and theOffice of the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs, hereby recognize,endorse, and enforce any and all New York State Laws regardingthe advertisement of alcohol on campus.<P>Any failure to comply with these regulations shall be reportedto the Office of the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs and shallbe penalized by the following fines to be automatically leviedon the sponsoring organization by the Office of the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs: <P>First Offense: $25 <P>Second Offense: $50<P>Where an offense is defined as any poster or flier in violationof one or more provisions of the Publicity and Posting Procedures.Additional fines and sanctions may be levied by the Office ofthe Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs or the Student Court inaccordance with provision #12 of the Publicity and Posting Procedures.<P>All fines shall be paid into a special Reserve Board account.The fine may be appealed by the sponsoring organization to theStudent Court. Continued failure to comply with these regulationswill result in sanctions against the organization to be specifiedby the Student Court. <BR><P><A NAME="sales_solicitation"><B>Sales and Solicitations</B></A><P>There shall be no solicitation by outside agents for the saleof goods or services to students on any portion of the propertyof Manhattan College except: <P>1. Display and sale of goods and services to authorized representativesof the College for College purposes. <P>2. Groups or individuals by invitation of authorized College personnelto present proposals for group consideration. <P><A NAME="school_closing"><B>School Closing</B></A><P>Ordinarily, classes will be conducted during inclement weather.When extreme weather or emergency conditions exist, faculty, students,and staff may call 718-862-7103 to obtain information about thecollege closing.<P>It is College policy to reschedule these days when, and if, anexcessive number of class days must be canceled because of inclementweather.<BR><P><A NAME="search_and_seizure_policy"><B>Search and Seizure Policy</B></A><P>Premises occupied by students shall not be searched (as distinguishedfrom ordinary maintenance activities and Residence Life room inspections)except in cases where College officials have a reasonable basisto believe that there is a violation of the Student Code of Conduct.<P>If a room is searched, permission will normally be obtained throughthe Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs or the Vice President forStudent Life. In an emergency situation wherein health and safetyare immediate concerns, Residence Life and/or Security personnelmay search a room. A search may include looking into all itemsin, on, or under which the articles sought may be located.<BR><P><A NAME="smoking"><B>Smoking</B></A><P>In compliance with New York City's Indoor Smoking RestrictionLaw, the College designates certain areas as non-smoking. Someareas are divided into smoking and non-smoking portions. Stillother areas may be either smoking or non-smoking depending onthe preferences of those who live or work there.<P>Designated non-smoking areas include but are not limited to cafeterias,classrooms, hallways, labs, libraries, public meeting rooms, restrooms,computer rooms, elevators, the bookstore, and locker rooms.<P>Individual residence hall rooms are areas which are determinedsmoking/non-smoking by the people who live there.<P>For a complete copy of the smoking policy, contact the Human ResourcesOffice.<BR><P><A NAME="speaker_policy"><B>Speaker policy</B></A><P>It is the College's policy to encourage student organizationsto welcome persons of divergent viewpoints who will, within theframework of the stated aims of the College, enrich the academicexperience of the students. To assure its orderly implementation,a formal policy statement has been drafted. The policy is on filein the Office of the Director of Student Activities.<P><A NAME="summary_joing"><B>Summary of Joint Statement on StudentRights and Freedoms</B></A><P>The College approves and subscribes to the content of the JointStatement on the Rights and Freedoms of Students. The statementis not printed here because of its length. Instead, a summaryof the Statement, drawn up by the United States National StudentsAssociation, follows.<BR><P>1. Students should have protection through orderly proceduresagainst prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. <P>2. Information from disciplinary or counseling files should notbe available to unauthorized persons on campus or to any personoff campus without express consent of the student involved exceptunder legal compulsion or in cases where the safety of personor property is involved. <P>3. No records should be kept which reflect the political activitiesor beliefs of students. <P>4. Students should always be free to support causes by orderlymeans which do not disrupt the regular and essential operationof the institution. <P>5. Students should be allowed to invite and to hear any personof their choosing. <P>6. The student press should be free of censorship and advanceapproval of copy, and its editors and managers should be freeto develop their own editorial policies and news coverage. <P>7. Students who violate the law may incur penalties prescribedby civil authorities, but institutional authority should neverbe used to merely duplicate the function of general laws. Onlywhere the institution's interests as an academic community aredistinct and clearly involved should the special authority ofthe institution be asserted. <P>8. Except under extreme emergency circumstances, premises occupiedby students and the personal possessions of students should notbe searched unless appropriate authorization has been obtained.<P>9. The student should be as free as possible from imposed limitationsthat have no direct relevance to his education. Disciplinary proceedingsshould be instituted only for violations of standards of conductformulated with significant student participation and publishedin advance in an available body of institutional regulations.<P>10. In all situations, procedural fair play requires that thestudent be informed of the nature of the charges against him,that he be given a fair opportunity to refute them, that the institutionnot be arbitrary in its action and that there be provision forappeal of a decision.<BR><P><A NAME="codeofconduct"><B>STUDENT CODE OF CONDUCT<BR></B></A><P><B>Academic Integrity</B><P>The Manhattan College Catalog indicates that the College is committedto providing its students opportunities for development in allareas: intellectual, moral, artistic, social, and professional.Promotion of academic integrity should, therefore, be a part ofthe duties of the College community including students, faculty,administration and support staff. Each constituency should beaware of its duties and rights in these areas.<P><B>To the Student</B><P>It is the student's responsibility to pursue academic work ina manner consistent with prescribed policies of the College andrequirements of the individual course. All materials submittedto the College or an instructor in fulfillment of course workmust be the student's own work unless permission has been grantedfor team efforts in larger projects. No material, methods or resultsshall be represented as the student's own work if these were obtainedfrom another source. If materials, methods, or results are obtainedfrom other sources, they shall be so identified.<P>All types of academic fraud and misrepresentation, including improperpassage or receipt of information during examinations, use ofunauthorized sources of information during examinations, dishonestpresentation of laboratory data, willful plagiarism in the presentationof reports or computer programs, unauthorized transmittal or receiptof examination material before an examination and tampering withthe grading process after submittal of course material are subjectto academic penalties.<P>Students are expected to be present for all examinations and toturn in assignments on the date due. If students cannot be presentfor an examination or cannot meet an assignment deadline, theyshould inform the instructor as soon as possible and provide legitimatereasons. These reasons shall be bona fide and of sufficient importthat both the instructor and student can agree that the studentshould not be penalized in the final grade. If requested by theinstructor, the student should be able to corroborate the reasons.Dishonest statements or misrepresentations shall be subject tothe same penalties as other forms of academic dishonesty.<P>Students who are witnesses to the cheating of other students havea moral responsibility to report the incident with specifics ofdate, course and instructor to the instructor or the chairpersonof the department or the dean of the school of which the instructoris a member. The individual to whom the report is made will thenfollow the procedure outlined at the end of this policy statement.<P>Students should consider computer files and electronic mail thesame as United States Postal Service mail. The Computer Centerreserves the right to inspect files or mail messages if thereis reason to believe they may be responsible for problems on thecomputer system.<P><B>To the Instructor</B><P>It is the instructor's responsibility to avoid those practicesthat are conducive to acts of academic dishonesty. Certain typesof examinations, such as multiple choice, true or false, shortanswer quizzes without partial credit and take-home projects,are particularly conducive to academic dishonesty and generallyshall be avoided. If they are used, the instructor must administerthese with special care to limit the temptation for student cheating.Practices such as giving the same examinations or assigning thesame projects year after year should also be avoided if possible.The teacher will take special care to detect and punish instancesof plagiarism. Each department will consult, discuss, and takesuch action to enforce academic integrity as is deemed necessaryand proper to that department. Preparation and duplication ofexamination materials should be handled in a confidential mannerto prevent prior circulation. Support staff involved in the preparationof confidential material should be informed as to its nature andinstructed to keep this material inaccessible to unauthorizedpeople.<P>As described in the <I>Faculty Handbook</I>, the instructor shall,within the first two weeks of the semester, inform each classof requirements regarding submission of reports, procedures ofexaminations and quizzes and the basis for assigning grades. Infairness to the students, instructors should proctor their ownexaminations whenever possible. In accordance with the <I>FacultyHandbook</I>, proctors are expected to perform this task withdiligence and close attention to student behavior. Verbal warningsshall be given if the proctor suspects that some students areengaging in cheating. If the instructor believes that a case ofcheating is clearly identifiable, the instructor shall personallydiscuss the charge with the student as soon as possible. The instructorwill investigate student reports of cheating in that instructor'sclass. <P>The instructor shall abide by the decision in any appeal caseinvolving the grade given to the student accused of academic dishonesty.<P><B>To the Administrator</B><P>It is the Provost's responsibility to disseminate this PolicyStatement on Academic Integrity throughout the Manhattan Collegecommunity and to see to its implementation. <P>The Dean of each school and the chairperson of each departmentwill act appropriately upon any student report of academic dishonesty.Each will, within his/her respective area of supervision, takeleadership in enforcing academic integrity by discussion and appropriateaction. Each Dean will maintain a separate file of reported casesof academic dishonesty; no record of the charge shall be maintainedin the Dean's academic files. <BR><P><B>Procedure for Cases of Academic Dishonesty</B><P>Any member of the College community may report in writing to theAssociate Dean of Judicial Affairs an alleged incident of academicdishonesty as defined in the policy on Academic Integrity. Thestudent(s) involved then becomes subject to an investigation andpossible subsequent disciplinary action. <P>The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs will hold a preliminaryhearing to provide the accused student(s) with the opportunityto discuss the facts and circumstances which led to the report.This hearing and all subsequent hearings will be tape recorded.<P>If the student <B>acknowledges</B> guilt, the case may proceedto a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on Student Affairsto determine the <I>sanction</I>, as outlined in the <I>StudentHandbook</I>. If the student <B>denies</B> guilt, the case willproceed to a hearing before the Judiciary Committee on StudentAffairs for a <I>decision and, if appropriate, sanction</I> asoutlined in the <I>Student Handbook</I>.<P>Both the accused student and the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairshave the right of written appeal to the <I>Provost</I> withinthree working days of the notification of the sanction. The appealprocess is outlined in the <I>Student Handbook.<BR></I><P><B>Sanctions</B><P>The penalty for a first offense will ordinarily be an F in thecourse, but different penalties may be determined by the JudiciaryCommittee. For a repeated offense the student will be suspendedor expelled. <P>An especially flagrant violation such as the theft of confidentialinformation from a computer record, the forging or tampering withacademic records either in hard copy or on a computer, or thestealing of copies of an examination may warrant expulsion. <P>The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs will notify the Dean ofthe school in which the student is enrolled of all cases wherea student is found guilty of academic dishonesty. The Dean willdestroy these files upon the student's graduation. <BR><P><A NAME="abuse_misuse"><B>SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MISUSE POLICY <BR></B></A><P><B>The Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Policy</B><P>Annually, Manhattan College informs students about the Drug-FreeSchools and Communities Act of 1989. This law, with which theCollege intends to comply fully, was designed, in part, to preventthe illicit use of drugs and the abuse of alcohol by students.<P>Failure to comply with the College's regulations and the lawsof the State of New York governing the possession, distribution,and consumption of alcohol constitutes a violation of the Codeof Conduct. The same applies to the unauthorized sale, purchase,production, possession, distribution, or use of controlled substancesof other addictive and illegal drugs on college premises. Violationsare punishable by sanctions which have been imposed pursuant tothe judicial procedures of the College which are set forth inthis handbook. These sanctions include dismissal from the Collegeand students may also be accountable to the appropriate civilauthorities.<P>The laws of New York State contain all relevant statues regardingthe possession, sale, distribution or use of alcohol and otherdrugs. If a student is convicted of a violation under these statues,he/she could face a fine, imprisonment, or the loss of drivingprivileges. If a student under the age of 21 purchases alcoholicbeverages through fraudulent means, they can face additional penaltiesif convicted.<P><B>Alcohol</B><P>Consumption of alcoholic beverages is a custom in American societyand is prevalent at most college campuses. Problems which relateto drinking are also universal and are particularly acute in collegecommunities. Studies indicate that more than one-fourth of individualsin college community have problems caused by immoderate and irresponsibledrinking. The College must have policies, programs and regulationsthat recognize the potential problems resulting from excessiveconsumption and that endeavor to prevent such occurrence.<P>The purpose of the College is twofold. 1. We must provide thebest possible opportunity for learning, and 2. We must createan environment conducive to personal growth. These goals are hinderedby alcohol abuse. Behavior resulting from excessive drinking thatinterferes with the accomplishment of our goals is unacceptableand shall be cause for disciplinary action. The College providesits own educational and counseling programs, as well as referralsources, in order to assist members of the College community indealing with alcohol problems that may develop.<P>College policy permits the use of alcohol in moderation in accordancewith New York State law but opposes excessive consumption. Thosewho drink must remain in control of their behavior; they shallbe responsible for their actions and respect the rights of others.Promotions and publicity that glorify or urge consumption of alcoholare prohibited.<P>Under current New York State law, individuals under 21 years ofage may not possess or consume alcoholic beverages nor may individualsover 21 years of age furnish alcoholic beverages to those under21 years of age.<P>Manhattan is chartered by the State of New York and, as such,it must make every reasonable effort to ensure that State lawis observed on College property. Accordingly, the following Collegepolicies are in effect: <P>(1) Persons under 21 years of age may not possess or consume alcoholicbeverages on College premises. <P>(2) No member of the College community may serve or otherwisefurnish alcoholic beverages to persons under 21 years of age onCollege premises. <P>(3) No person under the age of 21 may present evidence of agewhich is false for the purpose of purchasing alcoholic beverages.<P>Sanctions for violations of this policy are expulsion or suspensionfrom the college or residence halls; probation; fines; communityservice; or revocation of privileges. <BR><P><B>Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs</B><P>The unauthorized selling, purchasing, or possession, or distributionof narcotics, depressants, stimulants, or hallucinogenic drugsis in violation of the Student Code of Conduct and state and federallaws. Manhattan College cannot and will not be a sanctuary fromcivil authorities.<P>Any student distributing or selling drugs on campus will be subjectto dismissal through the College judiciary procedure. Evidenceof distribution or sale of drugs on campus will be reported tothe appropriate law enforcement agency. The College will cooperatewith law enforcement agencies in apprehending specific individualswhose activities such authorities have good reason to suspect.<P>The possession and/or use of such drugs is strictly forbidden.Students violating this restriction are subject to suspension,involuntary leave of absence, referral for a mandatory substanceabuse assessment, parental notification, and other sanctions.<P>The College recognizes the need for counseling and other supportservices for students who have used or are using drugs. The CollegeCounseling Center provides referrals for specialized professionalassessment and treatment as well as for self-help support groups.<BR><P><A NAME="expectations_behavios"><B>COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS ANDBEHAVIOR <BR></B></A><P>At Manhattan College, community is based on the mutual respectof many persons engaged in different aspects of the academic venture.In this cooperative educational experience, the Manhattan communityhas found that certain kinds of behavior defeat the respect webear for one another.<P>Generally, College jurisdiction and discipline shall be limitedto conduct which occurs on College premises (all land, buildings,facilities, and other property used or controlled by the Collegeincluding adjacent streets and sidewalks) and conduct which adverselyaffects the College community and/or the pursuit of its objectives.The College's right to discipline students extends to all offcampus activity which is sponsored by the College including socialfunctions and athletic events. Furthermore, in an effort to providea safe and secure environment for all students and to protectthe public order, the College believes it must hold all studentsaccountable for their behavior at all times. Therefore, the Collegewill confront cases of illegal and/or irresponsible behavior whetherit occurs on or off campus.<P>Inappropriate behavior that is observed by campus officials aswell as information provided by the Police and other local authoritieswill be addressed. The College will sanction such behavior inaccordance with the policies and procedures as outlined in thisHandbook. College authority is not used to duplicate the functionof civil laws. The College will provide counseling and referralsfor students who demonstrate a pattern of irresponsible behaviorincluding alcohol misuse.<P>The following actions are considered violations of the CollegeCode of Conduct and are punishable by sanctions imposed in accordancewith the judicial procedures of the College: <BR><P>1. Vandalism to, or theft of, College property or property belongingto another person while on college property (including, but notlimited to, library materials and computer files). <P>2. Any behavior that is contrary to the order requisite for theeducational community, including but not limited to, conduct whichthreatens or endangers the life, health, safety or well-beingof self or others.<P>3. Unauthorized entry or use of College facilities; unauthorizedpossession, duplication or use of keys to College facilities.<P>4. Tampering with fire-fighting equipment or alarms located onCollege property.<P>5. Unauthorized possession or use of dangerous or lethal weapons,explosives, firecrackers or combustibles. <P>6. Refusal to show identification to administrative, academic,Security or food service personnel or members of Student Governmentwho are performing their assigned duties.<P>7. Physical or verbal abuse of a College official.<P>8. Improper use of or transfer of Manhattan College identification.<P>9. Creating loud noise or other disturbance on the Quadrangle;game playing such as frisbee, football, catch, etc, on the Quadrangle.<P>10. Gambling in any form anywhere on the campus.<P>11. Smoking in restricted areas such as classrooms, cafeterias,corridors and foyers.<P>12. Any evidence of bigotry, racism, or prejudice directed towardanother individual or organization.<P>13. Being in a state of intoxication.<P>14. Any conduct which would violate the criminal codes of anyNew York City, New York State, or federal governmental agency.<P>15. Any sexual intercourse while on campus, and outside the boundsof marriage is behavior that is unacceptable in the universitycommunity. Students involved in activity of this nature will besubject to disciplinary action and/or counseling.<P>16. Any activity in violation of the College Policy Statementspresented in this Handbook or other college publications.<P>17. Failure to comply with the directives of College officialsacting in performance of their duties.<P>18. Engaging or threatening to engage in behavior which posesimminent danger of causing substantial harm to self or others,or would cause significant property damage, or would directlyand substantially impede the lawful activities of others, shallbe subject to an involuntary leave of absence.<P>19. Abuse of telecommunications, (telephone, e-mail, cable T.V.),computing and information services privileges will not be toleratedand shall result in appropriate disciplinary action includingbut not limited to revocation of privileges. Students are expectedto comply with all relevant laws and college policies governingaccess to and use of these services, software, equipment and tocomport themselves in an ethical manner with a high degree ofregard for fellow students and others.<P>20. Violations of any other policies outlined in the ResidenceLife section of this Handbook.<BR><P><B>NOTE:</B> Because of the Cooperative Program between the Collegeof Mount Saint Vincent and Manhattan College, students from eitherCollege may be present at the other's events. The actions of studentspresent on either college campus are governed by the Code of Conductof that particular college and can result in suspension of theprivilege of cross-campus participation. However, disciplinaryactions occur on the student's home campus.<BR><P><B>Disruptive Activity</B><P>Manhattan College wishes to reaffirm its role and function asan institution of higher learning where free inquiry and opendiscussion are considered indispensable elements for the achievementof its goal. <P>Dissent is recognized as a means for exposing error or discoveringalternative routes to truth, but the presentation of dissent throughdisruptive action will not be tolerated. Disruptive action includesphysical violence and/or conduct which restrains either the freedomof expression or movement of others or which obstructs normalcollege operation or which causes damage to personal or Collegeproperty, and thereby denies to others the freedom which all areentitled. <P>Therefore, in conformity with recommendations received from representativesof the student body, the faculty, the administration and the Boardof Trustees, the procedures to be followed at Manhattan Collegein case of disruptive action will be: <P>1. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs or his/her designeewill apprise all participating parties, directly or through theirrecognized leaders, that failure to discontinue, promptly, obstructionor disruption may result in disciplinary action including , butnot limited to, suspension and/or dismissal following the Collegejudiciary procedures. <P>2. Participating parties may be asked to show their identificationcards to the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs or his/her designee.Those who either have no such identification or refuse to showit and are unknown to the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs orhis/her designee will be assumed not to be members of the Collegecommunity and will be subject to legal action. <P>3. If obstruction or disruption continues for a period of timethat makes it obvious in the view of officials of the Collegethat ordinary methods are not sufficient to control the situation,the assistance of municipal law enforcement authorities will berequested. The decision to summon such assistance lies with thePresident of the College. Other members of the administration,faculty and student body may be consulted if there is time inthe opinion of the President. <BR><P><B>Hazing</B><P>Hazing in any form is expressly prohibited at Manhattan College.Hazing is defined as any planned action or created situation,whether on or off campus, that is demeaning to an individual;produces mental or physical duress, harassment or ridicule; orwhich threatens or endangers the health or safety of any person.<P>Such activities and situations include but are not limited to,any action or situation that recklessly or intentionally endangersmental or physical health or involves the forced consumption ofliquor or drugs for the purpose of initiation or affiliation withany organization, paddling in any form, creation of excessivefatigue, physical and psychological shocks, morally degradingor humiliating games or activities, late (post-midnight) worksessions that interfere with scholastic activities and any otheractivities that are not consistent with policies and regulationsat Manhattan College. <P>This policy governs the conduct of students, faculty and otherstaff as well as visitors and other licensees and invitees onManhattan College's campus and property. <P>Violation of the policy will result in the ejection of a violatorfrom College property and possible prosecution; and, in the caseof a student or faculty violator, suspension, expulsion or otherappropriate disciplinary action, according to existing judiciaryprocedures; and, in the case of an organization authorizing suchconduct, rescission of permission for that organization to operateon campus property as a result of having its official recognitionas a student organization withdrawn. Further, such penalties shallbe in addition to any penalty, pursuant to the penal code or anyother chapter to which a violator or organization may be subject.<P>A copy of this policy will be given to all students enrolled atManhattan College and shall be deemed part of the by-laws of allorganizations operating on campus. Additionally, the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs shall review annually such by-laws withindividuals affiliated with such organizations. <P>The foregoing policy statement is intended to comply with Chapter676, Section 6450, of the Education Law of 1980 and with Section120.16 of the New York State Penal Code. <BR><P><B>Sexual Harassment</B><P>Preamble<P>Manhattan College has long been known for the value-centered educationit offers. Among the values the College Community cherishes andimparts is a deep respect for the dignity and integrity of eachperson. Among the responsibilities the Community assumes is theneed to stand firm against all that threatens that dignity andintegrity. <P>Since discrimination of any form vitiates every form of humanrelationship, the College has long stated its intolerance of anydiscriminatory practice based on race, color, religion, nationality,or sex. <P>Knowing that sexual harassment is an insidious form of discrimination,one that demeans the dignity and integrity of the individual,that attacks the College's mission to foster an open learningand working environment, that destroys the good order of society,the College has condemned such harassment in the following policyadopted by the Senate, the President, and the Board of Trusteesin the Fall 1987. In addition, the College adopts the followingformal procedure should any such harassment be reported. <P>Policy<P>It is the policy of Manhattan College that no member of the CollegeCommunity may sexually harass another. <P>For general policy purposes, sexual harassment may be describedas unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, andother physical and expressive behavior of a sexual nature where:<P>1. Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitlya term or condition of an individual's employment or education:<P>2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individualis used as the basis for academic or employment decisions affectingthe individual; or <P>3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interferingwith an individual's academic or professional performance or creatingan intimidating, hostile, or demeaning employment or educationalenvironment. <BR><P>No College personnel and no office of the College shall condonesexual harassment either actively or by ignoring a complaint bya member of the College community or an obvious attempt to harasssexually another by a member of the College community. <P>No member of the College community may retaliate in any way againsta person for making a claim of sexual harassment or for assistingor acting as witness for a person who makes a claim of sexualharassment. <P>It is in the best interest of the College and of the complainantif the complainant consults with a trusted member of the Collegecommunity at the first instance of what may be perceived as sexualharassment. It is also in both the complainant's and the community'sbest interest if informal procedure is tried before formal chargesare filed. <P>Protection from retaliation in all cases<P>In its policy on sexual harassment, the College has affirmed thatno retaliation may be made against anyone for making a claim ofsexual harassment or for assisting or acting as a witness fora person who makes a formal or informal claim of sexual harassment.Should there be any evidence of retaliation, such shall be documentedin a letter to the Affirmative Action Officer with a copy to thePresident as quickly as possible. The Affirmative Action Officershall investigate all allegations of retaliation immediately.<P>The Hearing Committee<P>If a formal hearing is required to adjudicate charges of sexualharassment, an ad-hoc Hearing Committee will be constituted froma pre-determined list of sixteen persons representing the fourconstituencies of the College community, all of whom will havereceived training in the procedure and guidelines involving sexualharassment cases and are willing to serve on such a panel withutmost confidentiality and impartiality. <P>To develop this list of sixteen, the Affirmative Action Officershall ask the representatives of the four constituencies, StudentGovernment, Faculty Council, Administrators (including professionalstaff), and a Staff Group to name four persons each.* Studentsshall serve for a one-year renewable term. Faculty, staff, andadministrators shall serve for three-year renewable terms.** <P>An ad-hoc Hearing Committee shall be selected randomly from thepre-determined list of sixteen and shall comprise the chairperson(the Affirmative Action Officer), one faculty member, one student,one staff member, and one administrator. To this shall be addedtwo more members from the list, one to be chosen by the complainantand one to be chosen by the alleged harasser. <P>For charges that do not involve a student, the student on thecommittee shall be excused and not replaced by any other persons.<P>Any committee member perceiving a conflict of interest may excusehimself of herself, and the Affirmative Action Officer shall appointa replacement from the same group on the remaining list. The AffirmativeAction Officer may consider and may grant any application to removeand replace a member of the panel because of an alleged conflictof interest. <P>*For the representatives of the Administrators (including professionalstaff), the Vice-Presidents for Facilities Management, StudentServices, Finance, and College Advancement shall ask for volunteersto stand for election from each group. All administrators (includingprofessional staff), shall elect from the total slate, but eachof the four areas must be represented. For staff representation,the Vice-President of Human Resources shall notify all staff,asking for volunteers. The Vice-President of Human Resources shallthen choose four members, making sure that all components of thestaff are represented. Students must be at junior or senior level;all faculty representatives must be tenured. <P>**The first year that the list is drawn up, terms for faculty,staff, and administrators shall be set at one, two, and threeyears randomly to allow for orderly rotation. <BR><P>Alleged harassment involving Members and Non-Members of the CollegeCommunity<P>If a guest of a member of the College community or if an employeeof a service contractor is harassed by a member of the Collegecommunity, the procedures stated herein shall be followed. <P>If the alleged harasser is a member of an agency or company thatserves the College or contracts with the College to perform services,written notice of the alleged incident shall be made as soon aspossible by the complainant to the Affirmative Action Officerand then by the Affirmative Action Officer to the appropriatedean (where there is jurisdiction) or vice president in chargeof supervising the contract. <P>If the alleged harasser is a guest of a member of the Collegecommunity (including service personnel), written notice of thealleged incident shall be made as soon as possible by the complainantto the Affirmative Action Officer and then by the AffirmativeAction Officer to the appropriate dean or vice president. <P>Alleged harassment involving only Students<P>Since there is already in place a Judiciary Committee for adjudicatingcomplaints between students, matters of this nature shall be referredto that Judiciary Committee. Careful procedure shall be workedout in advance, perhaps based on the procedure worked out forother types of sexual harassment hearings. <P>Alleged harassment involving College Personnel or Students andCollege Personnel<BR><P>I. FILING CHARGES<UL><LI>a. It is not necessary that the complainants first try informallyto end the harassment, but is strongly recommended that he orshe do so. <LI>b. The complainant may choose any faculty member, administrator,or staff member to serve as confident(e). But there shall be oneperson to whom and through whom all written charges are made andadjudicated, the Affirmative Action Officer. Should the AffirmativeAction Officer be named in a sexual harassment complaint, theAffirmative Action officer shall immediately turn over all jurisdictionto the Provost. <LI>c. After discussing the situation with the Affirmative ActionOfficer and deciding to initiate formal procedure, the complainantshall file written charges with the Affirmative Action Officerwithin two months after the date of the last incident of allegedsexual harassment complained of or the date of the last attemptto stop the alleged harassment.* <LI>d. The complaint shall be filed in writing with the AffirmativeAction Officer in a simple statement or letter naming the allegedharasser, the dates, times, places, and nature of the offenseor offenses. Additional information should include any informalsteps taken by the complainant to end the behavior, the name ornames of any witness or witnesses to the alleged harassment, anthe name of any confident(e) selected by the complainant. </UL><P>*The Affirmative Action Officer may extend all time limits forgood cause. <BR><P>The Affirmative Action Officer shall have a simple form availableto help the complainant set forth the appropriate information.<BR><UL><LI>e.

THE SEPARATE MEETINGS<BR><P>Within two weeks of the filing of charges, the Affirmative ActionOfficer shall meet separately with the complainant, and with thealleged harasser to discuss the charges.* At these separate meetings,the complainant and the alleged harasser may each bring one personas support (the confidante or a parent or close friend, a chairpersonor faculty member), but these guests shall have no right to speakpublicly unless asked to by the Affirmative Action Officer. TheAffirmative Action Officer has full authority to push for resolutionat this time.<P>III. THE JOINT CONFERENCE AND THE PROCESS OF CONSTITUTING THEHEARING COMMITTEE<UL><LI>a. Within two weeks of the individual meetings,* the AffirmativeAction Officer shall schedule a joint conference, bringing togetherthe complainant and the alleged harasser. Again, the complainantand the alleged harasser may each bring one person as support(the confident[e] or a parent or close friend, a chairperson orfaculty member), but these guests shall have no right to speakpublicly unless asked to by the Affirmative Action Officer. Again,the Affirmative Action Officer has full authority to and shallmake every effort to resolve the problem, especially if the allegedharasser apologizes and promises to cease all such conduct andthe complainant is willing to accept this.<LI>b. At this joint conference, if no such resolution can beaffected quickly, a date within four weeks shall be set for aformal hearing to determine if sexual harassment has indeed occurred,and if so, the severity of the action and the kinds of sanctionswarranted. If the total time of nine weeks from the date of thefiling of the written complaint to the date of the formal hearingcannot be maintained, the party seeking the delay shall explainin writing to all involved why such a delay is necessary.* <BR><LI>c. At this joint conference, in the presence of the complainantand the alleged harasser, the Affirmative Action Officer shalldraw randomly the prescribed number for each category from thelist of sixteen to constitute the Hearing Committee. At this samejoint conference, the complainant and the alleged harasser eachshall nominate a specific candidate as their choice from thosenot already randomly drawn. They may choose from any category.If none on the list of pre-determined panelists is acceptableto either the complainant or the alleged harasser or both, eitherthe complainant or the alleged harasser or both shall nominatea person of his or her choice from within the College community.<LI>d. At this time also, the procedures of testimony and of cross-examinationand the nature of penalties shall be explained.</UL><P>*The Affirmative Action Officer may extend all time limits forgood cause. <P>IV. THE FORMAL HEARING<BR><UL><LI>a. The formal hearing shall be conducted impartially and withcourtesy extended to all parties.<LI>b. The formal hearing shall be recorded and a full transcriptprepared at College expense.<LI>c. The complainant shall testify first; the charged shallfollow.<LI>d.

Each member of the Hearing Committee may question any witness.<LI>g. Each witness may be examined by the complainant and thecharged directly.<LI>h. The complainant and the charged may question each other.<BR></UL><P>V. THE DECISION PROCESS<BR><UL><LI>a. The Hearing Committee shall issue its conclusions in writingto the President within two weeks of the close of hearings.*<LI>b. If the Hearing Committee concludes that sexual harassmenthas taken place, it shall include in its report the number ofmembers voting for each finding.<LI>c. If a majority concludes that the charged party had engagedin sexual harassment of the complainant, it may recommend thatthe President:<UL><LI>1. consider restitution to the complainant if appropriate;<LI>2. send a letter of warning to the offender;<LI>3. send a letter of reprimand to the offender;<LI>4. require counseling for the offender;<LI>5. suspend the offender for a definite time period;<LI>6. begin procedures to dismiss the offender.</UL><LI>d. If no sexual harassment is found, the Hearing Committeeshall file a full report with the President.<LI>e. Should the panel find the complainant either frivolousor malicious in bringing charges, the Committee may suggest thatthe President do one of the following:<UL><LI>1. send a letter of warning to the complainant;<LI>2. send a letter of reprimand to the complainant;<LI>3. require counseling for the complainant;<LI>4. suspend the complainant for a definite time period;<LI>5. begin procedures to dismiss the complainant.</UL><LI>f.

An appeals committee of three shall be named within twoweeks of the receipt of the registered letter.* This appeals committeeof three shall be constituted from the pre-determined list ofthe sixteen faculty, students, staff, and administrators on thelist, but shall not include any who served on the original HearingCommittee. The Affirmative Action Officer shall name all threemembers and specify the chairperson. <LI>d. This appeals committee shall have the right to all recordsin the case.

The Affirmative Action Officer shall notify the two partiesto pick up copies of the decision in his or her office. <BR></UL><P><A NAME="judiciary_procedures"><B>Judiciary Procedures</B></A><P>Disciplinary authority is vested in the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs. This authority may be exercised by referral to one ofthe following hearing boards: the Judiciary Committee on StudentAffairs, the College Judiciary Council, or the Student Court.At the discretion of the Associate Dean, the President of theCollege or Vice President for Student Life may conduct preliminaryhearings or act as hearing officers. The Judiciary Committee onStudent Affairs and the College Judiciary Council have the authorityto hear cases involving alleged violations of the Student Codeof Conduct when suspension or expulsion from the College may bethe appropriate sanction if charges are substantiated. Other typesof cases may be heard if referred to the Committee by the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs. The Judiciary Committee is composedof three faculty members, chosen on the basis of availabilityfrom those who have been appointed by the College President accordingto the procedures of the Council on Faculty Affairs, and threestudents including the President of Student Government, the Presidentof the Senior Class, the Chief Justice and three student alternatesappointed by the Executive Committee of Student Government andapproved by the Legislature. One faculty member will be chosenby members of the Judiciary Committee to serve as non-voting chairfor a period of one year; one faculty member will be chosen toserve as alternate chair. A full hearing board should be presentto constitute a valid hearing. Exceptions must be agreed uponin writing by the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs and the accusedstudent(s). <P>The College Judiciary Council has the authority to hear casesof appeal from the Judiciary Committee on Student Affairs or appealsof administrative decisions by the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs may also assignserious cases of alleged misconduct directly to the College JudiciaryCouncil. The Council is comprised of three administrators and/orfaculty members appointed by the Vice President of Student Life.<P>The Student Court has the authority to hear cases involving allegedviolations of Student Government regulations and College regulationswithin its jurisdiction, as referred by the Associate Dean ofJudicial Affairs. It also adjudicates appeals of campus parkingtickets. The Court is composed of a Chief Justice and six AssociateJustices to be nominated by the Executive Committee and approvedby a two-thirds vote of the Legislature. <BR><P><B>General Statements</B><P>The standard for disciplinary decision making is based on thepreponderance of the evidence. <P>A student may remain silent at a hearing and such silence shouldnot be used against the student. A violation of the Student Codeof Conduct may nevertheless be found based upon the other evidencepresented. <P>The action of the College with respect to any off campus conductshall be made independently of off campus authority. Studentsmay be accountable to both civil authorities and to the Collegefor acts which constitute violations of law and of the StudentCode of Conduct. Disciplinary action at the College will normallyproceed during the pendency of criminal/civil proceedings andwill not be subject to challenge on the ground that criminal/civilcharges involving the same incident have been delayed, reduced,or dismissed.<P><B>Jurisdiction</B><P>Generally, College jurisdiction and discipline shall be limitedto conduct which occurs on College premises (all land, buildings,facilities, and other property used or controlled by the Collegeincluding adjacent streets and sidewalks) and conduct which adverselyaffects the College community and/or the pursuit of its objectives.The College's right to discipline students extends to all offcampus activity which is sponsored by the College including socialfunctions and athletic events. Furthermore, in an effort to providea safe and secure environment for all students and to protectthe public order, the College believes it must hold all studentsaccountable for their behavior at all times. Therefore, the Collegewill confront cases of illegal and/or irresponsible behavior whetherit occurs on or off campus.<P>Inappropriate behavior that is observed by campus officials aswell as information provided by the Police and other local authoritieswill be addressed. The College will sanction such behavior inaccordance with the policies and procedures as outlined in thisHandbook. College authority is not used to duplicate the functionof civil laws. The College will provide counseling and referralsfor students who demonstrate a pattern of irresponsible behaviorincluding alcohol misuse.<P><B>Hearing Procedures </B><P>Notification and preliminary hearing<P>Any member of the College community may report an alleged violationof the Student Code of Conduct to the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs, in writing. The student(s) involved becomes subject toa disciplinary investigation and possible subsequent action. <P>The Associate Dean ofJudicial Affairs will hold a preliminaryhearing to provide the accused student with the opportunity todiscuss the facts and circumstances which led to the report. TheAssociate Dean will clarify the student's rights as defined inthe Student Handbook as well as describe potential sanctions forthe violation in question. Discussion will determine whether thecharges will be handled administratively or by a hearing board.<P>If the student acknowledges the violation, the Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs will decide on the course of action to betaken, which may include determination of the sanction by theAssociate Dean of Judicial Affairs or assignment to a hearingby the Student Court, the College Judiciary Council, or the JudiciaryCommittee on Student Affairs to determine the sanction. The student'spreference will be taken into consideration. <P>If the student denies the charges, the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs will determine whether the case will be assigned to theStudent Court, the College Judiciary Council, or the JudiciaryCommittee on Student Affairs.<P>Procedures for the Judiciary Committee on Student Affairs andthe College Judiciary Council<P>If the case proceeds to a hearing before the Judiciary Committeeon Student Affairs or the College Judiciary Council: <P>1. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs will inform the studentin writing of the specific charge against him/her and of the timeand place of the hearing. <P>2. The accused student shall be given a reasonable time to ensureopportunity to prepare for the hearing. <P>3. The accused student shall not be subject to disciplinary sanctionsuntil the conclusion of the hearing except in extreme cases whereit is deemed that the individual(s) represents a danger to himself/herselfor to the College community. In such a case the Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs may suspend a student pending the outcomeof the hearing. <P>4. The accused student shall be given copies of all evidence pertinentto the case except any which may be excluded by the College policyon Confidentiality of Student Records. <P>5. The accused student shall have an opportunity to present evidencein his/her behalf, including the testimony of witnesses, and shallnot be compelled to testify against himself/ herself. <P><B>Hearing Guidelines</B><P>The chairperson of the Committee/Council is responsible for maintainingan orderly hearing process. <I>Only those persons recognized bythe chair may speak at the hearing</I>. Persons other than thosedirectly involved in the case are permitted to be present providedthey have the approval of the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs.The chair has the right to exclude persons from the hearing ifthey are disruptive, or to postpone the hearing because of disruptivebehavior of participants or observers. Disruptive behavior mayform the basis of a charge in and of itself. <P>If an accused student fails to appear at a scheduled hearing andhis/her absence is not excused, the hearing may proceed withouthim or her. The hearing may be rescheduled at the option of theAssociate Dean of Judicial Affairs. <P>The following represent general operating guidelines: <BR><P>1. The chairperson will inform the accused student(s) of the policiesand procedures for the hearing including the fact that the hearingmay be recorded. <P>2. The chair will ask each member of the Committee/Council tointroduce himself/herself and relate his/her College affiliation.<P>3. The accused student(s) will have the right to be assisted byan adviser of his/her choice, who must be a member of the ManhattanCollege community (administrator, faculty member or student).The adviser may assist the student in preparation of his/her defense,may accompany him/her to the hearing, may advise the student duringthe hearing, but may not participate directly in the hearing process.Only those persons recognized by the chair may speak at the hearing.<P>4. The Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs and the accused studentwill present statements concerning the alleged violation of thecode of conduct. The accused student, the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs and members of the Committee/Council may examine all writtenmaterial and question all witnesses. <P>5. After all statements have been presented, the Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs and the accused student, in that order, maybe given the opportunity to summarize, at the discretion of thechairperson. <P>6. The Committee/Council will then go into closed session to makeits decision. The Committee/Council will determine by majorityvote from the weight and credibility of the statements and evidencewhether the accused has violated the code of conduct. The chairpersonwill inform the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs and the studentof the Committee's decision. <P>7. If the Committee/Council finds the accused student has violatedthe code of conduct, the student will be given the opportunityto make a statement to the Committee/Council. The Associate Deanof Judicial Affairs may respond to statements presented. The Committee/Councilwill also consider the following: <BR><UL><LI>a. the statements presented at the hearing;<LI>b. prior disciplinary record of the student;<LI>c. the disciplinary precedent. <BR></UL><P>The Committee/Council will then determine the sanction in closedsession and inform the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs andthe student. If the student is not able to be present to hearthe decision of the sanction from the hearing board, the AssociateDean of Judicial Affairs will inform him/her verbally as soonas possible. Written confirmation of the decision will be sentto the student(s) by the Associate Dean of Judicial Affairs. <P>8. When the hearing has ended, all documents and tapes (if recorded)shall remain in the custody of the Associate Dean of JudicialAffairs. It is understood that files of each case shall be strictlyconfidential and will not be released without the permission ofthe accused student except under legal compulsion or in caseswhere the safety of persons or property is involved. <BR><P><A NAME="disciplinary_sanctiosn"><B>Disciplinary Sanctions</B></A><P>When it has been determined that a student has violated a Collegerule, a sanction or combination of sanctions is imposed.

<title>Manhattan College Athletics: John
Leonard, Head Coach, Men's Basketball</title>
<meta name="CreatedBy" content="WP Internet Publisher 6.1">
</head>
<body>
JOHN LEONARD<p>

Manhattan College Head Coach<p>

<p>

	Contrary to popular belief, new Manhattan head coach John Leonard proves the theory that indeed,
"you can go home again." <p>

	Leonard, who spent four years as a member of the Jaspers' basketball team (1978-82) and four years
as a Jasper assistant coach (1988-92), returns to his alma mater after spending the past four seasons as an
assistant, then associate head coach at Villanova University.<p>

	On April 30, 1996, John Leonard was introduced as Manhattan College's 20th men's basketball
head coach.  It marked the third time in the 36-year-old's life that the Riverdale, New York, school
welcomed him "home".  <p>

     Leonard first entered the College in 1978 and went on to become one of the best basketball players in
Manhattan history.  His 1,329 career points currently rank seventh on the Jaspers' all-time scoring list.  <p>

     Ten years later, Leonard returned to Manhattan as an assistant coach, joining Steve Lappas and a staff
that would engineer one of the more successful rebuilding projects in recent college basketball history.<p>

	"I'm very excited about this great opportunity," Leonard states.  "Manhattan College has always
been a special place for me.  I'm grateful to the administration for putting their faith in me."<p>

	Leonard returns to Manhattan as one of the most highly regarded assistant coaches in the East.  For
the past eight seasons, Leonard has served as Lappas' assistant, the first four seasons at Manhattan, the last
four seasons at Villanova.  Two years ago, Leonard was promoted to "associate" head coach with the
Wildcats.<p>

	"John Leonard is a tireless and relentless individual who is ready for the next step and the new
challenge," remarks Bob Byrnes, Manhattan College's Director of Athletics.  "To me, he is a great
individual who coaches basketball.  I look forward to working with him."<p>

	At Villanova, Leonard was an instrumental part of the resurgence of another basketball program. 
After the Wildcats finished 8-19 in Lappas and Leonard's first year (1992-93), the team followed with three
consecutive 20-win seasons and three consecutive post-season appearances.  In 1993-94, Villanova posted
a 20-12 record en route to the school's first National Invitation Tournament championship.  The next
season, Leonard's first as "associate" head coach, the Wildcats went 25-8 and captured the 1995 Big East
Tournament championship.  In Leonard's final season at Villanova, the Wildcats posted a school-record
26 wins en route to a second-round appearance in the NCAA Tournament.  For his efforts, Leonard was
selected one of the top 10 assistant coaches in 1996 by <u>Eastern Basketball</u> magazine.<p>

	When Leonard joined Lappas' Jasper staff prior to the 1988-89 season, the Manhattan program had
produced a winning record only once over the previous 12 seasons.  However, during Leonard's four years
as an assistant at Manhattan, the Jaspers showed signs of improvement each season, recording seven, 11
and 13 wins respectively the first three seasons.  In Leonard's final season at Manhattan in 1991-92, the
Jaspers won a then-school record 25 games and reached the quarterfinals of the NIT, the school's first post-season bid in 17 years.  Since then, Manhattan has posted a winning record and a post-season berth every
season.<p>

	During his years of service as an assistant for Lappas, Leonard coached NBA draftee and former
Big East Player of the Year, Kerry Kittles, as well as Second Team All-Big East selections Eric Eberz and
Jason Lawson.  A relentless recruiter, Leonard helped Lappas convince Kittles to stay at Villanova after
Lappas was brought in as the new head coach.  In his first stint at Manhattan, Leonard helped develop
Keith Bullock, the 1993 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Player of the Year and the Jaspers' all-time
leading scorer.  <p>

     Leonard first entered the coaching ranks in 1982 as an assistant at Lehman College.  He stayed there
for three seasons and helped guide the Lancers to a City University of New York (CUNY) Championship
in  1983-84.	Leonard's first head coaching job was at Division III SUNY-Maritime, where he took over
a 3-3 team in the middle of the 1985-86 season and guided them to a season-ending 13-8 record.  Overall,
Leonard compiled a three-year head coaching record of 27-40.  <p>

	A 1982 Manhattan graduate with a degree in physical education, Leonard played in 103 games as
a Jasper guard from 1978 to 1982.  A four-year letterwinner, Leonard twice earned the team's Most
Valuable Player Award and served as the Jaspers' team captain in 1981-82.<p>

	Following his senior year, Leonard was drafted in the 10th round of the NBA Draft by the New
York Knicks and played one season for the Albany Patroons of the Continental Basketball Association (for
former Knick Dean Memminger and current Chicago Bulls' coach Phil Jackson).  Leonard is the last Jasper
to be drafted by the NBA.<p>

	A native of Schenectady, NY, Leonard and his wife, Cynthia, have two children: four-year-old
Alyssa Michelle and two-year-old Brianna Nicole.  The happy foursome currently reside in New City, NY.<p>

<title>Manhattan College Athletics:
MICHELE SHARP, Head Coach </title>
<meta name="CreatedBy" content="WP Internet Publisher 6.1">
</head>
<body>
MICHELE SHARP<p>

Manhattan College Head Coach <p>

<p>

In four seasons as head coach of the Lady Jaspers, Michele Sharp has attracted and developed some of the
Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference's best young talent.  Having recruited players from as far west as
California, from as far south as Texas, and from as far north as Canada, Sharp has brought a wealth of
North America's best talent to Manhattan's Riverdale campus.<p>

<p>

Sharp's efforts have proven worthwhile as the Lady Jaspers have had six players (Guylaine Blanchette,
Wanda Camps, Amy Gottschalk, Kirsten Roberts, Nikki Sanders, Gina Somma), selected to the MAAC
All-Rookie Team during her four years.  In fact, two of her seniors from last year's team, Somma and
Tonya Obey, graduated as 1,000-point scorers.  It marked only the second time in College history that two
members of the same graduating class have scored over 1,000 points.  (1992 graduates Cari-Lynn
Piotrowski and Christine Lardon also accomplished that feat.)<p>

<p>

In an effort to increase her team's exposure to playing against top-flight competition, Sharp succeeded in
bringing nationally-ranked Vanderbilt and perennial Atlantic Coast Conference force, Duke, to Draddy
Gymnasium in 1995-96.  The previous year's schedule included games against nationally-ranked Georgia,
Texas Tech and Texas A &amp; M. <p>

<p>

Last year, Sharp's relentless recruiting and scheduling efforts finally led to fruition.  Despite a 3-7 start,
the Lady Jaspers posted a 16-4 record over the next 20 games en route to a final overall record of 19-11,
an 11-3 second-place conference mark, Manhattan's third MAAC Tournament Championship and third
NCAA Tournament appearance (the Lady Jaspers also advanced to the NCAA Tournament in 1987 and
1990).  <p>

<p>

The 19 wins produced by Sharp's squad last season was the second-highest total in College history.  The
1986-87 team went 20-11, while the 1982-83 team also finished 19-11.<p>

<p>

The Lady Jaspers provided many highlights under Sharp's guidance in 1995-96, including a College-record
seven-game winning streak.  Somma (now an assistant coach) was selected MAAC and Metropolitan
Player of the Year, as well as Honorable Mention All-America by the <u>Associated Press</u>.  The Lady Jaspers
also established an all-time scoring record (78.5 ppg), including a College-record 115-point performance.<p>

<p>

Prior to being named head coach at Manhattan in 1992, Sharp served four years as the head coach at
Norwich University in Northfield, Vermont.  While there, her teams compiled a 59-40 record, including
a 22-2 mark in '90-91.<p>

<p>

In addition to her head coaching duties at Norwich, Sharp also served as the assistant director of athletics
for women's sports, as the head softball coach, and as an assistant professor in the health &amp; physical
education and recreation departments.<p>

<p>

A 1984 graduate of West Chester University with a bachelor of science degree in health and physical
education, Sharp returned to school and earned a master's degree in educational administration from
Villanova University in 1990.<p>

<p>

Prior to her years at Norwich, Sharp served as an assistant coach at Cabrini College and Philadelphia
Textile, and as the head coach at Cecilian Academy High School in Philadelphia.  As head coach of the
Philadelphia Shooting Stars, Sharp led her team to the National A.A.U. Tournament Championship in
1988.  Sharp also had a one-year coaching stint at Swarthmore College in 1987-88.<p>

<p>

"I have always tried to instill in my players my philosophy of what it takes to become a winner," Sharp
explains.  "I believe that winning begins with intensity, defense, playing together as a team and working
hard all of the time.  Last season, it took all of those things to help us win a championship."  <p>

<p>

Sharp, 34, is an active member of the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA).  <p>

DAN MECCA<p>

Manhattan College Cross Country/Track &amp; Field Head Coach<p>

 <p>

     Mecca begins his fourth season as head coach of Manhattan's cross country and track &amp; field
programs following seven years as the field events coach for the men's track team.  He is a pioneer
of sorts, as he has been the only head coach of Manhattan' s combined men's &amp; women's program,
which was established prior to the 1993-94 season.  Prior to that, the men's &amp; women's teams had
separate coaching staffs.<p>

     In his first two seasons as cross-country head coach, Mecca's women's squads won Metro Atlantic
Athletic Conference Championships, while producing MAAC individual titles in each of those three
seasons with Kerry Moloughney winning in 1993 and Margaret McParland taking the last two titles
(1994 &amp; 1995). <p>

     A 1976 graduate of Montclair State (NJ) College with degrees in history and physical education,
Mecca began his coaching career at St. Mary's High School in Rutherford, New Jersey, in 1974.  He
began as the throws coach, but eventually took over as the head coach in both cross-country and
track &amp; field in 1977.  <p>

     In 1984, Mecca was named head coach at William Paterson College in Wayne, NJ.  While there,
Mecca produced six All-Americans (three in javelin, and one each in the shot, discus and triple
jump).  Since arriving at Manhattan in 1986, Mecca has never failed to qualify at least one thrower
for the NCAA Championships each year.  <p>

     A native of Passaic, NJ, Mecca currently resides in Clifton, NJ, with his wife Kathleen and his
three children: Christopher, Patrick and Caelyn.<p>

MIKE ALOSCO<p>

Manhattan College Women's Soccer Head Coach<p>

<p>

	<b>MIKE ALOSCO, </b>the only women's head soccer coach the Lady Jaspers have ever had, took over
the position when the Manhattan College women's soccer program made its debut in the fall of 1990. 
While the team began competition on the club level that year, it is now entering its sixth season on
the NCAA Division I varsity level.      Under Alosco's guidance, the Lady Jaspers produced a
winning record in only their third season of varsity competition.  After leading the team to 6-10 and
7-11 records, respectively, in its first two seasons, Alosco's squad produced an 11-5-2 overall record
and a 3-3-1 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference mark in 1993.<p>

	Last year, the Lady Jaspers opened their season with a College-record five-game winning streak and
went on to finish with an overall mark of 9-7-1.  The Lady J's also finished with an impressive 8-2
record against non-conference foes.  Alosco's career record now stands at 38-44-4.<p>

	"I feel we've made tremendous strides in turning this into a competitive, Division I program," Alosco
explains.  "Our goal has always been to raise the program slowly to where we'd be competitive and
a contender in the MAAC.  I believe that we now have the talent and experience to compete year-in
and year-out."<p>

	Before coming to Manhattan, Alosco was head coach at  Archbishop Stepinac High School in White
Plains, New York.  He previously coached junior varsity soccer at Irvington High School in
Irvington, NY.<p>

	Alosco, a 1978 Iona College graduate with a degree in criminal justice, currently resides in

<title>Manhattan College Athletics: John
Carey, Women's Swimming Coach</title>
<meta name="CreatedBy" content="WP Internet Publisher 6.1">

<body>
JOHN CAREY<p>

WOMEN'S SWIMMING COACH<p>

          <p>

      John Carey has been the swimming coach at Manhattan College since 1960, when the squad was
all-male.  Then, in 1987, the team became co-ed for two years.  Since 1989, Carey has been the
coach of an all-women's program that has yet to experience a losing season.   <p>

      Carey, who has the longest tenure of any active Manhattan College coach, actually began
swimming at Manhattan's Alumni Pool when he was a high school student at Manhattan Prep in
1948.  After frequenting a place for over 46 years, it's easy to see how Carey has grown attached to
the place.<p>

      "I've been around the block, but I'm still having fun with the kids and enjoying the competition,"
states Carey, who also teaches several physical education courses at Manhattan.  "Being a college
professor and coach was a common combination when I started.  Now I'm alone in that position at
Manhattan, and in this age of specialization, there aren't many of us left."<p>

      Carey considers himself "fortunate" to have been educated by the Christian Brothers at
Manhattan College, where he received his undergraduate degree in physical education in 1956.  He
later earned a master's degree in educational administration from the University of Notre Dame in
1958.  In 1960, Carey received certification as a director of health and physical education at New
York University.  In 1989, Carey received a citation from the United States Congress and the Mayor
of the City of New York for his "long and outstanding service to young people through the medium
of athletics." <p>

      "I am still a purist and hold a romantic view of intercollegiate athletics," Carey reveals.  "I
believe our athletes compete because they enjoy swimming and want it to be a part of their
educational experience.  I admire that type of commitment, and the swimmers know that the College
appreciates their contribution as well."     <p>

      Carey began his coaching career as a graduate assistant at Notre Dame.  At Manhattan, his teams
have combined for an overall record of 266-196-2.  His women's varsity teams have produced a
seven-year record of 44-21-1, including a 7-4 mark in 1995-96. <p>

       <p>

<pre>     Carey's Career:

     1956- Becomes graduate assistant coach at Notre Dame.
     1958- Serves as assistant coach at Manhattan College.
     1960- Named head men's swim coach at Manhattan.

began his coaching career in 1992 at the St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire.  While a

JUDY McCLEARY<p>

Women's Volleyball Head Coach<p>

<p>

	<b>JUDY McCLEARY</b> enters her fifth season as the Lady Jaspers' head coach.  Last year, she led a
senior-less squad to a 16-17 overall record, including victories in 10 of their final 15 matches.  More
impressively, McCleary's Lady J's led all of NCAA Division I in service aces with an average of 2.93 per
game.<p>

	"Last season was definitely a learning experience for a young team," McCleary comments.  "But we
were able to show signs of competitiveness toward the end of the season.  With everyone coming back and
the addition of some talented recruits, I'm hoping that the momentum from that final stretch last year will
carry us to success in 1996."<p>

 	Under McCleary's leadership, the Manhattan volleyball program has continued to improve (see
accompanying chart).  Despite an inaugural 4-27 season, her teams have earned double-digit wins every year
and have reached two post-season tournaments.<p>

	In 1994, McCleary guided the Lady Jaspers to a best-ever Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference record
(4-3) and finish (third place). It marked the first time that Manhattan had ever qualified for the post-season
MAAC Tournament.  For their efforts, the Lady J's also earned their first-ever berth to the ECAC Volleyball
Championships.<p>

      Prior to her arrival in Riverdale, McCleary was the head coach at Molloy College, where she led the team
to a 15-11 record in 1991.  She also coached for three years at Christ the King Regional High School before
moving on to Queens College as an assistant in 1990.  A four-year varsity volleyball player at Queens,
McCleary graduated with a degree in physical education in 1987.  <p>

     In addition to her current coaching duties at Manhattan, the 31-year-old McCleary also works as a physical
education teacher at Francis Lewis H.S. in Queens.  <p>

     Judy and her husband Michael, an assistant men's basketball coach at Fairfield University, currently reside
in Queens, New York, with their newborn son, James.<p>

   <center>   <h1><b>After Graduation, What?</b></h1></center>
<hr>
 <p> Those of you who are planning to graduate this month
  probably cover a wide range of differences with regard to
  your future plans.  Some of you may be heading to further
  your education through studying law, business, medicine,
  psychology, etc.  Others may already have a job lined up. 
  There are those of you who plan on continuing their
  education after gaining some work experience.  And a large
  amount of you are currently looking for a job or will be,
  perhaps, after moving back home.  In spite of all of the
  range of possibilities, you all have one thing in common--change.  This article talks about possible life changes that
  you might be experiencing in the next few months, the
  effects change can have on a person, and ways to deal with
  the stress caused by change.<p>
       <p>The possible changes that you may experience in the
  near future can be grouped into two dimensions--intensity
  and valence (positive or negative).  Intense change effects
  one s life in more drastic ways and across more situations
  whereas less intense change may have brief consequences and
  perhaps only effect one area of a person s life.  Change
  that is closer to the positive end of the  valence dimension
  elicit more positive thoughts, emotions, and behaviors than
  those that are on the negative end.  For example, starting a
  new job that you want and are happy with can be an intense,
  positive change.  However, being unemployed for a long time
  period after graduation can be an intense, negative change. 
  A less intense, negative experience could be a move in the
  time slot of your favorite TV show to a time when you re
  busy.  A positive change that is less intense could be a new
  hair style.  The former two types of change, positive and
  negative intense experiences, are most relevant to the topic
  of this article--these types of changes are very likely to
  happen within the next few months.<p><p>
       Change in financial state, change to a different line
  of work, change in work hours or conditions, change in
  school, change in living conditions, change in social
  activities, and change in number of family get-togethers are
  some of the life changes that lead to stress (Weiten &
  Lloyd, 1994).  Any of these seem familiar?  Probably more
  than one of them will be occurring soon.  It is important
  that you are aware that these changes may lead to stress
  even though they are very positive in nature.  It is the
  intensity of the change that has a major effect on your
  stress level.  So how does one cope with positive or
  negative intense change?<p><p>
       Positive change.  The most important factor in coping
  with this type of life change has already begun by reading
  this article.  That is, to be aware that 'good stress  is
  still stress.  Enjoy the positive, natural high that you get
  from good stress (i.e. starting a new job), but also be
  aware of the toll it may be taking on your body and your
  mind.  Check in with yourself once in a while.  Take care of
  your self physically (eat healthy, get enough sleep and
  exercise) and emotionally (balance your life with work and
  social activities, do something just for you like taking a
  bath or listening to music).  Also, keep an eye out for
  signs of stress--a change in your temperament, change in
  sleeping and eating habits, etc.  These signs may indicate
  that you need to find more ways to help yourself cope with
  the new changes in your life.  Many of the coping skills
  that one can use are the same for those used when dealing
  with negative stressors.<p><p>
       Negative change.  Being aware of negative stressors is
  not as difficult, but taking care of yourself during these
  times can be more so.  For example, if  a person is
  unemployed for a lengthy time period (i.e. a year), they may
  have a low self-esteem and therefore do not treat themselves
  in the way they deserve.  It is during these times that one
  needs it the most!  <p><p>
       Some other examples of how not to cope with change are
  to give up, strike out at others, blame yourself, and
  defensive coping.  While the first three of these examples
  of harmful coping are self-explanatory, the latter type,
  defensive coping, will be expanded upon.  Examples of
  defensive coping are denial, overcompensation, projection,
  and rationalization (you may have heard these terms before). 
  Defensive coping is largely unconscious and rarely helpful. 
  Going to counseling and reading self-help books are two ways
  of learning new, healthier coping strategies to replace the
  defensive ones.<p><p>
       Additional adaptive ways of coping with change include
  talking with friends, using a sense of humor, problem-focused coping, and emotion-focused coping.  Problem-focused
  coping involves following systematic steps in working toward
  a solution.  For example, first clarify the problem, then
  generate alternative courses of action, then evaluate your
  alternatives and select a course of action, and finally,
  take action while maintaining flexibility.  Emotion-focused
  coping might involve meditation or other relaxation
  exercises.  <p><p>
       If your are interested in learning more about different
  types of coping strategies which might help you during these
  times of change, feel free to call  the College Counseling Center at  862-7394.
  Good luck after  graduation and we hope that all your stress is good stress!<p>

 <center>          <h1>MAKING THE TRANSITION TO A NEW COLLEGE YEAR</h1></center>
<hr>
<body>
  <p>   <h4>The start of a new college year brings with it the opportunity for a
variety of new experiences - meeting new friends, living in a new place,
and gaining the independence that living away from home can offer.  More
often than not, there are stresses that go along with each of these changes,
including homesickness, anxiety, feelings of isolation, and concerns such
as "How am I going to make friends and be recognized as an individual in
this big university?"
</h4>   <p> <b> HOMESICKNESS  </b>Feelings of homesickness and loneliness are
commonly experienced by frosh and transfer students at all colleges and
universities.  These feelings are triggered by separation from familiar
groups of friends, moving away from families and loved ones, and breaking
away from the traditions and cultures that are most comfortable and
familiar.  It is also not uncommon to experience homesickness if students
leave families in which a member is ill, is experiencing financial or
personal difficulties, or does not agree with a student's decision to pursue
a college career.<p><p>
     <b>CONCERNS ABOUT FITTING IN.</b>  For many students, especially
those coming from smaller schools, it was easy to join groups of peers and
"fit in".  In a larger university, this task is made more challenging by the
number of options for students to choose and the number and variety of
students who are also seeking solid peer groups.  Unfortunately, with the
need to fit in often come temptations to drink when one is underage, to use
illegal drugs, and to engage in unprotected sex.  Each of these pressures
places students at risk in terms of health, safety, and life.  Though people
may say that there is always an option of saying "no', this may be a
frightening choice for some people to make in the face of peer pressure.<p><p>
     <b>WHAT TO DO. </b> The most important thing to remember for any
student facing the new challenges of college is that you are not alone. 
There are people to assist you in the residence halls, in advisement offices,
and among our student leaders.  There are also places that you can go, such
as the Counseling Center to discuss your concerns.<p><p>

<H1>CONCENTRATION- SOME RULES 

OF THUMB</H1></center>
<hr>

<H2>1.     Set aside a place for study and study only!</H2>

A.     Find a specific place (or places) that you can use for studying (for example, bottom floor of 

the library, vacant classrooms, bedroom at home, Squires practice rooms, back seat of a "57 

Chevy, etc.)<P>

B.     Make a place specific to studying.  You are trying to build a habit of studying when you are 

in this place.  So, don't use your study space for bull sessions, writing letters, daydreaming, 

etc.<P>

C.     Insure that your study area has the following:<P>

<UL>

<UL>

<UL>

<UL>

<LI>good lighting

<LI>ventilation

<LI>a comfortable chair, but not too comfortable (you don't want to wake up next Tuesday).

<LI>a desk large enough to spread out your materials.

</UL>

</UL>

</UL>

</UL>

D.     Insure that your study area does not have the following:<P>

<UL>

<UL>

<UL>

<UL>

<LI>a good view (for example:  pretty girls or handsome guys walking by)

<LI>a telephone

<LI>a loud stereo

<LI>a 27-inch color TV

<LI>a sociable roommate or friend

<LI>an Amana refrigerator stocked with scrumptious goodies

</UL>

</UL>

</UL>

</UL>



<H2>2.     Divide your work into small, short-range subgoals.</H2>

<P>

A.     Don't set a goal as vague and large as ... "I am going to spend all day Saturday studying!"  

You will only set yourself up for failure and discouragement.<P>

B.     Take the time block that you have scheduled for study and set a reachable study goal.  (for 

example:  finish reading  3 sections of chapter seven in my Psych. text, or complete one math 

problem, or write the rough draft of the introduction to my English paper, etc.)<P>

C.     Set your goal when you sit down to study but before you begin to work.<P>

Set a goal that you can reach.  You may, in fact, do more than your goal but 

set a reasonable goal even if it seems to easy.

<p><hr>

<center><H1>HOW TO READ ESSAYS YOU 

MUST ANALYZE</H1></center>
<hr>
<P>

1.     Take a pencil in your hand.<P>

2.     Read the essay over once, quickly, looking for the main idea, for what the essay is about in general, 

and for what the author seems to be saying.  Don't get bogged down in details.  (If you  come to an 

unfamiliar word, circle it but go on reading).<P>

3.     Check  the meaning of unfamiliar words.  If they seem to be key words, i.e., if the author uses them 

more than once, scribble a brief definition at the bottom of the page or at the end of the essay.<P>

4.     Now re-read more slowly and carefully, this time making a conscious attempt to begin to isolate the 

single most important generalization the author makes: his thesis. Follow his line of thought; try to get 

some sense of structure.  The thesis determines the structure, so the structure, once you begin to sense it, 

can lead you to the thesis.  What is the main point the author is making: Where is it?  Remember, 

examples or "for instances" are not main points.<P>

The thesis is the generalization the author is attempting to prove valid.  Your job, then  is to ask yourself, 

"What is the author trying  to prove"?<P>

Another way of identifying the thesis is to ask yourself, "What is the unifying principle of this essay"? or 

"What idea does everything in this essay talk about"? or "Under what single main statement could all the 

subdivisions fit"?<P>

If the author has stated his thesis fully and clearly and all in one place, your job is easier. The thesis is apt 

to be stated somewhere in the last few paragraphs,  in which case the preceding paragraphs gradually lead 

up to it, or else somewhere right after the introduction, in which case the balance of the essay justifies the 

statement and refers back to it.  Sometimes, however, the author never states the entire thesis in so many 

words; he gives it to you a  piece at a time.  Never mind.  You can put it together later.                       

<P>

5.     When you think you have grasped  the main point, the whole essay goes to prove, underline it and 

write thesis in the margin.  If you find you have several possible theses, don't panic; they all fit together 

somehow.  One or more will probably turn out to be supporting the thesis rather than part of it.        <P>

Now re-read for structure.  You are looking for the main divisions of the essay.  There will (probably) be 

an introduction:  draw a line clear across the page after the introduction and write intr in the margin.  

Now tackle the body of the essay.  You are already pretty sure what the main  idea is.  What are the main 

points the author makes in leading up to his thesis, or in justifying it?<P>

You will find in a longer essay that you are now dealing with groups of paragraphs, all having to do with 

the same subdivision of the main subject.  Draw lines between the main groups and give the groups labels.  

In an essay about how to take an English I final, for instance, you would undoubtedly find a group of 

paragraphs all of which could be labeled "preparation", and another group that could be called "typical 

exam questions".  Under each group there would be sub-groups: under "preparation" there might be 

"reviewing essay", "memorizing terminology", etc.<P>

Occasionally, you will find a paragraph that doesn't seem to accomplish much.  Some paragraphs, for 

instance, are purely illustrative:  the "for example" type of paragraph. Some are just comments or 

igressions by the author .  The "that reminds me" type.  A third very common type is the transitional 

paragraph, which just takes you rather gracefully from one point to another.  When you come across a 

paragraph like one of  these, label it in the margin. <P>

6.     Within each structural subdivision find out what points the author is making.  (In the essay about the 

English 1 final, find out specifically what the author says to do in order to prepare for the exam.)  In other 

words, identify the topic sentence of each important paragraph.  Underline the  sentence.  Sometimes the 

topic sentence is at the beginning of the paragraph and sometimes at the end.  Sometimes the topic is not 

stated but is only implied<P>

7.     You now have the skeleton of the author's argument and should be able to follow his reasoning. If 

you are still having trouble, try scribbling a word or two in the margins and summing up the paragraphs 

as if you were annotating a textbook.  In the essay about the English 1 final, for instance, you might write 

"Mark up textbooks" in the margin after one paragraph, and "but not too much" after the next.  You can 

also underline key transitional or structural words or phases like "but", "however", "moreover", "on the 

other hand", "nevertheless".<P>

8.     Now write out , at the beginning or end of the essay, a thesis statement for the essay.  Remember, the 

thesis was his guiding PURPOSE?  What audience did he have in mind?  What assumptions did he make 

i.e., what did he take for granted his audience already knew, or already believed, or both?  Is his audience 

hostile or friendly?<P>

9.     Finally, and very important, consider two other questions:  WHY did the author write this, and for 

WHOM?  What audience did he have in mind?  What assumptions did he make, i.e., what did he take for 

granted his audience already knew, or already believed, or both?  Is his audience hostile or friendly?<P>

10.     If you know you are  to be examined on the rhetorical techniques the author uses, now is the point 

to go on a deliberate hunt for them after you have thoroughly understood the essay.<P>

<H3><B>Away From Home:  Coping with the Unexpected

</B></H3><HR>

Regardless whether the 'unexpected' or crises at home is a change in

financial support, a natural disaster, an illness or death of a loved one, etc.

you might experience some or all of the following emotional responses:<BR>

<UL>

<LI>panic (what am I going to do?...I can't handle this...etc.)

<LI>shock (I can't believe this is happening; there must be a

mistake..) 

<LI>fear (what if things are worse than I know right now? 

how can I go on without...? etc....)

<LI>denial (maybe it isn't true etc...)

<LI>guilt (I should have been there! Perhaps feeling glad to be

safe, yet, at the same time guilty for not being there. etc....)

<LI>anger (why does this happen to me?...Your family's wishes and 

needs may be in conflict to your own.)

<LI>depression (feeling all alone, isolated, hopeless, desperate, you 

may have difficulties concentrating, sleeping, eating, etc....)</UL>

<BR><P>

Besides these emotional reactions you may also experience physical

symptoms such as:

     <UL>

<LI>stomach aches,

<LI>headaches,

<LI>diarrhea or

<LI>back pain</UL><BR><P>



You may worry not only about your situation at home but also about how

your academic work is affected.   You may need to take some time to address your particular
situation by first talking it over with a trusted friend.  Perhaps you may come to the point of
needing to take some time off from

school or withdrawing from one of  your classes.  It's generally not advisable to make hasty
decisions but to explore a number of possibilities with the assistance of some other people.  There
are some people around campus who may be helpful to you.  It might be good to try to make a
list of specific people now ... before you desparately need to ask for their assistance.<P>
<p>

Since your usual support system and ways of coping with problems may not

be available to you, it might be helpful to know who might be able to help you while being away
from home.  <BR>

For example:<BR>
<ul>
<li>To deal with your emotional responses and physical symptoms, you may want to talk to a
counselor at the <B>Counseling Center</B> (501 Miguel Hall: (718) 862-7394) and / or see
the doctor at the <B>Infirmary</B> (East Hill Rm 813: (718) 862-7217).   You can come to the
Counseling Center anytime between Monday and Friday from 9:00 am to 4:30 PM.  Services
are free and confidential.  You may want to bring a friend along to feel more comfortable. 
<il>If you have to miss some classes or feel you may need to withdraw from a class or two, you
might be helped by seeing your Academic Advisor (whose office is in your Academic Dean's
Office).
</ul>
<br>
Specific preparation is always very helpful.  Please take a moment and list the people in this
country (USA) who might be able to help you:

     ________________________________________________________

</PRE><P><BR>

Being far away from home it might be helpful to think about the issues

involved in dealing with a crises situation ahead of time.  Certainly the hope

is that nothing difficult will happen especially while you are separated from

your family.  Should you need to speak with someone if a crisis situation arises, to whom would
you turn?  It is easy to tell yourself  "I'll handle that when and if I get to it.  Things will take care
of themselves later."  It is very sad when it is too late.<P>

It may be helpful to have  names, phone numbers and

addresses available of family members, friends, and neighbors at home who

might be a resource in the case of an emergency.  Please take a moment

and note these.  If you don't have all the information available, be sure to fill it in soon.

When needing to deal with a crises, it is helpful to think about how you may

have dealt with difficult situations in the past.  It also might be beneficial to

let friends and other significant people in your present life know how they

best can assist you in certain circumstances.   It may be important for others

to know how your customs and ways of handling problems may differ,

especially when your own cultural background is different from those of the

people around you.  For instance, in this country if a parent is sick he or she

may share his / her illness in detail with other family members to feel close

and to get support, while in your country a parent may not inform you about 

his/her illness to protect you.  Generally in this country people tend to relate

information regarding an illness and / or a death in the family very directly,

while in your country the respectful way might be to wait for an appropriate

time which may be several weeks after the fact.  Keeping these differences

in mind , please think about :

<UL>

<LI> Who ideally would relate difficult 'news' to you?

<LI>How  best would information regarding a difficult event be shared

with you?

<LI>Who else should be present? 

<LI>What are some of your ways to deal with stress?</UL>

<P>

Some coping ways that you may not have considered are:

<UL>

<LI>Write down thoughts and feelings;  keep a journal.

<LI>Express your feelings to a friend.

<LI>If you live in a dorm, talk to your resident  assistant.

<LI>Exercise, go for a run, swim etc....

</UL><P>



As mentioned earlier, the hope is that you won't have to confront a crises

situation during your stay at College.  If, however, you have to, this

information may at least be helpful in dealing with the issues at hand.

Also, remember that in every crises lies an opportunity.<BR><P>

<title>Choosing a Major</title>

<h1>Choosing a Major</h1>
</center>
<hr>
<body>
   
  	<p>The first and probably most widely held belief is that
  your college major determines your career.  That is rarely
  the case.  It may be the case if you major in accounting,
  for example, but even then it is not a simple rule that all
  accounting majors become accountants and that all working
  accountants majored in accounting as undergraduates.  So,
  what do hiring agencies want?  Many firms are looking for a
  solid liberal arts background.  Obviously this opens the
  door for a wide selection of majors.<p>
   	<p>Another misheld belief that is becoming less
  popular is that you will be in the same occupation for the
  rest of your life.  Therefore, not only does your major not
  determine your career, but neither does your first
  occupation.  Your career  is composed of all of your jobs
  and occupational activities (including college) and can be
  variable throughout your life.  You have already started
  your career even if you don t know your major!     <p>
   	<p>The main purpose of dispelling these beliefs is to
  try to decrease the amount of anxiety and stress felt by
  many college students that is associated with choosing a
  major.  One reason this process can be so anxiety provoking
  is that many students feel that they are making a decision
  that will determine the rest of their life.  Although one s
  major will probably effect your life, it is not as final as
  it seems.  Other forces in your life may affect the
  direction of your career more than what you choose as your
  major.  <p>
   	<p>Now that you understand that choosing a major may not
  be as threatening or as difficult as you previously thought,
  you may be asking, "How do I make the decision?"  The rest
  of this article will suggest some steps you can take to
  begin the decisional process.<p>
   	<p><b>Step I.</b>  Ask yourself, "What are my values?"  Think
  about your priorities, what conversations you ve had
  recently which have been emotionally provoking,  what
  qualities do your admire in yourself and others.  These
  kinds of thought eliciting topics may help you clarify what
  you value.<p>
   	<p><b>Step II.</b>  Ask yourself, "What are my interests?"  Try
  thinking specifically at first before you move on to more
  general topic areas.  For example, what are you hobbies or
  what have you ever thought of as developing as a hobby? 
  What subjects have you found interesting?  What TV shows do
  you watch that you find more interesting than others (e.g.
  Discovery channel)?  Who are your role models and what do
  they do?  After you have generated a list of specific
  activities, etc., then try grouping them into general topic
  areas.  This will be a good start towards deciding on a
  major.<p>
   	<p><b>Step III. </b> Ask yourself, "What do you want out of
  life?" and, "What do I need to do to get it?"  Do you want
  to be rich?  Do you want to have children and send them to
  college?  Do you want to make a difference in your country
  or your world?  This list will probably be a long one--don t
  be rational in developing it, just brainstorm.  Then, after
  you re done, ask yourself ,"How will you do these things?" 
  The items that seem impossible can be changed such that the
  same need is met but in a more realistic way.  <p>
   	<p><b>Step IV.</b>  Finally, ask yourself, " What do I do well in
  school?"  Good grades are an important part of your
  education and too often students major in something that
  looks good or their parents want them to major in and then
  don t do well in that area.  Try to be realistic with
  yourself.  For example, is it that you can t do well in that
  major or that you don t try hard enough?  If it is the
  latter, then ask yourself why, because it still may be a
  poor choice if you re never going to change that attitude
  (e.g. it bores you).<p>
   	<b><h2>There are many services on campus that can assist you
  in choosing a major.  Make good use of these services during
  your college career. </h2></b>

<center><H1>STUDY DISTRACTIONS 

ANALYSIS</H1></center><hr>

Concentration is the number one problem for many students.  Frequently, the problem is one of finding a 

place to study where there are no external distractions.  External distractions are those that originate 

outside the body.  Telephone calls, visitors, and noises are examples.  Concentration may be difficult when 

there are too many such distractions present.  This checklist will help you analyze distractions in the 

places you study.<P>

<HR>

<H4>List the three places where you usually study in the order you use them 

most:</H4>

<P>

A _______________________ <P>

B _______________________<P>

C _______________________<P>

<P>

<H4>Now record your total of true (T) and false (F) responses to the 

statements below  for EACH of the three places you usually study.</H4>

<OL>

<LI>Other people often interrupt me when I study here.

<LI>Much of what I can see here reminds  me of things that don't have anything to do with studying.

<LI>I can often hear radio or TV when I study here.

<LI>I can often hear the phone ringing when I study here.

<LI>I think I take too many breaks when I study here.

<LI>I seem to be especially bothered by distractions here.

<LI>I usually don't study here at regular times each week.

<LI>My breaks tend to be too long when I study here.

<LI>I tend to start conversations with people when I study here.

<LI>I spend time on the phone here that I should be using for study.

<LI>There are many things here that don't have anything to do with study or school work.

<LI>Temperature conditions here are not very good for studying.

<LI>The chair, table, and lighting arrangements here are not very helpful for studying.

<LI>When I study here I am often distracted by certain individuals.

<LI>I don't enjoy studying here.

</OL>

<H2>The location which has the most "false" responses may be the least 

distracting place to study.  Try to plan your day so that you do as much of your 

work as you can there.</H2>

<b><FONT SIZE=6>Study Skills</b><hr>
<P>
<p>     
  The majority of college success is due to <b>motivation and time management</b>.
  Anyone who tells you that they can get through college without studying, or
  that they make great grades without studying is pulling your leg. Success in
  college takes effort.
<p>
  This means that if you want to do well you must be willing to set aside time
  to study. You may have to sacrifice at times. However, effective time
  management will allow adequate time for school as well as a social life or
  free time to do the activities that you most enjoy.<p>

  We have ideas and tools that will help you manage your time more wisely.<p>
  
  *** <b>MOTIVATION</b> ***  Motivation is the key to success in school. Although we
  can provide you with some helpful hints to enhance motivation, we cannot
  motivate students. You are responsible for your study habits, for seeking
  resources and assistance, and for managing your time. You have to want to do
  well enough to put forth the effort.<p>
  
 <b>Five major problems with students who study are</b>:<p>
  -----------------------------------------------<p>
<ul>
<li>  A. Not studying enough
<li>  B. Wasting time when studying (Have you ever read 2 or 3 pages of material
  only to discover that you cannot remember any of the material that you have
  just read?)
<li>  C. Having trouble getting ready to study ("Before I study my laundry must be
  done, the bathroom must be clean, I need to have all of my errands run, etc.")
<li>  D. Finding a good place for studying.
<li>  E. Using a good learning strategy
</ul>  
  
 <b>The following suggestions will help you avoid these problems</B>:<p>
  ------------------------------------------------------------<p>
<ul>
<li>  1. <b>SET UP A SCHEDULE</b>.</UL><p>
  Allocate more time for the most difficult classes. Make sure that you allot
  time for recreation and social activities. (You need to reward yourself for
  your hard work!) And follow your schedule.<p>
  
<ul>
<li>  2. <b>START STUDYING FOR 10-15 MINUTES AT A TIME AND THEN BUILD UP
TO LONGER PERIODS OF TIME</B></UL>.
  Most study skills programs suggest reading for 10-15 minute increments your
  freshman year, 20 minutes your sophomore year, 25 minutes your junior year, 30
  minutes your senior year and 45 minutes to an hour in graduate school. So,
  work  towards reading for longer periods of time. Just remember to be
  realistic. If you can no longer concentrate or remember what you have read,
  stop. There's no sense in wasting your valuable time.<p>
  
<ul>
<li>  3. <b>TAKE BREAKS</b></ul>.
  Take breaks when studying. The average attention span for one task is
  approximately 20 minutes. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CRAM! Study small portions of
  material, take a break and then study some more. We retain a great deal more
  if we learn in small manageable portions, than when we attempt to learn a
  great deal of information at once. Make these breaks mandatory. Even if you
  are enjoying your reading or studying, take some breaks. You do not want to
  get burned out.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  4. <b>REWARD YOURSELF</b></ul>.
  Reward yourself for studying, learning a difficult concept, or completing a
  project. Go to a movie, spend time with your friends, or do the things you put
  off in order to study. This reinforces your behavior. You are more likely to
  study again and concentrate if you know there is a reward at the end of
  completing a task.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  5. <b>FIND A GOOD LOCATION</b>.</ul><p>
  Where you study can influence your concentration and your study habits as
  well. Make sure you are comfortable, but not too comfortable. Sitting at a
  desk is preferable to lying in bed.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  6. <b>USE THE SAME PLACE FOR STUDYING</b>.</ul><p>
  This will help you associate that particular location with studying and will
  facilitate concentration.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  7. <b>MAKE SURE IT IS A QUIET PLACE</b>.</ul><p>
  Seeking a quiet well-lit study area is equally important. A radio blaring in
  the background, a stereo blaring next door, and the sounds of an interesting
  conversation are but a few of the factors that can disturb a study area.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  8. <b>ELIMINATE THE OBVIOUS DISTRACTIONS</b>.</ul><p>
  Some of the more common distractions are telephone calls or friends and family
  stopping by to chat. Put up the newspapers, magazines, and unfinished
  projects. Even the sight of a textbook from another class can serve as a
  reminder of how far behind you are in another class, causing you to waste time
  worrying. Once you become aware of these simple distractions, you can
  eliminate them and improve your study skills.<p>
  
<ul> 
<il> 9. <b>REMEMBER THAT MEMORY IS "CONTEXT DEPENDENT</b>."</ul><p>
  Studying in a physical situation similar to the one in which you will be
  tested increases your chances to recall information. (This is another reason
  why studying in bed does not work!) Make your studying situation as similar as 
  possible to the testing situation. When possible, go review your materials in
  the classroom.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  10. <b>MEMORY IS ALSO "STATE DEPENDENT."</b></ul><p>
  Studying in an emotional mood similar to the one you experience during tests
  increases your chances to recall studied information. When studying, keep the
  same focus and enhanced attention you have in your tests. Being too relaxed
  during your study time would not match the level of activation you reach
  during your tests. You need to increase your concentration and activation
  levels while studying to increase your chances to recall the studied material
  when tested. The reverse is applicable to tests. If you get too psyched-up or
  tensed-up during your tests, you will not be able to recall your material
  because your test mood state will not match your studying mood. This is the
  reason why it is so important to calm down in a testing situation. The
  Relaxation screen of the Counseling Center Help Screen provides a relaxation
  technique.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  11. <b>INCREASE YOUR READING EFFECTIVENESS</b>.</ul><p>
  The following are two effective methods for reading text material. Choose the
  one that is best for you.<p>
  
  I. <b>SQ4R Method</b>:<p>
  --------------<p>

  * <b>SURVEY</B>: Briefly survey the chapter. Read the authors' headings. Your aim
  here is not to go into detail but to develop a general idea of the structure.
  This will prepare you for what you are going to read and grasp a general
  understanding of the chapter. Read any summary. This will remind you of what
  is important throughout the chapter. This step helps you to get acquainted
  with the chapter.<p>
  
  * <b>QUESTION</b>: Think about the material as you are reading. Ask yourself
  questions about it. These questions will serve to keep you more involved with
  what you are reading. This will keep you focused on the more important
  material without becoming overwhelmed by details. Try formulating questions as
  if you were the professor making up the test. This accomplishes 2 tasks; one,
  it facilitates concentration and two, it helps you prepare for the test.<p>
  
  * <b>READ</b>: Read carefully and try to answer questions you have asked yourself.
  Remember you read a text differently than you read a novel. A novel is read
  passively. Textbook reading requires more concentration and retention. Read
  actively with involvement. This increases your understanding of the material.
  If you become tired or distracted, stop reading. Remember, your job here is
  not to cover a number of pages, but to "dig in". During this step, avoid
  reading aloud to yourself. Instead, read silently as this is much faster.<p>
  
  * <b>WRITE</b>: After you have answered a question, write the  answer down. Sum up
  information in your own words. Restructure the information so that it makes
  the most sense to you.<p>
  
  * <b>RECITE</b>: Recite to yourself what you have read. Recall main headings and
  ideas. Be sure to put ideas in your own words as this will improve your
  ability to retain the material. Answer questions aloud and listen to your
  responses to see if they are complete and correct. If they are not correct,
  re-read the material and answer the question again. This form of rehearsal
  increases the likelihood that you will retain the material.<p>
  
  *<b>REVIEW</b>: Reviewing is the key to figuring out what you know and what you need
  to concentrate on. The best times to review are right after reading while the
  material is still fresh on your mind and again before the test. Try to
  summarize major points in the chapter. And answer questions you posed to
  yourself while reading.<p>
  
  II.<b>PQ4R METHOD</b><p>
  ---------------<p>
  **<b>PREVIEW</b>: Survey the chapter to determine the general topics being
  discussed. Identify the sections to be read as units. Apply the next four
  steps to each section.<p>
  
  ** <b>QUESTIONS</b>: Make up questions about the section. Often, simply transforming
  section headings results in adequate questions.<p>
  
  ** <b>READ</b>: Read the section carefully trying to answer the questions you have
  made up about it.<p>
  
  ** <b>REFLECT</b>: Reflect on the text as you are reading, try to understand it, to
  think of examples, and to relate the material to prior knowledge.<p>
  
  ** <b>RECITE</b>: After finishing a section try to recall the information contained
  in it. Try answering the questions you made up for the section. If you cannot
  recall enough read the portions that you had trouble remembering.<p>
  
  ** <b>REVIEW</b>: After you have finished the chapter go through it mentally
  recalling its main points Try again to answer the, questions you made up.<p>
  
  
<ul>
<il>  12. <b>IMPROVE YOUR MEMORY</b>.</ul><p>
  Some students find that using particular memorization tactics can improve
  their memory. Here are a few of the popular memorization strategies.<p>
 <b>*** Acrostics</b>: Acrostics are phrases or poems in which the first letter of
  each word or line functions as a cue to help you recall the words that you are
  trying to remember. One popular example is the phrase "Every good boy does
  fine".  This acrostic is used to remember the order of musical notes on a
  musical scale.<p>
<b>  *** Acronyms</b>: Acronyms are words formed out of the first letters of a series
  of words you are trying to remember. A popular acronym is "Roy G. Biv" which
  is used to remember the order of colors of the spectrum (Red, Orange, Yellow,
  Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet).<p>
  
<b>  *** Narrative</b>: Some find making up a story with the lists of words throughout
  the narrative aids retention.<p>

<b>  *** Rhymes</b>: Remember the phrase "i before e except after c"? You probably
  remember this well because it is a rhyme. Rhyming can enhance retention as
  well.<p>
  
 <b> *** Imagery</b>: There are two methods of imagery which enhance retention of
  material. One involves LINKING items together visually in your mind. For
  example, if you have a list of groceries such as cereal, milk, toilet paper
  and tangerines, you might try visualizing a dairy cow eating cereal under a
  tangerine tree wrapped in toilet paper. Believe it or not the more bizarre the
  image, the more likely you are to remember it.<p>

  The second method is called the METHOD OF LOCI. This involves taking an
  imaginary walk in your mind through a familiar path along which you associate
  items you are trying to remember. For example, you may take the same grocery
  list and place the items (visually in your imagination) throughout your room.
  The tangerine may be the doorknob as you open the room, the cereal appears on
  the TV, the milk is hanging from the ceiling fan and you may envision a large
  roll of toilet paper in place of the chair at your desk.<p>
  
  
<ul>
<il>  12. <b>BE AWARE OF THE "INTERFERENCE" PHENOMENON</b>.</ul><p>
  When memorizing, also keep in mind that interference can occur. In fact,
  learning new material can interfere or cause you to forget old material. Try
  to memorize material for each class on a different day. This is also why it
  helps to review the night before, or a few hours before, the test. You have
  less chance of other information interfering with the acquisition of the test
  material.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  13. <b>GO TO CLASS</b>.</ul><p>
  Attendance is crucial. Studies have found a positive correlation between class
  attendance and grades. In fact the higher the attendance rate, the higher your
  grades are likely to be. Most professors believe that their lecture material
  is important. If you miss class you miss what is important to the professor;
  hence, what is most likely to end up on the test.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  14. <b>PARTICIPATE IN CLASS</b>.</ul><p>
  In order to learn more in class it helps to become involved by participating
  in class discussions. Asking questions for  clarification and maintaining eye
  contact with your professor can increase your involvement and enhance
  concentration of the class discussion. Use active listening skills. This means
  hearing what your professor is saying and trying to anticipate what he or she
  is going to say next. One other hint: if your course material is difficult be
  sure to read the material prior to class. This may help you understand and
  follow more closely.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  15. <b>IF YOU NEED TO MISS A CLASS...</B></ul><p>
  If you have to miss class, let your professor know. It is very helpful to have
  a reliable classmate from whom you can get the notes. Exchange phone numbers
  so that you can rely on each other for notes in case of an emergency.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  16. <b>TAKE GOOD NOTES</b>.</ul><p>
  Proper note taking skills can facilitate understanding of lecture material.
  Don't be a human tape recorder! Try not to write everything down. Be concise
  and sum up lecture material in your own words whenever possible. Write down
  unfamiliar terms. Review your notes as soon after class as possible. You can
  fill in details that you missed and review the material while it is still
  fresh on your mind.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  17. <b>USE YOUR TEXTBOOK</b>.</ul><p>
  Some professors follow the book closely. In this case it may be helpful to
  take the book to class and highlight important topics or terms and write notes
  in the margins.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  18. <b>TALK TO YOUR PROFESSOR </b>.</ul><p>
  If you are struggling in your class, talk to your professor. He or she may be
  able to assist you or send you in the right direction to get the resources you
  need. However, do not wait until the last minute. Most professors have little
  sympathy for students who become concerned about failing during the last few
  weeks of the semester.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  19.<b> FORM OR JOIN A STUDY GROUP</B>.</ul><p>
  Get study groups together. Chose those students who seem interested in the
  class. Make sure everyone is familiar with the material before meeting as you
  do not want to spend time re-teaching material to someone who has not learned
  the material. It helps if these study groups serve to review material already
  learned or to clarify problem areas. Make sure everyone is motivated. Beware!
  Sometimes groups can become chatting sessions, just make sure you all remember
  your purpose: to learn class material. After the test, reward yourselves with
  pizza and conversation.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  20.<b> START AT THE BEGINNING</b>.</ul><p>
  Start studying from the first day. Be ahead in the reading material.<p>
  
<ul>
<il>  21. <b>KEEP UP IN AN ORGANIZED FASHION</b>.</ul><p>
  Some classes require more work or effort than others. For  example, math and
  foreign language are subjects which require daily work. Because these classes
  require knowledge of basic material which then builds, if you don't keep up
  you'll be lost.<p>
<p>  
  
  ****** To sum up, effective study is an active process. It does not mean
  passively reading some material. It does not mean endless hours spent in a
  frustrated search for understanding. Rather, effective study involves actively
  "digging in" and mastering course material. Studying involves steady progress.
  It requires efficient use of your study time and perhaps a reduction in time
  spent studying. Effective studying can produce a sense of competence, pleasure
  and mastery.<p>
  
  
  In the event that other factors are affecting your studying, the Counseling
  Center offers individual counseling to S.H.S.U students. We know that family
  issues, roommate concerns, alcohol and substance abuse problems can greatly
  affect your success in college. Do not hesitate to come in to the counseling
  center if personal issues are affecting your studies.

<title>Test Anxiety</title>
<H1>Welcome<BR>

<center><H1>Test Anxiety</H1></center>
<hr>  
<body> 
  
  <p>Most of us experience some level of uneasiness or tension before
  and/or during a test. A small amount of tension or stress is
  expected. Sometimes that nervousness works in our favor, motivating
  us. However, in larger amounts that tension can interfere or even
  impair our capacity to think, plan, and perform on tests. The
  following information will help you to cope and overcome test
  anxiety.</p>
   
  <p>The first question I ask students consulting for test anxiety is
  whether their anxiety is a result of lack of preparation, or a
  consequence of overreacting/panicking during testing.
  Anxiety produced by inadequate preparation is easy to understand, and
  can be eliminated with appropriate studying. </p>
  
  <p>If you are adequately prepared but still overreact or panic, you are
  suffering from test anxiety. In this screen, we will review the steps
  that will help you to overcome its effects.</p>

  <p>These steps are: 
<br>
<ol>
<li> Before the test
<li>Thinking straight about your  test
 <li>Taking care of your basic needs
<li> Getting ready
<li> Facing the test 
<li> During the test
<li>After the test
  </ol>

  <h3> <b>BEFORE THE TEST.</b></h3>
 <br> 
  <i>*PREPARATION.</i>
  <p>Preparation is a key element for reducing anxiety. The higher your
  level of preparation, the lower your level of anxiety.
  Moreover, getting ready for your test, increases your self-
  confidence.</p>
  <br>
 <i> * NO CRAMMING.</i>
  <p>Avoid cramming for a test. This is an ineffective way of studying. If
  you cram the night before you might be able to pass some parts of
  your test, but you will remember nothing afterwards (and in most
  cases that information will be included in your final.) Trying to
  learn weeks worth of material the day before the test does not work
  either. Usually this is not a good time to learn much because you
  feel anxious. You feel pressured, and probably guilty, for studying
  at the last minute, therefore you cannot concentrate very well.
  Please do not tell me that when you study ahead of time you do worse
  than when you study the day before. Years of research on how to study
  are against you! If this happens to you it is because you are either,
  studying in advance without learning, or you have developed the
  negative habit of learning under pressure. Both are ineffective ways
  of learning, and both can easily create  anxiety.</p>
  <br>
  <i>* REVIEW ALL THE INFORMATION.</i>
  <p>Study from your book, notebook, and any other materials used class.
  Combine their information. Work on mastering the main, as well as
  especific concepts presented in your class.</p>
  <br>
  <i>* ASK YOURSELF QUESTIONS.</i>
  <p>This method is well explained in the Study Skills screen of the
  Counseling Center program. When studying, transform the headings into
  questions, and answer them using the different sources of information
  used in class. Ask yourself what kind of questions your instructor
  may ask you. Try to answer them too. Moreover, ask your instructor
  for samples of previous tests, and practice with them.</p>
  <br>
 <i> * USE FLASH CARDS.</i>
  <p>Yes, you can use this type of help to organize your study. This kind
  of help will allow you to allocate your time in an effective way. You
  will be able to determine what you already know, and spend more time
  reviewing those materials that need more studying.</P>
    <br>
  <h3><b>THINKING STRAIGHT ABOUT YOUR TEST</b></h3>
  <br>
  <i>* CHANGE THE WAY YOU THINK ABOUT STUDYING.</i><br>
  <p>Changing the way you think about studying can improve your
  performance. Studying -and grades- are not a measure of your self-
  worth. You may be investing too much of your personal definition on
  studying and grades. This kind of thinking can lead you to see
  studying as an insurmountable task. These kinds of beliefs are very
  effective in creating anxiety and stress. And these reactions can
  reduce, in turn, your capacity to concentrate, and learn. Confirming
  that studying is an impossible task for you! (Does the concept
  "vicious circle" ring a bell?)</p>
  <br>
  <i>* PUT YOUR TEST IN PERSPECTIVE.</i>
  <p>A test is only a test. Keep in mind that there will be others. This
  will help you remove part of the emotional charge we put on our
  tests, reducing your stress, and allowing you to study better.</p>
  <br>
  <i>* ELIMINATE NEGATIVE SELF-TALK.</i>
  <p>Avoid thinking of yourself in a negative way. Avoid getting entangled
  in negative aspects related with studying. Focus on what needs to be
  done and do it. You will be surprised how much time students spend
  doing everything else but studying. And negative thoughts are an
  example of "everything else."</p>
  <br>
 <i> * INVEST TIME IN PLANNING.</i>
  <p>Plan ways to improve your studying. Evaluate your plan  accordingly
  with your performance. Plan ways to keep what you did right; and plan
  ways to improve what can be improved.</p>
  <br>
  <i>*PUT YOUR GRADE IN PERSPECTIVE.</i>
<br>
  <p>Your grade is not necessarily a reflection of your preparation. Most
  of my students believe that the success of a test anxiety reduction
  program should be measured by the grades obtained. The reality is
  that your grades will not improve immediately. It will take time and
  more than one test to see that kind of results. Therefore, your
  performance should be evaluated against what you did. If you had a
  good plan, and you stick to it, that is what really counts; even if
  the grade was not as high as you would have liked it to be. You might
  have improved significantly, but the test may have been more
  difficult than expected. The reverse is also possible, you may have
  failed your plan and still get a good grade. (E.G., the test included
  those questions you knew all about.) Again, you should use more than
  your actual grade to evaluate your performance.</P>
  <br>
 <i> * DEVELOP REASONABLE EXPECTATIONS.</i>
<br>
  <p>Take your tests one at a time. Set realistic goals. Show as much as
  you know as you can. Hope for a result that matches the stage of
  development you have reached at this point. Unrealistic expectations
  will only lead to frustration, which, in turn, will become a good
  excuse to give up.</p>
  <br>
  
  <b><h3>TAKING CARE OF YOUR BASIC NEEDS.</h3></b>
  <br>
  <i>* KEEP IN MIND THAT YOU ARE MORE THAN A TEST TAKER.</i>
<br>
  <p>Students concerned about tests usually neglect other aspects of
  themselves. Do not forget that taking a test is only one of the
  important things in your life. You should also care for your
  biological, emotional, psychological, and social needs.</p>
  <br>
 <i> * "MENS SANA IN CORPORE SANA."</i>
<br>
  <p>"Healthy mind in healthy body." Exercise. Stay in good shape. Eat
  consciously. Keep up with your recreational and social activities.
  All contribute to your well-being and capacity to buffer test
  anxiety.<p>
  <br>
  <i>* REMEMBER THAT "FOOD FOR THOUGHT" IS ONLY A LITERARY EXPRESSION.</i>
<br>
  <p>More often than not you will see students abusing food (e.g.,
  cookies) or beverages (e.g., coffee.) It looks as if they believe
  that this will help them in studying or taking tests. In fact, the
  result is often the opposite. A stomach ache will keep you from
  concentrating. Caffeine may give you the jitters. You may end up
  feeling light-headed.<p>
  <br>
  <i>* DOSIFY YOUR STUDY.</i>
<br>
 <p>  Study for short periods of time (see the Study Skills screen for
  more information.) Follow a moderate pace. Do not forget that your
  mind can take more of the same forever. Take breaks.<p>
  <br>
 <i> * REST THE NIGHT BEFORE THE TEST.</i>
<br>
 <p> Distract your mind with activities other than studying. Rest. Get
  plenty of sleep. A refreshed mind will allow you to do your best. An
  overly tired mind will not function at its best. (This is the reason
  why studying overnight usually does not pay off).<p>
<br>  
<i>  * DO NOT ABUSE YOURSELF.</i>
<br>
  <p>Once you feel you know what you need to know, quit studying, and do
  something relaxing. The only reason why you keep studying way after
  you are reasonably prepared is your lack of confidence. Be patient.
  Learning when to stop takes time. Accomplishing it boosts your sense
  of self-confidence and self-esteem.<p>
<br>
  
  
  <b><h3>GETTING READY.</h3></b>
 <br>
  <i>* FACE THE DAY OF THE TEST WITH PRIDE.</i>
<br>
  <p>Take responsibility for your actions. If you studied enough, be proud
  of yourself. What really matters at this point is not the potential
  grade, but the fact that you did what you were supposed to do. This
  is an accomplishment in itself!<p><br>
  
<i>  * EAT A SENSIBLE BREAKFAST.</i><br>
  <p>Do not abuse food before the test. Some students use food as a way to
  reduce anxiety. Indulging in food on the day of the test may backfire
  on you, impairing your performance by making you feel physically
  uncomfortable (or sick) during the test.<p><br>
  <i>  * RELAX DURING THE HOUR BEFORE THE TEST.
 </i> <br><p>Do something relaxing the hour before the test. It is to late to try
  to learn what you did not learn before. Last minute cramming will
  cloud what you have learned before. It will also undermine your
  confidence.<p><br>
  
  <i>* ARRIVE AT THE CLASSROOM EARLY, BUT DO NOT STAY THERE.</i>
 <p> Arrive at the classroom early if you want to select a good seat
  (e.g., a seat away from distractions.) Then, go out of the room and
  use the remaining time to walk and relax.<p><br>
  
  <i>* AVOID "STRESS-CARRIERS."</i>
<br><p>  Politely avoid classmates who produce anxiety and affect your
  disposition to the test. Do not let them scare, stress, or upset you.<p><br>
  
<i>  * BRING A "STRESS-SAVER" WITH YOU.</i><br>
  <p>Bring a magazine or newspaper to read if waiting for the test
  stresses you.<p><br>
   
  *<i> USE PHYSICAL RELAXATION.</i><br><p>
  Learn and use tensing and relaxing techniques to fight off the
  tension and anxiety.<p><br>
  
<h3><b> FACING THE TEST.</b></h3>
 <br>
  <i>* CHECK YOUR INTERNAL STATE.</i>
  <p>How are you? How is your anxiety level? If it is high or moderately
  high, take some time to relax. Even though it takes time away from
  your test, relaxing increases your chances to do a more efficient
  job, saving you time instead.<p><br>
  
<i>  * COACH YOURSELF.</i><br>
  <p>Sometimes students get anxious after finding out that do not know the
  answer to the first or second question. Tell yourself that you are
  going to do your best. Tell yourself that you are going to answer the
  questions you know first, then the questions you are not really sure
  about, and, finally, the questions you do not know. Follow your plan!<p><br>
  
  <i>* REVIEW YOUR TEST.</i><br>
  <p>Before you begin answering the questions, review the entire test.
  Read the instructions carefully; twice if necessary.
  Stick to your plan, begin working on the easiest questions first.<p>
  <br>
  
<b> <h3>DURING THE TEST.</h3></b>
 <br>
  <i>* OUTLINE ANSWERS ON ESSAY QUESTIONS.</i>
  <br><p>Develop a short outline of your answers for essay questions. This
  will help you to organize your answer, avoid irritating repetitions,
  and skip circular arguments.<p><br>
  
  <i>* GIVE SHORT ANSWERS FOR SHORT-ANSWER QUESTIONS.</i><br>
  <p>Answer short and to the point. Use specific terms and ideas. If you
  cannot remember a technical term, describe it in your own words.<p><br>
  
<i>  * READ OPTIONS CAREFULLY.</i>
  <br><p>Read all the options of multiple choice questions. Eliminate the most
  obvious. Use qualifying words such as "always," or "only," to
  eliminate others. If unsure, rely on your first hunch, then mark the
  question with an asterisk or a star and move on. If you have time at
  the end, go back and review your marked questions.<p><br>
  
 <i> * WEAR YOUR WATCH.</i>
  <br><p>Do not rush through the test. Keep track of the time. Pace yourself.
  If you are running out of time, concentrate on those questions which
  you can answer. Make sure you match the number of the question with
  the number of your answer on the Scantron.<p><br>
   
  <i>* DO NOT GET STUCK.</i><br>
  <p>Do not get stuck on one question. Skip it and solve the next one. Go
  back to the question after you finish answering those you can.
  Remember that you do not get points for trying.<p><br>
    
 <i> * RELAX YOUR TENSION</i><br><p>
  If your tension is hampering your capacity to do your best, tense and
  relax your body as needed during the test. This exercise releases
  your tension. Breathing deeply, in and out, also helps to release
  anxiety. For more information on relaxation, see the Relaxation,
  Breathing Techniques, and Biofeedback screens in this program.<p><br>
  <i>
  * ASK QUESTIONS.</i><br><p>
  Ask for more information if you are not sure about a question in your
  test. Asking your instructor a question can also help to distract you
  and reduce your anxiety.<p><br>
 <i> 
  * TALK TO YOURSELF.</i><p><br>
  If your anxiety continues, tell yourself phrases like "I can be
  anxious later, now I am going to continue my test." Use any type of
  internal dialogue (nobody else need to hear you) that can help you do
  better in your test.<br><p>
  
  <i>* IF WORSE COME TO WORSE, USE ANY OTHER LEGAL TRICK TO DISTRACT
  YOURSELF.</i><br><p>
  If anxiety continues, use any acceptable way to distract yourself
  from it. Request permission to go to the bathroom or get a drink,
  etc. If nothing else works, go sharpen your pencil!<p><br>
  
  <b>
   <h3>AFTER THE TEST.</h3></b>
  <br>
  <i>* REWARD YOURSELF.</i><br><p>
  Whether you did well or not, reward yourself for taking, and
  surviving your test! You deserve it.<p><br>
  <i>
  * LATER ON.</i>
  <br><p>Evaluate your study plan. Were you prepared for it? Were you able to
  control your anxiety and relax. Find out what you did right and
  repeat it the next time. Find out what needs more work. Do not dwell
  on your mistakes. You are supposed to make some. Use them as a guide
  for what needs to be improved, and work on improving them.<p><br>
  
  <i>* THEN...</i>
  <p>Develop an improved plan and begin studying for your next test!<p>

      <p> If you are at Manhattan(or at any other college) you know that finally,
  after all your hard work and sacrifice the day of the test will inevitably
  arrive. The following test taking strategies may improve your test taking
  ability:<p>
  
  <b>1. MAKE EFFICIENT USE OF YOUR TIME.</b>

  <ul>
<li>
 Make sure you know exactly how much time your professor has allocated for
  the test. Check periodically to see if you are keeping up. For example, when
  half of your time is up make sure you are half way through your test.
 <li>Do not waste time on difficult problems. If one of the questions is
  confusing or you do not know the answer, circle it or put a star by it and
  come back to it later.
  <li>Review your answers if you have time. When you review them more slowly you
  may find that there is a better answer. Do not hesitate to change your answers
  (see #4, below). 
  </ul>
<br>
  <b>2. TRY NOT TO READ INTO THE TEST.</b>

  <ul>
<li>
Sometimes people read into a question, think that some items are trick
  questions, or too easy. Instead of it being too easy, it may be that you
  studied effectively and remember the material well.
  </ul>
<br>
  <b>3. FOR MULTIPLE CHOICE TESTS:</b>

 <ul>
<li>
  Anticipate the answer before you look at them.
 <li> Read over all of your options.
  <li>Eliminate highly implausible answers.
  <li> Some examiners give away answers in their tests. By answering one
       question, you may be able to deduce the answer to another.
  <li>If you must guess, keep in mind the following tips for multiple choice
       tests:</ul>
  <ol>
<li>
 Sometimes lengthy or highly specific answers will be the correct answer.
  <li>Be aware of words like "always", "never", "only", "must", and "completely".
  These are usually the wrong answers since there are many exceptions to rules.
  These are extreme words which  are more than likely to be the wrong choice.
  </ol>
<br>
  <b>4. TO CHANGE OR NOT TO CHANGE YOUR ANSWER ON MULTIPLE CHOICE TESTS.</b>
  
  <ul>
<li>
The popular belief is that "your first hunch is your best hunch." Several of
  our students feel that they should not go back and change their answers. This
  popular belief is wrong. Research has shown that changes from a wrong answer
  to a right answer outnumber changes that go from a right answer to a wrong
  answer by a margin of approximately 3 to 1.  Research has also shown that
  changing answers improve students scores!</ul>

<center><h1>The Risks of Caffeine</h1></center>
<hr>
     <p>It's 8 a.m.  You just can't seem to wake up enough to make it through second period
class.  You just aren't yourself until your first cup of coffee.<p><p>
     It's 11 p.m.  You have two finals tomorrow and at least two more hours of studying
before you can turn in.  But you're so sleepy.  Time for a full strength sugared and caffeinated
soda, right?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  If you're a moderate user of caffeinated products, such as tea,
coffee, colas and chocolates, recent studies show it probably won't hurt you in moderation. 
However, studies show some of our ideas about caffeine and its health risks are unfounded.<p><p>
     We were told caffeine was addictive.  Then we were told it was okay.  Then we were told
it was safe.  Then we were told it was unsafe.  What's the truth?  The International Food
Information Council (IFIC) says caffeine isn't addictive in the way that dependency drugs or
alcohol can be.  You can have "withdrawal" symptoms, including headaches and irritability if your
"daily dose" is quickly lessened.  Symptoms can be reduced by slow reduction over a few days.<p><p>
     We've also heard that there are health risks, such as increased cancer risk, high blood
pressure and birth defects.  IFIC says there is no relationship between any of these health
problems and caffeine use.  However, North Florida Regional's Wellness Center says there are
possible links with fibrocystic lumps and some birth defects.  Some researchers say there is a link
between caffeine intake and reduced fertility.  Don't count on it as birth control, but if you're
having trouble getting pregnant-or are pregnant-you may want to refrain form using caffeine.<p><p>
     The American Cancer Society reports there is "no indication that caffeine is a risk factor in
human cancer."  The Archives of Internal Medicine say a very few sensitive individuals may
experience a short rise in blood pressure, similar to climbing a flight of stairs.  IFIC says studies
caffeine can "quicken reaction and prolong vigilance of various demanding tasks."  <p><p>
     Caffeine is a mild stimulant drug.  As with any drug, you can take too much and have
scary side effects, so be careful popping Vivarin or No-Doz during finals week.  Just one of these
caffeine products can be equal to 6 or more cups of coffee.  For some, a cup of coffee is enough
to provide a "little lift."  Remember to balance caffeine with food so as to prevent health
complications.  This will prevent a caffeine induced low blood sugar reaction that can cause
shaking and the jitters.  If you do experience shaking and the jitters, however, drink orange juice
followed by a protein snack (cheese or peanut butter).  This will help to normalize the blood sugar
level and lessen the severity of the reaction.<p><p>
     But, like any other stimulant, keep it to a reasonable level.  What's reasonable?  Health
Science Education professor William Chen says "An average amount of 200 mg a day is a safe
dosage.  This is equal to about 2 or three cups of coffee."  You should be aware of your caffeine
intake for other health reasons.  Many people report poor, restless and unrefreshing sleep when
using caffeinated products.  As it takes caffeine several hours to leave your bloodstream, avoid
caffeine for a few hours before bedtime.  "Students should realize that caffeine is a drug, and
should be used moderately," Chen said.  So when your next late-night study session or early-morning class threatens premature zzz's, enjoy your coffee or soda-in moderation. . . and don't
forget to eat food also!<p><p>
     If you have any questions about your own particular situation and the use of caffeine, you
may want to speak with a health care professional.  The nurses and doctors in the Manhattan
College Health Services Office (813 East Hill: 718-862-7217) may be of assistance to you.<p>

<p><hr>                           <h1>How to Quit Smoking</h1>

<body>
     <p>Most people are aware of the health risks and negative effects
of

smoking:  heart disease, lung cancer, stroke, emphysema, chronic
bronchitis,

high blood pressure, stained teeth, smoker's breath, dulled sense
of taste, etc..  However, people continue to smoke (and continue to
start the habit), even though there is indisputable evidence that
it is one of the worst things you can do for your body.<p><p>
     Basically, smokers continue to damage their bodies because it
is difficult to quit.  For this reason, nonsmokers should read this
article in order to understand the importance of AVOIDING EVER
GETTING STARTED.  The nicotine in cigarettes is a highly addictive
substance that activates the central nervous system and, like opium
and marijuana, can provide a mood altering experience.  Therefore,
people who smoke may do so because they claim to feel better and
more full of energy after a cigarette.  Also, people smoke to
relieve pressure, to appear "cool" or "sophisticated", and simply
because the activity, as well as the nicotine, is habit forming. 
In reality, smoking involves a combination of behaviors, thoughts,
and physiological responses that differ in intensity from
individual to individual.<p><p>
     It is obvious that any fleeting "benefits" pale in comparison
to the health risks.  Quitting smoking may be difficult, but it is
worth the effort.  Over 34 million people have successfully stopped
smoking for better health.  In fact, when you quit smoking your
body will benefit immediately, and after 
awhile, your risk for heart attack and lung problems will reduce to
that of  a nonsmoker.  Quitting also means more spending money;
feelings of self-control, accomplishment, and self-esteem; and more
time spent on hobbies, work, and socializing.  With more and more
smoking laws, it is also becoming a major inconvenience to find an
area where smoking is allowed. So lets get started on the road to
better health!  If you smoke, the following is a general
description of hints and strategies to kick the habit, or at least
cut down.<p><p>
     First you should really make up your mind to quit and begin to identify exactly why, when, and how much you smoke.  Start a
smoking diary and record the place, time, and feelings connected to
every cigarette you smoke.  Start to cut out the "automatic" or
unconscious smoking.  One way to do this is to wrap your cigarette
pack with a piece of paper and a rubber-band, or put the cigarettes
away from where you talk on the phone or work, in these ways
smoking becomes more of an effort and you may skip a few cigarettes
you normally would have had.<p><p>
     Write a "quitting contract" for yourself that specifies the
day and time you will quit, or begin cutting down.  Sign it and
have someone witness it.  It is also a good idea to quit with a
partner, so you can support and assist each other in your goal. 
Develop a list of reasons you want to quit, and when you crave a
cigarette you can focus on the reasons you listed.<p><p>
     As you approach the quit date, begin to remove ashtrays and
lighters from your living area, frequent places where smoking is
not allowed, change to a brand of cigarettes that you do not like,
smoke only half of each cigarette you light, and do anything else
you need to help you achieve your goal.  Snacking, sleeping, or
watching more TV are activities that are much less damaging than
smoking.  You should give yourself treats or rewards during this
period.<p><p>
     When you have stopped smoking there are many tips for dealing
with cravings and avoiding a relapse.  Eat low calorie snacks like
carrot sticks and sugar-free candies, chew gum, call someone on the
phone, take a break from your job or classwork, go to a movie,
exercise or take a walk, take a few deep breaths, brush your teeth,
drink a lot of water (this helps clean your system of nicotine).<p><p>

     Whatever method you choose, the important factor is that you
choose to quit.  Different people have found success with a variety
of different methods.  Whether you quit "cold turkey", cut down,
use nicotine gum or the patch, is up to you to decide.  You may
want to speak with your doctor regarding the method you use because
some products require a prescription.  The sooner you decide to
quit, the better for your health and those around you.<p>

<h1>Quitting Smoking</h1>
<hr>
<p>You've absorbed the backlash from friends and family.  You've heard all the latest reports
about smoking.  Now, finally, you want to quit!  Good for you!  Maybe you've tried stopping
before.  You know it's not very easy, is it?<p><p>
     "I've tried to quit and I just couldn't do it," Patricia Atienza admitted.  "When I tried
stopping cold turkey, I ended up craving cigarettes more, and I smoked more the next day, it
takes a lot of self-discipline," she said.  Graduate student Zeshan Khan, an 8  year smoker,
agrees.  "You have to decide for yourself that you want to quit.  Otherwise, it's not going to
work, regardless of which method you use," he said.  Khan has quit before, and for 5 smokeless
months he felt "so much better, both physically and mentally."  <p><p>
     The "rush" reported by some smokers is often a sense of relief when the nicotine craving
is satisfied.  In other words, for many smokers, smoking a cigarette simply keeps the person from
feeling bad.  Stopping is difficult because you're addicted to the nicotine and/ or the ritual itself. 
If all your friends are smokers, kicking the habit will be that much more difficult because of the
additional social component.<p><p>
     Quitting smoking, like changing your weight, requires a dedicated and personalized plan
of attack.  Leaping in unprepared could leave you feeling defeated, discouraged and with a
bruised self-esteem.  The Health Care Professionals at the College Infirmary can help you with
developing a plan to stop smoking.  We offer consultation and counseling, informational
brochures and pamphlets, and medical referrals to obtain nicotine gum, patches, or other
treatments.  Stop by the College's Health Services Office in East Hill Room 813 to investigate
your options or call (718) 862-7217 for more information.<p>

<center><h1>HOW CAN I MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE
                      TO DRINK OR NOT DRINK?</h1></center>
<hr>
<p>Alcohol is used in our society for a host of reasons, sometimes
inappropriately.  People tend to use alcohol to calm down, unwind,
relax, increase self-esteem, lower inhibitions, or even to
indirectly deal with a problem.  In fact, alcohol is a depressant
that affects the central nervous system- specifically the way we
think, act, and feel.  When making decisions about drinking, it is
necessary to know what alcohol does to you physically and
psychologically.<p><p>

Alcohol consumption can affect your body directly and indirectly. 
Alcohol is absorbed relatively quickly into the bloodstream through
the stomach and small intestine.  After circulating throughout the
entire body, the alcohol is then slowly broken down, mostly by the
liver.  Generally speaking, it takes approximately one hour for
your body to break down the alcohol of one standard drink (12 oz.
beer, 5 oz. wine, or 1.5oz. of hard liquor).  Consumption of
alcohol over an extended period of time can lead to loss of
appetite, heart, liver, and central nervous system damage, skin
problems, vitamin deficiencies, and sexual impotence in men.  Women
that are pregnant not only run the risk of harming themselves, but
also can harm the developing baby.<p><p>

The short term effects of excessive alcohol use can also lead to
many problems.  While intoxicated your judgement, coordination and
vision are impaired; therefore, you tend to take more risks and
make poorer decisions.  If you drink too much alcohol in a short
amount of time, the anesthetic effects of the alcohol can affect
your deeper levels of brain functioning, resulting in a coma, or
even death.  Drinking and driving is a notoriously bad combination,
but it still occurs even with stricter enforcement and widespread
knowledge about the dangers involved.  Why???  The effects of the
alcohol on judgement and coordination impair the potential drivers
decision making and the driver's reaction time while on the road. 
Some other high risk activities associated with alcohol use
include:  working around machinery, boating, hunting, and even
climbing stairs.  Otherwise normal activities can become
potentially dangerous when carried out under the influence of
alcohol.<p><p>

As alcohol use affects the body, it also affects behavior. 
Sometimes people who are drunk say and do things that they later
regret.  Alcohol blocks the messages traveling to your brain and
alters your perceptions and emotions.  If you drink while you are
angry and upset, chances are that you will become even more angry
and upset.  A common reason that people drink is to make
socialization easier by lowering inhibitions.  This can lead to
even more questions and problems.  "Does she/he like me, or are
they just acting out of drunkenness?"  "I don't know what I was
thinking last night, I am not attracted to that person at all." 
"She/he is fine when not drunk, but after a few drinks, it's like
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."  These examples display how a source of
relief can become a source of stress.<p><p>

<h2>Some myths and facts associated with alcohol are:
</h2>
<ul>

<li><b>MYTH: </b> Getting drunk is funny.
<li><b>FACT:  </b>Getting drunk is analogous to getting sick, and you lose    control of your mind and body.
<p><br>
<li><b>MYTH:  </b>Drinking will make you more attractive.
<li><b>FACT:  </b>Drinking only makes you feel more attractive because of the      short-term effects of lowered inhibitions, increased self-       esteem and altered perceptions.
<p><br>
<li><b>MYTH: </b> Drinking increases sexual enjoyment, potential, and ability.
<li><b>FACT: </b> The more a person drinks, the less sexually capable he or        she is.
<p><br>
<li><b>MYTH: </b> A cup of coffee and a cold shower are all that is needed to      sober up.
<li><b>FACT:</b>  There is nothing that can be done to increase the speed of       the natural sobering process.
</ul><br><p><p>
Another piece of information that is important to keep in mind is
that it is against the law to drink alcohol if you are under 21. 
If you are found to be using alcohol if you are underage or giving
alcohol to someone who is underage, this is a serious violation
which can potentially damage your career at the College and leave
you with a legal record.<p><p>

Remember that the decision to drink or not drink is yours and yours
alone.  Someone who tries to pressure you into drinking probably is
not looking out for your best interests.  It is also likely that
there will not be very many people who will remain by your side if
alcohol should hurt you or get you into trouble in some way.  Armed
with factual knowledge, you can make a more informed decision and
can take charge of your own future.<p>

  <center><h1>COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE INCREASING PRESSURES TO USE ALCOHOL</h1></center>
  <hr>  
<p> In recent years, there has been a great deal of attention on
the impact of binge drinking on college students.  A study
highlighted in the June 8, 1994 issue of the New York Times
suggests that, while binge drinking has remained at a high level in
men during the past twenty years, binge drinking in women has
almost tripled and is currently rivaling the rates of alcohol use
in men.  The article reports that a national survey conducted at
the Columbia University Center for Addictions and Substance Abuse
indicates that 35% of college women surveyed reported that they
drink just to get drunk, while 10% of women in a 1977 survey
reported this reason for using alcohol.  A study of University at
Albany students conducted in 1990 suggests that, while men are
entering the campus environment with established alcohol use
patterns, women in their freshman year are particularly vulnerable
to external influences which might contribute to increases in
alcohol use.<p><p>
     The researchers at Columbia University list several possible
reasons for this steady alcohol use in men and the change in
alcohol use among women.  First, pressures to excel and to "fit in"
may cause men and women to use alcohol in college.  Second, the
manner in which alcohol advertising portrays groups such as women
who drink as sexy and attractive to men, and the way in which the
alcohol industry targets college students as consumers, may play a
role.<p><p>
     Regardless of the reasons that we are finding increases in
alcohol use by college students, the damaging effects of alcohol to
both women and men are evident.  Research indicates that between
50-60% of reported rapes involve alcohol use by the perpetrator,
the victim, or both.  In addition, a sizeable number of college
students who contract herpes or other sexually transmitted
infections are intoxicated at the time of infection.  Alcohol abuse
can have harmful and deadly effects on the bodies of both women and
men, including liver damage, damage to other organs and organ
systems, and negative effects on unborn children, causing lower
birth weight and possible brain damage.<p><p>
     It is clear that alcohol use is having a serious impact across
our nation and in our campus community.  It is only when we
recognize that each of us has the power to change these grim facts
and make our own choices to drink responsibly or not to drink can
we make our future a healthy and safe one.<p><p>

<center><h1>PREVENTING ALCOHOL ABUSE IS MORE THAN A MATTER OF EDUCATION</h1></center>
<hr>
     <p>On college campuses today, most students are educated about
the effects of excessive use of alcohol on their bodies, their
relationships, and other aspects of their lives.  Students know
that alcohol is a drug, that it can impair one's judgement, and
that it can make one vulnerable to physical and emotional harm in
the form of fighting, DWI charges, sexual and physical assaults,
and other consequences.  On college campuses as well, there is
increasingly more attention being given to providing students with
alternatives to the bar scene ,in the form of on and off campus
events that do not place a major focus on alcohol use.<p>

              <center> <h2> HOW CAN I COPE WITH DEPRESSION?</h2></center>
<hr>
<p><b>Depression is a disturbance in a mood characterized by varying
degrees of sadness, disappointment, loneliness, hopelessness, self-doubt and guilt. </b> Most people tend to feel depressed at one time or
another, but some people may experience these feelings more
frequently or with deeper, more lasting, effects.  In some cases,
depression can last for months or even years.
<p><p>
The most common type of depression is referred to as "feeling blue"
or "being in a bad mood".  These feelings are usually brief in
duration and have minimal or slight effects on normal, everyday
activities.  Depression at the next level is more severe.  Symptoms
are more intense and last over a longer duration of time.  Day to
day activities become more difficult but the individual is still
able to deal with them.  It is at this level, however, that
feelings of hopelessness can become so overwhelming that suicide
may seem the only solution.<p><p>

People suffering from depression may experience extreme
fluctuations in moods or begin withdrawing from their daily routine
and/or outside world.<p><p>

<i>The symptoms of depression are as follows:
</i>
<ol>
<li>
  Changes in feelings or perceptions as evidenced by:
    <ul>

<li> crying spells or, at the other extreme, lack of emotional  
          response
     <li>inability to find pleasure in anything
     <li>feelings of hopelessness and/or worthlessness
     <li>exaggerated sense of guilt or self-blame
     <li>loss of warm feelings toward family and friends
</ul> 
<li>
 Changes in behavior and attitudes as evidenced by:
    <ul>
<li>
loss of interest in activities which previously were        
          enjoyed and a general withdrawal from others
     <li>loss of interest in appearance and responsibilities
     <li>irritability and complaints about matters which were        
          previously taken in stride  
     <li>general dissatisfaction about life
     <li>impaired memory, inability to concentrate, indecisiveness   
          and confusion
     <li>reduced ability to cope on a daily basis
</ul> 
<li>  Physical complaints as evidenced by:
     <ul>
<li>
lack of energy and chronic fatigue
     <li>loss of appetite or, at the other extreme, excessive        
          overeating
     <li>disturbance is usual sleeping patterns (insomnia, early     
          morning wakefulness, or excessive sleeping)
     <li>unexplained headaches, backaches and similar complaints
     <li>problems with digestion including stomach pains, nausea,    
     indigestion, and/or change in bowel habits
</ul></ol>
<p>Depression can be the result of any number of circumstances,
including but not limited to personality, environmental or
biochemical factors.  Shortages or chemical imbalances in the brain
created by illness, infections, certain medications or drugs,
improper diet or nutrition may play a significant role in some
cases of depression.   When the source of the depression is obvious
and the person knows where it is coming from, the individual can
expect the depression to level off and eventually fade away after
a reasonable amount of time.  The problem is when the depressed
person is unaware of the source of such feelings.  This can lead to
further depression because the person is unable to understand it
and, therefore, feels a loss of control.  Identifying the source
and understanding the causes of physical and psychological stress
is a major step in learning to cope with depression. <p><p>

By being honest with yourself about changes in your mood and the
intensity of your negative feelings you can try to determine what
is troubling.  Perhaps it is your relationship with a family member
or friend, a financial problem, or a school related incident. 
Discussing problems with the people involved or with a supportive
friend can sometimes help to resolve the situation before a
critical stage of stress if reached.  Even mild depression should
be dealt with if it impairs your ability to act effectively. <p><p> 
<i>You might also want to try:
</i>
<ul>
<li>
 Changing your normal routine to take a break for something you
     enjoy doing, even if you don't feel like it.

<li>   Exercising.  It's a great way to work off tension and stress     as well as improving your digestion and helping you to sleep.
   
<li>  Avoiding stressful situations such as long-term commitments,     or decisions that may make you feel trapped.  It's better to     put them off until you are feeling better.

<li>   Seeing a physician, especially if physical complaints persist.
</ul> 
<p><p>

                   <b> Helping a Depressed Friend</b><p><p>
   Since severely depressed individuals can be very withdrawn, lethargic, self-ruminating, and
possibly suicidal, a concerned friend can provide a valuable and possibly life-saving service.  
Talking candidly with the individual regarding your concern for his or her well being will
often bring the problems out into the open.  As you talk with your friend, the American College<p><p>
<i>Health Association advises the following:</i>
  <ul>
<li>
Do not try to "cheer up" the individual.
  <li> Do not criticize or shame, as feelings of depression cannot be helped.
  <li> Do not sympathize and claim that you feel the same way as he or she does.
  <li> Try not to get angry with the depressed individual.
</ul>
   <p>Your primary objective is to let the person know you are concerned and willing to help.
If feelings of depression appear to turn to thoughts of suicide, urge the individual to seek 
professional help.  If the person resists such a suggestion and you feel that suicide is likely do not
leave the person alone.  If you feel that the person may attempt suicide, seek professional help
immediately by calling <b>Campus Security (862-7333), the College Counseling Center (862-7394),
the Suicide 24 Hour Hotline (718-589-1880), or New York City Emergency Assistance (911).</b><p><p>

             <b>  When Professional Help is Necessary
</b>
<p>Depression is treatable and needless suffering of those who experience it can be alleviated.  A 
mental health professional should be consulted when an individual experiences any of the 
following circumstances:
  <ul>
<li>
When pain or problems outweigh pleasures much of the time;
<li>When symptoms are so severe and persistent that day-to-day functioning is impaired; and/or
 <li>When stress seems so overwhelming that suicide seems to be a viable option.
</ul>
<i>Qualified mental health professionals can help identify the causes and sources of depression and 
can help the individual find ways to overcome them.  For further assistance call the Counseling 
Center at (718) 862-7394 for an appointment.</i>

<BODY>
<H2>A Few Suggestions For Combating Depression</H2>
<HR>

<H2>Assume a "Coping" Attitude</H2><P>

<H3>Even though we are not able to change all the things we would
like to in our lives, we still have control over how we cope with
adversity.  When we take on a coping attitude we are recognizing
that we almost always have choices available to us, even if that
choice is to do nothing.
</H3><P>

<H2>Practice Assertion</H2><P>

<H3>Assertion can most simply be defined as truly being oneself. 
Part of being a unique, assertive person involves learning to
identify one's feelings and thoughts.  This should result in a
confident expression of oneself and a greater understanding on
the part of others.</H3><P>

<H2>Talk To a Friend</H2><P>

<H3>Try to be open with others by sharing your thoughts and feelings. 
Isolation often increases depression while activity and social
support frequently decrease it.</H3><P>

<H2>Use a Self-Rescue List</H2><P>

<H3>Create a list of things you can do which might help you feel
better when you're depressed or overwhelmed.  Think of things
which have worked for you in the past.  Some suggestions might be
to go out for a soda with a trusted friend, engage in a sporting
activity, nurture yourself with a warm bath
or cup of tea.</H3><P>

<H2>Set Life Goals</H2><P>

<H3>College is a time when one often wonders "where am I going with my 
life?"  When these questions come up it can help to create a list of 
life goals for oneself.  This list should be updated as
your interests and values change.  It can also be helpful to
visualize what your life would be like if you fulfilled the
various goals.</H3><P>

<H2>Laugh and Play</H2>

<H3>Set aside time for spontaneous, unstructured activities.  This
can be done alone or with others and can involve things which you
have never done before.
</H3><P>

<H2>Get Help If You Need It</H2><P>

<H3>It may be that you have tried all of these things at one time or
another with little or no success.  Don't give up!  It might be
time for you to seek professional help which you are likely to
benefit from.  It's always harder to do it alone, especially when
one feels alone to begin with.  We owe it to ourselves to get
help!

<center>  <h2>WINTER DEPRESSION</h2></center>
<hr>
     <p>Winter is a beautiful time for many of us - a quiet
snowfall, snow on the trees.  For most of us, however, it is also
a time of restricted activity - sub-freezing temperatures, icy
roads, layers of clothes, and "cabin fever."  There is a seasonal
effect on our feelings, and for some this time of year may
accentuate feelings of isolation and depression.  Of course,
there are other situations throughout the year that alter how we
feel and how we handle those feelings, but winter can heighten
our awareness of this issue.<p><p>
     When you are depressed you may feel sad, anxious, or
experience mood swings.  Sleep may be disturbed; eating patterns
are irregular; you may feel weak and easily tired; you may
withdraw from other people; you cry frequently; your general
behavior slows down.  You accentuate a negative view of yourself
and the world, and may become pessimistic about the future.  Some
people become self-critical, or have difficulty making decisions. 
After ruling out an organic illness, these signs may indicate
depression.<p><p>
     Theorists speculate that depression may be caused by overly
negative thoughts concerning your environment, yourself or the
future, and may be triggered by a significant loss, e.g. a
relationship or a life goal.  This loss may stimulate a chain of
negative appraisals which result in a depressed state.  Others
are said to experience "learned helplessness," a lack of
effective adaptive techniques when one is unable to believe an
unsatisfying state of affairs can be changed.  Some may be too
dependent on external sources for a sense of meaning.  Others see
depression as sense of loss (a goal, expectation or position). 
With no focus outside of self, feelings turn inward.  The normal
process of dealing with the loss is a gradual turning loose of
the "lost" object of our feelings and a turning toward other
persons or goals.  When these feelings are not allowed to
surface, depression may occur.<p><p>
     One basic approach to dealing with depression is to first
identify what brings on such feelings in our daily life -  place,
people, thoughts.  Learn how to predict these occurrences and
develop new coping strategies to deal with them.  It is also
important to learn how to identify your feelings and their
relationships to various thoughts and situations.  Try to
communicate those feelings assertively.  Even anger, which may
have been taught is "wrong" to express, needs to find a
constructive outlet rather than be turned inward or saved for a
later outburst.  You have the right to feel your feelings and to
change those feelings without having those feelings rule or ruin
your life.<p><p>
     Next, recognize depressive thinking or "negative self-talk." 
Such thoughts reinforce the "I am no good" view of ones self. 
Then correct these thoughts to "positive self-talk" by
acknowledging the real situation, but following up with a
relaxed, confident analysis of your best available responses.<p><p>

<h1>EATING DISORDERS</h1>

<hr>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Due to cultural ideals of feminine beauty, young women feel a strong
desire to be thinner than their bodies naturally tend to be.  As a
result, they change their eating patterns and they may develop eating
disorders.  The most common eating disorders are Anorexia Nervosa and
Bulimia. Both eating disorders are more common among young adults than
at any other age.

Below you will find information on
<ul>
<li><b>ANOREXIA NERVOSA
<li>BULIMIA
<li>WHAT CAUSES ANOREXIA NERVOSA & BULIMIA
<li>PHYSICAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ANOREXIA NERVOSA &
BULIMIA
<li>WAYS TO HELP
<li>WHERE TO FIND HELP</b>
</ul>
<p><br>
<h3>WHAT IS ANOREXIA NERVOSA ?</h3>

Anorexia Nervosa is a serious psychological and physiological disorder.
Anorexia Nervosa has the following characteristics:
<ol>     
<li>The anorexic restricts eating to the point of emaciation.

<li>The anorexic may exercise constantly and take laxatives or
          diuretics to lose weight.
   
<li>The most common ages of onset are 11 and 18, the beginning
          and ending of adolescence.
     
<li>The disorder is mostly diagnosed in the upper middle class.
          However, both rich and poor can develop the disorder.
     
<li>Even though anorexics are extremely thin and underweight,
        most insist that they are not hungry or thin.

<li>With psychological help about 1/3 of all anorexics get  
          better.  About 20% die of the disorder.

<li>Approximately 60% of all anorexics also develop bulimia.
</ol> 

<h3>WHAT IS BULIMIA ?</h3>

Bulimia is binge-eating followed by self-induced vomiting or the use of
laxatives.  Bulimia has the following characteristics:
<ol>     
<li>The disorder usually begins in late adolescence and early   
          adulthood. 
     
<li>It is not easily recognized by others because bulimics may be
          of normal weight or a little overweight.

<li>Bulimics are aware of the problem and try to keep it a        
          secret.

<li>Bulimics may become depressed, guilty, and disgusted with
          their binge-purge cycles.  Yet they will not stop the
          behavior.
</ol>


<h3>WHAT CAUSES ANOREXIA NERVOSA & BULIMIA ?</h3>
1.   A desire for control, competence, and independence.
<p>
2.   Discomfort with sexual thoughts and feelings.

<center><h2>What Are Eating Disorders?</h2></center>

<hr>

<b>Anorexia Nervosa</b>
     <p>Anorexia Nervosa is a disruption in normal eating habits characterized by an all
consuming fear of becoming "fat."  It typically starts in teenage women as a normal attempt to
diet but gradually leads to more and more weight loss, often more than 25% of original body
weight.  There is an intense preoccupation with food and body size, which may involve
compulsive exercising.  As this happens, many normal activities may stop.  Menstruation ceases
in women and there are a number of physical symptoms of malnutrition such as lowered heart
rate, low blood pressure, decreased metabolic rate and sensations of coldness particularly in the
extremities.<p><p>

     People with anorexia nervosa are obsessed with food and deny that they have a problem
or that they are too thin.  They may be able to work or study and have some social life but
usually function far below their potential.  Frequently they are also depressed.  Some persons
with anorexia starve themselves to death.  Others check the downward spiral of weight loss and 
maintain a steady but seriously underweight condition.  In all cases, even severe weight loss does 
not diminish the perception of being "fat."<p><p>




<b>Bulimia</b>
     <p>Bulimia is a cycle of uncontrolled binge eating followed by purging through vomiting or
the use of laxatives.  Individuals with bulimia are often of normal weight or even slightly
overweight.  Bulimia can range from a mild and relatively infrequent response to stress to an
extremely debilitating pattern that absorbs nearly all of a person's time, energy, and money.  In
its most severe forms, binge eating and purging may occur ten or more times a day.<p><p>

     Bulimia usually begins innocuously as an attempt to control weight. Purging may seem to
be a convenient means for a person to overeat without gaining weight.  It can quickly become a
destructive process that cannot be controlled.  Persons with bulimia are often aware that
their eating patterns are abnormal and out of control and that their lives are dominated by their 
eating habits.  They may feel quilty and depressed after a binge.  Over time, the cycle becomes 
more and more dominant in the person's thoughts and behavior.  It may impair personal
relationships and interfere with other activities, leading to depression, isolation, and lowered 
self-esteem.  Once caught in this pattern, the resulting shame and sense of helplessness may 
make it difficult for the person to seek the help that is needed.<p><p>

     The physical effects of bulimia can also be serious.  Frequent vomiting can cause
permanent tooth damage from erosion of tooth enamel as well as damage to the tissues of the
throat and esophagus.  Kidney problems and seizures are also possible.  Electrolyte imbalance
with consequent risk of serious cardiac problems is also a significant danger. One form of
anorexia nervosa also involves binge eating and purging.  In these cases persons turn to
binge-purge strategies as an alternative to starving themselves to achieve their desired weight
loss.  Thus the bing-purge cycle may occur in both disorders but individuals with anorexia
nervosa lose much more weight.<p><p>

                   <b> Causes of Eating Disorders
</b>
     <p>Anorexia nervosa has been known for over a century but it is only since the early 1970's
that bulimia, not associated with anorexia, has been known to professionals.  One out of every
one hundred women may become anorexic.  Estimates of the frequency of bulimia vary from five
out of a hundred to twenty out of a hundred in college age women.  Men also develop anorexia
nervosa and bulmia but in far smaller numbers.  Both disorders appear to be on the increase.  
Experts do not know the causes of these disorders nor why they are increasing, but most agree
that biological, psychological, and social factors all play a part.<p><p>

     Least is known about biological factors.  Some evidence suggests that eating disorders
may develop as a response to inherited predispositions to mood swings and depression.  Other 
evidence reveals an increased incidence of major depression and alcoholism in blood relatives of
persons with bulima or bulimic variations of anorexia nervosa.  Antidepressant medication under 
the supervision of a physician has been found helpful to some individuals in controlling the
binge-purge cycle.<p><p>

     More attention has been paid to the psychological development of persons with eating
disorders.  It is speculated that anorexia may function as an attempt to gain control over life or
life circumstances when a person has felt little control in the past.  It may also serve as an
avoidance of the bewildering complexities of physical and emotional maturation. Specialists
from the UCLA Eating Disorder Program have described a profile of individuals with anorexia. 
They are often compliant "model children" who tend to be intelligent, perfectionistic, and have
high personal standards.  They often want to please others but have low self-esteem and
problems with assertion.  They will also frequently be depressed.  High expectations within their
families may be another contributing factor.<p><p>

     Persons with bulimia also suffer from low self-esteem but tend to be less passive than
persons with anorexia nervosa.  Individuals with bulimia tend to be more socially active, are
more likely to date, and may use alcohol and drugs.  Research suggests that persons with bulimia
have a higher general level of anxiety than others.  Thus the binge-purge cycle may function as a 
mechanism for relieving anxiety and emotional stress.<p><p>

     Social factors also seem to contribute to eating disorders.  Excessive emphasis within our
culture on slim, boyish figures for women makes it increasingly hard for the adolescent girl,
already worried about herself and her body, to feel acceptable.  Increasing numbers of teenage
girls resort to extreme diets or purging in attempts to make their maturing bodies conform to the 
expectations of society.  Some of these individuals will be trapped in the destructive pattern of 
eating disorders.  Females have traditionally felt more pressure than males to conform to physical
stereotypes of what is acceptable.  This may explain why so many more females than males
develop eating disorders.<p><p>

                            <b>Treatment</b>

     <p>An important first step in overcoming an eating disorder is for the person to acknowledge
to him or herself and to helping professionals that an eating disorder is a problem.  Medical and 
psychological help should be sought from individuals experienced in the treatment of
such disorders.  A complete physical examination including lab tests will often be necessary.<p><p>

     Psychotherapy or counseling is also usually necessary.  It may include individual and/or
group therapy.  One immediate benefit of such therapy is the feeling of relief at no longer having
to keep such an important part of one's life a secret.  Psychotherapy will often focus on
improving self-esteem.  It may be supplemented by nutrition education, discussions of eating
habits, and food selection.<p><p>

     This combination of medical, psychological, and educational treatments can be effective
on an outpatient basis, meaning that the person can continue to do normal life activities while
being treated.  In extreme cases, e.g., a person with anorexia nervosa whose weight is 
extremely low or a person with bulimia who is completely out of control, temporary hospi- 
talization may be required.  What is most important is that professional treatment be sought as 
quickly as possible.  Attempts at self-help are rarely sucessful, and the longer the disorder
remains unchecked the harder it may be to overcome.<p><p>

        <b>  How to Help Someone Who Has an Eating Disorder
</b>
    <p> <i>If you know of a friend or family member who has an eating disorder, here are some
guidelines:</i>
   <ul>
<li>
 Don't nag about eating or not eating.  Don't spy.  People with eating disorders are
          already extremely self-conscious aboout their eating habits.  The most you will do
          is increase their discomfort and force them to be even more secretive.

   <li>  Don't agree to help the person control eating by hiding food to keep them from
          binge eating.   The person with bulimia may request such "help" initially, but will
          end up resenting it and finding other ways to binge.

   <li>  Do remember a person with an eating disorder is just that -- first, a person, and
          only secondarily one who has trouble with food.

   <li> Do be available to listen to the person in times of distress. One of the best ways
          to help someone gain control over eating is to reach out to that person as a friend
          instead of focusing on his or her eating behavior.

    <li>   Do be supportive and encourage the person to get help.  Medication,
          psychotherapy, and nutrition education can all be helpful.  Let the person know
          you care.  Don't let yourself be convinced that the person really doesn't have a
          problem.  The problem exists and there is hope.

                <center>   <h2>THE SAFE WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT</h2></center>

<hr>
     <p>Losing weight and staying slim have become a national
obsession.  We are bombarded daily with new diets, exercise
programs, fitness products, and weight control pills.  All of these
things promise to make us look like supermodels, immediately and
forever.  Most of these things simply do not work and are only a
means to make somebody rich.  However, if, like many Americans, you
are determined to lose some weight for better health, there are
effective and reasonable methods you can use to achieve your goal.<p><p>
     Dieting alone is not an effective, safe or long-lasting method
to lose weight.  People using diet pills or severely cutting down
on their food intake to lose weight quickly, often wind up gaining
the weight back, or gaining even more.<p><p>
     The body needs a variety of foods for growth, tissue repair,
energy, and true fitness.  We should consume protein, vitamins,
fats, and carbohydrates everyday to maintain good nutrition,
especially several servings of fruits, grains and vegetables.  Any
diet that advocates eating poorly or too little should be avoided.<p><p>
     The best program for weight loss is one which combines a
sensible reduction in calories and fats and some form of regular
exercise.  A sensible diet is one which involves eating less of
some foods (like fatty and sugary foods), and increasing the intake
of other foods (like vegetables and fruits).  Studies have shown
that people who eat a diet of low calorie, low fat foods and engage
in some form of regular exercise lose 25% more fat than those who
diet alone.  The formula is simple:  burn more calories than you
take in so they are not stored as fat.<p><p>
     The fact is, we should not talk about an "ideal" weight, or
about losing weight.  We should talk about losing excess fat and
becoming more physically fit.  The health risk is not being
overweight, but being overfat.  Exercise helps the body to turn fat
into muscle building protein.  Diets alone promote loss of protein
and temporary loss of water-weight, and long-term effects will be
minimal without exercise.  Actually, because muscle weighs more
than fat, a better gauge of your health as you begin to eat better
and exercise is the way you feel and the amount of fat on your
body, not the dreaded bathroom scale.<p><p>
     The exercise you choose should be based on what you would most
enjoy doing about three times a week.  You can vary the type of
exercises you do so that you do not become bored and give up.  The
exercises you do to lose fat should be aerobic, that is exercise
that gets your heartrate up a bit and promotes overall<p><p>
cardiovascular health.  Nonaerobic or anaerobic exercises like
weightlifting or situps do not burn fat.  The good news is there
are many aerobic exercises to choose from; they can be done in a
variety of convenient places; and many are relatively inexpensive
and simple to do.  Jogging, walking, cycling, roller-blading,
swimming, cross-county skiing, jumping rope, step-aerobics,
treadmill walking, and dancing are just a few of the exercise
options for an effective aerobic fitness regime. <p><p>
     Starting a sensible fitness program should be a goal we all
strive for, not just to look good but to feel good.  You should
begin slowly, set obtainable goals for yourself, and see your
doctor for a full physical examination before you begin.  If you
deny yourself too many of the foods you enjoy or set out to
exercise too rigorously, you will not stick to the program and feel
discouraged or depressed.<p>

<center><h2>WEIGHT MANAGEMENT</h2></center>
<hr>

     <p>The social, psychological and physical consequences of obesity
are significant.  As a result many people attempt to lose weight
through diets.  The sheer number of diets is staggering; many
dieters have tried several of them.  A common outcome of dieting is
that weight lost on the diet is regained once the diet is
discontinued.  Most diets are discontinued out of boredom or
because one can not live on the food allowed.  As a result, many
overweight Americans experience a yo-yo effect as their weight goes
up and down.  Research suggests that this experience is very
harmful.<p><p>
     There are many reasons for trying to lose weight.  One is the
social ostracism which contradicts the myth of the jolly fat
person.  Many obese children and adults are considered less
attractive as friends or employees that people of normal weight. 
There is also considerable evidence that overweight people are
dissatisfied with themselves and prone to depression and anxiety. 
The physiological effects of being overweight can be quite
profound.  Obese people suffer greater strain on their muscles and
joints than those of normal weight.  There is increased risk of
cardiovascular disease in overweight people.  Complications from
medically necessary surgery are increased and surgeons may refuse
elective surgeries because of obesity.  Many of these people feel
guilty because of their weight.<p><p>
     A myth that has been dispelled is that obese people have 


                             
 
little willpower and are therefore weak.  Actually, many obese
people eat normal or below normal amounts of food.  It appears that
problems in their metabolism or in their choice of food contribute
to the obesity.  A sedentary lifestyle and a pattern of restrictive
eating or dieting can reduce metabolism, so many people
inadvertently perpetuate the very problem they are attempting to
correct because the body reduces metabolism in response to dieting. 
The choice of foods high in fat content complicates weight loss,
too.  As with many problems, obesity is caused by the interaction
of many factors.<p><p>
     Treatment of obesity involves a change of lifestyle and not
just of diet alone.  Through group or individual therapy, clients
must learn how to eat nutritionally balanced meals and to avoid
diets or other artificial meal plans.  It is important to learn
when to eat and to avoid emotional eating.  Emotional eating
involves using food to reduce the effect of unpleasant feelings. 
It is imperative for such eaters to discover healthy ways to cope
with unpleasant emotions.  Exercise is extremely important to
weight management and general health because it facilitates weight
loss through increasing the body's metabolism which helps burn the
calories consumed.<p><p>

<h1>PERMANENT WEIGHT CONTROL</h1>

			  
<hr>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Many American men and women believe that they are fat.  They then
diet, lose, and regain weight.  Dieting can become frustrating
when it does not work.  Also, extreme dieting can lead to
physical and psychological problems. 


<h3>CAUSES OF WEIGHT PROBLEMS</h3>

1. Heredity.  
<p>
2. Inactivity. 
<p>
3. Overeating.
<p>
4. Types of food eaten.  Too much fatty, fried, or junk food will 
   increase your weight.
<p>   
5. Eating snacks while watching television.
<p>   
6. Repeated dieting.  With repeated dieting, the rate of          
   metabolism becomes slower, enabling the body to maintain its   
   weight with fewer calories.
<p>
Because people are overweight, they diet.  But dieting usually
don't work.

<h3>WHY DIETING DOES NOT WORK ?</h3>

1. Dieting is for a limited time.
<p>
2. Unrealistic goals are set.
<p>
3. The dieter constantly thinks of food due to food restriction.
<p>    
4. The dieter does not learn a new lifestyle.
<p>
   In addition, dieting can have negative effects.  Repeatedly
breaking one's diet can promote self-criticism, create
disappointment, and cause anxiety.  

<h3>HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT PERMANENTLY</h3>

1. Incorporate exercise into your daily routine. 
<p>
2. Monitor: 
<ul>     
<li> your mood when food was eaten.
        
<li> type of food eaten.
     
<li> when food was eaten.
     
<li> where food was eaten.
     
<li> what influenced you to eat.
</ul>        
3. Develop solutions to the eating habits that are problematic.   
   For example, if you note that you are eating fatty and fried   
   foods, you can avoid these foods by not buying them. 
<p>
4. Set realistic goals.
<p>
5. Eat a balanced diet that includes meat, cereal, fruit,         
   vegetables, and milk. Avoid high caloric foods.
<p>
6. Weigh yourself once a week at the same time.
<p>
7. Develop hobbies and become socially active so you do not eat   
   merely because you are bored.

        <center>  <h2><b>COPING WITH THE AFTERMATH OF A TRAUMATIC EVENT</b></h2></center><hr>

    <p> As we live our lives, most of us expect that we can go from
day to day without touched major stressors. However, in our
society, newspapers and television programs tell us that serious
situations such as rapes, assaults, and violence are not beyond the
realm of possibility.  If such a situation were to happen to us or
to someone we love, what reactions would we expect?  How long would
these reactions last?  Most importantly, what can we do to help
ourselves or others as we deal with the aftermath of a traumatic
event?
   <p>  Defined most succinctly,<i> a traumatic event is an occurrence
that is beyond the scope of everyday experience which makes a
person concerned about his or her welfare or survival in the face
of that event.</i>  Examples of traumatic events may be situations
related to war, abuse, violence, accidents, or other events.  When
faced with such situations, the human body prepares to engage in a
"fight or flight" response to deal with the stressful situations. 
While the fight or flight response can be adaptive in confronting
physical danger, a similar psychological response may increase our
level of stress unless we find outlets to address our concerns and
allow ourselves time for healing.
   <p>  Typically, responses to traumatic situations can be
characterized as falling within several stages, though all people
do not have to pass through these stages sequentially nor do they
need to experience every stage.  In the <b>"OUTCRY" </b>stage, which
frequently occurs relatively soon after the trauma, individuals
often feel anxious, confused, and exhausted.  In the <b>"DENIAL"</b>
stage, there is often an experience of emotional numbing and
"shutting down";  at this time, people may have difficulty
recalling details of the event and have difficulty discussing
feelings related to it.  In the <b>"INTRUSION" </b>stage, individuals may
experience moodiness and mood changes, many have difficulty
concentrating, may be sensitive to sights and sounds around them,
and may have difficulty sleeping, perhaps being affected by
nightmares.  During the <b>"WORKING THROUGH" </b>stage, persons engage in
steps and strategies that will allow them to heal.  There is no set
time line for this stage nor any of the others listed above;
responses to traumatic situations are as individual as are persons
who experience such situations.
    <p> There are many things that individuals can do to address the
affects of traumatic situations on their lives.  These include
taking care of oneself through proper nutrition and exercise,
developing or enhancing one's support network, and learning and
practicing relaxation techniques to be used during periods of high
stress.  Some persons find it very helpful to discuss their
concerns with either a professional psychologist or a peer
counselor.  To this end, the College Counseling Center (862-7394)
offers services from licensed psychologists and advanced doctoral
students in Clinical and Counseling Psychology programs.  Whatever
the traumatic situation, there are options to address it's effects,
and we can each play a role in directing the path of our healing.

<center><h2><b>Why Am I Still Awake?<br>
Submitted by the Manhattan College Health Services Office</b></h2>
</center><hr>
     <p>The erratic schedule most college students follow can lead to "Disorders of Initiating and
Maintaining Sleep (DIMS)."  While science has yet to solve insomnia, we can offer you what we
do know about sleeping patterns and disruptions.<ol>
<li>Stress, anxiety and overwork are the likeliest suspects.  While these are
unavoidable during certain class weeks, try to relax after making it to bed.
     <li>Most adults, need 7-8 hours of sleep a night.  You may not.  So don't think you're
an insomniac if you run on 5  hours.  Feel Lucky.
     <li>Avoid mythologized glass of warm milk.  Milk may actually stimulate your brain! 
Sugar and honey, however, will soothe you.  Alcohol may relax you, but it can produce restless
or disturbed sleep.
     <li>Don't force yourself to sleep.  It won't work.  If you're still awake after 20 minutes
in bed, get up and do something relaxing for a half-hour.  Then try it again.
     <li>Avoid caffeine before bedtime (coffee, tea, sodas, chocolate...).  Of course, after 2
pots of coffee you might have trouble getting to sleep.  Some doctors advise avoiding caffeine as
early as the afternoon!
     <li>Naps longer than 1/2 an hour or after 3 p.m. interfere with your normal sleeping
pattern.  Keep  em short and sweet.
     <li>A routine can help a lot, too.  Go to bed at the same time every night (yeah, right). 
Wake up at the same time, too (even easier).  Of course I realize this is almost an impossibility
for anyone going to college, so move on to the next one.
     <li>Avoid procrastination.  Keeping up with assignments helps you avoid those all-nighters which can disrupt the best of sleep patterns.
     <li>Over-the-counter pills may work once, but beware of "rebound insomnia" after you
stop using them.  Could be more trouble than they are worth.
</ol>
    <hr> <p><b>If you have any questions about your own particular situation concerning sleep patterns,
you may want to speak with a health care professional.  The nurses and doctors in the Manhattan
College Health Services Office (813 East Hill: 718-862-7217) may be of assistance to you.  Hope
you have sweet and refreshing dreams!</b>

<center><h2><b>No Sleep  Til The Grade Is Made<br>
Submitted by the Manhattan College Health Services Office
</b></h2></center><hr>
     <p>The Health Care Professionals at the Manhattan College Health Sevices Office hope
you're managing your time well enough that you won't have to suffer through too many
sleepless nights in order to do well in your academic courses.  But since some of you will
probably engage in at least a few all night cram sessions before you're finished here at
Manhattan College, you might as well do it as carefully as possible.
     <p>First of all, manage your study time effectively.  Plan out your night so you can plot your
progress ahead of time and study more efficiently.  
     <p>Next, don't skimp on eating.  Eat well and eat frequently.  Try to keep a light snack on
hand while studying to keep your body well-nourished.  This will help your ability to concentrate
and to retain what you're studying.
     <p>Try to take a break once every half-hour to give your eyes a rest and your brain some
time to relax.  Do various stretches (especially the neck, upper back and shoulders if you're
hunching over your books or computer terminal) and/or take a shower ( more than one if
necessary) to help refresh yourself.
    <p> For many students, caffeine is part and parcel of the all- nighter.  Beware!  Too much
caffeine stimulation (whether through drinks or over-the-counter pills) may boomerang on you!
These stimulants could lead to irritability, anxiety, lethargy, stomach irritation or headaches. 
Drink coffee or colas moderately.  We don't recommend that you use caffeine pills at all. 
Depending on these products to keep you awake can do your body chemistry more harm than
good in the long run.
     <p>Sleeping patterns vary depending on the individual.  Some people can sleep in 15 minute
intervals, while others are dead to the world once they close their eyes.  In any case, if you have
back-to-back exams and have to pull back-to-back all-nighters, you might be able to "function"
on four hours sleep, though we wouldn't recommend that you make a habit of it.
     <p>You know, you don't have to take caffine to stay alert, certain foods will do the trick
too!  What are good high-energy foods to help keep you awake and alert?  According to Dietician
Patti Funk, a general rule is to combine proteins with carbohydratres for high-energy fuel that
keeps you going through the night.  For meals, pasta with a bit of meat sauce, a sandwich on
whole-wheat bread, beans and brown rice or macaroni and cheese are all good bets.
     <p>For snacks, try to avoid vending machines as much as possible.  But if they're the only
food resource on hand, go for cheese and crackers, trail mix or popcorn instead of candy bars and
chips.  Fresh fuits and vegetables are optimal snacks for all-nighyt situations, so munch on
grapes, apples, celery or bananas while studying.
    <p> Don't rely on sugar fixes from candy and sugar snacks for energy.  Despite what you may
have heard about sugar's ability to provide an energy boost, it generally has the opposite effect. 
Hundreds of experiments have shown that eating sugary foods causes drowsiness.  Sugar in fruit
(fructose), however, does not create this "calming" effect.
     <p>Another myth you might have heard is that milk (or at least warm milk) makes you
drowsy. <b> WRONG!  </b>Milk actually stirs up mental energy that stimulates you to think more
quickly and accurately.  So drinking a steady supply of milk while studying will help you stay
awake.  
     <p>If you start getting a <i>"sour stomach" </i>because you've stayed up long past your bedtime,
try eating a piece of dry toast or crackers.  This helps absorb some of the acid in your stomach
that causes mild nausea and heartburn in the wee hours.  Also try drinking club soda or ginger
ale.
    <p> So the next time you have to pull an all-nighter, pick up some of these items at the
grocery store to help you make it through the long, long night.  Finally (just in case you needed
reminding)  after taking your exam, get to bed as soon as possible.  No amount of good eating,
showers, stretching or caffeine can take the place of sleep.  Bon Soir!

 <center> <h2><b>Stress And Burnout: What are They and How to Cope</b></h2></center><hr><br>
       <p>Midterm time is here and the stress level is at its
  peak--what to you do?  Before suggestions are offered on how
  to decrease your level of stress, this article explains the
  nature of stress in order to help you understand more about
  what is happening to you this time of the semester.
       <p><i>What is stress? </i> According to <b>Hans Selye</b>, a pioneer in
  stress research, stress is composed on a pattern or cycle
  that consists of three stages: <ol>
<li>the alarm reaction, in
  which the body mobilizes its defense forces<li>the
  resistance stage, during which the body adapts to the
  continuous stresses and resistance is increased<li>the
  exhaustion stage, which occurs after prolonged exposure to a
  stressor.  During this latter stage, if you do not pay
  attention, a loss of adaptability may result, and illness
  and exhaustion may also occur.  </ol>
     <p>  In order to personalize this description, consider the
  beginning of the semester, did receiving all your course
  syllabi result in a massive stress attack?  Did you
  eventually plateau and cope throughout the semester?  Are
  you now beginning to reach the point of exhaustion?  Sound
  familiar?  These are the typical stages of stress and can
  occur as a result of different types of stress inducing
  events.
      <p> <i>What is burnout?</i>  Burnout is a condition wherein the
  individual s ability to respond adequately is diminished,
  with accompanying changes of attitude, behavior, emotions,
  and physical symptoms.  Basically, one reaches a point of
  exhaustion where they can no longer cope with the stress and
  they begin to act differently because of this.  For example,
  have you been increasingly impatient with others?  Tired all
  of the time?  These are some possible reactions to burnout.
     <p>  <i>What are signs of stress or burnout?  </i>Irritability,
  being quick to anger, excessive procrastination, fatigue,
  lack of time, colds, headaches and coughs that linger, loss
  of hunger, chest pains, change of bowel movements, and
  inability to concentrate are all signs of burnout.  These
  signs occurs over a period of time.  The come upon you
  gradually.  Often the first people to notice that you are
  stressed are your friends roommates, and family.
  <p> <i>    What brings about burnout? </i> That differs from one
  person to the next.  You may be an intense person, or a
  perfectionist.  You may have a need to continually prove
  yourself.  You may have been given the message from your
  family "Make us proud of you,"  You may be driven to succeed
  and accomplish.  All of these or a combination of any of
  these may serve as stresses in your life, and lead to
  burnout.
  <p>     <i>What can you do about it?</i>  Five main suggestions are
  offered here.<ol><li>Attempt to change your behavioral
  responses to specific stressor situations.  <li>Work at
  changing your perception of events that are occurring.
 <li>Set limited goals.  Diminish your need for perfection.  <li>Increase your possibly lowered resistance through exercise
  and nutrition.  <li>Work out a daily log for a two week
  period.  Write down who, where, and when you find yourself
  most stressed.  Look at the pattern, then address what is
  changeable.</ol>
   <p>   <b> Remember, stress will always be a part of your life,
  whether in college or after you graduate.  Sometimes stress
  may even be positive.  What you need to be on the lookout
  for is that it does not become excessive, a way of life, or
  prevent you from functioning productively.  Now, during
  midterms, you can be on the look-out for signs and signals
  of stress and be aware of possible burn-out as the semester
  continues.</b>

<H2>Blame:  One Painful Way of Defeating Yourself</H2>
<HR> 
 
<H3>Traditional Western culture has developed an interesting concept --
one that is honed to a fine edge in the United States (and its criminal
justice system) and one that is found as a component of Judeo-Christian
based religions.<P>

BLAME is the concept.  Notice I  didn't  say "responsibility."  Think for a
few seconds about the two words.  Perhaps use them in a sentence.<P>

Blame is an affect laden word.  Responsibility, on the other hand, does not
tend to have the same level of affective (emotional) weighting.  Usually,
when we think of somebody as being to blame for an event we are judging
both their behavior and that person.  We are also often involved in 
assigning or determining guilt (he/she's to blame for the  car breaking-
down).  It may have been the person's responsibility to maintain the car in
sound working order but the implication of blame involves, to some
degree, causation (he/she caused the car to break-down).  In the examples,
blame implies causation and guilt.<P>

In our heritage, establishment of guilt is followed by some form of
punishment.  The punishments vary from standing in a corner for five
minutes to saying several extra prayers to a jail term or, in rare instances,
the death penalty.  Our entire culture revolves around the concept of rules
(both written and un-written) that are supposed to guide or regulate our
behavior.  When we break the rules one or more persons judge us guilty,
announce a punishment (which is to be imposed) and inform us when the
punishment is to be ended (or when we are absolved of the guilt).<P>

We grow up in the culture learning this type of system of blame, guilt,
punishment and absolution and apply it with regularity to others and to
ourselves.   We do this most frequently through our self talk.  We expend
vast amounts of energy determining who is to blame for a particular event
or phenomena. (Who spilled the milk?  Now, come on, 'fess up, who spilled
the milk?  Wait 'till your father/mother gets home.  He/she will find out
who spilled the milk and then you'll get it.)   The  determination of blame
(guilt) always seems to carry with it some implied or explicit suggestion of
punishment (then you'll get it).  Small wonder the responsibile party is
unwilling to step forward.<P>

In most day-to-day situations where people set about the task of
establishing blame the activity is of little actual importance.  In the
example of the spilled milk, the blame establisher probably is concerned
that (1) the milk is spilled (and may need to be cleaned up), and (2) the
responsible party be aware that the spilling of milk is something to be
avoided (and is to be mopped up).<P>

When we seek to establish blame for an event, we send a message.   The
message tends to be one that implies some terrible consequence following
the establishment of blame.   We are, of course, attempting to establish a
punishment for the wrongful event.  But punishment is not always an
effective means of changing behavior, feelings, and thoughts.  You have
probably learned in psychology that a punishment or a reward is
associated with the behavior that most immediately preceded the
administration of the reward or punishment.  That's essentially true!  But
wait a minute -- which behavior immediately preceded the
punishment?<P>

Those of you who have (or have had) dogs may recall that when the dog
did something wrong, you called the dog and spanked the dog for the
transgression.  The first time you did this the dog came right away, the
next time the dog was slower to respond and eventually the dog would not
come when called.   The dog would not come when called because it
learned that it would get spanked when it responded to your call.  You
have trained the dog to not come when you call as opposed to training the
dog to not dig in the garden.  Humans, though certainly very different than
dogs, respond to learning situations in a very similar way.<P>

What gets lost in the process of blame establishment is most often the
fundamental reason for initiating the process at the outset.   That is, a
person has exhibited a behavior (done something) that has had an effect
on our lives that we do not like.  We do not want them to do the same
thing again, particularly if the same consequence on our life may result. 
The objective is for that person (and we may be that person) to change his
or her behavior in such a way that the new behavior will likely result in
our experiencing a more favorable consequence (we want them to not spill
milk so we will not have to spend our energy cleaning a floor with milk on
it).<P>

By seeking to establish blame we focus on establishment of guilt rather
than on changing or modifying milk handling behavior.   We punish
"fessing up" (or coming when called) rather than teaching new, more
productive, methods of handling milk to the people with responsibility for
the handling of milk.  We get angry when they don't respond and when the
milk is spilled again.  This seems like a rather unproductive group of
activities.<P>

How might we change our blame establishing behavior? -- Not  by
punishing ourselves for doing it, but by seeking to replace the behavior
pattern with one that may get us closer to our overall objective.  When we
notice ourselves saying, either out loud or internally, things  like:  Who's to
blame, who's at fault, who did this or that, and other similar phrases and
we are feeling a strong emotion like anger -- STOP -- maybe even say out-
loud the word stop -- and then ask the following questions:   What
difference does establishing blame make?  Will establishing blame change
anything that is happening or has happened?   Will establishing blame
change the behavior of the responsible person?  As you review your
responses to the questions you will probably note your emotional resonse
has less intensity and that your self talk will start to move into the
problem solving mode  (O.K. -- now how can I correct the problem).  Once
in the problem solving mode you can then start determining your
immediate and long range objectives (seeing to it that the milk is mopped
from the floor and teaching people how to not spill milk) and the action
steps involved (getting the mop for yourself or another person and
teaching the responsible person how to more effectively hold a milk carton
and pour milk).  <P>

As you make a habit of taking charge of situations rather than establishing
blame you will most likely find that you have much more energy available
to invest in more productive activities.<P>

<center><H2><b>BREATHING TECHNIQUES</b></H2></center><hr>
   
  <h4>     <p>During stressful situations we rarely stop to think about what is happening within our bodies. Indeed, the pressures of the moment keep our
  minds occupied on almost everything but our physiological functions.  Consequently those functions often become irregular, leaving us in an
  unhealthy state of being. When we are in this state we have fewer chances to succeed in whatever we try to accomplish.
     <p>Among the many physiological functions adversely affected by stress is
  our breathing. Even when stress is minimal few people retain a habit of
  natural, full breathing which is required for maintaining a good mental and
  physical state. Proper breathing is essential for sustaining life and
  cleansing inner body systems. By learning proper breathing techniques
  stressful situations may be handled better and overall mental and physical
  health will be improved.</h4>
  
  <h3><b>BREATHING: THE IMPORTANCE OF OXYGEN.</b></h3>

<p>  Oxygen plays a vital role in the circulatory and respiratory systems. As we
  breathe, oxygen that is inhaled purifies our blood by removing poisonous waste
  products circulating throughout our blood systems. Irregular breathing will
  hamper this purification process and cause waste products to remain in
  circulation. Digestion will then become irregular, leaving tissues and organs
  undernourished. Improper oxygen consumption will thus ultimately lead to
  fatigue and heightened anxiety states. The irregular breathing elicited during
  stressful situations not only make them hard to cope with but also contribute
  to a general deterioration of health. By the careful control of our breathing
  pattern, we may not only rejuvenate our systems but counter the unhealthy
  effects of stress.
  
 <h3><b> BREATHING METHODS.</b></h3>

<p>  Breathing methods are useful to settle the body and mind and induce a
  heightened sense of awareness. Breathing exercises have been practiced for
  thousands of years in the East. The West began studying the effectiveness and
  importance of them several years ago. By this time, sufficient research has
  taken place in the West to verify the usefulness of these techniques.
       <p>The following breathing methods can be helpful for reducing anger,
  anxiety, depression, fatigue, irritability, muscular tension and stress.
  
  <h3><b>PROPER BREATHING.</b></h3>
 
 <p> While breathing is a function most people take for granted, rarely is it
  practiced in a proper fashion. Before beginning any technique it is essential
  that you learn how to breath properly and fully:<ol>
  <li>Lie down on a rug or blanket on the floor with your legs  straight and
  slightly apart, your toes pointed comfortably outwards, arms at your sides not
  touching your body, your palms up, and your eyes closed. This is called a
  "relaxed body" position. Take time to relax your body and breathe freely.
  <li>It is best to breathe through your nose, as the tiny hairs and mucous
  membranes filter out dust and toxins from the inhaled air. Keep your mouth
  closed as you breathe.
  <li> As you breathe, your chest and abdomen should move together. If only the
  chest seems to rise and fall, your breathing is shallow and you are not making
  good use of the lower part of your lungs. As you inhale you should feel your
  abdomen rising; it is as if your stomach is filling with air. As you exhale,
  the abdomen comes back in, like a balloon releasing all of its air. This
  inhale and exhale process should continue comfortably and smoothly. The chest
  and abdomen should rise as you inhale and fall as you exhale. The chest should
  move only slightly.</ol>
  
  <h3><b>DEEP, RELAXED BREATHING.</b></h3>

  <p>Although this exercise can be practiced in a variety of poses, the following
  is recommended for beginners:<ol>
  <li> Lie down on a blanket or rug on the floor. Bend your knees and move your
  feet about eight inches apart, with your toes turned outward slightly. Make
  sure your spine is straight.
  <li> Place one hand on your abdomen and one hand on your chest.
  <li> Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose into your abdomen to push up
  your hand as much as feels comfortable. Your chest should move only a little
  and only with your abdomen.
  <li> Continue step three until it becomes rhythmic and comfortable. Now smile
  slightly, inhale through your nose and exhale through your mouth, making a
  quiet, breezy sound as you gently blow out. Your mouth, tongue and jaw will be
  relaxed. Take long, slow, deep breaths raising and lowering your abdomen. Hear
  the sound and feel the texture of breathing as you become more and more
  relaxed.
  <li>When you first begin this technique, do it for five minutes. When you
  become more comfortable with it, you may extend it up to 20 minutes.
  <li>Upon ending a session, stay still for a few minutes and try to keep the
  entire body relaxed.
  <li>The purpose of this technique is to develop a good, relaxing breathing
  method. It may be practiced anytime, especially during stressful situations.
  </ol>

  <h3><b>THE RELAXING SIGH.</b></h3>

  <p>Sighing and yawning during the day are signs that you are not getting enough
  oxygen. A sigh releases a bit of tension and can be practiced at will as a
  means of relaxing.<ol>
  <li>Sit or stand up straight.
   <li>Sigh deeply, letting out a sound of deep relief as the air rushes out of
  your lungs.
  <li>Let new air come in naturally.
  <li>Repeat this procedure eight to twelve times whenever you feel the need for
  it, and experience the feeling of relaxation.</ol>
  
  <h3><b>THE CLENCHED FIST.</b></h3>

  <p>This exercise will stimulate your breathing, circulation and nervous system.<ol>
  <li>Stand up straight, hands at your sides.
  <li>Inhale and hold a complete natural breath as described above.
  <li>Raise your arms out in front of you, keeping them up and relaxed.
  <li>Gradually bring your hands to your shoulders. As you do, slowly contract
  your hands into fists so that when they reach your shoulders they are clenched
  as tight as possible.
  <li> Keep the fists tense as you push your arms out straight again very slowly.
  <li>Pull your arms back to your shoulders and straighten them out, fists tense,
  as fast as you can, several times.</ol>
  
 <h3><b> IMAGINATIVE BREATHING.</b></h3>
 
  <p>This exercise combines the relaxing benefits of deep, relaxed breathing with
  the curative value of positive auto-suggestions.<ol>
  <li> Lie down on a rug or blanket on the floor in a "relaxed body" pose.
 <li>Place your hands gently on your solar plexus (that point where your ribs
  start to separate above your abdomen) and practice deep, relaxed breathing for
  a few minutes.
  <li>Imagine that, with each incoming breath of air, energy is rushing into your
  lungs and being immediately stored in your solar plexus. Imagine that as you
  exhale, this energy is flowing out to all parts of your body. Form a mental
  picture of this energizing process.
  <li>Continue on a daily basis for at least five to ten minutes a day.</ol>
  
  <h3><b>THE ROLLING BREATH.</b></h3>
  
  <p>The following exercise requires a partner and is effective in relaxing and
  energizing you.<ol>
  <li> Lie on your back. Have your partner put one hand on your abdomen and one
  hand on your chest.
  <li>Inhale and exhale as in deep, relaxed breathing, but each inhale is taken
  in two stages abdomen, then chest. Imagine that you are breathing into your
  partner's hand as you fill your belly with air. When your abdomen feels full,
  continue breathing into your chest. Watch your partner's hands as it rises.
  <li>Exhale fully through the chest and belly simultaneously. 
  <li>Repeat. It is important to keep a rhythmic rolling effect between abdomen
  and chest. Breathe at your natural pace, however.</ol><br>
  
  <p>-- Any of the above techniques can and should be practiced everyday. Being a
  natural preventive measure for stress, there are very few side effects. It
  will take some time before you observe any profound changes within your body
  and mind taking place, but practice diligently and patiently. You will
  eventually realize that you have more energy and are much more relaxed.

<h2>Faculty and Staff as Helping Resources for Students</H2>
</center>
College students typically encounter a great deal of academic,
personal, and social stress during their educational experience.
While most students cope successfully with the demands of college
life, for some the pressures can become overwhelming and
unmanageable.
<P>
Faculty and staff are often in the most direct position to
identify students in distress. Moreover, faculty and staff are
often perceived by students as the first point of contact in
obtaining advice and support. Your expression of interest and
concern may be critical in helping a student reestablish the
emotional equilibrium necessary for academic success.
<P>
This guide is designed to assist you in working with students in
distress. Counseling Center staff members
are available to offer further consultation.
<center>
<H2>Recognizing Distressed Students</H2>
</center>
At one time or another, everyone feels depressed or upset.
However, when some of the following signs are present the student
is probably in distress.

<H3>Unusual Behavior</H3>
<UL>
<LI> withdrawal from usual social interaction<BR>
<LI> unwillingness to communicate<BR>
<LI> inability to sleep or excessive sleeping<BR>
<LI> loss of appetite or excessive appetite<BR>

<LI> dissatisfaction with academic major<BR>
<LI> unrealistic educational aspirations<BR>
<LI> confusion about interests, abilities, or values<BR>
<LI> chronic indecisiveness or choice conflict<BR>
</UL>
<center>
<h2>What Can You Do?</H2>
</center>
The options you choose depend upon the urgency of the situation.
For students who are having difficulty but seem able to cope
fairly well, you may choose not to intervene, to limit your
interaction to the classroom issue, or to deal with it on a more
personal level. If you judge a situation to be more urgent or an
emergency, you might decide that more active and timely
involvement on your part is appropriate.
<P>
If you choose to approach a student, or if a student seeks you
out for help with personal problems, here are some suggestions
that might make the situation more comfortable for you and
helpful for the student.
<UL>
<LI> Talk to the student in private when both of you have time. Give
  the student your full attention.<BR>

<LI> Listen to the thoughts and feelings in a sensitive, non-
  threatening way. Let the student know you hear by repeating
  back the gist of what the student has told you.<BR>

<LI> Be specific regarding the behaviors that have raised your
  concerns, and avoid making generalizations, criticizing, or
  judging (e.g., "I noticed you've been absent from class lately
  and I'm concerned" rather than "Where have you been lately?
  Goofing off? Being lazy?").<BR>
   
<LI> Work with the student to clarify options and the costs and
  benefits of each option.<BR>
</UL>
<center>
<H2>When Should You Make a Referral?</H2>
</center>
Even though a student asks for help with a problem and you are
willing to help, some circumstances may indicate that you should
suggest that the student use other resources. For example: The
problem or request is one you know you can't handle...you believe
that personality differences will interfere with your ability to
help...you know the student personally (as a friend, neighbor,
relative) and think you could not be objective enough to
help...the student is reluctant to discuss a problem with
you...after working with the student you find that little
progress has been made...you feel overwhelmed, pressed for time,
or at a high level of stress yourself.

<center>
<H2>How Do You Make a Referral?</H2>
</center>
When you have decided that a student might benefit from
professional counseling, it is usually best to express your
recommendation in a straightforward, matter-of-fact manner. Make
it clear that this recommendation represents your best judgment
based on your observations of the student's behavior. Be specific
regarding the behavior that has raised your concerns and avoid
making generalizations or attributing anything negative to the
individual's personality or character.
<P>
Except in an emergency, the option must be left open for the
student to accept or refuse counseling. If the student is
skeptical or reluctant for whatever reason, simply express your
acceptance of those feelings so that your own relationship with
the student is not jeopardized. Give the student room to consider
alternatives by suggesting that perhaps you can talk after the
student has had some time to think it over. If the student
emphatically says "No," respect the decision and again leave the
situation open for possible reconsideration later.
<P>
Once the student has agreed that counseling might be useful,
there are several possible steps to take, depending on the
urgency of the situation and how committed the student is to
following through on the referral.<P>
<OL>
<LI>Give the student information about the Counseling Center and urge the student to call for an
   appointment.<BR>

<LI>Offer to let the student call from your office right then so
   that a public commitment will have been made.<BR>

<LI>Accompany the student yourself to ensure that the student
   arrives at the Center and to provide the necessary
   information. The Center would appreciate your calling ahead if 
   a student is being brought over or sent directly in an
   emergency, so that plans can be made to have a counselor
   available.<P>
</OL>

<strong>In emergency situations involving students who are unwilling or
unable to seek help on their own, faculty and staff members may
call the Counseling Center at 862-7493.</strong>
<P>
For any referral whether accepted or not, follow up with the
student later to show your continuing interest.
<P>
<center>
<H2>What Happens at the Counseling and Student Development Center?</H2>
</center>
Once the student contacts the Counseling and Student Development
Center, an appointment is made for an initial interview. This is
usually within a few days from the time of contact. In an
emergency, the student is seen that day.
<P>
During the student's first visit to the Counseling Center, information forms are completed. These can be
waived in emergencies. During the first appointment, a counselor
assesses the student's needs and the ways the Counseling Center might be able to help. Options the
counselor considers include individual counseling, groups or
workshops, or referral to private or community counseling services.
Some students may leave the initial appointment feeling able to
handle their concerns without further assistance.
<P>
If the student and counselor agree that individual counseling is
appropriate, a series of appointments may be scheduled. The Center
offers up to twelve individual sessions per academic year to
students. Typically, students need four or five sessions with a
counselor. At busy times of the year, it may be two weeks or so
before regular appointments begin. Students are encouraged to keep
in touch if their level of distress increases prior to scheduled
appointments. 
<P>
Students need to know that services provided at the Counseling
Center are free and confidential.
Information is released only with a student's written permission.
This means that a counselor cannot discuss the student's situation
with the faculty member unless the student provides written
permission.  Faculty are encouraged to contact the student and ask
them if they saw a counselor and how it went. Exceptions to
confidentiality may occur if there is of clear danger to self or
others or in the case of court-ordered subpoenas.

<center>
<H2>Additional Consultation Is Available to You</H2>
</center>

If you have concerns and questions about a student, staff members
at the Counseling Center are available to
help you:
<OL>
<LI>Assess the situation, its seriousness, and potential 
   referral.<BR>

<LI>Learn about resources, both on- and off-campus, so you can
   suggest the most appropriate help when talking with the
   student.<BR>

<LI>Learn the best way to make a referral if appropriate.<BR>

<LI>Clarify your own feelings about the student and consider the
   ways you can be most effective.<BR>
</OL>

<center><h2><b>Can You Laugh Your Stress Away?</b></h2></center>
<center><h3><b>By Dr. Sandy Sarrro, Staff Psychologist, Manhattan College Counseling Center*
</b></h3></center><hr>

<p>Did you know that, in India, a growing number of  people join Laughing Clubs?  Members
gather early every morning in public parks to laugh, breath and laugh some more. They claim to
feel better and experience fewer illnesses since joining the clubs.  Sounds a little silly to us
Americans, doesn't it? 

<p>But research may back the jocular club members up!
<ul>
<li>Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, claimed in the late 1980s to have
     laughed away a life-threatening form of arthritis by watching hour after hour of Marx
     Brothers movies and Candid Camera episodes;
<li>William Fry of Stanford, found that 100 laughs is the aerobic equivalent of 10 minutes on
     a rowing machine;
<li>Loma Linda University (California) researcher Lee Berk found that subjects watching
     funny videos had significant increases in various measures of immune function when he
     compared them to controls who did not watch funny videos.  He believes laughter is a
     state of "eustress" which is psychology-speak for the opposite of "distress." ( Much
     research links distress, or chronic stress, with lowered immune functioning and chronic
     illness.);
    <li>A SUNY/Stony Brook Medical College study by Arthur Stone found higher levels of
     antibodies which fight flu and cold viruses among men who reported more positive social
     interaction such as laughing and playing with children than among men who reported
     having more negative social events such as arguments or conflicts with a boss;
<li>Another study found the entire cerebral cortex (the outer layer of the brain) is involved
     when people laugh. The researcher at the College of William and Mary suggests that
     mirth stimulates the brain's pleasure centers which could then boost the immune system;
<li>   Another study at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, found that the above-mentioned
     health benefits  seem to occur in those who can laugh at themselves and/or who can laugh
     under stressful situations;
<li>   While a few studies found no statistical link between laughter and health, more are
     pointing toward positive effects of laughter on longevity,  immunity, and freedom from
     symptoms of illness
</ul>
<p>So, the conclusion seems to be, the more you laugh, the happier you are and the healthier you'll
be.  And that's no joke!  

<p>Here are some ideas on how to:
              <center>      <h3><b>Get In The Humor Habit </b></h3></center>
<ul>
<li><b>Turn off the TV and be sociable:</b> People laugh 30 times more often in a social setting than
     when alone. SO get together with friends, play a game, invite some neighbors over.
<li>    <b>Learn something new:</b> try something you might not be great at, preferably with someone
     you like.  You and your friend could be in hysterics as you each try to maintain your
     balance on roller blades or try to interpret each other's first artistic attempt in a painting
     class!
<li>   <b>Choose your friends carefully:</b>  A friend with whom you always laugh is a treasure.
     Unload the duds and cultivate the gems.
<li> <b>Don't be lazy: </b>Too many people don't bother to try and be funny. It's so easy to be dull.
     Make the extra effort. When talking with friends or classmates, don't just get to the point,
     noodle a bit along the way. Illustrate anecdotes with sound effects or Jim Carey-like
     facial expressions!  Make wisecracks or blurt out non sequiturs. To keep your comic
     juices flowing, make yourself a reminder - a silly comic strip on your door or a funny
     joke penned on your notebook.
<li>   <b>Cultivate running jokes:</b> When you find yourself in a moment of shared hilarity, milk it.
     Work it into a conversation or an E-mail message the next day.
<li>   <b>Master the art of comic complaining: </b>Poke fun at yourself, exaggerate and overstate! 
     Think of all the comedians, such as Howie Mandel or Rosie O'Donnell, who have based
     their careers on gripes and groans;
<li>  <b>Share the joke:</b> When you hear or read something funny, pass it along and laugh all over
     again;
<li>  <b>Get a Pet;</b> David Letterman hit a goldmine with his Stupid Pet Jokes for a reason. Dogs
     and cats crack people up. And you don't have to train them.  Have you ever watched a
     dog try to find a tossed snowball that's disappeared in a snowbank? Or a cat with its head
     stuck in a paper bag?
<li>  <b>Start the day with a laugh.</b> Instead of CNN or the weather channel with your  a.m. coffee,
     try a dose of the Roadrunner or Bugs. Fifteen minutes of looniness can set your mood on
     silly for the day!
</ul>
<p><h3><b>Now that you're on the road to a funnier you, have I told you the one about the three
psychologists and a lightbulb? </b></h3>

<html><title>Speakers Anxiety</title>
<body><H1>Welcome<BR>
The Manhattan College Counseling Center<BR>
BRIEF ARTICLES about MENTAL HEALTH Topics Homepage<BR></H1>
<h2>Phone 718-862-7394<BR>

The Counseling Center is in Room 501 Miguel Hall</h2><br>
<p><hr>      
<center><H1><b>Speakers Anxiety</b></H1></center><hr>
  Ever experienced the signs of "Speakers anxiety:" Sweaty
  palms, dry mouth, shortage of breath, accelerated heartbeat, anxiety, and
  fear. These signs may begin right before your presentation, hours or days
  before it, or even at the moment you find out about it; and they can persist
  during your presentation or talk. Sometimes they make it impossible for you to
  do a good job. Most of the students that suffer from speakers anxiety feel
  and/or think that it is almost impossible to get rid of. However, there is
  hope. Most of the experienced speakers know today what they did not know then,
  which is how to fight and overcome this type of anxiety. These speakers have
  learned how to transform fear into confidence and self-control; and you can
  learn, too. In this article we will review the steps they have gone through in
  order to make a good presentation. These steps are: <ol>
<li>Before your
  presentation/talk<li> Taking care of yourself<li> Beginning your presentation<li>During your presentation<li> After you are done with your presentation.</ol>
<p>  The following description of these steps contain some of the techniques you
  can use to develop self-confidence and a powerful speaker ability.
  
  <p><h2><b>1) BEFORE YOUR PRESENTATION/TALK.</b></h2>
 
  <p><i>Think about your classmates/audience.</i>
 
 <p> Are you going to present in front of a small or a large group? Do you know
  their backgrounds or interests? Learning about them would help you to become
  more relaxed; and tailor your presentation to that particular group.
  
  <p><i>Research your subject/topic.</i>
 
  <p>Even if you know your subject/topic, get more information about it. Doing this
  would help you to feel more confident, and would enable  you to answer more
  questions.
  
  <p><i>Writing down your presentation</i>

  <p>Writing your talk will help you prepare yourself. You can have this material in
  front of you if you decide to read your presentation to your audience. Even if
  you decide not to read it, it will be there in case you get lost and need to
  get back "on track".
  
 <p> <i>A step ahead.</i>
 
  <p>If you want to deliver a better presentation, develop an outline of the
  headline and main ideas from your written presentation. Then, avoid reading
  and use the outline for your presentation. Trust me, your audience will not
  only be  grateful, but more interested in what you have to say. In addition,
  you may have noticed that most good speakers do not read their presentations,
  even though they started that way.
  
  <p><i>Number and staple together all pages of your presentation.</i>

  <p>Remember, most podiums are not horizontal, the air conditioner unit might blow
  stronger in that area, and you may become a little more clumsy when
  presenting. Numbering and stapling your presentation, or its outline, will
  help you put it back together again in case something happens.
  
  <p><i>Use <h3>LARGE </h3>and <b>bold </b>type.</i>
  
  <p>One of my friends always types his presentations in large and bold print, with
  wide spaces between the lines, so he can see them easily. This also helps him
  to rapidly spot where he is, after making a pause, or even when he gets lost.
  I think he is a pretty smart person.
  
  <p><i>Use your capacity of "As if."</i>
 
 <p> Picture yourself "as if" you are in front of your classmates/audience and
  rehearse your presentation out loud. Rehearsing will allow you to evaluate and
  improve your presentation, as well as practice your gestures and other non-
  verbal elements. Do not forget to time yourself.
  
  <p><i>Tape yourself.</i>
  
  <p>Tape your rehearsal and check the content, pace, and length (time) of your
  presentation. By listening to yourself you can find out what is OK and what
  needs to be changed. Organize the rest of your work accordingly.
  
  <p><i>Rehearse in front of others.</i>

  <p>Ask a friend or classmate you trust to critique your presentation. This person
  can help you identify the strengths and weaknesses of your presentation and
  provide some helpful advice. (Do not forget to be open and not to take any
  criticisms in a personal way; you want to do better, not to lose a friend.) If
  you cannot do this, practice in front of a mirror. Several of my students have
  confided to me that it really helps.
  
 <p> <i>Have some "comebacks" ready.</i>
 
  <p>Even experienced speakers can lose their place in the middle of a
  presentation. The reason they do not freeze is that they have some "comebacks"
  ready to fill the gap and allow them time enough to return to what they were
  saying. These "comebacks" can be anecdotes, short comments, or even jokes 
  that you can throw into your presentation when you need it.
  
<p><i>  Highlight interesting details.</i>

  <p>In the same way you highlight key elements when reading, verbally point out
  key elements during your presentation. Interesting and entertaining elements
  add spice to your talk, and make it more powerful.
  
  <p><i>Coach yourself.</i>
  
  <p>Talk to yourself. Tell yourself what you are doing right and motivate yourself
  to practice what still seems to need some improvement. Avoid telling yourself
  what you do not want to happen. Emphasize what you want to do, not what you
  want to avoid. Use statements such as "I will do my best," instead of "I will
  not be nervous".
  
  <p><i>Think "catastrophically".</i>
  
  <p>What do you think is the worst that can happen? Having to request a delay
  because you have to run to the bathroom? Noticing some tremor in your voice?
  Skipping a section of your presentation? Not being able to talk because of
  your dry mouth? And what do you think your audience would do? Would some of
  them leave the room? Would they laugh at you? Think about it. You may be
  investing too much energy worrying that some of these things may happen.
  Chances are they would not. And even if they do happen you now you can do
  something about each of them. You can go to the bathroom, you can take a deep
  breath and relax, you can realize that everybody may miss a part of their
  talk, and all these will change for the better with practice. And regarding
  your audience, remember, there is always the possibility of somebody leaving
  the room or laughing during a presentation, even if the presenter is doing a
  good job.
  
  
 <h2><b> 2) TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF.</b></h2>

 <p> <i>Talk to yourself.</i>
 
  <p>Continue your coaching. Tell yourself that you can make it, and that you have
  something important to say to your classmates/audience. Think about this
  presentation as another step in your road to self-confidence and self-control.
  
<p> <i> Get enough rest before your presentation.</i>

  <p>If your presentation is in the morning, get enough sleep the night before. If
  it is during the day, take enough time to rest before presenting. The more
  relaxed you are, the higher the chances to do a good job. The more tired or
  exhausted you are, the higher the chances to get nervous and make  mistakes.
  
<p> <i> Do not abuse food or beverages.</i>

  <p>People that I know postpone drinking and eating until after their
  presentation. This helps them to prevent any stomach discomfort, and at the
  same time, use food and beverages to reward themselves for a job done. Notice
  that they do not say "for a job well done," the important point is rewarding
  yourself according with your level of progress. If you are just starting, you
  deserve a reward for just giving a presentation! It does not matter how good
  or bad it was. The important point is that you were brave enough to do it.
  
 <p> <i>Do not use alcohol or any other drugs.</i>
 
  <p>Avoid alcohol, as well as other drugs always, and especially before your
  presentation. These substances could not only produce damage over time, but
  they can also impair your capacity to do your presentation now.
  
<p> <i> Dress for success.</i>

  <p>Your appearance will affect the way people feel about you. Find out about the
  dress code in the situation you will be presenting and dress accordingly. Find
  a balance between a distinctive outfit for that particular setting, and one
  that will help you feel relaxed.
  
<p> <i> Use physical relaxation.</i>

<p>If you know how to relax, practice it. If you do not know how to do it, learn
  to relax before your next presentations. One of the best ways I know to relax
  uses tensing and relaxing each of the major muscle groups in your body. Tense
  them very tightly. Then gently relax your muscle. This simple exercise can
  calm your body and relax strained muscles. If you want to know more about
  relaxation, use the Relaxation, or the Breathing Techniques screens in this
  program. Biofeedback is also a useful way to learn to relax.
  
 <p> <i>Use handouts.</i>
 
  <p>Figures, tables, or other summative information are always useful. They make
  you look good, grab peoples' attention, and can help you to collect your
  thoughts or calm down if you must pause.
  
 <p> <i>Find a safe position.</i>
 
  <p>If your hands shake when holding your outline, find support in the podium. If
  you feel more comfortable behind a table, take that place. In a sense,
  position yourself in any reasonable way that helps you feel more secure.
   
  <p><i>Bring your own "stress-saver."</i>
  
  <p>Use a pointer, or a pen, or anything that you can hold and/or grasp during
  your presentation. This object can serve as a personal "support," as well as
  an outlet for your stress.
  
  <p><i>Check the equipment.</i>
  
  <p>Check your overhead or slide projector ahead of time. Try the equipment two or
  three times. Make sure you know how to use them. If this sounds like too much,
  I can tell you I have seen upside-down slides way too many times. Check to
  make sure you have enough chalk. Make sure that the audience will be able to
  see what you are seeing.
  
  
 <h2><b> 3) BEGINNING YOUR PRESENTATION.</b></h2>
  
  <p><i>Gain supporters even before your presentation.</i>
  
  <p>Talk to one or more of your classmates or friends in the room. Tackle the
  monster head-on. The more people you meet before your presentation, the easier
  it will be for you to see them as a friendly group.
  
 <p> <i>Present yourself.</i>
 
  <p>Give your name and the title of your presentation before moving on. Making
  some introductory remarks about yourself and about the topic you will be
  presenting usually produces a more relaxed feeling in your audience. Even
  making some positive remarks about your classmates/audience can help in the
  same way.
  
 <p> <i>Use a powerful opener.</i>
 
  <p>Start with a relevant story, relevant statistics, or an important question.
  These will set the stage for your presentation, getting people's attention and
  interest.
  
<p>  <i>The question of Self-awareness.</i>

 <p> Keep in mind that you are more aware of yourself than anybody else in the
  room. More often than not listeners miss your nervousness. The tremors that
  seem so obvious to you are rarely noticed by your audience. The less attention
  you pay to your own signs, the more easily they go away.
  
  
  <h2><b>4) DURING YOUR PRESENTATION.</b></h2>
 
  <p><i>Speak clearly. </i>
  <p>Do not eat your words. Enunciate clearly. During your practices, check for the
  correct pronunciation of specific words. If you cannot pronounce them
  correctly, choose a synonym.
  
  <p><i>Use rhythm and drama.</i>
  
  <p>Go slowly. Pause when appropriate. Change your voice volume to emphasize
  important points. Spice up your talk with some dramatic silences.
  
 <p><i> Breathe in and out.</i>
  
  <p>Sounds like silly advice! Well, one of the most common difficulties speakers
  experience is maintaining a normal breathing pattern. Usually, they lose their
  air as they talk, finishing their last phrases gasping for air. A way to
  prevent this is learning some of the breathing methods described in the
  Breathing Techniques screen.
  
  <p><i>Release the tension of your shoulders</i>.
  
  <p>I have named this tension the "hanger syndrome" because it feels as if you are
  wearing your shirt or jacket with the hanger still on. Relax your shoulders
  before and during your presentation. The closer your shoulders are to your
  ears, the more tension you feel in your neck and the back of your head, and
  the more anxious you feel. The exercise to release this tension involves
  exaggerating it. Take your shoulder even closer to your ears, hold that
  tension for a moment, then relax. Repeat two or three times. This way, you can
  learn how it feels when your shoulders are relaxed, and work to keep them that
  way in the future.
  
 <p> <i>Be brave, look at people.</i>
  
  <p>I have had several discussions with people who lecture. Some of them advise
  staring at people during your presentation and some prefer to make no visual
  contact. My choice is to make eye contact with the persons in the room. I
  think looking at people helps you to overcome your anxiety over time and keeps
  them attentive!
  
 <p> <i>Let the tremor in your voice come in and go out.</i>
 
 <p> Everybody's voice will show some tremors from time to time. Tremors are
  unavoidable. Whenever they happen, change to a slower pace, breathe more
  deeply, and let the tremor go away by itself.
  
  <p><i>Move around.</i>
 
 <p> You cannot be standing up and sitting down at the same time.  By the same
  token, you cannot be moving and freezing at the same time. Moving around will
  calm you down!
  
  <p><i>Make your point.</i>
 
 <p> Deliver the best information you can, and make your point(s). Let people know
  the results of your research by stating your main point(s) clearly. They are
  there to learn, so let your audience learn something from you.
  
  
  <p><i>Intersperse colorful details.</i>
 
  <p>Introduce interesting details now and then, throughout your entire
  presentation. Colorful details will engage people's attention.
  
  <p><i>Lighten up.</i>
  
  <p>Remember the song "...keep loose when things get tight..." No matter what kind
  of problem you run into, or what kind of mistake you can make, as long as you
  are in control of yourself you will be able to do something about it.
  
  <p><i>Use a powerful end.</i>
  
  <p>Finish with a relevant summary, a clever closing remark, or an important
  question. These will round out your presentation.
  
 <p> <i>Have fun!</i>
 
 <p> I know this "ain't gonna" happen at first. But, if you use some or all the
  techniques described here, you get to the point of having fun doing your
  presentation. The audience is there to learn, and you have something they can
  learn from. If you do a good job your audience will appreciate it, and you
  will enjoy the experience.
  
  <h2><b>5) AFTER YOU ARE DONE WITH YOUR PRESENTATION.</b></h2>
 
<p> <i> Leave room for questions.</i>

  <p>Save some time for questions. As long as you do not take them in a negative
  way, questions can help you to restate, correct, or clarify some point(s).
  What about not having questions? You can come up with one of your own (one
  that you can brilliantly answer!) or you can use that time to thank your
  classmates/audience.
  
  <p><i>Reward yourself.</i>
  
 <p> Whether you did well or not, reward yourself for doing, and surviving your
  presentation! You deserve it.
  
 <p><i> Later on.</i>
 
  <p>Evaluate your performance. Find out what you did right and save it for the
  next time. Then, focus on what did not work. Do not dwell on the mistakes you
  might have made. You are supposed to make some mistakes. Use them as a guide
  for what needs to be improved. Work on improving them over time.
  <h3><b>
  <p><i>REMEMBER.</i>
 
  <p>Remember the old saying, "Practice makes perfect." But do not forget that, as
  my friend Jeff Zeig use to tell me, "even a perfect presentation should have a
  perfect mistake."
  </b></h3>

<center>                <h2><b>Why Do People Kill Themselves </b></h2> </center><hr>
                                

     <p>The common link among people who kill themselves is the belief that suicide is the only
solution to a set of overwhelming feelings.  The attraction of suicide is that it will finally end
these unbearable  feelings.  The tragedy of suicide is that intense emotional distress often blinds
people to alternative solutions... yet other solutions are almost always available.  We all
experience feelings of loneliness, depression, helplessness, and hopelessness, from time to time. 
The death of a family member,  the breakup of a relationship, blows to our self-esteem, feelings
of worthlessness, and/or major financial setbacks are serious which all of us may have to face at
some point in our lives.  Because each person's emotional makeup is unique, each of us responds
to situations differently.  In considering whether a person may be suicidal, it is imperative that
the crisis be evaluated from that person's perspective.  What may seem of minor importance to
someone else - and an event that may be insignificant to you can be extremely distressful to
another.  Regardless of the nature of the crisis, if a person feels overwhelmed, there is danger that
suicide may seem an attractive solution.  

                      <center>  <h3><b> Danger Signals  </b></h3></center>
  <p>   At least 70 percent of all people committing suicide give some clue as to their intentions
before they make an attempt.  Becoming aware of these clues and the severity of the person's
problems can help prevent such a tragedy.  If a person you know is going through a particularly
stressful situation - perhaps having difficulty maintaining a meaningful relationship, having
consistent failure in meeting preset goals, or even experiencing stress at having failed an
important test- watch for other signs of crisis.  

  <p>   Many persons convey their intentions directly with statements such as "I feel like killing
myself," or "I don't know how much longer I can take this."  Others in crisis may hint at a
detailed suicide plan with statements such as "I've been saving up my pills in case things get
really bad," or "Lately I've been driving my car like I really don't care what happens."  In general,
statements describing feelings of depression, helplessness, extreme lone-lines, and/or
hopelessness may suggest suicidal thoughts. It is important to listen to these "cries for help"
because they are usually desperate attempts  to communicate to others the need to be understood
and helped.  

   <p>  Often persons thinking about suicide show outward changes in their behavior.  They may
prepare for death by giving away prized possessions, making a will, or putting other affairs in
order.  They may withdraw from those around them, change eating or sleeping patterns, or lose
interest in prior activities or relationships.  A sudden, intense lift in spirits may also be a danger
signal, as it may indicate the person already feels a sense of relief knowing the problems will
"soon be ended."  

                   <center> <h3><b>  Myths about Suicide </b></h3></center> 
<ul>
<li><p>MYTH: "You have to be crazy even to think about suicide."  
<p>FACT: Most people have thought of suicide form time to time.  Most  suicides and suicide
attempts are made by intelligent, temporarily  confused individuals who are expecting too much
of themselves,  especially in the midst of a crisis.  
<p> 
<li><p>MYTH: "Once a person has made a serious suicide attempt, that person is unlikely to
make another."  
<p>FACT: The opposite is often true.  Persons who have made prior suicide attempts may be at
greater risk of actually committing suicide; for  some, suicide attempts may seem easier a second
or third time.  
  <p>
<li><p>MYTH: "If a person is seriously considering suicide, there is nothing you can do."   
<p>FACT: Most suicide crises are time-limited and based on unclear thinking. Persons attempting
suicide want to escape from their problems.  Instead, they need to confront their problems
directly in order to find other solutions - solutions which can be found with the help of concerned 
individuals who support them through the crisis period, until they  are able to think more clearly.  
 <p>
<li><p>MYTH: "Talking about suicide may give a person the idea."  
<p>FACT: The crisis and resulting emotional distress will already have  triggered the thought in a
vulnerable person.  Your openess and concern in asking about suicide will allow the person
experiencing  pain to talk about the problem which may help reduce his or her anxiety.  This may
also allow the person with suicidal thoughts to  feel less lonely or isolated, and perhaps a bit
relieved.  
 </ul> 
                        <center><h3><b>How You Can Help  </b></h3></center>
   <p>  Most suicides can be prevented by sensitive responses to the person in crisis.  If you think
someone you know may be suicidal, you should:  <ul>
<li>*   Remain calm.  In most instances, there is no rush.  Sit and listen - really listen to what the
          person is saying.  Give understanding and active emotional support for his or her feelings. 
          
<li>  *  Deal directly with the topic of suicide.  Most individuals have mixed feelings about death
     and dying and are open to help.  Don't be afraid to ask or talk directly about suicide.
  <li>*  Encourage problem solving and positive actions.  Remember that the person involved in
     emotional crisis is not thinking clearly; encourage him or her to refrain from making any
     serious, irreversible decisions while in a crisis.  Talk about the positive alternatives which
     may establish hope for the future.  
  <li>*  Get assistance.  Although you want to help, do not take full responsibility by trying to be
     the sole counsel.  Seek out resources which can lend qualified help, even if it means
     breaking a confidence.  Let the troubled person know you are concerned - so concerned
     that you are willing to arrange help beyond that which you can offer.  
</ul>
 <p> UCLA suicide prevention experts have summarized the information to  be conveyed to a
person in crisis as follows:  
 <i><b> "The suicidal crisis is temporary.  Unbearable pain can be survived. Help is available.  You
  are not alone." </b></i><hr>

<title>Managing Time</title>
<body><H1>Welcome<BR>
The Manhattan College Counseling Center<BR>
BRIEF ARTICLES about MENTAL HEALTH Topics Homepage<BR></H1>
<h2>Phone 718-862-7394<BR>
Fax 718-862-7321<BR>
The Counseling Center is in Room 501 Miguel Hall</h2><br>
<p><hr>      

<Center>  <b><h2>Time Management:  Getting Those Assignments Done</h2></b></center><hr>
      <p> Do you find that there are not enough hours in the day? 
  Are you often doing assignments at the last minute?  Do you
  ever receive grades knowing that you would have done better
  if you hadn t crammed?  If you answered  yes  to any of
  these questions, then reading this article on time
  management skills may help.  The following paragraphs will
  first review some beliefs which may interfere with effective
  time management.  Secondly, steps toward managing your time
  will be outlined, concluding with some helpful hints.<br>
 <h3><u><b>Damaging beliefs</b></u></h3>
      <p> The first belief that may effect time management
  negatively is the belief that your life is controlled only
  by external events.  This belief can be damaging because it
  encourages you not to take responsibility for your actions
  and their consequences.  The fact is, is that you have
  control over many aspects of your life and you don t have to
  rely on external events (such as deadlines) to motivate you.<br>
     <p>  Another potentially harmful attitude is that you should
  meet everyone s expectations.  Others  expectations may lead
  to unnecessary anxiety.  Besides, other people s
  expectations may not be appropriate for you or may be coming
  from a different priority than your own.<br>
     <p>  The last damaging belief is that you should have no
  limits.  Perfectionism can be harmful in that this leads to
  an impossible task--you can never meet your standards.  This
  denies you the feeling of accomplishment and feeling good
  about yourself.  Realistic and attainable goals increase the
  likelihood of success and reward you for doing your work.<br>
  <u><b><h3>Organizing your time</h3></b></u>
     <p>  There are three major steps in organizing your time. 
  The first is to establish priorities, the second is to
  analyze your time, and the third, and most complex, is to
  schedule your study time.  Establishing your priorities
  involves making a simple list which is a result of some hard
  thinking.  Be honest with yourself.  If your list is
  different than you feel it  ought  to be, ask yourself why. 
  Perhaps talk it over with friends or, if you feel strongly
  that your priorities need adjustment, make an appointment at
  the College Counseling Center (862-7394) .<br>
       <p>After you have listed your priorities, analyze, as
  precisely as possible, how much time you need for classes,
  studying, etc. Estimate the amount of sleep you need per
  week, the number of hours spent in class, and the number of
  hours you need to study every week.  Add this total amount
  and subtract it from 168 (there are 168 hours in a week). 
  This amount is the leftover time for work (e.g. work study),
  socializing, and other miscellaneous tasks (e.g. laundry). 
  For example, you may sleep 56 hours/week, attend classes 15
  hours/week, and study 45 hours a week (this estimate assumes
  you study on average three hours/week for every credit, with
  a 15 credit course load).  This would leave 52 hours for
  free time, etc.  <br>
      <p> Finally, you make out a time schedule.  This might
  involve using a blank schedule with the days of the week
  across the top of the page and the times across the left
  side.  The following advice will help you schedule your
  time.  First, study difficult material first, when you re
  most alert.  Second, leave routine tasks for last.  Third,
  study for a particular course close to the time you attend
  that class.  Fourth, take a break between each subject. 
  Fifth, take breaks after 60 minutes of study time, in
  general.  Sixth, schedule separate blocks for each
  topic/subject.  Seventh, be aware of your biological clock,
  for example, are you a morning person?  Do you study best
  right after a meal?  Eighth, be aware of your environment,
  for example, will you be near a good study area at the time
  that you re planning on studying?  Ninth, set aside some
  time to review and revise your schedule--your schedule will
  not be the same each week and you ll need time to plan these
  weekly changes.  Finally, write down an "A," "B," or "C"
  next to the planned activity to indicate which are related
  to your high priorities ("A") or which are related to your
  lower priorities ("C").  When you review your timetable,
  take note to how much time has been assigned to each and
  adjust the schedule accordingly.<br>
  <b><h3>    <u>Here are some tips which may help you</u></h3></b>
 <p>  Use the phone,
  rather than going to the office.  Use spare moments (e.g. to
  review index cards).  Learn to combine some activities.  Use
  lists (to-do lists, grocery lists, whatever!).  Make sure
  you reward yourself for your progress.  And last, but
  certainly not least, be aware of your physiology.  Are you
  hungry?  Are you tired, or sick?  These tips and the above
  steps should help you begin your quest towards managing your
  time effectively.       <br>

<p><hr>      
          <CENTER>          <b><h2>TIME MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES</h2></b></Center><hr>

    <p> Time management is frequently mentioned as one of the tools a
person can use to reduce stress.  This article will help survey
some of the techniques of effective time usage.<br>

  <p>   <u>A few questions may help you assess your time management
skills. </u>
<ul>
<li>Do you have a written list of clearly defined lifetime
goals and goals for the next six months?  <li>Do you set priorities
according to importance, not urgency? <li>Do you force yourself to
make minor decisions quickly? <li>Do you force yourself to make time
to plan? <li>Do you make periodic use of a time log to determine if
you are slipping into unproductive routines? <li>Have you discontinued
unproductive routines or activities recently? <li>Are you really in
control of your time?  <li>Are your actions determined primarily by
you, not by circumstances or by other people's priorities?
</ul>
   <p>  After answering these questions, the next step should be a
survey of how you are using your time now.  On a sheet of paper for
three columns:  one for Waking--Noon, the second, Noon--Dinner, the
third, Dinner--Sleep.  Keep daily lists of your activities and the
amount of time spent in each during those three time periods. 
Review the lists after a week, looking at how much time you spend
on studies, socializing, eating, exercising, watching TV, etc. <br>
<p>Next, on another sheet of paper, 


                                 
take your list and force your activities into three areas: high-,
medium-, and low levels of importance.  Then cross out the medium
area, forcing that list into either high or low.  Use this process
frequently to check on how you are using your time, whether your
are focusing on primarily high or low priority tasks.<br>

    <p> Ask yourself some questions after this review: 

<ul>
<li>Which
activities are the most productive?  the least?  <li>How much of each
day is simply lost, through frittering hours away, interruptions,
etc?  <li>How much time is spent on improvement or innovation? <li>How
much on maintenance and fire fighting?  <li>What should the proportions
be?  <li>When the pressure comes for better results, do you fall back
on old routines or analyze what is really needed?
</ul>
     <p>Often managing time means learning how to make time.  Here are
a few suggestions:  
<ol>
<li>Protect your prime time; determine your best
times of day and schedule high priority tasks in prime time, low
priorities in your worst time <li>Learn to say no <li>Defer or
delegate low priority items<li>Build time into your schedule for
delays<li>Set aside time for quiet relaxation<li>keep a list of
short five minute tasks to be done "between things"<li>Reduce or
avoid television viewing time<li>Throw away as much mail as
possible<li>Stop perfectionism<li>Work form a TO DO list, have
a plan<li>Block escape routes when you have 


                                 
high priority items:  stop socializing, put away unimportant tasks,
don't run out of food, forget errands that can be run later<li>Cut off non-productive activities as soon as possible
</ol>
   <p>  In managing your time remember a few rules of thumb:  
<ul>
<li>Cut your
losses and run<li>Don't stay with a bad TV show thinking it will get
better<li>Choose social occasions carefully and know who you really
want to spend time with<li>Consider whether you come away energized
or drained<li>Try to plan for interruptions<li>Schedule your
availability and unavailability<li>Don't handle trivia, while
keeping the job on hold<li>Attack the most important project first
thing in the morning<li>By 11:00 a.m. you'll feel you've done a
day's work<li>Plan your day, or it will be planned for you</ul>
<h3><b><i>Remember, also, the reason for time management is not to shoehorn
more tasks into your day, but to get the most important tasks done--leaving more time to do what you want.</i></b></h3>

<body>Being successful at the university level will probably require a more careful and effective
utilization of 

time than the student has ever achieved before.  He is typically scheduled for fifteen or more
hours of 

classroom work per week, in addition, he is expected to average about two hours of preparation
for each 

hour in the classroom.  This means that he has at least a forty-five hour work week and is
consequently 

involved in a full-time occupation!  Many students find that this full-time job must be
supplemented by 

other part-time jobs and/or family and social responsibilities which add a great deal more time. 
A 

common student complaint, therefore, is that there is just not enough time to go around.<P>

<P>

The job of being a university student, like most other jobs, can be carried out either efficiently or 

inefficiently.  The way we use time (or waste it) is largely a matter of habit patterns.  One of the
best 

techniques for developing more efficient habits of time use is to prepare a time schedule. 
Research 

psychologist and efficiency experts can produce impressive statistics demonstrating the
efficiency of a 

well-organized time schedule.  The work habits of people who have achieved outstanding
success 

invariably show a well-designed pattern or schedule.  When a person has several duties
confronting him 

simultaneously he often will fail to do any of them.  The purpose of scheduling is not to make a
slave of 

the student, but to free him from the scholastic inefficiency and noncomitant anxiety that is, at
least 

partially, a function of wasted time, inadequate planning, hasty, last minute study, etc.<P>

<P>

The most successful system for most students is to combine long-range and short-range planning. 
thus, a 

student can make a general schedule for an entire quarter and then prepare a more specific plan
for two or 

three days a week at a time.<P>

 <P>

<b><h4>LONG-RANGE SCHEDULE:   Some suggestions for developing a long-range strategy - i.e., a
quarter 

schedule.</h4></b><P>

<HR>

<H5>1.   PLAN ENOUGH TIME FOR STUDY.</H5>

The University expects a student to average about two hours in studying (including library work, 

term papers, themes, etc.) for each hour spent in the classroom.  This is an appropriate and 

realistic guideline.  A genuinely high ability student may get by adequately with less.  However, 

many students would do well to plan for somewhat more than the two-for-one ratio.<P>

<P>

<H5>2.   STUDY AT THE SAME TIME EVERY DAY.</H5>

In so far as possible, a student should schedule certain hours which are used for studying almost 

every day in a habitual, systematic way.  Having regular hours at least five days a week will
make 

it easier to habitually follow the schedule and to maintain an active approach to study.<P>

<P>

<H5>3.   MAKE USE OF THE FREE HOURS DURING THE SCHOOL 

DAY.</H5>

The hours between classes are perhaps a student's most  valuable study time yet, ironically, the 

most  frequently misused.  A student may effectively utilize these hours reviewing the material 

and editing the notes of the preceding class and/or studying the material to be discussed in the 

following class.<P>

<P>

<H5>4.   PLAN STUDY PERIODS TO FOLLOW CLASS PERIODS. 

</H5>

This should be done whenever possible.  The next best procedure is to schedule the period for 

study immediately preceding the class.  A student should specify the particular course he will 

study rather than just marking "study" on his schedule.<P>

<P>

<H5>5.   SPACE STUDY PERIODS.</H5>

Fifty to ninety minutes of study at a time for each course works best.  Relaxation periods of ten
or 

fifteen minutes should be scheduled between study periods.  It is more efficient to study hard for
a 

definite period of time, and then stop for a few minutes, than attempt to study on
indefinitely.<P>

<P>

<H5>6.   PLAN FOR WEEKLY REVIEWS. </H5>

At least one hour each week for each class (distinct from study time) should be scheduled. The 

weekend is a good time for review.<P>

<P>

<H5>7.  LEAVE SOME UNSCHEDULED TIME FOR 

FLEXIBILITY.</H5>

This is important!  Lack of flexibility is the major reason why schedules fail.  Students tend to 

over-schedule themselves.<P>

<P>

<H5>8.  ALLOT TIME FOR PLANNED RECREATION, CAMPUS AND  

CHURCH ACTIVITIES., etc.</H5>

When a student plans his schedule, he should begin by listing the activities that come at fixed 

hours and cannot be changed.  Classes and laboratories, eating in the dorm dining hall, sleep, 

and work for money are examples of time uses which the student typically cannot alter.  Next, he 

can schedule his flexible time commitments.  these hours can be interchanged with other hours if 

he finds that his schedule must be changed during the week.  Recreational activities are planned 

last.<P>

<b><i>When forced to deviate from his planned schedule (and that will invariably occur), the student 

should trade time rather than steal it from his schedule.  Thus, if he has an unexpected visitor at 

a time he has reserved for study, he can substitute an equal amount of study time for the period 

he had set aside for recreation.</i></b><P>

<center><H2><b>PROCRASTINATION:  TEN WAYS 

TO "DO IT NOW"</b></H2></center>
<hr>
<P>

     We've all been plagued by procrastination at one time or another.  For some, it's a chronic problem.  

Others find that it hits only some areas of their lives.  The net results, though, are usually the same - 

wasted time, missed opportunities, poor performance, self-deprecation, or increased stress.<P>

     Procrastination is letting the low-priority tasks get in the way of high-priority ones.  It's socializing 

with colleagues when you know that important work project is due soon, watching TV instead of doing 

your household chores, or talking about superficial things with your partner rather than discussing your 

relationship concerns.<P>

     We all seem to do fine with things we want to do or enjoy doing for fun.  But, when we perceive tasks 

as difficult, inconvenient, or scary, we may shift into our procrastination mode.  We have very clever ways 

of fooling ourselves.  See how many of the following excuses hit home for you:<P>

<UL>

<UL>

<LI>I'll wait until I'm in the mood to do it.

<LI>It's OK to celebrate ... besides, I'll start my diet (sobriety) tomorrow.

<LI>My health problem isn't that bad.  Time will heal this pain.

<LI>There's plenty of time to get it done.

<LI>Why does the boss give us so much to do?  It's not fair.

<LI>It's too hard to talk about.  I don't know where to begin.

<LI>I work better under pressure so I don't need to do it right now.

<LI>I've got too many other things to do first.

</UL>

</UL>

<P>

     Once exposed, these self-defeating statements don't sound so convincing.  But, when we privately tell 

ourselves these excuses, they seem quite believable.  Don't be fooled by how innocent they sound.  They 

get us to postpone important tasks and duties.<P>

<P>

<H4>CAUSES</H4>

     Procrastination is a bad habit.  Like other habits, there are two general causes.  The first is the 

"crooked thinking" we employ to justify our behavior.  The second source is our behavioral patterns.<P>

     A closer look at our crooked thinking reveals three major issues in delaying tactics - perfectionism, 

inadequacy, and discomfort.  Those who believe they must turn in the most exemplary report may wait 

until all available resources have been reviewed or endlessly rewrite draft after draft.  Worry over 

producing the perfect project prevents them from finishing on time.  Feelings of inadequacy can also cause 

delays.  Those who "know for a fact" that they are incompetent often believe they will fail and will avoid 

the unpleasantness of having their skills put to the test.  Fear of discomfort is another way of putting a 

stop to what needs to be done.  Yet, the more we delay, the worse the discomforting problem (like a 

toothache) becomes.<P>

     Our behavioral patterns are the second cause.  Getting started on an unpleasant or difficult task may 

seem impossible.  Procrastination is likened to the physics concept of inertia - a mass at rest tends to stay 

at rest.  Greater forces are required to start change than to sustain change.  Another way of viewing it is 

that avoiding tasks reinforces procrastination which makes it harder to get things going.  A person may be 

stuck, too, not by the lack of desire, but by not knowing what to do.  Here are some things to break the 

habit.  Remember, don't just read them, do them!<P>

<P>

<H4>REMEDIES</H4>

1. <b> Rational Self-Talk. </b> Those old excuses really don't hold up to rational inspection.  The "two-column 

technique" will help.  Write down all your excuses on one side of a piece of paper.  Start challenging the 

faulty reasoning behind each of the excuses.  Write down your realistic thoughts on the opposite side of 

each excuse. Here are two examples of excuces and realistic thoughts.<P>

EXCUSE:  I'm not in the mood right now.

REALISTIC THOUGHT: Mood doesn't do my work, actions do.  If I wait for the right mood, I 

may never get it done.



EXCUSE::I'm just lazy.

REALISTIC THOUGHT: Labeling myself as lazy only brings me down.  My work is really 

separate from who I am as a person.  Getting started is the key to finishing.







<P>

2.  <b> Positive Self-Statements</b>.  Incorporate a list of self-motivating statements into your repertoire of 

thoughts.  Consider ...<P>

<UL>

<UL>

<UL>

<LI>"<i>There's no time like the present."
</i>
<LI>"<i>The sooner I get done, the sooner I can play."</i>

<LI><i>"There's no such thing as perfectionism.  It's an illusion that keeps me from </i>

<LI><i>doing what I have to do right now."</i>

<LI>"<i>It's cheaper and less painful if  I do it now rather than wait until it gets worse."
</i>
</UL>

</UL>

</UL>

<P>

3.  <b>Don't Catastrophe</b>.  Jumping to the conclusion that you will fail or that you are no good at something 

will only create a wall of fear that will stop you cold.  Recognize that your negative predictions are not 

facts.  Focus on the present and what positive steps you can take toward reaching your goals.<P>

<P>

4.  <b>Design Clear Goals.  </b>Think about what you want and what needs to be done.  Be specific.  If it's 

getting that work project completed by the deadline, figure out a time table with realistic goals at each 

step.  Keep your sights within reason.  Having goals too big can scare you away from starting.<P>

<P>

5. <b> Set Priorities. </b> Write down all the things that need to be done in order of their importance.  The greater  

the importance or urgency, the higher their priority.  Put "messing around" (distractions) in its proper 

place - last!  Start at the top of the list and work your way down.<P>

<P>

6.  <b>Partialize the Tasks.</b>  Big projects feel overwhelming.  Break them down into the smallest and most 

manageable subparts.  You'll get more done if you can do it piece by piece.  For example, make an outline 

for a written report before you start composing or do a small portion of the chores rather than all at once.  

Partializing works especially well with the unpleasant jobs.  Most of us can handle duties we dislike as 

long as they're for a short time and in small increments.<P>

<P>

7.  <b>Get Organized. </b> Have all your materials ready before you begin a task.  Use a daily schedule and have 

it with you all the time.  List the tasks of the day or week realistically.  Check off the tasks when you have 

completed them.<P>

<P>

8.  <b>Take a Stand. </b> Commit yourself to doing the task.  Write yourself a "contract" and sign it.  Better still, 

tell a friend, partner, or supervisor about your plans.<P>

<P>

9.  <b>Use Prompts. </b> Write reminders to yourself and put them in conspicuous places like on the TV, 

refrigerator, bathroom mirror, front door, and car dashboard.  The more we remember, the greater the 

likelihood we'll follow through with our plans.<P>

<P>

10.  <b>Reward Yourself.</b>  Self-reinforcement has a powerful effect on developing a "do it now" attitude.  

Celebrate, pat yourself on the back, smile, and let yourself enjoy the completion of even the smallest of 

tasks.  Don't minimize your accomplishments.  Remember, you're already that much closer to finishing 

those things that need to be done.  Go ahead, get started ... NOW!<P>

     <center>             <h2><b>Overcoming Procrastination </b></h2></center>


<p>     Procrastination technically refers to t<i>he avoidance of a specific task or work which needs
to be accomplished.</i>  But this technical explanation doesn't begin to capture the emotions
triggered by the word.  For  most of us, the word "<i>procrastination"</i> reminds us of past
experiences where we have felt guilty, lazy, inadequate, anxious, or stupid -- or some
combination of these.  It also implies a value judgment: if you procrastinate, you are bad, and as
such, you lack worth as a person.  <br>

                 <h3><b>Procrastination and Its Causes</b></h3>

     <p>In order to understand and solve your procrastination problems, you must carefully
analyze those situations where your work is not being completed.  First, determine whether the
cause is poor time management.   If so, you will need to learn and develop time management
skills.  If, however, you know how to manage your time but don't make use of those skills, you
may have a more serious problem.<br>
  
<p>Many individuals cite the following reasons for avoiding work:  
<ul>
<li> <b>LACK OF RELEVANCE</b>.  If something is neither relevant nor meaningful to
          you personally, it may be difficult to get motivated even to begin.  
     <li><b>ACCEPTANCE OF ANOTHER'S GOALS.  </b>If a project has been imposed or
          assigned to you and it is not consistent with your own interests, you may be
          reluctant to spend the necessary time to see it to conclusion. 
     <li><b>PERFECTIONISM.</b>  Having unreachable standards will discourage you from
          pursuing a task.  Remember, perfection is unattainable, at least in this world!
     <li><b>EVALUATION ANXIETY. </b> Since the way that other people respond to your
          work is not under you direct control, overvaluing these responses can create the
          kind of anxiety that will interfere with work getting accomplished. 
     <li><b>AMBIGUITY. </b> If you are uncertain of what is expected of you, it may be
          difficult to get started.  
    <li><b>FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN.</b>  If you are venturing into a new realm or field,
          you don't have any way of knowing how well you'll do.  Such an uncertain
          outcome may inhibit your desire to begin.   
    <li><b>INABILITY TO HANDLE THE TASK</b>.  If through lack of training, skill, or
          ability you feel that you lack the personal resources to do the job, you may avoid
          it completely.  
</ul>  
               <h3><b>Procrastination Takes Many Forms  
</b></h3>
     <p>Once you have surmounted the emotional block (guilt, anxiety, feelings of inadequacy)
by acknowledging your procrastination, and after you have analyzed the underlying causes, you
need to clearly specify how you procrastinate.  Each person is different.  Consider the following
examples.<br>
<ol>
<li>Do you act as though if you ignore a task, it will go away?  The mid-term exam in
               your chemistry class is not likely to vaporize, no matter how much you ignore it.  
  <li>Do you underestimate the work involved in the task, or overestimate your abilities and
     resources in relationship to the task?  Do you tell yourself that you grasp concepts so
     easily that you need only spend one hour on the physics problems which would normally
     take you six?  
<li>Do you deceive yourself into believing that a mediocre performance or lesser standards
     are acceptable?  For example, if you deceive yourself that a 3.3 GPA will still get you
     into the medical school  of your choice, you may be avoiding the decision to work harder
     to improve your grade point average and thus may have to alter your career plans.  This
     form of avoidance can prevent you from consciously making choices about important
     goals in your life.   
 <li>Do you deceive yourself by substituting one worthy activity for another?  Suppose you
     clean your room or do laundry instead of writing your term paper.  Valuing a clean room
     and having clean laundry is fine but if that value only becomes important when there is a
     paper due, you are procrastinating.  
<li>Do you believe that repeated "minor" delays are harmless?  An example is putting off
     writing your paper so you can watch five minutes of your favorite television program.  If
     you don't return to writing the paper after five minutes have elapsed, you may stay tuned
     to the television for the entire evening, with no work being done on the paper.  
  <li>Do you dramatize a commitment to a task rather than actually doing it?  An example is
     taking your books on vacation but never opening them, or perhaps even declining
     invitations for pleasurable events, but still not pursuing the work at hand nor getting
     needed relaxation.  This way you stay in a constant state of unproductive readiness to
     work without ever working!
<li>Do you persevere on only one portion of the task?  An example is writing and rewriting
     the introductory paragraph of the paper but not dealing with the body and the conclusion. 
     The introductory paragraph is important, but not at the expense of the entire project.  
<li>Do you become paralyzed in deciding between alternative choices?  An example involves
     spending so much time deciding between two term paper topics that you don't have
     sufficient time to write the paper.  
</ol>  
                <b><h3> What To Do About Procrastination</h3></b>
  <p>   If you can visualize yourself in one or more of these vignettes, you may be ready to
overcome your problems with avoidance or procrastination.  The following is a list of additional
steps which may help you to deal with your avoidance problems:  <br>
<ol>
<li>Extract from the above examples those principles which apply to you.  Write them down.  
<li>Make honest decisions about your work.  If you wish to spend only a minimal amount of
     effort or time on a particular task, admit it.  Do not allow guilt feeling to interfere with
     your realization of this fact.  Weigh the consequences of various amounts of investment
     in a project and find the optimal return for your investment.  This step exposes intentional
     reasons for avoiding work.  If you have been unintentionally avoiding work, admit to
     yourself that you do want to achieve certain goals and accept the responsibilities involved
     in meeting those goals.  
<li>Work to acquire an adequate understanding of what is necessary to accomplish a task
     within a given time frame.    

<li>Distinguish between activities which dramatize your sense of commitment and those
     which will help you accomplish the task.  Devote only that amount of time which is
     appropriate for each part of a task.  Develop an overview of the entire project and
     visualize the steps that are needed to reach completion.  
  </ol>
                       <h3><b>Effective Planning</b></h3>
     <p>The larger and more involved the project, the more difficult it is to plan effectively to
carry it out.  The following steps may be helpful:<br>
 <ol>
<li>Segment the task, break it down to sma
ller parts.  The entire job may seem impossible,
     but smaller segments may seem more manageable.  Divide the task into small steps.  
<li>Distribute the small steps reasonably within the given time frame.  "Reasonably" is the
     key word; you must give yourself sufficient time for each step.  Do not fool yourself by
     believing you can do more than is humanly possible.  
<li>Realize that humans periodically need variety and relaxation.  Intersperse rewards,
     relaxation, and gratification for work completed.  This will help you feel less resentful of
     the task and the work that still needs to be done.  
  <li>Monitor your progress on the small steps.  Watch for the pitfalls discussed earlier.  Assess
     problems when they arise and do something about them quickly.  Keep track of the
     segments and how they fit together to form the whole picture.  Reassess time
     commitments as necessary.  
  <li>Be reasonable in your expectations of yourself.  Perfectionistic or extremely strict
     expectations may cause you to rebel or may sabotage your progress.  </ol>
                 <h2><b>     Need Additional Help?</b></h2>

 <center>             <h2><b>Coping with Summer Vacation  </b></h2></center><hr>
  

<p>     While summer vacation can be relaxing times for sleeping in, eating home-cooked meals, and
seeing old friends; for many students it may fall significantly short of the romanticized image.  Issues
that students often face can be discussed under three different headings: <br><ul>
<li>Family and Home<li>Work<li>
Social Life and Recreation. </ul> <br> 
  <center>      <h3><u>Family and Home</u></h3></center>
    <p> Even the best families occasionally must struggle with such matters as divergent
expectations and changes in family members.  When returning home from college a period of
readjustment is natural and normal.  After a year away, you likely  have changed from the person
you were before.  Sometimes parents feel threatened by such changes, feeling a loss of control,
fear of the student's new independence, or devalued in their parental role.  These struggles need
not become rifts in the family; if talked about with mutual caring and respect, they can become the
basis for a more mature and equal relationship.  Thus, your own natural development can
contribute to your parents' growth as they face the inevitable challenge of finding fulfillment in
shifting roles.  <br> 
                                
  <center>                            <h3><u>Work</u></h3></center>

<p>Looking for a job, whether it be for the summer or after graduation, is a rite of passage.  This rite,
which is part of the passage into adulthood, challenges us to demonstrate who we are and what
we know to strangers.  We also face the task of maintaining our self-esteem and sense of
perspective in the face of evaluation and possible rejection.  Although summer employment
0perhaps is less an indication of one's social status and success than a career job, it is easy to
become caught up in the process of finding the perfect summer position  One way to avoid the
roller-coaster cycles of expectation and disappointment is to keep in mind that every loss or
closed door is also an opportunity.  Obstacles teach us to become more resilient, flexible, and
creative - qualities whose value will last far longer than the three months of summer.  Even
unemployment can teach us such lessons as humility and valuing the moment, and instill in us
confidence in our ability to survive our worst fears.  The next time you face with a disappointed
expectation, you might ask yourself:  what opportunities does this leave open?  You might
surprise yourself by what you discover.  <br>
<center>                   <h3><u>Social Life and Recreation</u></h3></center>
<p>     It may seem to defy common sense to say that some of us struggle more with having free
time than with being obsessively busy.  And yet, the sudden lack of structure that accompanies
extended vacations poses a real challenge for many students.  Some students even experience
depression, as personal problems that were submerged by the demands of school and work
suddenly rise to the surface.  Since we are raised in a system that tends to organize our time for
us, many of us have not learned to structure our time in ways that are personally meaningful. 
Leaving new friends behind and discovering  that old friends have moved or changed, can also
leave us facing a social vacuum at home.  Again, while this loss may be frustrating and painful;  it
also presents us with opportunities, such as discovering new interests, stretching ourselves
socially, or letting ourselves explore the places and activities we have secretly fantasized about. 
And remember:  no one holds us back as much as ourselves. <br>
 <center>                       <b><h3><b>A final note </b></h3></b></center>
     If family problems or personal struggles become too much, there are likely some resources
nearby to help you.  Crisis lines, job boards, recreation programs, and counseling agencies exist in
many communities.  If you are looking for a professional therapist, you might start by calling the
county mental health agency, crisis line, or local college counseling center for a referral.  
     The Counseling Center offers individual counseling as well as information about, and
referral to, other campus and community resources.  For more information or to schedule an
appointment, call the Counseling Center at (718) 862-7394.  All appointments are strictly
confidential.

<CENTER><h2><b>I Have No Time</b></h2></center>
<HR>
<TABLE>
<TR></TD><TD><DD>Although there are a number of successful ways students can manage their time we would like to share at least one way of approaching things:</TD><TH COLSPAN=4 ROWSPAN=3 ALIGN=left></TH></TR></TR>
<TR><TD><DD>First, we are strongly oppose late night marathon study sessions (cramming) on a routine basis. We believe for most it is much more effective to split up the day whenever possible into two (2 - 2 <SUP>1/2</SUP> hr.) sessions, ideally one during the day between classes when possible and the other after dinner in the evening.  This will vary from day to day, sometimes needing more or less time but in general it works pretty well with minor adjustments.  Sometimes it is difficult to get a 2 - 2 <SUP>1/2</SUP> hour block during the daytime because of classes but with some fine tuning and adjustments it will usually work out.</TD>
<TR><TD><DD>Something students should avoid is going to class all day, participating in an extracurricular activity, going to dinner, hanging out with friends until about 10 pm and then sitting down to do homework for four hours, at a time when there are usually few help sources available.  For most people this will cause burnout and there really is no time to relax before going to sleep each evening.  There is also plenty of time to do work on the weekends; we have found that late Saturday and Sunday mornings seem to be a good time for homework as well as Sunday nights.</TD></TR>
<TR><TD><DD>Secondly, it is important to find a place that's conducive for you to study.  The important word there is <Font Color=#800080>you</FONT>.  Some people might need total silence when they study; while others prefer music playing for example.  Some people feel their room is the best place while others think the Library is where they get their best studying done.  The bottom line is to find out what works for <Font Color=#800080>you</FONT> and follow it.  Do not worry about how other students do their studying. We have provided a list of study tips that may help you.</TD><TH COLSPAN=4 ALIGN=left></TH></TR>
<TR><TD ROWSPAN=8><DD>Thirdly, it is important to develop a chronological list of what is due and when it is due for all classes combined either on a piece of paper, in a daily planner, or electronically.  People often have a tendency to write down assignments on the back of envelopes or little scraps of paper without any order.  If all assignments are written in one place in chronological order, students get to see their overall assignment picture and they always know what is due next.  Why is this important?  If you always know what is due next and you do assignments chronologically you will not fall behind in your work and you will have a clear picture at all times of where you stand vis--vis your assignments.  We wish we could tell you that you can always add things on the bottom of your list but the fact of the matter is sometimes you'll get assignments that don't fall to the bottom of the list chronologically and you have to make adjustments and fit them in their appropriate place on the schedule.  This is not always easy but eventually, if you are organized, you make these sometimes difficult adjustments. </TD><TD COLSPAN=4><FONT SIZE=-1><I>The following chart gives you a good understanding of how much time you need to plan for school each semester. The general rule of thumb is that for every credit hour you take, you need to plan to spend two hours of studying outside of class time.</I></FONT></TR>

<TR><TD><DD>Again, there are any number of variations regarding how students manage their time.  The aforementioned is one that we know has worked here at Rensselaer for many of our students.  Other help services or individuals might give you other ideas but the important thing is to develop a routine that works for you and to stick with it. Just as an athlete has a game plan in preparation for the game, so should a student have a game plan to approach his/her studies.  If we can help anyone work out a plan that works for them or if you would like additional detail about the information we have provided please contact us and we would be happy to assist you.</TD><TH COLSPAN=4><TT><Font Color=#800080 SIZE=+1>"develop a routine that works for you and stick with it"</Font></TT></TH></TR>
<TR><TD ROWSPAN=15 VALIGN=top><DD>When planning out your weekly time requirements, it's a good idea to include all of your time commitments, such as for sleeping, athletic practices, working, and eating. Start off with 168 hours in a week and deduct the total time required for each commitment. This will give you a general idea of how much time is left for for everything else (hanging out with friends, watching television, partying). An example is shown at the right.</TD><TH COLSPAN=3><FONT SIZE=-1>WEEKLY TIME COMMITMENTS</FONT></TH></TR>

hosted by the Society of Black Engineers at Purdue University in April 1975  Black engineering 
students from the United States and Canada attended the event. From the meeting of concerned 
students and educators, NSBE was born. In 1976, NSBE was incorporated as a non-profit 
corporation in the State of Texas. NSBE also became recognized as a tax-exempt organization 
under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.<BR>

<H3>Latest WRCM Developments: </H3>

<HR>

<H3><IMG SRC="news.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Cable FM? (Dec '95) </H3>

<P>
As many people on campus know, WRCM currently only broadcasts
to the cafeterias in Thomas Hall. Well, recent developments may
suggest otherwise. Under the guidence of newly appointed Director
of Student Activities, Elane White, WRCM is attempting to upgrade
its transmission from carrier current AM, to a system known as
Cable FM. The Cable FM system uses coaxial cable and transmitts
a crystal clear stereo signal, which would be a tremendous improvement
over the outdated carrier current signal that is know being employed
by the station. Under Cable FM, not only would the quality of
the sound be increased, the WRCM signal would be able to picked
up anywhere on campus. This would put WRCM where it should be:
in the rooms of everyone on campus!!!
<HR>

<H3><IMG SRC="news.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Times available (Dec '95)
</H3>

<P>
WRCM will now be heared in Plato's Cave from 7:30 AM until 4:30
PM. At 4:30 PM WRCM can be heared in Locke's Loft. The Leo Engineering
building which had WRCM brroadcasting to the cafeteria last semester
is experiencing some technical difficulties. We hope to have this
up and working by the intersession.

<H3><A NAME="OLE_LINK2"><IMG SRC="news.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A>Benefit
Concert (Dec '95) </H3>

<P>
The Benefit concert for Part of the Solution held on Saturday
Oct. 28 proved to be a success. Organized by board member Chris
Trivino, the concert featured five bands performing live in Plato's
Annex. The bands who performed included C.R., Three Steps Up,
Halfman, Millhouse and Stripped Bastards. This is the second consective
semester in which such a benefit concert was organized by WRCM.
Part of the Solution is a charity organization that helps provide
food and shelter to the homeless of the Bronx.

<H3><IMG SRC="news.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Upcoming Events (Mar '96)
</H3>

<P>
The following are some of the events WRCM has planned for the
following 2 &#189; months:
<UL>
<LI>Coffehouse in Thomas Hall - open mike format, co-sponsored
possibly with Manhattan Magazine, and the Quadrangle.
<LI>Program Guide (see State of the Station (3/7/96) - coming
soon to the Quadrangle, and other places around campus.
<LI>Appearance at Springfest - WRCM will be at spring fest in

<LI>Senior coffehouses - WRCM DJ's most of the Senior Coffeehouses.
They usually take place on a Wednesday night in Thomas Hall. Proof

<LI>WRCM stickers - WRCM stickers are in the process of being
made, if you are a DJ, and you want an official WRCM sticker,
ask for them at the next WRCM general meeting.
<LI>WRCM T-shirts - depending on what is left in the WRCM budget,
T-shirts may be a possibility for the DJ's, more info on this
as the semester edges on. 
</UL>
<HR>
<H3><IMG SRC="news.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM">WRCM gets WIRED! (May '96)
</H3>
<P>This past week, WRCM finally was rewired in Jasper and Chrysostym Halls.  The result of this is that for the first time in about 4 years, WRCM can be heard on 850 AM.  Plans are underway to bring WRCM to Overlook and East Hill.

            CHAPTER 1: WELCOME TO VIRUSSCAN
            
            Thank you for purchasing McAfee(R)'s VirusScan(TM)
            software, a powerful and advanced system
            designed to detect, eradicate, and prevent
            computer viruses. VirusScan will help you
            protect one of your most important assets--the
            information on your personal computer or local
            area network.
            
            VirusScan includes two main programs:
            
            o The Scan program detects known viruses in your
              computer's memory or on disks. It can also
              detect new and unknown viruses. Once viruses
              are detected, it can remove them and restore
              your system to normal operation. The Scan
              program comes in two forms:

              o A graphical interface so that you can select
                commands and options using a mouse and
                keyboard, if you like. For instructions,
                see the on-line documentation.
              
              o A command line interface, so you can run the
                program and select options by typing from a
                command prompt or from batch or script files,
                if you prefer.

            o The VShield(TM) memory-resident program
              continuously monitors and protects your
              system from viruses that might be introduced.
            
            The VirusScan programs run on IBM-PC or 100%
            compatible personal computers (PCs) that use
            DOS, Windows, or OS/2.
            
            VirusScan is an important element of a
            comprehensive security program that includes a
            variety of safety measures, such as regular
            backups, meaningful password protection,
            training, and awareness. We urge you to set up
            and comply with such a security program in your
            organization. For tips on how to do this, see
            "Other sources of information" in this chapter.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             2
            
            HOW TO USE THIS MANUAL
            
            This manual will help you get VirusScan running
            quickly and properly on DOS, Windows, and OS/2
            systems.
            
            All the key information is in Chapter 2, "Don't
            skip this chapter." Please don't install
            VirusScan before reading it, even if you are a
            PC power user or already familiar with Scan.
            Installing and using VirusScan is not like using
            other software.
            
            The rest of Chapter 1, "Welcome to VirusScan,"
            describes the programs and files on your
            VirusScan disk, system requirements, how to
            register, and how to get help.
            
            Chapter 3, "Scan Reference," and Chapter 4,
            "VShield Reference," contain reference
            information for Scan and VShield, respectively.
            Many users will not need to read these chapters,
            because basic operation of VirusScan, as
            described in Chapter 2, will detect and remove
            most viruses from your system. The options
            described in Chapters 3 and 4 offer additional
            power and control, and are most useful in
            vulnerable environments and to network
            administrators and information services staff.
            
            Chapter 5, "Tips & troubleshooting," explains
            how to get the most out of VirusScan, and how to
            cope with some common problems.
            
            Appendix A describes how to retrieve new
            versions of McAfee programs using your
            communications software.
            
            Appendix B describes differences in command line
            options between VirusScan version 1.5 and
            version 2.1.1.

            WHAT VIRUSSCAN INCLUDES
            
            In addition to Scan and VShield, your VirusScan
            diskette contains another program that will help
            you use VirusScan. The Validate program ensures
            that new versions of VirusScan software you've
            obtained are authentic and unmodified.
            
            Your VirusScan diskette also contains several
            useful text files, which you can view and print
            with a text editor, word processor, or print
            command. You'll find version-specific
            information in the README.1ST file.

            personal computer and any of the following
            operating systems:
            
            o DOS 3.1 or later 

            o Windows 3.1 or later

            o IBM OS/2 2.1 or later

            VShield is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
            program. VShield attempts to minimize the use of
            conventional memory by loading into expanded,
            extended, or upper memory. For more information,
            see "VShield Reference" in Chapter 4.
            
            You'll need a high-density 3.5" diskette drive
            to use the VirusScan diskette in this package.
            Contact McAfee for other media, or download the
            software from the McAfee bulletin board system
            (BBS).

            CHAPTER 2: DON'T SKIP THIS CHAPTER
            or, What You Really Need to Know About VirusScan.
            
            We're serious about this. Installing and running
            the VirusScan(TM) programs is not like using
            other software. Even if you are a personal
            computer power user, use the VirusScan
            installation procedure and follow the tasks in
            this chapter.
            
            The reason is to avoid spreading a computer
            virus infection. Viruses spread when you start
            your computer (sometimes called booting) from an
            infected disk, or when you run an infected
            program. If your computer is infected,
            installing and running VirusScan on your hard
            disk may spread the infection, even to the
            VirusScan programs themselves. The tasks in this
            chapter will ensure that you have a clean
            environment to detect, eradicate, and prevent
            viruses.
            
            This is like a surgical team establishing a
            "sterile field" before performing surgery. Once
            it is established, they make sure that
            everything brought into the field has already
            been sterilized. In this procedure, you will
            create a clean anti-viral start-up diskette with
            which you can always re-establish the sterile
            field.
            
            Your VirusScan diskette is write-protected to
            ensure that no virus can alter the programs and
            information stored there. Under no circumstances
            should you remove the write protection.
            
            Here's a summary of the tasks you'll follow in
            this chapter:
            
            o Installing VirusScan
            o Scanning your system.
            o If you detect a virus.
            o Activating VShield(TM).
            o Making a clean start-up (boot) diskette.
            o Running the VirusScan programs.
            o When to scan for viruses.
            o Updating VirusScan regularly.

            
            
            
            

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             11
            
            INSTALLING VIRUSSCAN

            This task explains how to check your system and install the
            VirusScan software under DOS, Windows, or OS/2 using the 
            install program. For instructions on installing downloaded 
            software, see Appendix A.

            Don't use any other method to install VirusScan, or 
            you risk spreading a virus.
            
            INSTALLATION STEPS

            Start from the system prompt (C:\> or [C:\]). If you are
            running Windows or an application program, exit from it to
            display the prompt. If you are running OS/2, close all DOS
            and Win-OS/2 sessions. Open the Command Prompts folder in the
            OS/2 System folder, and click on either the OS/2 Full Screen
            or OS/2 Window icon.

            NOTE: See Appendix A for additional instructions for 
            setting up WScan and VShield under Windows.

            1. Create a directory to contain the VirusScan files, as
               in the following example:

                    C:\> mkdir c:\mcafee

               and press <ENTER>. 

               If you have an earlier version of VirusScan already
               installed, create a separate directory (such as 
               c:\newvscan) for the new version. (You should test 
               the new version before removing the earlier version.)

            2. Copy the VirusScan archived (.ZIP) file to this 
               directory, as in the following example:

                    C:\> copy c:\download\*.zip c:\mcafee

               and press <ENTER>.

            3. Change to the VirusScan directory you just created,
               as in the following example:

                    C:\> cd c:\mcafee

               and press <ENTER>.






           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             12
            
            4. Unzip the file using PKUNZIP.EXE, as in the following
               example:

                    C:\mcafee> PKUNZIP *.ZIP

               and press <ENTER>.
            
            5. Run VirusScan to check your local hard disk(s) by
               typing:

                    c:\mcafee> scan /adl

               and pressing <ENTER>. It may take several minutes
               for the Scan program to check for viruses in memory,
               then on the system and user portions of your drives.
               Scan keeps you informed of its progress. Read the
               information carefully, and write down the name of any
               viruses Scan reports.

            6. If Scan reports no virus found, congratulations--
               most likely your system is currently virus-free. 
               Continue with "Making a Clean Start-Up Diskette" 
               in this chapter.

               If Scan finds one or more viruses, you'll see a message like:
               
                    Found the Jerusalem Virus

               and installation will stop. Don't panic, even if the
               virus has infected many files. At the same time, don't
               run any other programs, especially if the virus is
               found in memory. Go directly to "If you detect a virus"
               later in this chapter for further instructions.

            7. Create a directory on your hard disk to store the
               VirusScan files in by typing:

                    C:\> mkdir mcafee

               and pressing <ENTER>.

            8. Copy the VirusScan files from the 'VirusScan Program
               Diskette' in drive A: to your hard disk by typing:

                    C:\> copy a:\*.* c:\mcafee
               
               and pressing <ENTER>.  VirusScan has now been installed
               onto your hard disk.  Now your system's startup files
               must be modified to find VirusScan on your system.

            9. DOS and Windows users: Using a text editor program, 
               load your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Locate the path statement,
               which typically begins with a 'PATH' or 'SET PATH ='
               statement.  Place your cursor at the end of this line
               and type:

                    ;C:\MCAFEE

               and press <ENTER>.  Now save your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and
               exit the editor.

               NOTE: If a semi-colon ";" is already present at the end
                     of the line, do not add one to the path statement.

               OS/2 users: Make the same change listed above to the
                           'SET PATH=' and 'SET LIBPATH=' statements in
                           your CONFIG.SYS file. Now save your CONFIG.SYS
                           file and exit the editor.

            Congratulations! You've successfully installed VirusScan.
            Restart your computer now and continue with this chapter to
            see how you can use VirusScan to keep your computer virus-
            free. We recommend looking over the following sections in
            this chapter:

            o "Scanning Your System"
            o "If You Detect A Virus"
            o "Activating VShield"
            o "Making A Clean Start-Up Diskette"

            Continue with the remaining tasks in this chapter, beginning
            with "Running the VirusScan Programs" to find out how and
            when to run and update the VirusScan programs.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            



           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             14
           
            SCANNING YOUR SYSTEM
            
            VirusScan's Scan program examines your PC and
            disks to detect viruses there. The first time
            you run Scan, do so from the original, write-
            protected diskette so that the programs
            themselves cannot be infected.
            
            Start from the system prompt (C> or [C:\]). 
            If you are running Windows or an application
            program, exit from it to display the prompt. If
            you are running OS/2, close all DOS and Win-OS/2
            sessions; then open the Command Prompts folder
            in the OS/2 system folder, and click the OS/2
            Full Screen or OS/2 Window icon.
            
            After typing each entry on the command line,
            press [Enter]. If you include the /REPORT
            option, Scan saves a report of infected files
            and any system errors to a log file that you
            specify.

            1. Insert the VirusScan program diskette in drive A.

            2. Scan your C drive for known viruses by typing:

               DOS or Windows
                    C> a:scan c: /report c:\virus.log
               
               OS/2 
                    [C:\] a:os2scan c: /report c:\virus.log
            
               Or, if you have more than one hard drive, scan
               them in the same way. For example, if you have C
               and D drives:
            
               DOS or Windows
                    C> a:scan c: d: /report c:\virus.log
            
               OS/2
                    [C:\] a:os2scan c: d: /report c:\virus.log
            
               You can also scan all local drives using the
               /ADL option. For example:
            
               DOS or Windows

               It may take several minutes for the Scan program
               to check for viruses in memory, then on the
               system and user portions of your drives. Scan
               keeps you informed of its progress. Read the
               information on the screen carefully. Below is a
               sample of what Scan reports when checking a
               drive for viruses.

            3. If Scan reports No viruses found,
               congratulations--most likely your system is
               currently virus-free. Skip to "Activating
               VShield" later in this chapter.

               If Scan finds one or more viruses, you'll see a
               message like:

               DON'T PANIC, even if the virus has infected many
               files. At the same time, don't run any other
               programs, especially if the virus is found in
               memory. Turn to "If you detect a virus" later 
               in this chapter, where VirusScan will help you 
               eradicate it.
            
            NOTE: Scan has many options to control and fine-
            tune the scope, validation, and operation of its
            scan. For details, see Chapter 3 and "Detecting
            new and unknown viruses" in Chapter 5.

            IF YOU DETECT A VIRUS
            
            In this task, you will run Scan with the /CLEAN
            option to eradicate most known viruses from your
            disks.
            
            NOTE: If you are at all unsure about how to
            proceed once you've found a virus, contact
            McAfee for assistance (see "Technical support"
            in Chapter 1).
            
            We strongly recommend that you get experienced
            help in dealing with viruses if you are
            unfamiliar with anti-virus software and methods.
            This is especially true for "critical" viruses
            and master boot record (MBR or so-called
            "partition table")/boot sector infections,
            because improper removal of these viruses can
            result in the loss of all data and use of the
            infected disks.
            
            RESTART FROM A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT
            
            You must run Scan from a clean, virus-free
            environment. With DOS or Windows, restart from a
            clean diskette. With OS/2, simply close all DOS
            and Win-OS/2 sessions.
            
            DOS OR WINDOWS
            
            With DOS or Windows, the only way to ensure a
            clean environment is to turn your computer off
            to eliminate any viruses in memory, then restart
            from a virus-free diskette, preferably the
            original, write-protected DOS installation
            diskette that came with your computer. If you
            don't have one, borrow or buy one; don't use a
            diskette that might be infected. (See "Making a
            clean start-up diskette" later in this chapter
            for instructions. Create this diskette after you
            clean your system.)
            
            1. Turn off your computer. (Don't just reset or
               reboot, which may leave some viruses intact
               in the computer's memory.)








           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             17
            
            2. Make sure your clean boot (start-up) diskette
               is write-protected.

               o For a 3.5" diskette, slide its corner tab so
                 that the square hole is open.

               o For a 5.25" diskette, cover its corner notch
                 with a write-protect tab. Be sure to use the
                 write-protect stickers provided with your
                 diskettes, not tape.
            
            3. Insert your start-up diskette in drive A.

            4. Turn on your computer and wait until you see
               the system prompt (probably A>). Don't run
               any programs on your hard disk, or you may
               reactivate the virus.

            OS/2
            
            With OS/2, you can eliminate viruses from memory 
            by closing all DOS, Win-OS/2, and virtual DOS 
            machine (VDM) sessions. 
            
            BACK UP YOUR HARD DISK
            
            Some viruses may leave certain disks or files
            unusable when cleaned up. To increase your
            chance of recovery, boot from a clean copy of
            the operating system, then copy all the files on
            all of your hard disks onto fresh diskettes or a
            backup tape. You can use a commercial backup
            program, or the one included with DOS or OS/2.
            Scan the program disk first to make sure that
            the backup program itself is not infected. Do
            not run the backup program if it is infected.
            Instead, reload it from your original
            installation diskettes.
            
            Although some of the backed-up files may be
            infected, it is better to have current copies
            than not. However, don't overwrite previous
            backup disks or tapes, which may or may not be
            infected.

            RUN SCAN WITH THE /CLEAN OPTION
            
            Start from the system prompt (probably A> or
            [A:\]). If you are running OS/2, open the
            Command Prompts folder in the OS/2 system
            folder, and click the OS/2 Full Screen or OS/2
            Window icon.
            
            After typing each entry on the command line,
            press [Enter].

            1. Insert the VirusScan program diskette in drive A.
            
            2. Eliminate the first known virus on your hard
               drive(s) by typing:

               DOS or Windows
               A> scan /adl /clean
            
               OS/2
               [A:\] os2scan /adl /clean
            
            Scan keeps you informed of its progress and
            generally reports virus removed successfully. If
            Scan reports that the virus could not safely be
            removed, see the next section, "If viruses were
            not removed."
            
            NOTE: Scan has options to control and fine-tune
            the scope, validation, and operation of its
            disinfection. For details, see "Scan option
            descriptions" in Chapter 3.
            
            IF VIRUSES WERE NOT REMOVED
            
            If Scan can't remove a virus, it will tell you:
            
                 Virus cannot be removed from this file.
            
            Make sure to take note of the filename, because
            you will need to restore it from backups. Run
            Scan again, this time using the /CLEAN and /DEL
            options to delete the remaining infected files,
            as described in Chapter 3. If you have any
            questions, contact McAfee (see "Technical
            support" in Chapter 1).

            IF VIRUSES WERE SAFELY REMOVED, RESCAN AND CHECK DISKETTES
            
            If Scan has successfully removed all the
            viruses, restart your computer. Restart
            installation as described in "Installing
            VirusScan" earlier in this chapter. Thereafter,
            you can proceed to "Making a clean start-up
            diskette" and "Running the VirusScan programs"
            later in this chapter.
            
            One common source of virus infection is floppy
            diskettes. Once you've finished installing
            VirusScan on your hard disk, use Scan again to
            examine and disinfect the diskettes you use, as
            described in "When to rescan" later in this
            chapter.
            
            FALSE ALARMS
            
            Due to the nature of anti-virus software, there
            is a possibility that Scan may report a virus in
            a file that is not infected. This can be more
            likely if you are using more than one brand of
            virus protection software, especially if the
            virus is reported in memory and not anywhere on
            the disk when you boot.
            
            If Scan reports a virus infection that you
            suspect may be in error, contact McAfee (see
            "Technical support" in Chapter 1). You can
            upload the file to our bulletin board system at
            (408) 988-4004, along with your name, address,
            daytime telephone number, and electronic mail
            address (if any).
            
            ACTIVATING VSHIELD
            
            VirusScan's VShield program can help prevent
            viruses from infecting your system. It runs as a
            "terminate-and-stay-resident" (TSR) program,
            remaining in memory and scanning and
            intercepting programs as they are executed.
            
            To activate VShield at any time:
            
            o DOS or Windows
              Restart your computer by pressing [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del], 
              or by turning it off and then on again, or any 
              other reset method.




           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             20
            
            o OS/2
              Restart all DOS and Win-OS/2 windows. If you have 
              difficulties running VShield, it may be due to 
              conflicts with other TSR programs in your system, 
              or with other programs that monitor disk access. 
              See "VShield option summary" in Chapter 4 and 
              "Troubleshooting VShield" in Chapter 5 for more 
              information. Contact McAfee technical support if you
              need help (see "Technical support" in Chapter 1).
            
            VShield minimizes the use of conventional memory
            by attempting to load into extended, expanded,
            upper memory, or a combination of them, before
            using conventional memory. For extreme memory
            limitations, you can use VShield's /SWAP option
            to reduce memory requirements to 8Kb, although
            this decreases VShield's speed. For details, see
            Chapter 4.
            
            NOTE: VShield has options to control and fine-
            tune the scope, validation, and operation of its
            virus prevention. For details, see Chapter 4. 
            
            When used in conjunction with some Scan options, VShield
            can help protect your system from new and unknown 
            viruses. At a minimum, consider checking floppy disk 
            (/ANYACCESS, /FILEACCESS, or /BOOTACCESS). For details, 
            see "Detecting new and unknown viruses" in Chapter 5. 
            
            In OS/2, VShield runs in DOS and Win-OS/2 sessions
            only, because viruses can operate only in those
            sessions. 
            
            In Windows, you can use the VShield icon to
            turn messages from VShield on and off. (VShield itself, 
            however, remains active.) For details, see Chapter 4.
            



            












           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             21
            
            MAKING A CLEAN START-UP DISKETTE
            
            In DOS or Windows, create a clean anti-viral
            start-up (boot) diskette that you can use to
            regain your "sterile field" if your system
            becomes infected. This is not necessary in OS/2,
            although it will be helpful to make backup
            copies of your OS/2 installation diskettes.
            
            NOTE: Your system must be virus-free before
            starting these steps.

            DOS OR WINDOWS
            
            In DOS, start from the system prompt (C>). In
            Windows, you may open a DOS window, or duplicate
            these steps with the Windows File Manager.
            
            1. Insert a blank or dispensable diskette in
               drive A. Make sure the diskette contains no
               important information, as this procedure will
               overwrite it.

            2. Format it as a start-up diskette with the
               system files by typing:

                    C> format a: /s/v/u
            
               NOTE: If you are using a version of DOS before
               DOS 5.0, do not type the /U option. The  /U
               option in recent DOS versions ensures that
               the system portions of the diskette are
               overwritten.

               When prompted for a volume label, enter
               virusfree01 or another name of up to 11
               characters.

            3. Copy the Scan program to the diskette. Here's
               one way to do this, assuming that your VirusScan 
               files are stored in C:\MCAFEE\VIRUSCAN:

                    C> copy c:\mcafee\viruscan\scan.exe a:
                    C> copy c:\mcafee\viruscan\scan.dat a:
                    C> copy c:\mcafee\viruscan\clean.dat a:
                    C> copy c:\mcafee\viruscan\names.dat a:

            4. Copy useful DOS programs to the diskette.
               Here's one way to do this, assuming that your
               DOS files are stored in C:\DOS:

                    C> copy c:\dos\xcopy.* a:

               In the same way, copy other DOS programs that
               you think might be useful.
            
               NOTE: If you use a disk compression utility, be
               sure to copy the drivers required to access
               the compressed disks onto the clean start-up
               diskette.

            5. Remove the diskette from the drive and write-
               protect it so that it cannot become infected.

               o For a 3.5" diskette, slide its corner tab so
                 that the square hole is open.

               o For a 5.25" diskette, cover its corner notch
                 with a write-protect tab. Be sure to use the
                 write-protect stickers provided with your
                 diskettes, not tape.

            6. Label the diskette "Virus-Free start-up" and
               put it away in a secure place in case you
               need to reestablish a virus-free environment
               in the future. You may want to note the date
               and versions of DOS and VirusScan on the label.
            
            OS/2
            
            With OS/2, you don't need a virus-free start-up
            disk. However, it will be helpful to keep a
            clean copy of important files. Copy the
            VirusScan OS/2 program and data files and your
            CONFIG.SYS, STARTUP.CMD and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
            onto a clean start-up diskette. Write-protect
            the diskette, label it, and put it away in a
            secure place.

            RUNNING THE VIRUSSCAN PROGRAMS
           
            DOS
            
            To run the VirusScan programs from the DOS
            command prompt, type the program name (SCAN or
            VSHIELD) on the command line. Follow the program
            name with the drive (if applicable to the
            program) and whatever options you want.
            
            NOTE: If you have not changed the path statement
            in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you will need to
            include its location (usually
            C:\MCAFEE\VIRUSCAN) in the command, or change to
            that directory.
            
            For example, to examine a diskette in drive A:
            
                 C> c:\mcafee\viruscan\scan a:
            
            EXCEPTION: If Scan detects a virus in memory or
            on your hard disk, don't run Scan with the
            /CLEAN option from C:\MCAFEE\VIRUSCAN. Instead,
            restart your computer and run Scan from your
            clean start-up diskette as described in "If you
            detect a virus" earlier in this chapter.
            
            VirusScan can list the viruses it detects. To
            view this list, run Scan with the /VIRLIST
            option, as described in Chapter 3.
            
            WINDOWS
            
            If you used the installation procedure earlier 
            in this chapter or installed downloaded files using
            the instructions in Appendix A, the WScan and 
            VShield icons appear in the McAfee group.
            To use them, open the folder and double-click 
            the program icon. See Chapter 3 for
            instructions on using Scan for Windows.
            
            NOTE: If a virus is active in memory, do not use
            interactive Scan to remove it, because Windows
            or other system files might be infected and you
            risk spreading the virus.
            
            If you've detected such a virus, restart your
            computer and run Scan from your clean start-up
            diskette, as described in "If you detect a
            virus" earlier in this chapter.
            


           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             24

            VSHIELD AND WINDOWS
            
            The install program adds a line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
            file that automatically activates VShield whenever you 
            start or restart your computer. In Windows, it also gives 
            you a VShield icon that you can click to see VShield
            status. (See Appendix A for instructions for downloaded
            software.)
            
            NOTE: You can change VShield options from the
            DOS command line by removing VShield from memory
            and rerunning it, by editing the VSHIELD command
            in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or by editing the default 
            configuration file. See Chapter 4 for details.
            
            OS/2
            
            To run Scan from OS/2, open the Command Prompts
            folder in the OS/2 system folder and click the
            OS/2 Full Screen or OS/2 Window icon. Next, type
            the program name (os2scan) on the command line.
            Follow the program name with the drive,
            directory, or file(s) you want to scan and the
            options you want to use.
            
            NOTE: If you have not changed the PATH and
            LIBPATH statements in your CONFIG.SYS file, you
            will need to include its location (usually
            C:\MCAFEE\VIRUSCAN) on the command line, or
            change to that directory.
            
            For example, to examine a diskette in drive A:
            
                 [C:\] c:\mcafee\viruscan\os2scan a:
            
            NOTE: VShield does not run in OS/2 sessions,
            only under DOS and Win-OS/2 sessions inside of
            OS/2. You can place the VShield command in your 
            AUTOEXEC.BAT file, where it will run automatically 
            when you start a DOS or Win-OS/2 session. You can 
            also run it from the DOS command line, as described 
            earlier in this section.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             25
            
            WHEN TO RESCAN
            
            Although VShield will monitor your software for
            viruses, it's wise to scan your disks when you
            introduce new programs, or disks that may be
            infected. New programs and files are generally
            introduced in two ways: by inserting a diskette
            and booting from it, and by installing new
            programs. It is also possible to download a
            virus inadvertently via a modem, but this is
            very rare.
            
            You can use VShield with the /ANYACCESS option
            to scan diskettes automatically. For more
            information, see "/ANYACCESS" in "VShield option
            descriptions" in Chapter 4.
            
            For instructions on running VirusScan, see
            "Running the VirusScan programs" earlier in this
            chapter.
            
            WHEN YOU INSERT AN UNCHECKED DISKETTE
            
            Every time you insert a new diskette in your
            drive, run Scan on it before executing,
            installing, or copying its files. If you have
            several diskettes to scan, you can scan them
            consecutively using the /MANY option described
            in Chapter 3. In fact, we recommend doing this
            now with all the diskettes you normally use, as
            well as diskettes received from friends,
            coworkers, salespeople, and even your own
            diskettes if they have been in another PC.
            
            WHEN YOU INSTALL OR DOWNLOAD NEW FILES
            
            Every time you install new software on your hard
            drive, or download executable files from a
            network server, bulletin board, or on-line
            service, run Scan on the directory in which the
            files were placed before you execute the files.
            
            UPDATING VIRUSSCAN REGULARLY
            
            Unfortunately, new viruses (and variants of old
            ones) appear and circulate often in the personal
            computer community. Fortunately, McAfee updates
            the VirusScan programs regularly--usually
            monthly, but sooner if many new viruses have
            appeared. Each new version may detect and
            eradicate as many as 60-100 new viruses or more,
            and may add new features. To find out what's
            new, review the README.1ST text file.
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             26
            
            DOWNLOAD NEW VERSIONS
            
            As a VirusScan licensee, you may download new
            versions without charge for one year from your
            date of purchase. Use your communications
            software to download new versions from the
            McAfee bulletin board, CompuServe, or the
            Internet. See Chapter 1 and Appendix A for more
            information.
            
            New versions of McAfee software are stored in
            compressed form to reduce transmission time.
            
            NOTE: Always download and decompress the files
            in a separate directory from your current files.
            That way, if you discover a problem with the new
            files, you'll still have the old ones.
            
            VALIDATE VIRUSSCAN
            
            When you download a program file from any source
            other than the McAfee bulletin board or other
            McAfee service, it's important to verify that it
            is authentic, unaltered, and uninfected. McAfee
            anti-virus software includes a program called
            Validate that helps you do this. When you
            receive a new version of VirusScan, run Validate
            on all of the program files.
            
            To do this for Scan, start from the system prompt 
            (C> or [C:\]):

            1. Navigate to the directory to which you've
               downloaded the files. For example, if you've
               stored the files in C:\MCAFEE\DOWNLD\VIRUSCAN:

                  C> c:
                  C> cd \mcafee\downld\viruscan

            2. Type the command:

               DOS or Windows
                  C> validate scan.exe
            
               OS/2
                  [C:\] os2val os2scan.exe

            3. Compare the results with the information in
               the PACKING.LST file or other text file for
               the program you validated. If the validation
               results match what's in the file, it is
               highly unlikely that the program has been
               modified.

            UPDATE YOUR CLEAN START-UP DISKETTE
            
            Once you have validated the new version, copy it
            into your C:\MCAFEE\VIRUSCAN directory. In
            addition, copy the Scan program onto your clean
            start-up diskette. Below is one way to do this;
            you may also use the Windows File Manager or the
            OS/2 environment.
            
            Note any changes you've made to default options,
            because you may want to select and save them
            again. Start from the system prompt (C> or
            [C:\]).
            
            1. Navigate to the directory to which you've retrieved
               the files, such as C:\MCAFEE\DOWNLD\VIRUSCAN:
            
                     C> c:
                     C> cd \mcafee\downld\viruscan

            2. Copy the contents of the directory to 
               C:\MCAFEE\VIRUSCAN:

                    C> copy *.* c:\mcafee\viruscan

            3. Temporarily remove write-protection from your
               clean start-up diskette and insert it in
               drive A.

               o For a 3.5" diskette, slide its corner tab so
                 that the square hole is closed.

               o For a 5.25" diskette, remove the tab from its
                 corner notch.

            4. Copy the Scan program to the diskette.

               DOS or Windows
                  C> copy SCAN.EXE a:
                     copy SCAN.DAT a:
                     copy CLEAN.DAT a:
                     copy NAMES.DAT a:

               OS/2
                  [C:\] copy OS2SCAN.EXE a:
            
            5. Remove the diskette from the drive and write-
               protect it again.

            CHAPTER 3: SCAN REFERENCE
            
            The Scan program detects, identifies, and disinfects
            known DOS computer viruses. Scan checks memory as  
            well as the system and data areas of disks for 
            virus infections. If Scan finds a known virus, 
            in most cases it will eliminate the virus and 
            fully restore infected programs or system areas 
            to normal operation.
            
            To obtain a list of all the viruses that Scan
            detects, run Scan with the /VIRLIST option.
            
            In addition, Scan can also assign validation and
            recovery codes to files, and use those codes to
            detect and treat infection by new and unknown
            viruses. If Scan has stored validation or
            recovery data for files, it may detect file
            changes and warn that infection by an unknown
            virus may have occurred. Scan can also use the
            recovery codes to remove new or unknown viruses
            and restore infected files.
            
            Scan runs on DOS, Windows, and OS/2. The program
            files are SCAN.EXE (DOS), WSCAN.EXE (Windows),
            and OS2SCAN.EXE (OS/2), respectively. This 
            chapter describes them all.
            
            NOTE: Because OS/2 operates in a protected mode
            environment, Scan for OS/2 does not check
            memory. To protect against viruses in OS/2 DOS
            and Win-OS/2 sessions, use the VShield (for DOS)
            virus prevention program.
            
            Scan is designed so that basic operation, as 
            described in "Scanning your system" and "When 
            to rescan" in Chapter 2, will detect most viruses.
            The command line options described here offer 
            additional power and control over virus detection. 
            They enable you to run Scan from batch or script 
            files. Network administrators, information services
            staff, and computer systems with vulnerable environments
            will benefit from this feature.

            SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND SUPPORT
           
            Scan requires DOS 3.1 or later, Windows 3.1 or
            later, or IBM OS/2 Version 2.1 or later.
            
            Scan works with 3Com 3/Share and 3/Open,
            Artisoft LanTastic, AT&T StarLAN, Banyan VINES,
            DEC Pathworks, IBM LAN Server, Microsoft LAN
            Manager, Novell NetWare, and any other IBMNET-
            or NETBIOS-compatible network operating systems.
            Contact McAfee or your local authorized agent if
            you do not see your network listed (see
            "Technical support" in Chapter 1).
            
            Scan is designed to check for pre-existing
            infections of known and unknown viruses on floppy, 
            hard, CD-ROM, and compressed disks (SuperStor, 
            Stacker, DoubleSpace, and so on) on both
            stand-alone and networked personal computers, 
            as well as network file servers. If you have a
            Novell NetWare/386 V3.1X or 4.01 file server,
            you may want to use the NETShield(TM) virus
            prevention NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) in
            conjunction with Scan.
            
            NOTE: To use Scan to clean up (disinfect) virus-
            infected files, the CLEAN.DAT file must be
            present in the same subdirectory as SCAN.EXE. 
            If you don't have the CLEAN.DAT file, first verify
            whether you should contact your system
            administrator or information systems staff
            directly for virus clean-up. Otherwise, you can
            contact McAfee (see "Technical support" in
            Chapter 1).
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            


            
            
            


           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             30
            
            TECHNICAL OVERVIEW
            
            KNOWN VIRUS DETECTION
            
            Scan detects known viruses by searching the
            system for characteristics (sequences of code) 
            unique to each computer virus and reporting their 
            presence if found. For viruses that encrypt or 
            cipher their code so that every infection is 
            different, Scan uses detection algorithms that 
            work by statistical analysis, heuristics, and 
            code disassembly.
            
            NEW AND UNKNOWN VIRUS DETECTION
            
            Scan can also check for new or unknown viruses
            by comparing files against previously recorded
            validation data. If a file has been modified, it
            will no longer match the validation data, and
            Scan will report that the file may have become
            infected. With certain options, SCAN /CLEAN can
            use the validation and recovery data to restore
            infected files. Refer to the /AF, /AV, /CF, /CV, 
            /RF, and /RV options in Chapter 4.
            
            NOTE TO NETWORK USERS
            
            To use Scan on a network drive (or directory),
            you must be connected to that drive and have
            read access to it. Some command line options
            described in this chapter attempt to create,
            change, and delete files. To use these options,
            you must have sufficient access rights. If you
            have questions about access rights, contact your
            network administrator.

            VALIDATING SCAN
            
            The Scan program in your VirusScan package is
            supplied on a write-protected diskette that
            should be secure from infection. We recommend
            that you update your copy of the VirusScan
            programs regularly. You can obtain an upgrade
            from several sources, as described in "Updating
            VirusScan regularly" in Chapter 2.
            
            Before using a new version of Scan for the first
            time, verify that it has not been tampered with
            or infected by using the Validate program, as
            described in "Validate VirusScan" in Chapter 2.
            If your new copy of Scan differs from the
            validation data in the on-line documentation
            file, it may have been damaged. Don't use it,
            and obtain a clean copy of Scan from a known
            source.
            
            Scan performs an integrity test when run. This
            self-check allows Scan to determine if it has
            been modified. If Scan fails its integrity test,
            a warning message appears, and Scan refuses to
            run and returns to the command line prompt. You
            must obtain an undamaged copy before continuing.
            
            RUNNING SCAN FROM THE COMMAND LINE
            
            Scan checks files and other areas of the system
            that can contain computer viruses. When a virus
            is found, Scan identifies the virus and the
            system area or file where it was found.
            
            By default, Scan examines only executable files
            (.EXE, .COM, .SYS, .BIN, .OVL, and .DLL files).
            These are the files most likely to be infected
            with a virus. Use the /ALL option to scan all files 
            on your system. Refer to "Scan option descriptions" 
            later in this chapter for more information about 
            the /ALL option.
            
            From DOS or OS/2, you can run Scan from the
            system prompt. (From OS/2, open the Command Prompts 
            folder in the OS/2 system folder, then click 
            either the OS/2 Full Screen icon or the OS/2 Window
            icon to see the system prompt. Once you see the prompt,
            
            For DOS, type:
                 C> scan {drives} [options]
            
            For OS/2, type:
                 [C:\] os2scan {drives} [options]

            {drives} indicates one or more drives to be
            scanned. You must specify one or more drives to
            scan. If you list a drive like c:, all of its
            subdirectories will be scanned. If you list \,
            only the root directory of the current disk
            will be scanned. If you list \ or a directory,
            its subdirectories will not be scanned unless 
            you use the /SUB option.
            
            [options] indicates one or more of the Scan
            options listed in the next section, "Scan
            command line option summary."

            SCAN OPTION DESCRIPTIONS
            
            Here is a detailed description of Scan's options.
            
            /? or /HELP
            Display list of Scan options.
            
            Does not scan. Instead, displays a list of Scan
            command line options with a brief description of
            each. No scanning is performed when these
            options are specified. Use either of these
            options alone on the command line.
            
            
            /ADL
            Scan all local drives (except floppy drives).
            
            Scans all local drives for viruses, in addition
            to those specified on the command line. In DOS,
            use /ADL to check all local drives (including
            compressed drives, CD-ROMs, and PCMCIA drives,
            but not floppy drives). To scan both
            local and network drives, use /ADL and /ADN
            together in the same command line.
            
            
            /ADN
            Scan all network drives.
            
            Scans all network drives for viruses, in
            addition to those specified on the command line.
            To scan both local and network drives, use /ADL
            and /ADN together in the same command line.
            
            
            /AF {filename}
            Store validation/recovery codes in {filename}.
            
            Helps you detect and recover from new or unknown
            viruses. /AF logs validation and recovery data
            for executable files (but not the boot sector or 
            the master boot record) of a disk in the file 
            you specify. The log file is about 95 bytes per file
            validated. You must specify a {filename}, which
            can include the target drive and directory (such
            as D:\VSVALID\VALCODES.VSC). If the target path
            is a network drive, you must have rights to
            create and delete files on that drive. If
            {filename} exists, Scan updates it. /AF adds about
            300% more time to scanning.
            
           
            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             37

            To recover from a virus using the /AF information, 
            use the /CF and /CLEAN options together in 
            the same command line. Using any of
            the /AF, /CF, or /RF options together in the
            same command line returns an error.
            
            NOTE: /AF performs the same function as /AV, but
            stores its data in a separate file rather than
            changing the executable files themselves. For
            more information, see "Detecting new and unknown
            viruses" in Chapter 5.
            
            
            /ALL
            Check all files, not just standard executable files.
            
            Increases system security by performing a more
            thorough scan. Otherwise, Scan checks only
            standard executable files (with .COM, .EXE,
            .SYS, .BIN, .OVL, and .DLL extensions), which
            are the files most likely to be infected by a
            virus. If /ALL is specified, Scan checks all
            files on the specified drive, which increases
            Scan's ability to detect viruses in overlay
            files but substantially increases the scanning
            time required. Use this option if you have found
            a virus or suspect one. (Note that the list of
            extensions for standard executables, above, has
            changed from previous releases of VirusScan.)
            
            
            /APPEND
            Append to the report file.
            
            Used in conjunction with /REPORT, appends the
            report message text to the specified report
            file, if it exists. Otherwise, the /REPORT
            option overwrites the specified report file, if
            it exists.
            
            
            /AV
            Add validation/recovery data to files.
            
            Helps you detect and recover from new or unknown
            viruses. /AV adds recovery and validation data
            to each standard executable file (.EXE, .COM, .SYS,
            .BIN, .OVL, and .DLL), increasing the size of each
            file by 98 bytes. To update files on a shared network
            drive, you must have update access rights. The /AV 
            option adds about 100% more time to scanning.

            To exclude self-modifying or self-checking files
            that might cause false alarms, use the /EXCLUDE
            option. To recover from a virus using the /AV
            information, use the /CV and /CLEAN options
            together in the same command line. Using any of
            the /AV, /CV, or /RV options together in the
            same command line returns an error.
            
            NOTE: The /AV option does not store any
            information about the master boot record (MBR)
            or boot sector of the drive being scanned.
            
            
            /BOOT
            Scan boot sector and master boot record only.
            
            Scans the boot sector and master boot record on
            the specified drive(s), but not files or
            directories on those drives.
            
            
            /CF {filename}
            Check validation/recovery codes in {filename}.
            
            Helps you detect new or unknown viruses. Checks
            validation data stored by the /AF option in
            {filename}. If a file or system area has changed,
            Scan reports that a viral infection may have
            occurred. The /CF option adds about 250% more
            time to scanning. For more information, see
            "Detecting new and unknown viruses" in Chapter
            5. You can use /CF and /CLEAN in the same
            command line to check validation/recovery codes
            and remove any viruses found. Using any of the
            /AF, /CF, or /RF options together in a command
            line returns an error.
            
            NOTE: Some older Hewlett-Packard and Zenith PCs
            modify the boot sector each time the system is
            booted. If you use /CF or /CV, Scan continuously
            reports that the boot sector has been modified
            even though no virus may be present. Check your
            system's reference manual to determine whether
            your PC has self-modifying boot code, or contact
            McAfee for help (see "Technical support" in
            Chapter 1). 
            
            NOTE OS/2 dual boot systems change the boot 
            sector between DOS and OS/2 depending on
            which operating system is active. This causes
            Scan to report that the boot sector has been
            modified.

            /CLEAN
            Remove viruses from boot sector, master boot
            record, and infected files.
            
            Attempts to restore the boot sector, if
            infected, and any infected files. Usually,
            between 10% and 20% of all viruses are not
            removable; they damage the file they infect
            beyond repair. If the infected file resides on a
            network drive, you must have rights to modify
            files on that drive to clean it. If it cannot
            restore a file, you'll see a message that
            identifies the name of the unrecoverable file.
            To use /CLEAN, the CLEAN.DAT file must reside in
            the Scan directory. For more information, see
            "Cleaning viruses" later in this chapter.
            
            Use /CLEAN instead of /DEL when you want to
            restore infected files, not just delete or
            overwrite them. The /CLEAN option can remove
            master boot record (MBR) and boot sector
            viruses, but the /DEL option cannot. If you use
            /CLEAN and /DEL in the same command line, Scan
            first attempts to disinfect an infected file,
            then deletes it only if it cannot be repaired.
            Similarly, if you use /CLEAN and /MOVE in the
            same command line, Scan first attempts to clean
            an infected file, then moves it to the specified
            subdirectory if the file is unrecoverable.
            
            You can use /CLEAN and /CF or /CV in the same
            command line to check validation/recovery codes
            and remove any viruses found. We strongly
            recommend that you get experienced help in
            dealing with viruses if you are unfamiliar with
            anti-virus software and methods. This is
            especially true for "critical" viruses and
            master boot record (MBR)/boot sector infections,
            because improper removal of these viruses can
            result in the loss of all data on the infected
            disks.
            
            NOTE: When scanning a network drive using
            /CLEAN, you must have sufficient rights to
            update files on that drive.

            /CV
            Check validation/recovery data in files.
            
            Helps you detect new or unknown viruses. Checks
            validation data added by the /AV option. If a
            file is modified, Scan reports that a viral
            infection may have occurred. The /CV option adds
            about 50% more time to scanning. You can use
            /CLEAN and /CV in the same command line to
            check validation/recovery codes and restore
            infected files. Using any of the /AV, /CV, or
            /RV options together in the same command line
            returns an error.
            
            For more information, see "Detecting new and
            unknown viruses" in Chapter 5. See also the note
            under /CF in this section.
            
            
            /DEL
            Overwrite and delete infected files.
            
            Deletes and overwrites each infected file. Files
            erased by the /DEL option cannot be recovered
            (you should generate a report so that you can 
            restore them from backups). Instead of /DEL alone, 
            we recommend using it in combination with the
            /CLEAN option to attempt to disinfect an
            infected file first, then delete it only if the
            file is unrecoverable. The /CLEAN option can
            remove master boot record and boot sector
            viruses, but the /DEL option cannot.
            
            NOTE: When scanning a network drive using /DEL,
            you must have sufficient access rights to delete
            files on that drive.
            
            /EXCLUDE {filename}
            Scan using exception list file called {filename}.
            
            Allows you to exclude files from /AV
            validation and /CV checking. Self-modifying 
            or self-checking files can cause a false alarm 
            during a scan. To create {filename}, see
            "Technical note 1: Creating an exception
            list file for the /EXCLUDE option" in this
            chapter.

            /FAST
            Speed up Scan's scanning.
            
            Reduces scanning time by about 15%. Using the /FAST
            option, Scan examines a smaller portion of each
            file for viruses, although it examines more
            files overall. Using /FAST might miss some
            infections found in a more comprehensive (but
            slower) scan. Do not use this option if you have
            found a virus or suspect one.
            
            
            /FREQUENCY {hours}
            Set the time freqency with which to scan your system.
            
            In environments where the risk of viral infection is 
            very low, use this option to prevent unnecessary or 
            too-frequent scans. The lower the number of {hours} 
            specified, the greater the scan frequency and the 
            greater your protection against infection.

            The first time this option is used on a workstation, 
            Scan creates a hidden file named MCAFEE.FRC in the root 
            directory of drive C. In it, Scan stores the date and 
            time that the system was scanned. Thereafter, whenever 
            this option is used, Scan checks this file and compares 
            the time elapsed from the last scan with the specified 
            number of {hours}. If {hours} exceeds the elapsed time, 
            Scan exits without scanning the system. Otherwise, Scan 
            proceeds as usual to scan the system and, when finished, 
            updates MCAFEE.FRC with the system date and time.

            
            /LOAD {filename}
            Use Scan settings stored in {filename}.
            
            By default, Scan loads its internal default
            settings plus any options specified on the
            command line. You can store all custom settings
            in a separate ASCII text file, then use /LOAD to
            load those settings from that file.
            
            Use a text editor to create the file. You can
            put all options on the same command line or put
            each option (with its parameter) on its own
            line, separated by a hard carriage return and
            line feed, as shown in the following examples.

            Sample load file with all options on the same
            command line:
            
                 m: /report a:infectn.rpt /rptcor /rpterr
            
            Sample load file with each option on a separate
            command line:
            
                 m:
                 /report a:infectn.rpt
                 /rptcor
                 /rpterr
            
            
            /LOG
            Save date and time of last scan.
            
            Stores the time and date Scan is being run by
            updating or creating a file called SCAN.LOG in
            the current directory.
            
            
            /MANY
            Scan multiple floppies.
            
            Scans multiple diskettes consecutively in a
            single drive. Scan will prompt you for each
            diskette. Once you have established a virus-free
            system, use this option to check multiple
            diskettes quickly.
            
            
            /MOVE {directory}
            Move infected files to {directory}.
            
            Moves all infected files found during a scan to
            the specified directory. If you use /MOVE in
            conjunction with /CLEAN, Scan attempts to
            restore an infected file first, then moves it to
            the specified directory only if the file cannot
            be restored. Using /MOVE and /DEL in the same
            command line returns an error message.

            /NOCOMP
            Skip checking compressed executable files.
            
            Reduces scanning time when a full scan is not
            needed. Otherwise, by default, Scan checks
            inside executable, or self-decompressing, files
            that have been created using the LZEXE or PKLITE
            file compression programs. Scan decompresses
            each file in memory and checks for virus
            signatures, which takes time but results in a
            more thorough scan. If you use /NOCOMP, Scan
            does not check inside compressed files for
            viruses, although it can check for modifications
            to those files if they have been validated using
            validation/recovery codes.
            
            
            /NOMEM
            Skip memory checking.
            
            Reduces scan time by omitting all memory checks
            for viruses. Use /NOMEM only when you are
            absolutely certain that your system is virus-
            free.
            
            By default, Scan checks system memory for critical 
            known computer viruses that can inhabit memory. 
            In addition to main memory from 0Kb to 640Kb, 
            Scan checks system memory from 640Kb to 1088Kb 
            that can be used by computer viruses on 286 and 
            later systems. Memory above 1088Kb is not addressed 
            directly by the processor and is presently not
            susceptible to viruses.
            
            NOTE: /NOMEM is not applicable to OS/2.
            
            
            /PAUSE
            Enable screen pause.
            
            If you specify /PAUSE, the More? (H = Help)
            prompt appears when Scan fills up a screen with messages, 
            such as when using the /SHOWLOG or /VIRLIST options.
            Otherwise, by default, Scan fills and scrolls a
            screen continuously without stopping, which
            allows Scan to run on PCs with many drives or
            that have severe infections without requiring
            you to attend. We recommend that you omit /PAUSE
            when keeping a record of Scan's messages using
            the report options (/REPORT, /RPTCOR, /RPTMOD,
            and /RPTERR).

            /PLAD
            Preserve last access dates (NetWare drives only).
            
            Prevents changing the last access date attribute
            for files stored on a network drive in a Novell
            network. Normally, NetWare updates the last
            access date when Scan opens and examines a file.
            However, some tape backup systems use this last
            access date to decide whether to back up the
            file. Use /PLAD to ensure that the last access
            date does not change as the result of scanning.
            
            
            /REPORT {filename}
            Create report of infected files and system errors.
            
            Saves the output of Scan to {filename} in ASCII
            text file format. If {filename} exists, /REPORT
            erases and replaces it. You can use /APPEND to
            append the current scan report to the end of
            {filename}. You can include the destination drive 
            and directory (such as D:\VSREPRT\ALL.TXT), but 
            if the destination is a network drive, you must 
            have rights to create and delete files on that drive. 
            You can also use /RPTCOR, /RPTMOD, and /RPTERR to 
            add corrupted files, modified files, and system 
            errors to the report.
            
            
            /RF {filename}
            Remove validation/recovery codes in {filename}.
            
            Removes recovery and validation data from
            {filename} created by the /AF option. If {filename}
            resides on a shared network drive, you must be
            able to delete files on that drive. Using any of
            the /AF, /CF, or /RF options together in the
            same command line returns an error.
            
            
            /RPTCOR
            Add corrupted files to Scan report.
            
            Used in conjunction with /REPORT, adds the names
            of corrupted files to the report file. A
            corrupted file is a file that a virus has
            damaged beyond repair, which typically occurs in
            10% to 20% of all viral infections. You can use
            /RPTCOR with /RPTMOD and /RPTERR on the same
            command line.

            /RPTERR
            Add errors to Scan report.
            
            Used in conjunction with /REPORT, adds system
            errors to the report file.
            
            System errors include problems reading or
            writing to a diskette or hard disk, file system
            or network problems, problems creating reports,
            and other system-related problems. You can use
            /RPTERR with /RPTCOR and /RPTMOD on the same
            command line.
            
            
            /RPTMOD
            Add modified files to the Scan report.
            
            Used in conjunction with /REPORT, adds the names
            of modified files to the report file. Scan
            identifies modified files when the
            validation/recovery codes do not match (using
            the /CF or /CV options). You can use /RPTMOD
            with /RPTCOR and /RPTERR on the same command
            line.
            
            
            /RV
            Remove validation/recovery from files.
            
            Removes validation and recovery data from files
            validated with the /AV option, along with the
            SCAN.LOG file on the specified drive. To update
            files on a shared network drive, you must have
            access rights to update them. Using any of the
            /AV, /CV, or /RV options together in the same
            command line returns an error.
            
            
            /SHOWLOG
            Update and display the contents of SCAN.LOG.
            
            Stores the time and date Scan is being run by
            updating or creating a file called SCAN.LOG in
            the current directory, and shows you the date
            and time of previous scans that have been
            recorded in the SCAN.LOG file using the /LOG
            switch. The SCAN.LOG file contains text and some
            special formatting.  To pause when the screen
            fills with messages, specify the /PAUSE option.

            /SUB
            Scan subdirectories.
            
            By default, when you specify a directory to scan
            rather than a drive, Scan will examine only the
            files it contains, not its subdirectories. Use
            /SUB to scan all subdirectories inside any
            directories you've specified. Do not use /SUB if
            you are scanning an entire drive.
            
            
            /VIRLIST
            Display the contents of SCAN.DAT.
            
            Shows you the name and a brief description of
            the viruses that VirusScan detects. To pause
            when the screen fills with messages, specify the
            /PAUSE option. Use /VIRLIST alone or with /PAUSE
            on the command line.
            
            You can save the list of virus names and
            descriptions to a file by redirecting the output
            of the command. For example, in DOS:
            
                 scan /virlist > filename.txt
            
            CLEANING VIRUSES
            
            Although /CLEAN removes many viruses and
            restores normal operation, viruses can be
            harmful and insidious, and no anti-virus program
            can undo all their damage. Usually, between 10%
            and 20% of all viruses corrupt the files they
            infect, making them unrecoverable. If the file
            is infected with an uncommon virus that /CLEAN
            can't remove, Scan notifies you and identifies
            the filename. Note this filename so that you
            know what to restore from a backup diskette or
            tape. If you use both the /CLEAN and the /DEL
            options, Scan will first attempt to repair an
            infected file and, if the file is damaged beyond
            repair, Scan will delete it. Deleted files are
            not recoverable except from backups.
            
            Some viruses damage or overwrite program (.EXE)
            files or overlay files. Removing the virus can
            truncate the file or otherwise render it
            inoperable. Others, like the common virus
            Stoned, infect the master boot record (MBR). On
            systems partitioned with programs other than DOS
            (such as Disk Manager and SpeedStor), removing
            the virus can cause loss of the master boot record 
            (MBR) and all data on the disk, if done improperly.

            BASIC PRINCIPLES TO MINIMIZE DAMAGE
            
            These considerations lead to the three important
            principles:
            
            NOTE: Before running Scan with the /CLEAN
            option, back up all of your programs and data.
            
            Of course, this works best if you back up your
            files regularly, so that you can restore your
            files from a backup made before your system was
            infected. But even a backup from an infected
            system can be useful for restoring data, because
            most viruses do not corrupt data. If a program
            no longer runs after being cleaned, replace it
            from the original disk or from a virus-free
            backup.
            
            1. When disinfecting an infected system, it is
               important to start from a "sterile field," as
               described in Chapter 2.

            2. Before running Scan with the /CLEAN option for
               DOS, restart your computer from a clean,
               write-protected diskette; before running it
               for OS/2, close all DOS and Win-OS/2
               sessions.

               Preferably, use the clean anti-virus start-up
               diskette you created in "Making a clean start-
               up diskette" in Chapter 2. And, because
               running any program can spread the infection:

            3. Do not run any programs, including Windows,
               before running Scan /CLEAN.
            
            Run Scan /CLEAN from DOS instead of Windows.
            Exit completely from Windows. Do not run Scan
            /CLEAN from within a DOS window.
            
            IMPORTANT: If you are at all unsure about how to
            proceed once you've found a virus, contact
            McAfee technical support, or your local
            authorized agent, for assistance (see "Technical
            support" in Chapter 1).
            
            We strongly recommend that you get experienced
            help in dealing with viruses if you are unfamiliar 
            with anti-virus software and methods. This is especially 
            true for "critical" viruses and master boot record (MBR)
            /boot sector infections, because improper removal of 
            these viruses can result in the loss of all data and
            use of the infected disks.

            RUNNING SCAN TO CLEAN UP INFECTIONS
            
            PREPARATION
            
            Before running Scan to clean up infections:

            1. Clear the virus from system memory and prevent
               reinfection:

               o With DOS or Windows, turn off your PC, then
                 restart from a clean start-up diskette,
                 preferably the anti-virus diskette you
                 prepared in "Making a clean start-up
                 diskette" in Chapter 2.

               o With OS/2, close all DOS and Win-OS/2 sessions.

               o With an OS/2 dual-boot system infected by a
                 boot sector virus (like Form, or others
                 identified by Scan), boot (start up) OS/2
                 first, delete the BOOT.DOS file from the \OS2
                 directory, and then boot DOS to create a new,
                 virus-free DOS boot sector file.

            2. Run the Scan program to locate and identify
               the infections.

            3. Back up the files on the infected disks (be
               sure not to overwrite any previous backups).

            4. Repeat Step 1.

            5. Run the Scan program with the /CLEAN option to
               remove infections.

            NOTE: Don't run any programs, including Windows,
            before running Scan /CLEAN.
            
            If you have Windows, run Scan /CLEAN from DOS.
            
            NOTE: When disinfecting a hard disk, always run
            Scan /CLEAN from a write-protected diskette to
            prevent infection of the Scan program. When
            disinfecting diskettes, make sure there is no
            active virus in memory before running Scan from
            your hard disk.
            
            SUCCESSFUL AND UNSUCCESSFUL RESULTS
            
            Scan /CLEAN reports the results of its attempt
            to remove the virus from each infected file. If
            a file has several infections, it will report on
            each.

            IF VIRUSES WERE NOT REMOVED
            
            If Scan can't remove a virus, you'll see a
            message like:
            
                 Virus cannot be safely removed from this file.
            
            Make sure to take note of the file name, because
            you will need to restore it from backups. If you
            have any questions about how to proceed, contact
            McAfee technical support or your local
            authorized agent (see "Technical support" in
            Chapter 1).
            
            IF VIRUSES WERE SAFELY REMOVED, RESCAN AND CHECK
            DISKETTES
            
            If Scan /CLEAN has successfully removed all the
            viruses, turn your computer off again and
            restart from the system disk. Scan your hard
            disks again to make sure they are virus-free. If
            you suspect that your system was infected from a
            diskette, run Scan from your hard disk to
            examine and disinfect the diskettes you use.

            ERROR LEVELS
            
            After Scan has finished running, it sets the
            ERRORLEVEL. You can use the ERRORLEVEL in batch
            files to take different actions based on the
            results of the scan. See your DOS operating
            system documentation for more information. Scan

            APPLICATION NOTE 1  UPDATING VALIDATION CODES
            
            If you install any new software or programs on
            your system, including a new version of DOS, and
            are running Scan or VShield with the /CF
            (preferred) or /CV validation options, you need
            to install validation codes for the new files
            with Scan's /AF (preferred) or /AV options.
            
            The quickest way to update the validation codes
            is to remove all validation codes from the hard
            disk and then add them back. In other words,
            first run Scan with the /RF or /RV option, then
            run it again with the /AF or /AV option.
            
            APPLICATION NOTE 2  REFORMATTING INFECTED
            DISKETTES WITH DOS 5.0 AND LATER
            
            When reformatting infected diskettes using DOS
            5.0 and later versions, be sure to add the /U
            switch to the FORMAT command. This tells DOS to
            do an unconditional format of the diskette,
            without saving the original infected boot
            sector. This is necessary to erase certain
            infections, and will prevent reinfection by
            unformatting the diskette.

            TECHNICAL NOTE 1  
            CREATING AN EXCEPTION LIST FILE FOR THE /EXCLUDE OPTION
            
            If you set up validation codes using Scan's /AV
            option, subsequent scans using the /CV option
            will detect changes in executable files.
            
            This can generate false alarms if the executable
            files are self-modifying or self-checking (most
            programs that do this will tell you to turn off
            your anti-virus software before running them;
            some of these files are listed below).
            Therefore, use the /EXCLUDE option in
            conjunction with /AV to identify such
            files and exclude them from the validation.
            
            The exception list is an ASCII or DOS text file.
            If you use a word processor to create it, be
            sure to save the file as ASCII or DOS Text. Each
            line in the file contains the path and file name
            of one file that should not be validated. Here
            is an example:
            
                 c:\clipper\bin\clipper.exe
                 c:\123\123.com
                 c:\fox\foxprolx.exe

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             55
            
            CHAPTER 4: VSHIELD REFERENCE

            VirusScan's VShield(TM) is a memory-resident
            program that helps to prevent virus infection.
            It complements the Scan virus detection program
            as part of your computer security plan. While
            Scan lets you check areas on disks for viruses,
            the VShield program checks these areas
            automatically as they load into your computer's
            memory. This ensures that you don't "catch" any
            new viruses while you're working on your computer.
            
            VShield does this by remaining in memory and:
            
            o Checking master boot records (MBRs), boot
              sectors, system files, and itself for viruses
              when you turn on or reset
              ([Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del]) your machine.
            
            o Checking program files for viruses as your
              computer executes them.
            
            o Checking files for viruses as you copy them
              (optional).
            
            o Checking for viruses whenever your computer
              accesses a disk (optional).

            Follow the instructions in Chapter 2 or Appendix A
            to install VShield. You can modify your AUTOEXEC.BAT 
            file so that VShield loads into memory every time you 
            turn on your computer.
            
            If VShield finds a virus, you will hear three
            beeps and see a message like:
            
                 Found the Jerusalem Virus in memory
            
            If that happens, don't panic. Turn to Chapter 3
            to find out how to use the Scan program to get
            rid of the virus. If you need additional help,
            contact McAfee (see "Technical support" in
            Chapter 1).
            
            NOTE: There is one way to infect your computer
            that VShield cannot prevent--only you can. Never
            accidentally start your computer from an unknown
            diskette. That's how 80% of all viruses are
            passed! VShield checks diskettes if you warm
            boot, but cannot check them when you cold boot.
            Always make sure your diskette drives are empty
            before you turn your computer on.
            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             56
            
            VShield runs under DOS, Windows, and OS/2
            Virtual DOS Machine and WIN-OS/2 sessions. The
            program file is VSHIELD.EXE. The file called
            VSHLDWIN.EXE allows VShield to display messages
            from within Windows. The install program adds 
            this icon to your WIN.INI file automatically, or you 
            add it manually using the instructions in Appendix A.
            If you need to conserve memory on your system, 
            you can use VShieldCRC, a version of VShield 
            that offers fewer protection options but requires 
            less memory. The program file is VSHLDCRC.EXE.
            
            A companion program called CheckVShield checks
            whether either VShield or VShieldCRC is loaded
            in memory. The program file is CHKVSHLD.EXE.
            CheckVShield is especially useful for network
            administrators who want to ensure that everyone
            who logs on to the network is running VShield.
            All of these related programs are included in
            your VirusScan disk and described in this chapter.
            
            DO YOU NEED TO READ THIS CHAPTER?
            
            Many users will not need the VShield options
            described in this chapter. We have designed
            VShield so that basic operation--achieved by
            simply installing it in memory as described in
            Chapter 2--provides a high degree of protection
            for most users. The options here offer
            additional power and control for virus
            detection, and are most useful in vulnerable or
            memory-scarce environments and to network
            administrators and information systems staff.
            See "Four levels of protection" and the table
            "Deciding which options are for you" later in
            this chapter for help in deciding how to use VShield.
            
            SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE
            
            VShield is a terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
            program, which remains in memory while you run
            other programs. VShield tries to optimize memory
            usage and minimize conflicts with other TSRs. By
            default, VShield tries to conserve as much
            conventional memory as possible.
            
            If you have only 640Kb or less memory in your 
            system, VShield requires minimal conventional 
            memory. By using the /SWAP option, you can reduce 
            this to only 8Kb of conventional memory, although
            this will decrease VShield's speed.
            
            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             57

            If you have more than 640Kb, VShield tries to
            load as much of itself as possible above
            conventional memory: first into expanded memory
            (EMS), into extended memory (XMS), then into
            upper memory blocks (640Kb to 1024Kb, or UMB).
            If you have sufficient high memory available, 
            VShield or VShieldCRC use no conventional memory.
            
            After VShield loads, you'll see a message that
            describes where VShield loaded into memory and
            how much memory it uses. You can control how
            VShield loads by using the /NOUMB, /NOEMS, and
            /NOXMS options, as described later in this chapter.
            
            NOTE: VShield might require slightly more memory as
            SCAN.DAT and NAMES.DAT grow to include more viruses.
            
            VShield adds a small amount of time to program
            loads and reboots. Performance will vary,
            depending on your system. The /SWAP option adds
            more time, because VShield must reload from disk
            to check files. VShieldCRC adds an average of
            one second to each program load.
            
            Once programs have been loaded, VShield does not
            degrade the performance of your system. Programs
            that load other files may run more slowly when
            you use the /FILEACCESS or /ANYACCESS options,
            because these options cause VShield to scan
            files whenever they are accessed, not just when
            they are executed.

            FOUR LEVELS OF PROTECTION
            
            You can think of VShield as providing four
            levels of protection. You can use VShield's
            options to customize it for the level of
            protection you need. Level II meets the
            protection needs of most systems.
            
            Level I protection is appropriate for users who
            have very little memory available on their
            systems. It provides only minimal protection.
            
            For Level I protection, first use Scan with the
            /AF or /AV option to add validation codes. Then,
            install VShieldCRC instead of VShield.
            VShieldCRC can inform you that a file has not
            been certified, a file has been modified, a file
            size has changed, or a file has not been added
            to the validation file. VShieldCRC will not
            prevent infection, nor will it tell you when you
            have a known virus. Use Scan instead to detect
            viruses, as described in Chapter 3. See "Using
            VShieldCRC" later in this chapter for
            instructions.
            
            Level II protection is appropriate for most
            users. It will protect you from most viruses
            whether you have run Scan or not.
            
            For Level II protection, install VShield
            according to "Running VShield" later in this
            chapter. When loading, VShield checks memory
            automatically for viruses. Once resident in
            memory, VShield checks master boot records
            (MBRs), boot sectors, and program files (when
            executed) for virus signatures.
            
            Level III protection is appropriate for
            computers that are used by many people, as in an
            open-use computer lab, or onto which you
            frequently load files from public sources. Level
            III protection checks for both validation codes
            and virus signatures, incorporating both Level I
            and Level II protection.
            
            For Level III protection, first use Scan with
            the /AF {filename} option, then use VShield with
            the /CF {filename} option. The /AF option logs
            recovery and validation data for program files
            (but not the boot sector or the master boot 
            record) to a file you specify. The /CF option
            tells VShield to check against that log. See
            "Scan Reference" in Chapter 3 for instructions.

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             59
            
            Level IV protection is for environments where
            security is extremely important and new software
            is seldom introduced. It combines Level III
            protection with access control, specifying that
            only programs known to be safe can be run.
            
            For Level IV protection, run VShield with the
            /CERTIFY option. See the "VShield option
            descriptions" later in this chapter for details
            about /CERTIFY.
            
            NOTE: VShield has many optional features that
            you might use at any protection level. See the
            table "VShield option summary" later in this
            chapter to see these options.

            RUNNING VSHIELD
            
            VShield checks programs, the master boot record
            (MBR), boot sector, system files, and itself for
            virus signatures, the pattern of code unique to
            each virus. If VShield finds an infection, it
            prevents programs from running. It also prevents
            warm boots ([Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del]) from infected disks.
            
            You can use options to control and fine-tune the
            scope, validation parameters, and operation of
            the VShield's checks. To use VShield with
            options, use the following syntax:
            
                 vshield [options]
            
            [options] indicates one or more options
            described in the table in the next section.
            
            NOTE: Don't enter the square braces, which
            indicate that what's within them is optional.
            
            Because systems and environments differ, VShield
            gives you a choice of options. Consider the
            mixture of safety, performance, and maintenance
            that meets your needs, then choose the
            combination of options that works best.
            
            When you run VShield for the first time, VShield
            uses the virus information contained in SCAN.DAT
            and NAMES.DAT to creates a new file,
            VSHIELD.DAT, in the program directory. The
            VSHIELD.DAT file contains virus information in a
            format that is optimized for VShield operation.
            Thereafter, when you install an updated version
            of SCAN.DAT, VShield updates VSHIELD.DAT
            automatically with any new virus information it
            finds in SCAN.DAT.
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             61

            DOS
            
            You can add VShield to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so 
            it is activated every time you turn on your computer.
            
            You can put VShield at the end of AUTOEXEC.BAT. 
            In most cases this is OK. However, using a text editor,
            
            1. Check the placement of the VShield command
               line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

               o VShield must be run before any menu programs,
                 such as Windows, MS-DOS's DOSSHELL or Norton
                 Commander, or it will not be loaded.

               o If AUTOEXEC.BAT loads any network drivers,
                 keyboard drivers, disk caching programs,
                 drive compression programs, or custom disk
                 drivers, VShield must be run both before and
                 after them. These kinds of programs disable
                 VShield. The second time VShield is loaded,
                 use only the /RECONNECT option, as described
                 later in this chapter.

            2. If necessary, move the line that loads VShield.

            3. Add the VShield options of your choice to the
               command line.
            
            WINDOWS
            
            When you install VShield, you can add the VShield
            command line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If you used
            the install program or the instructions in Appendix A,
            your WIN.INI file was modified to include
            VSHLDWIN.EXE, which allows VShield to display
            messages under Windows.
            
            However, you may need to change your Windows
            configuration for VShield to run properly.
            
            To do so, follow these steps. If you need help
            with this procedure, see your Windows
            documentation, or you can contact McAfee (see
            "Technical support" in Chapter 1).

            1. Follow the instructions for DOS users in the
               previous section.

            2. Start Windows.

            3. In the Control Panel, configure Windows to run
               in 386 enhanced mode.

            4. Load Windows. You will see the VShield icon on
               your desktop.

            If VShield finds or suspects a virus, you'll see
            a warning message. Choose OK to close the
            message dialog.
            
            Double-clicking the VShield icon only displays a
            message confirming whether VShield is loaded.
            
            OS/2
            
            Because OS/2 is a protected environment, you
            need VShield only during Virtual DOS Machine
            (VDM) and WIN-OS2 sessions. When you install it,
            you can add VShield to AUTOEXEC.BAT so it is 
            activated every time you start a VDM or WIN-OS/2 session.
            
            If your start-up batch file is not AUTOEXEC.BAT,
            edit your start-up batch file to include
            VShield. For example:
            
                 [C:\] vshield /fileaccess
            
            NOTE: See "/FILEACCESS," an option we recommend
            using with OS/2, later in this chapter.

            SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR NETWORK ADMINISTRATORS
            
            You have many options for setting up VShield on
            a network. The table "Deciding which options are
            for you" later in this chapter lists options
            that apply in network environments. If you need
            assistance in choosing the best configuration
            for your network, contact McAfee (see "Technical
            support" in Chapter 1).
            
            If you run VShield from a network drive, flag
            VSHIELD.EXE as EXECUTE ONLY, READ ONLY, and
            SHAREABLE.
            
            If you run VShield from clients' local drives (optimal):
            
            o Edit all clients' AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load
              VShield, with the options that are
              appropriate for your environment, before any
              other drivers are loaded.

            o Add VShield with the /RECONNECT option to the
              AUTOEXEC.BAT or the network login script,
              after the network drivers are loaded. See
              /RECONNECT, later in this chapter, for more
              information.

            o Run CheckVShield from the login script.
              CheckVShield returns a

            DOS ERRORLEVEL that you can use in batch files
            to check and update VShield. For an example of
            using CheckVShield, see "Technical note 2:
            Sample NetWare login script and .BAT file" later
            in this chapter.

            /ANYACCESS
            
            Checks the diskette boot sector and all files
            for viruses whenever a diskette is accessed by a
            read or write operation, such as a DIR or COPY
            command, and when a program on the diskette is
            opened, read, updated, or executed.
            
            /ANYACCESS prevents execution if a program file
            is infected. It also checks any new files
            created, such as with a copy command, regardless
            of the file's extension.
            
            This is the highest level of protection against
            viruses that infect boot sectors. Using
            /ANYACCESS with either /BOOTACCESS or
            /FILEACCESS in the same command line returns an
            error message.
            
            NOTE: The /ANYACCESS switch is not recommended
            for use with DOS and WIN-OS/2 sessions under
            OS/2 due to certain low-level operating system
            incompatibilities between OS/2 and DOS. Use the
            /FILEACCESS switch instead.
            
            
            /BOOTACCESS
            
            Checks the boot sector of a diskette for viruses
            whenever a diskette is accessed by a read or
            write operation, such as the DIR or copy
            commands. By default, VShield checks programs
            when they execute, but does not check the boot
            sector of the diskette for viruses. Using
            /BOOTACCESS with /ANYACCESS in the same command
            line returns an error message.
            
            NOTE: This option does not work from within
            Windows File Manager. For virus-checking within
            Windows, use the /FILEACCESS or /ANYACCESS
            switch instead.

            /CERTIFY
            
            Prevents programs from running if they do not
            have Scan validation codes. Use it in high-
            security environments to prevent clients from
            running programs that have not been scanned. To
            use /CERTIFY, first run Scan with the /AF or /AV
            option, as described in Chapter 3. Then, use
            VShield with the /CERTIFY option and either the
            /CF or /CV option (either is required), such as:
            
                 vshield /certify /cf c:\mcafee\recvalch.sav
            
            Some programs, such as Lotus 1-2-3, contain self-
            modifying code and do not work correctly with
            validation codes attached. You may create an
            exception list of files to exclude from
            validation. For instructions, refer to
            "Technical note 1: Creating an exception list
            for the /EXCLUDE option" later in this chapter.
            
            
            /CF {filename}
            
            Checks validation data stored by Scan's /AF
            {filename} option, where {filename} is the name of
            the validation data file created by Scan. If a
            file or system area has changed, VShield reports
            that a viral infection may have occurred. 
            
            In this example:
             
                 vshield /cf c:\mcafee\valcodes.dat /noems
            
            VShield looks in the VALCODES.DAT file for
            validation data. For instructions on using Scan
            /AF to add validation codes, see "Scan option
            descriptions" in Chapter 3, and "Detecting new
            and unknown viruses" in Chapter 5.

            /CONTACT {message}
            
            Displays a custom message when a virus is found.
            This message is displayed in addition to all
            other VShield messages. Use /CONTACT to let
            network users know what to do if VShield finds a
            virus. The message can be up to 50 characters
            long, and can contain any character except a
            backslash " \ ". Place messages starting with a
            hyphen " - " or slash " / " in quotation marks.
            
            If your message is longer than 50 characters or
            you want to store the message text in a file,
            use /CONTACTFILE instead. Using /CONTACT and
            /CONTACTFILE in the same command line returns an
            error message.
           
            
            /CONTACTFILE {filename}
            
            An alternative to the /CONTACT option,
            /CONTACTFILE identifies a file that contains the
            message string to display when a virus is found.
            This option is especially useful in network
            environments, because you can easily maintain
            the message text in a central file rather than
            changing the command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
            file on each workstation.
            
            If your message is 50 characters or fewer, you
            can use /CONTACT instead. Using /CONTACT and
            /CONTACTFILE in the same command line returns an
            error message.
            
            
            /CV
            
            Checks validation codes added by Scan with the
            /AV option. If a file has changed, VShield
            reports that the file has been modified and a
            viral infection may have occurred. You can
            specify the /EXCLUDE option to exclude a list of
            files from validation checking. For instructions
            on using Scan to add validation codes, see "Scan
            option descriptions" in Chapter 3, and
            "Detecting new and unknown viruses" in Chapter 5.

            /EXCLUDE {filename}
            
            Excludes files listed in {filename} from
            validation when using /CV. For more
            information on this, see "Technical note 1:

            option" later in this chapter.
            
            
            /FILEACCESS
            
            Checks standard executable files whenever the
            file is accessed or executed, and prevents
            execution of infected programs. Checks all files
            when accessed by a read or write operation.
            Using /ANYACCESS in the same command line with
            /FILEACCESS returns an error message.
            
            NOTE: We recommend always using /FILEACCESS with
            OS/2. 1 For VShieldCRC, /FILEACCESS checks files
            only if they have been validated with the /AF or
            /AV options.
            
            
            /IGNORE {drives}
            
            Omits checking program loads from the specified
            drives, as shown in the following example:
            
                 vshield /ignore t: y: w:
            
            Use /IGNORE or /ONLY to speed up VShield by
            excluding secure, virus-free network drives from
            virus checking. You can specify up to 26 drives.
            See also /ONLY, described later in this section.
            Using /IGNORE and /ONLY in the same command line
            returns an error message.
            
            
            /LOCK
            
            Halts the system to stop further infection if
            VShield finds a virus. /LOCK is appropriate in
            highly vulnerable network environments, such as
            open-use computer labs. If you use /LOCK, use
            /CONTACT or /CONTACTFILE to tell users what to
            do or whom to contact if a virus is found and
            the system locks up.

            /NOEMS
            
            Prevents VShield from using expanded memory (LIM
            EMS 3.2) when it loads. This ensures that EMS is
            available exclusively to other programs.
            
            
            /NOMEM
            
            Skips the memory check for viruses when VShield
            loads. Using /NOMEM improves performance
            slightly, but use it only if you are absolutely
            sure that your system is virus-free.
            
            
            /NOREMOVE
            
            Prevents VShield from being removed from memory
            with the /REMOVE option in a subsequent VShield
            command. When you load VShield with the
            /NOREMOVE option, subsequent loads with the
            /REMOVE option will have not effect. Your
            network will be more secure if users cannot
            remove VShield, but this option may prevent
            users from solving memory limitations or
            conflicts.
            
            
            /NOUMB
            
            Prevents VShield from loading into the upper
            memory block (UMB, 640Kb to 1024Kb). This
            ensures that the UMB is available exclusively to
            other programs.

            Checks program loads only from the specified
            drive(s), ignoring all other drives, as shown in
            the following example:
            
                 vshield /only c: f: k:
            
            Use /IGNORE or /ONLY to speed up VShield by
            excluding secure, virus-free network drives from
            virus checking. You can specify up to 26 drives.
            See also /IGNORE, earlier in this chapter. Using
            /ONLY and /IGNORE in the same command line
            returns an error message.
            
            
            /POLY
            
            Checks for polymorphic viruses, which are
            viruses that attempt to evade detection by
            changing their internal structure or encryption
            techniques. Otherwise, VShield does not check
            for polymorphic viruses. Using /POLY on the same
            command line as /FILEACCESS, /ANYACCESS, /BOOTACCESS, 
            or /SWAP returns an error.
            
            
            /RECONNECT
            
            Restores VShield's links into DOS after another
            program has disabled it, such as a network
            driver, keyboard driver, custom disk driver,
            drive compression program, or disk caching
            program. These types of programs replace the
            normal DOS system interrupts so that VShield no
            longer recognizes program loads. After the lines
            in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file (or network login
            script) that load these programs, add this
            command line to restore VShield:
            
                 vshield /reconnect
            
            
            /REMOVE
            
            Unloads VShield from memory. You may want to do
            this temporarily if you are running out of
            memory for programs. For best results, try using
            VShield with the /SWAP option first. Use /REMOVE
            only as a last resort.
            
            

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             72
            
            NOTE: /REMOVE will not work if other memory-
            resident programs were loaded after VShield, or
            if VShield was loaded previously with the
            /NOREMOVE option.
            
            
            /SAVE
            
            Stores the VShield options you specify as the
            defaults in VSHIELD.INI. In the following
            example, /SAVE saves the /CONTACTFILE N:\MSGFILE
            as the default setting:
            
                 vshield /contactfile n:\msgfile /save
            
            To remove custom options and return to VShield's
            original defaults, use the /SAVE option alone:
            
            vshield /save
            
            
            /SWAP [pathname]
            
            Installs a small (8Kb) kernel of VShield in
            memory that loads the rest of VShield from disk
            on demand. Specify a pathname only if you want
            VShield to swap to a path other than the
            directory where VShield resides.
            
            Use /SWAP only if you have very little memory
            available, but require a high assurance of
            safety. /SWAP will slow down your system and may
            cause conflicts with programs that fail to
            allocate memory properly. If you don't have
            enough memory to load VShield without swapping,
            consider using VShieldCRC instead. We do not
            recommend storing the swap file on a network
            path because, if the workstation disconnects
            from the network, the workstation will lock.

            DECIDING WHICH OPTIONS ARE FOR YOU

            Because systems and environments differ, VShield gives you a
            choice of options. Consider the mixture of safety,
            performance, and maintenance that meets your needs, then
            choose the combination of options that works best.

            ERROR LEVELS
            
            When VShield loads, it sets the DOS ERRORLEVEL.
            You can use the returned ERRORLEVEL in
            AUTOEXEC.BAT or other batch files to take
            different actions based on whether VShield has
            loaded in memory. See your DOS manual for more
            information.
            
            VShield returns these ERRORLEVELs:
            
            ERRORLEVEL/Description
            
            0   VShield successfully loaded in memory with all

                (program error).
            
            VShield alerts you to problems by beeping once
            for system errors, twice for validation errors
            (/CF or /CF checking), or three times if a virus
            is found.

            USING VSHIELDCRC
            
            For Level I protection on systems with limited
            memory, use VShieldCRC instead of VShield.
            VShieldCRC is a separate program that consumes
            little system overhead, but is not recommended
            for normal use because it provides only minimal
            protection. VShieldCRC can inform you that you
            have been infected with a virus, but it does not
            check for virus signatures nor does it prevent
            infection.
            
            To use VShieldCRC, first use Scan with the /AF
            or /AV option. VShieldCRC checks the validation
            codes added by Scan. It also checks the master
            boot record (MBR) and boot sector validation
            codes, if present. See Chapter 3 for
            instructions on using Scan.
            
            To load VShieldCRC with options, use the
            following syntax:
            
                 vshldcrc [options]
            
            [options] include the options listed in the
            table "VShieldCRC option summary" later in this
            chapter. For more information on all options
            except /LOGFILE, see "VShield option
            descriptions" earlier in this chapter.
            
            EXAMPLES
            
                 vshldcrc
            
            Activates VShieldCRC (Level I protection).
            
                 vshldcrc /cf valcodes.dat
            
            Activates VShieldCRC and checks validation data
            stored in VALCODES.DAT, a file that was created
            using Scan with the /AF option.

            USING CHECKVSHIELD
            
            CheckVShield allows network administrators to
            make sure that workstations are running VShield
            or VShieldCRC before users can log onto a
            network. See "Technical note 2: Sample NetWare
            login script and .BAT file" later in this
            chapter for a sample Novell NetWare login script
            using CheckVShield.
            
            To load CheckVShield with options, use the
            following syntax:
            
                 chkvshld [option(s)]
            
            [option(s)] include:
            
            /? and /HELP 
              Display a list of valid CheckVShield command line 
              options.
            
            /DEBUG  
              Displays the version of VShield or VShieldCRC resident 
              in memory and the DOS ERRORLEVEL on the screen.
            
            /QUIET 
              Suppresses CheckVShield messages (quiet mode) so 
              users don't see the messages.
            
            /V "xxxxx" 
              Tells CheckVShield to look for a specific version 
              (2.00 or higher) of VShield or VShieldCRC in memory. 
              For example, /v "2.00" for VShield 2.00.
            
            EXAMPLE
            
                 chkvshld /quiet
            
            Checks for VShield or VShieldCRC in memory and
            suppresses messages.

            ERROR LEVELS
            
            When CheckVShield runs, it sets the DOS
            ERRORLEVEL. Use the ERRORLEVEL in batch files to
            take different actions based on the results of
            CheckVShield's check. The ERRORLEVELs returned
            by CheckVShield are:
            
            ERRORLEVEL/Description
            
            0   VShield or VShieldCRC is resident or, if /V is
                used, the version specified is resident in memory.
            
            1   VShield or VShieldCRC is resident but does not
                match the version specified in the /V option.
            
            2   VShield or VShieldCRC is not resident in
                memory.

            TECHNICAL NOTE 1:  
            CREATING AN EXCEPTION LIST FOR THE /EXCLUDE OPTION
            
            VShield /CERTIFY permits a file to load only if:
            
            o It has been validated by Scan, or

            o It appears in the exception list file
              specified with the /EXCLUDE option, used in
              conjunction with /CV.

            If you do not validate any files and do not use
            an exception list, /CERTIFY will disable all
            programs other than DOS internal commands.
            
            The exception list file is an ASCII or DOS text
            file containing up to 1,024 characters. If you
            use a word processor to create it, be sure to
            save the file as ASCII or DOS Text. Each line in
            the file contains the path and filename of one
            file that should not be validated. Here is an
            example:
            
                 c:\clipper\bin\clipper.exe
                 c:\123\123.com

            script gets the ERRORLEVEL from CheckVShield and
            displays messages on the user's screen. If
            VShield is not loaded correctly, there is an
            internal error with CheckVShield, either VShield
            or VShieldCRC is not installed, or an older
            version of VShield is present, the script exits
            the user to a NOLOGIN.BAT file that logs him or

            CHAPTER 5: TIPS & TROUBLESHOOTING
            
            The other chapters in this manual are meant to
            tell you clearly and concisely how to use the
            VirusScan software. Still, you may have
            questions or encounter confusing situations.
            This chapter contains two kinds of advice:
            
            o Tips for getting the most out of VirusScan.

            o Common problems and how to solve or avoid
              them.

            If this information doesn't help resolve your
            question or problem, contact McAfee (see
            "Technical support" in Chapter 1).
            
            TIPS
            
            DETECTING NEW AND UNKNOWN VIRUSES
            
            There are two ways of dealing with new and
            unknown viruses that may infect your system:
            
            o Update VirusScan regularly.

            o Store and check validation and recovery
              information about your files.

            UPDATE VIRUSSCAN REGULARLY
            
            Most likely, McAfee will see new viruses long
            before you do. We update the VirusScan programs
            often--usually monthly, but more often if many
            new viruses have appeared. Each new version may
            detect and eradicate as many as 60 to 100 new
            viruses or more, and may fix bugs that have been
            reported.
            
            Updating VirusScan regularly is probably all you
            need to do to protect against new viruses. See
            the instructions for obtaining new versions in
            "Updating VirusScan regularly" in Chapter 2.

            USE THE VALIDATION AND RECOVERY OPTIONS
            
            If your environment is highly vulnerable to
            viruses, or you require unusual security against
            them, you can use VirusScan's validation and
            recovery options. Scan checks for new or unknown
            viruses by comparing files against previously
            recorded validation data. If a file has been
            modified, it no longer matches the validation
            data, and Scan reports that the file may have
            become infected. Scan has two levels of
            validation, which are stored in two separate
            ways:
            
            o It can store the enhanced code in a separate
              recovery file, which can be stored off-line
              (for example, on a diskette) for recovery
              purposes (/AF, /CF, and /RF switches). This
              is the preferred method because it stores the
              data for files (but not the boot sector or the
              master boot record) in a separate recovery file.

            o It can append a simple 98-byte validation code
              to .COM and .EXE files (/AV, /CV, and /RV
              switches). This method applies to the files
              you specified only. It does not store data
              for the boot sector and master boot record (MBR).

            Once the validation codes are stored, both Scan
            and VShield can use the /CV and /CF options to
            detect changes to the files. More importantly,
            if you have stored the recovery information with
            /AF, Scan can use it to restore infected files.
            
            All of these options require continuing effort
            to store and maintain the codes. For example, if
            you install new programs or upgrade old ones,
            you should use the /RV or /RF options to remove
            all codes, then /AV or /AF to restore them.
            
            If you want to use one of these methods, which
            should you use? We recommend the "F"
            options--/AF, /CF, and /RF--over the "V" options.
            /AF stores the validation and recovery
            information in a separate file, instead of
            modifying the program files themselves. This has
            three advantages:
            
            
            

            

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             85
            
            o You can store the recovery file off-line (on
              your clean anti-viral startup diskette, for
              example, or on a network drive or tape drive)
              and access it on demand to check for, and
              recover from, infection by unknown viruses.
              Use the procedure below to create a recovery
              diskette.

            o This method keeps self-checking files (usually
              copy-protected programs) from reporting that
              they have been tampered with.

            o If you use this method, you don't need an
              exception list. However, it's important that
              you run Scan with the /RF option on
              individual self-modifying files, such as
              Lotus 1-2-3, to remove the validation codes
              for those programs from the validation file.

            The "V" options are primarily useful for
            companies that distribute software to their
            customers or employees, and want to incorporate
            an additional level of virus protection.
            
            Creating a recovery diskette To store the
            recovery file on the clean startup diskette you
            created in "Making a clean start-up diskette" in
            Chapter 2, temporarily remove write-protection
            from the diskette and insert it in drive A. Run
            Scan on your hard disks with the /AF option. For
            example:
            
                 scan /adl /af a:\scancrc.crc
            
            scans the local hard disk drives for known
            viruses and creates SCANCRC.CRC, a file
            containing recovery data and validation codes,
            on the diskette. After Scan finishes, write-
            protect the diskette.
            
            To check for virus infection, turn your computer
            off, insert the recovery diskette in drive A,
            and turn the power back on. The PC will now
            start from the diskette. At the DOS prompt,
            type:
            
                 scan /adl /cf a:\scancrc.crc
            
            to compare the local hard disk drives against
            the recovery data stored on the diskette in the
            SCANCRC.CRC file.
            

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             86
            
            If you detect an unknown virus, to disinfect
            your system, turn your PC off, insert the
            recovery diskette, and turn the power back on.
            The PC will start from the floppy disk. At the
            DOS prompt, type:
            
                 scan /adl /cf a:\scancrc.crc /clean
            
            to restore local hard disk drives with the
            recovery data stored in SCANCRC.CRC on the
            diskette.
            
            If you install new software, or upgrade your DOS
            version, remember to update your recovery file.

            INTERACTING WITH YOUR NETWORK
            
            Many personal computers are interconnected
            through a local area network (LAN). VirusScan is
            highly compatible with most networks. Here are
            some ways of using the VirusScan software with
            your network:
            
            o Run Scan on network drives Run from a
              workstation (PC) on the network, Scan checks
              network drives for viruses just as it does local
              drives. For convenience, the /ADN option scans
              all network drives to which the workstation is
              connected.
            
            o Use VShield and CheckVShield By activating
              VShield as part of every workstation's
              AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you can prevent the
              workstations from introducing viruses into the
              network. Network administrators can ensure that
              VShield is active on each workstation by running
              CheckVShield as part of the network login script, 
              before actual login.
            
            o Use NetShield provides continuous virus
              protection on a NetWare server. NetWare network
              administrators can use it to check for both
              known and unknown viruses and to monitor all
              network activities. On other kinds of networks,
              you can use Scan to check network servers.

            DEVELOP A SECURITY PROGRAM
           
            VirusScan has been shown to be an effective
            virus-preventive measure when used in a
            conscientiously applied program of network
            security and regular professional care.
            
            VirusScan is one important element of a
            comprehensive computing security program that
            includes a variety of safety measures, such as
            regular backups, meaningful password protection,
            user training, and awareness. Even with
            VirusScan, some viruses--not to mention theft or
            fire--can render a disk unrecoverable without a
            recent backup. Although outlining such a
            security program is beyond the scope of this
            manual, see "Other sources of information" in
            Chapter 1 for suggestions.
            
            If you are a network administrator, we urge you
            to implement a security program to safeguard
            your organization's data and productivity. If
            you are a network user, please support and
            comply with such a program.
            
            TROUBLESHOOTING
            
            GENERAL ABNORMALITIES
            
            Using VirusScan with other anti-virus software
            
            When you run more than one anti-virus program,
            you risk strange results and false alarms. For
            example, some anti-virus programs store their
            "virus signature strings" unprotected in memory.
            Running VirusScan may "detect" them falsely as a
            virus.
            
            TSR CONFLICTS
            
            Some "terminate-and-stay-resident" (TSR)
            software may conflict with VirusScan programs,
            especially VShield (which is itself a TSR). To
            check whether this is the problem, "comment out"
            the other TSR files in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
            and restart your system. If the errors
            disappear, the TSR conflict caused them.

            SLOW DISK ACCESS, PROGRAM LOCKS
            
            Running VShield will slow your system slightly
            as described in Chapter 4, especially if you use
            either the /ANYACCESS or /SWAP options. If you
            experience very slow disk access, or if programs
            lock or freeze while using Windows 3.1, you may
            be using a disk cache program that interferes
            with program operation, or you may need to
            increase the number of BUFFERS in your
            CONFIG.SYS file.

            TROUBLESHOOTING SCAN
            
            FALSE ALARMS
            
            Scan may incorrectly report viruses in the boot
            sector or master boot record (MBR) of certain
            copy-protected diskettes. Contact technical
            support if you're unsure (see "Technical
            support" in Chapter 1).
            
            TROUBLESHOOTING VSHIELD
            
            PROGRAM LOCKS WITH /SWAP
            
            When VShield is running with the /SWAP option,
            certain programs may lock up the computer. These
            programs may use memory without allocating it
            first, including older versions Lotus 1-2-3,
            pfs:Write and Professional Write, OfficeWrite,
            and DisplayWrite4. To correct, restart your
            computer and run VShield without the /SWAP
            option.
            
            UNABLE TO REMOVE VSHIELD
            
            If the /REMOVE option doesn't successfully
            remove VShield from memory, you have probably
            loaded other terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
            programs after VShield. VShield can't be removed
            until the other TSRs are removed. If you need to
            unload VShield often, load it last.

            APPENDIX A:  
            RETRIEVING MCAFEE PROGRAMS WITH COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE
            
            You can use your communications software to dial
            up the McAfee bulletin board system (BBS) and
            retrieve (download) McAfee software by following
            these steps.
            
            DIAL UP
            
            o The McAfee BBS phone number is (408) 988-4004.

            o The BBS operates at up to 28,800 bps (baud).
              Set your communications parameters to 8 data
              bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, and your
              terminal emulation to ANSI or TTY.

            o The BBS is Bell- and ITU- (formerly CCITT)
              compatible.

            LOG ON
            
            After receiving the CONNECT message from your
            modem, enter your name, geographic location, and
            password.
            
            To retrieve VirusScan programs, type
            
            guest   (for first name)
            user    (for last name)
            
            Or, if you want personal answers or feedback,
            create your own account by entering your first
            and last name and a password. Passwords should
            be 3-8 characters long and are case-sensitive.
            
            THE MAIN MENU
            
            Here are some of the important functions on the
            main menu:
            
            F  File transfer area (download McAfee updates)
            
            M  Message area (read and write messages in all
               sections and e-mail)
            
            G  Goodbye (hang up and leave the BBS)

            DOWNLOADING MCAFEE PROGRAMS

            1. Select F from the Main Menu to go to the File
               transfer area. This is the area from which
               you can download McAfee programs.

            2. Select 1 for the McAfee Antivirus Files. A
               sorted directory listing of files available
               for download will be displayed.

            3. Type D for download, then type in the filename
               as found in the directory.

            4. The BBS will prompt you to select a protocol.
               If possible, use an error-correcting protocol
               such as ZMODEM, YMODEM or XMODEM.

            5. You'll see the message Awaiting start signal.
               Tell your software to receive files. With
               PROCOMM for DOS or TELIX, press the [Page
               Down] key, with BITCOM, press the [F2] key.
               For other communications programs, check your
               manual.

            6. Your software will prompt you to select a
               protocol and file name to receive the file.
               Select the same protocol and name.


            UNPACKING YOUR FILES

            Once you have downloaded software, you
            need to unpack the downloaded files
            before you can use them for virus detection.
            
            ABOUT COMPRESSED FILES

            Compressed files take less space on the
            disk and require less time to transfer
            electronically.  McAfee uses a shareware
            program, PKZIP (produced by PKWare of
            Brown Deer, WI, and not a McAfee
            product), to compress updated software.
            PKUNZIP (also from PKWare) is the
            utility used to decompress file
            previously compressed with PKZIP. Once a
            file is decompressed, it can be used normally.

            
            
            
            

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             93
            
            Note:  Since McAfee's products are
            zipped using PKZIP version 2.04g, you
            must also have version 2.04g.  This is
            available on our BBS in area one (1) as
            PKZ204.EXE. This is a self-extracting
            zip file. Simply download the file and,
            at the DOS prompt, run it by typing
            PKZ204 and pressing ENTER. It self-
            extracts several files, including PKUNZIP.EXE.

            HOW TO UNPACK

            Once you have downloaded the McAfee
            software, quit to DOS, and change to the
            directory where you downloaded the
            software to.  (If you used QMODEM,
            TELIX, PROCOMM or CROSSTALK it will be
            in that directory, or a subdirectory of
            it usually named DOWNLOAD).  If you used
            Windows Terminal, this may be the
            Windows directory).  Then, enter the
            following command:

                 PKUNZIP zipfile  destination

            where

            o   zipfile  is the name of the file you downloaded.

            o   destination  is the target directory to store 
                the McAfee software.

            For example,

                 PKUNZIP SCN216.ZIP C:\MCAFEE

            unpacks the SCN216.ZIP file and stores
            it in the C:\MCAFEE directory.

            o  If you are updating an older version
               of McAfee software, you may get a
               message similar to the following example
               while decompressing:

                 PKUNZIP: (W18) Warning! AGENTS.TXT
                 already exists.  Overwrite (y/n/a/r)?

               If this happens, type A for ALL and
               press ENTER. PKUNZIP will replace all
               files with the updated versions
               contained in the zip file.

            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             94

            o  The last lines after all of the files
               are decompressed should be similar to:

               Authentic files Verified!   #FZW807
               McAFEE Inc.

               If you do not see this message, you
               might have files that have been tampered
               with. Be sure that you obtain them
               from a valid source before using them.

            o  If you run VSHIELD after updating,
               you might get the following message:

               WARNING: VSHIELD data file has been damaged.

               This occurs because VSHIELD continually
               accesses its data file and it has
               detected a change.  Simply restart your
               machine. VSHIELD will load with the new version.

            IF YOU ARE INSTALLING SOFTWARE FOR WINDOWS

            If you downloaded WScan or VShield for
            the first time, you need to perform
            several additional configuration steps
            to complete your installation. You can
            skip this section if you are not running
            VirusScan under Windows.

            INSTALLING WSCAN

            For WScan, you need to add the icon to
            your McAfee program group.

            1. Create a McAfee program group, if one 
               does not already exist. In the Windows 
               Program Manager, choose File | New. In 
               the New Program Object dialog box, select 
               Program Group and choose OK. Enter a 
               description (such as "McAfee") and a group
               filename (such as MCAFEE.GRP).
              
               If a McAfee program group already
               exists, select it.

            2. Create the WScan icon. In the Windows 
               Program Manager, choose File | New. In 
               the New Program Object dialog box, select
               Program Item and choose OK. Click Browse, 
               locate the WSCAN.EXE file in the McAfee 
               software directory, then double-click it. 
               Choose OK to add the icon.
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                             95

            3. Double-click the icon to verify that it works.

            Note: You do not need to make any changes to 
            the WIN.INI file because WScan stores its startup 
            settings in WSCAN.INI.

            INSTALLING VSHIELD UNDER WINDOWS
            
            The VSHLDWIN.EXE program allows VShield
            to display warning messages in a Windows
            message dialog box. For VShield, you
            need to add the VShield icon to the
            McAfee program group and modify WIN.INI
            so that VSHLDWIN.EXE loads automatically
            when you start Windows.

            1. Within Windows, use the File Manager 
               to locate the VSHINST.EXE program in 
               your McAfee software directory and
               double-click it. The program creates 
               a McAfee program group (if one does 
               not already exist) and adds the icon 
               for VSHLDWIN.EXE.

            2. Edit your WIN.INI file using any ASCII 
               text editor. Add the following line to 
               the [windows] section of your WIN.INI file:
                      
                      run=VSHLDWIN.EXE

            Restart Windows for your changes to take effect.

            UPDATING YOUR AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE

            Finally, you might need to edit the
            AUTOEXEC.BAT file to:

            o Automatically load VShield. For more
              information, see "Running Vshield" in Chapter 5.
            
            o Add the McAfee software directory to
              your PATH statement.

            Restart your system for the changes to take effect.

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                            106
            VIRUSCAN GLOSSARY
            
            ARCHIVED FILE  A file that has been archived
            using either LZEXE or PKLITE, file compression
            utilities.
            
            BOOT  To start a computer. The first step is to
            load startup instructions from the boot ROM or
            boot sector of a disk.
            
            BIOS  A read-only memory chip that contains the
            coded instructions for the operating system to
            start the computer. Always present in portable
            computers, a BIOS (boot ROM) is not susceptible
            to infection (unlike the boot sector on a disk).
            However, it is harder to update.
            
            BOOT SECTOR  A portion of a disk that contains
            the coded instructions for the operating system
            to start the computer.
            
            BOOT SECTOR INFECTIONS  Contamination of the
            boot sector by a virus. Particularly serious
            because information in the boot sector is loaded
            into memory first, before virus protection code
            can be executed. The only certain way to
            eliminate boot sector infections is to restart
            from a disk known to be uninfected, then clean
            up the infection.
            
            CLEAN STARTUP DISKETTE  A diskette known to be
            uninfected, that contains the coded instructions
            from which the computer can be started. See
            Chapter 2 for instructions on preparing one.
            
            COLD BOOT  To start a computer from power-off
            state.
            
            COMPRESSED FILE  A file (usually with a .ZIP
            extension) that has been compressed using the
            PKZIP file compression utility.
            
            CONVENTIONAL MEMORY  Up to 640Kb of main memory
            in which DOS executes programs.
            
            CORRUPTED FILE  A file that has been damaged.
            About 10% to 20% of viral infections involve
            viruses that damage files beyond repair.
            
            DETECTION  Scanning memory and disks for
            telltale marks or changes indicating that a
            virus might be present.
            

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                            107
            
            DISINFECT  To eradicate a virus so that it can
            no longer spread or cause damage to a system.
            
            EXCEPTION LIST  List of files to which
            validation codes should not be added because
            they are immunized against viruses or contain
            self-modifying code. Scans /AV option uses the
            list to avoid adding codes to inappropriate
            files; VShield's /CERTIFY option can use it to
            allow certain unvalidated files to be run.
            
            EXECUTABLE (FILE)  A file containing coded
            instructions to be executed by the computer.
            Executable files include programs and overlays.
            
            EXPANDED MEMORY  Memory above the DOS 640Kb
            limit of conventional memory that is accessed by
            memory paging. You need special software,
            conforming to an expanded memory specification,
            to take advantage of expanded memory.
            
            EXTENDED MEMORY  Linear memory above the DOS
            640Kb limit of conventional memory. Often used
            for RAM disks and print spoolers.
            
            FALSE ALARM  Detecting a virus when none is
            present.
            
            INFECTED FILE  A file contaminated by a virus.
            
            MASTER BOOT RECORD (MBR)  A portion of a hard
            disk that contains a partition table that
            divides the drive into chunks, some of which may
            be assigned to operating systems other than DOS.
            
            MEMORY  A storage medium where data or program
            code are kept temporarily while being used by
            the computer. DOS supports up to 640Kb of
            conventional memory. Beyond that limit may be
            accessed as expanded memory, extended memory, or
            an upper memory block (UMB).
            
            MEMORY INFECTION  Contamination of memory by a
            virus. The only certain way to eliminate memory
            infections is to restart from a disk known to be
            uninfected, then clean up the source of
            infection.
            
            MODIFIED FILE  A file that has changed after
            validation/recovery codes have been added.
            
            

           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                            108
            
            OVERLAY INFECTION  Virus contamination of a file
            containing auxiliary program code that is loaded
            by the main program.
            
            PARTITION TABLE  See MASTER BOOT RECORD.
            
            POLYMORPHIC VIRUS  A virus that attempts to
            evade detection by changing its internal
            structure or its encryption techniques.
            
            PROGRAM  Software that performs a defined
            function on a computer. See executable.
            
            READ OPERATION  Any operation in which
            information is read from a disk. DOS commands
            that perform read operations include dir
            (directory listing), type (display contents of a
            file), and copy (copy files). See also write
            operation.
            
            RECOVERY CODES  Information that Scan records
            about an executable file in order to recover if
            it is infected by a virus. See also validation
            codes.
            
            SELF-MODIFYING PROGRAM  Software that
            deliberately changes its own program file, often
            to protect against viruses or illegal copying,
            and is therefore difficult to validate in
            conventional ways.
            
            STANDARD EXTENSIONS  Filename extensions
            (suffixes) that signify executable files--.EXE,
            .COM, .SYS, .DLL, .BIN, and .OVL--which Scan
            checks by default.
            
            SYSTEM ERRORS  Errors that can prevent Scan from
            completing its job successfully. System error
            conditions include disk format errors (such as
            unformatted disks), media errors (bad sectors),
            file system errors (unreadable files), network
            errors (unable to log in), file access errors
            (access permission denied), device access errors
            (printer out of paper), and report failures.
            
            TERMINATE-AND-STAY-RESIDENT (TSR)  A program,
            like VShield,  that remains active in memory
            while you run other programs.
            
            TURBO  A scanning option that is faster than
            normal but less comprehensive (because it checks
            a smaller portion of each file).
            
           Using VirusScan (Version 2.2)                            109

            UNKNOWN VIRUS  A virus not yet identified and
            listed in SCAN.DAT. VirusScan can detect unknown
            viruses by observing changes in files that could
            result from infection.
            
            UPPER MEMORY BLOCK (UMB)  Memory in the range
            640-1024Kb, just above the DOS 640Kb limit of
            conventional memory.
            
            VALIDATE  To check that a file is authentic and
            has not been altered. Most validation methods
            rely on computing a statistic based on all the
            data in the file, which is unlikely to remain
            constant if the file itself is changed.
            
            VALIDATION CODES  Information that Scan records
            about an executable file in order to detect
            subsequent infection by a virus. See also
            recovery codes.
            
            VIRUS  A software program that attaches itself
            to another program in computer memory or on a
            disk, and spreads from one program to another.
            Viruses may damage data, cause the computer to
            crash, display messages, or lie dormant.
            
            WARM BOOT  To restart (reset) a running
            computer, in DOS by pressing [Ctrl]+[Alt]+[Del].
            
            WRITE OPERATION  Any operation in which
            information is recorded on a disk. Commands that
            perform write operations include those that
            save, move, and copy files. Most write
            operations are also read operations because the
            system verifies that the data have been written
            correctly. See also read operation.
            
            WRITE PROTECTION  A mechanism to protect files
            or disks from being changed. A 3.5" diskette may be 
            write-protected by sliding its corner tab so that 
            the square hole is open; a 5.25" diskette by covering 
            its corner notch with a write-protect tab. A file 
            may be write-protected by changing its system attributes.

<H3>Why use a Network?</H3>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=500 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
The Novell NetWare Network provides a wealth of services and
features that cannot be found in a standalone machine or workstation.
The Novell NetWare Network provides electronic mail, printing, 
application, and Internet services all at the user's personal 
workstation. A network allows for the central management and
distribution of applications and printing. For the three years
that I've been managing the Novell Network, its proven to be the
most reliable of any platform at Manhattan College including the
Administrative VAX minicomputer.<BR>

<H3>Video Resolution</H3>
<HR SIZE=1 WIDTH=500 ALIGN=LEFT>
<P>
Microsoft Windows runs on the default VGA (640*480*16). While this
provides the ability to support a wide range of video cards, it
doesn't provide the ability to view high resolution graphics such
as those present on world wide-web sites. We do offer high resolution
graphics (SVGA - super video graphics array) for any workstation
that has an S3 based graphics adapter.  Some of the machines that
have S3 based graphics adapters include the the IBM PS/ValuePoints
and the Dell Dimension XPS 90s. Most Dell machines ship with the
Number Nine graphics card, which is S3 based.<BR>
<P>
If you'd like the ability to view high resolution graphics and SVGA
(1024*768*256 LF) video resolution within Microsoft Windows you
should email support@mancol.edu with your request. You must have an
SVGA graphics monitor and you must be running ODI network drivers.<BR>

Printing has long been a troublesome problem for many. I will
briefly try to explain what must be done in order to print.
LPT1 - refers to your local printer that is in your office;
LPT2 and LPT3 - refer to printers that (if present) are
attached to the network.<BR>

<P>

When printing from within Microsoft Windows, YOU MUST
CONFIGURE THE PROPER PRINTER DRIVER TO THE PROPER PORT
SETTING BEFORE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO PRINT PROPERLY.<BR>

<P>

If you have a HP DeskJet 500, 520, 540, 550, or 560 attached
to your workstation's parallel port (LPT1) you should select
the HP DeskJet 500 printer driver from the Control Panel->

AN APPROXIMATE DESCRIPTION
--------------------------

Usenet is a world-wide distributed discussion system.  It consists of a
set of "newsgroups" with names that are classified hierarchically by
subject.  "Articles" or "messages" are "posted" to these newsgroups by
people on computers with the appropriate software -- these articles are
then broadcast to other interconnected computer systems via a wide
variety of networks.  Some newsgroups are "moderated"; in these
newsgroups, the articles are first sent to a moderator for approval
before appearing in the newsgroup.  Usenet is available on a wide variety
of computer systems and networks, but the bulk of modern Usenet traffic
is transported over either the Internet or UUCP.

WHY IS USENET SO HARD TO DEFINE?
--------------------------------

The first thing to understand about Usenet is that it is widely
misunderstood.  Every day on Usenet, the "blind men and the elephant"
phenomenon is evident, in spades.  In my opinion, more flame wars
arise because of a lack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than
from any other source.  And consider that such flame wars arise, of
necessity, among people who are on Usenet.  Imagine, then, how poorly
understood Usenet must be by those outside!

Any essay on the nature of Usenet cannot ignore the erroneous
impressions held by many Usenet users.  Therefore, this article will
treat falsehoods first.  Keep reading for truth.  (Beauty, alas, is
outside the scope of this article.)

WHAT USENET IS NOT
------------------

 1. Usenet is not an organization.

    No person or group has authority over Usenet as a whole.  No one
    controls who gets a news feed, which articles are propagated
    where, who can post articles, or anything else.  There is no
    "Usenet Incorporated," nor is there a "Usenet User's Group."
    You're on your own.

    Granted, there are various activities organized by means of Usenet
    newsgroups.  The newsgroup creation process is one such
    activity.  But it would be a mistake to equate Usenet with the
    organized activities it makes possible.  If they were to stop
    tomorrow, Usenet would go on without them.

 2. Usenet is not a democracy.

    Since there is no person or group in charge of Usenet as a whole
    -- i.e. there is no Usenet "government" -- it follows that Usenet
    cannot be a democracy, autocracy, or any other kind of "-acy."
    (But see "The Camel's Nose?" below.)

 3. Usenet is not fair.

    After all, who shall decide what's fair?  For that matter, if
    someone is behaving unfairly, who's going to stop him?  Neither
    you nor I, that's certain.

 4. Usenet is not a right.

    Some people misunderstand their local right of "freedom of speech"
    to mean that they have a legal right to use others' computers to
    say what they wish in whatever way they wish, and the owners of
    said computers have no right to stop them.

    Those people are wrong.  Freedom of speech also means freedom not
    to speak.  If I choose not to use my computer to aid your speech,
    that is my right.  Freedom of the press belongs to those who own
    one.

 5. Usenet is not a public utility.

    Some Usenet sites are publicly funded or subsidized.  Most of
    them, by plain count, are not.  There is no government monopoly
    on Usenet, and little or no government control.

 6. Usenet is not an academic network.

    It is no surprise that many Usenet sites are universities,
    research labs or other academic institutions.  Usenet originated
    with a link between two universities, and the exchange of ideas
    and information is what such institutions are all about.  But the
    passage of years has changed Usenet's character.  Today, by plain
    count, most Usenet sites are commercial entities.

 7. Usenet is not an advertising medium.

    Because of Usenet's roots in academia, and because Usenet depends
    so heavily on cooperation (sometimes among competitors), custom
    dictates that advertising be kept to a minimum.  It is tolerated
    if it is infrequent, informative, and low-hype.

    The "comp.newprod" newsgroup is NOT an exception to this rule:
    product announcements are screened by a moderator in an attempt to
    keep the hype-to-information ratio in check.

    If you must engage in flackery for your company, use the "biz"
    hierarchy, which is explicitly "advertising-allowed", and which
    (like all of Usenet) is carried only by those sites that want it.

 8. Usenet is not the Internet.

    The Internet is a wide-ranging network, parts of which are
    subsidized by various governments.  It carries many kinds of
    traffic, of which Usenet is only one.  And the Internet is only
    one of the various networks carrying Usenet traffic.

 9. Usenet is not a UUCP network.

    UUCP is a protocol (actually a "protocol suite," but that's a
    technical quibble) for sending data over point-to-point
    connections, typically using dialup modems.  Sites use UUCP to
    carry many kinds of traffic, of which Usenet is only one.  And
    UUCP is only one of the various transports carrying Usenet
    traffic.

10. Usenet is not a United States network.

    It is true that Usenet originated in the United States, and the
    fastest growth in Usenet sites has been there.  Nowadays, however,
    Usenet extends worldwide.

    The heaviest concentrations of Usenet sites outside the U.S. seem
    to be in Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan.

    Keep Usenet's worldwide nature in mind when you post articles.
    Even those who can read your language may have a culture wildly
    different from yours.  When your words are read, they might not
    mean what you think they mean.

11. Usenet is not a UNIX network.

    Don't assume that everyone is using "rn" on a UNIX machine.  Among
    the systems used to read and post to Usenet are Vaxen running VMS,
    IBM mainframes, Amigas, Macintoshes and MS-DOS PCs.

12. Usenet is not an ASCII network.

    The A in ASCII stands for "American".  Sites in other countries
    often use character sets better suited to their language(s) of
    choice; such are typically, though not always, supersets of ASCII.
    Even in the United States, ASCII is not universally used: IBM
    mainframes use (shudder) EBCDIC.  Ignore non-ASCII sites if you
    like, but they exist.

13. Usenet is not software.

    There are dozens of software packages used at various sites to
    transport and read Usenet articles.  So no one program or package
    can be called "the Usenet software."

    Software designed to support Usenet traffic can be (and is) used
    for other kinds of communication, usually without risk of mixing
    the two.  Such private communication networks are typically kept
    distinct from Usenet by the invention of newsgroup names different
    from the universally-recognized ones.

Well, enough negativity.

WHAT USENET IS
--------------

Usenet is the set of people who exchange articles tagged with one or more
universally-recognized labels, called "newsgroups" (or "groups" for short).
There is often confusion about the precise set of newsgroups that
constitute Usenet; one commonly accepted definition is that it consists of
newsgroups listed in the periodic "List of Active Newsgroups" postings
which appear regularly in news.lists and other newsgroups.  A broader
definition of Usenet would include the newsgroups listed in the article
"Alternative Newsgroup Hierarchies" (frequently posted to news.lists).  An
even broader definition includes even newsgroups that are restricted to
specific geographic regions or organizations.  Each Usenet site makes its
own decisions about the set of groups available to its users; this set
differs from site to site.

(Note that the correct term is "newsgroups"; they are not called areas,
bases, boards, bboards, conferences, round tables, SIGs, echoes, rooms or
usergroups!  Nor, as noted above, are they part of the Internet, though
they may reach your site over it.  Furthermore, the people who run the
news systems are called news administrators, not sysops.  If you want to
be understood, be accurate.)

DIVERSITY
---------

If the above definition of Usenet sounds vague, that's because it is.

It is almost impossible to generalize over all Usenet sites in any
non-trivial way.  Usenet encompasses government agencies, large
universities, high schools, businesses of all sizes, home computers of
all descriptions, etc, etc.

(In response to the above paragraphs, it has been written that there
is nothing vague about a network that carries megabytes of traffic per
day.  I agree.  But at the fringes of Usenet, traffic is not so heavy.
In the shadowy world of news-mail gateways and mailing lists, the line
between Usenet and not-Usenet becomes very hard to draw.)

CONTROL
-------
Every administrator controls his own site.  No one has any real
control over any site but his own.

The administrator gets her power from the owner of the system she
administers.  As long as her job performance pleases the owner, she
can do whatever she pleases, up to and including cutting off Usenet
entirely.  Them's the breaks.

Sites are not entirely without influence on their neighbors, however.
There is a vague notion of "upstream" and "downstream" related to the
direction of high-volume news flow.  To the extent that "upstream"
sites decide what traffic they will carry for their "downstream"
neighbors, those "upstream" sites have some influence on their
neighbors' participation in Usenet.  But such influence is usually
easy to circumvent; and heavy-handed manipulation typically results in
a backlash of resentment.

PERIODIC POSTINGS
-----------------

To help hold Usenet together, various articles (including this one)
are periodically posted in newsgroups in the "news" hierarchy.  These
articles are provided as a public service by various volunteers.
They are few but valuable.  Learn them well.

Among the periodic postings are lists of active newsgroups, both "standard"
(for lack of a better term) and "alternative."  These lists are maintained
by David Lawrence and periodically posted to the news.lists newsgroup.
They reflect his personal view of Usenet, and as such are not "official" in
any sense of the word.  However, if you're looking for a description of
subjects discussed on Usenet, or if you're starting up a new Usenet site,
David's lists are an eminently reasonable place to start.

PROPAGATION
-----------

In the old days, when UUCP over long-distance dialup lines was the
dominant means of article transmission, a few well-connected sites had
real influence in determining which newsgroups would be carried where.
Those sites called themselves "the backbone."

But things have changed.  Nowadays, even the smallest Internet site
has connectivity the likes of which the backbone admin of yesteryear
could only dream.  In addition, in the U.S., the advent of cheaper
long-distance calls and high-speed modems has made long-distance
Usenet feeds thinkable for smaller companies.

There is only one pre-eminent site for UUCP transport of Usenet in the
U.S., namely UUNET.  But UUNET isn't a player in the propagation wars,
because it never refuses any traffic.  UUNET charges by the minute,
after all; and besides, to refuse based on content might jeopardize
its legal status as an enhanced service provider.

All of the above applies to the U.S.  In Europe, different cost
structures favored the creation of strictly controlled hierarchical
organizations with central registries.  This is all very unlike the
traditional mode of U.S. sites (pick a name, get the software, get a
feed, you're on).  Europe's "benign monopolies," long uncontested, now
face competition from looser organizations patterned after the U.S.
model.

NEWSGROUP CREATION
------------------

The document that describes the current procedure for creating a new
newsgroup is entitled "How To Create A New Newsgroup."  Its common
name, however, is "the guidelines."

If you follow the guidelines, it is probable that your group will be
created and will be widely propagated.

HOWEVER: Because of the nature of Usenet, there is no way for any user
to enforce the results of a newsgroup vote (or any other decision, for
that matter).  Therefore, for your new newsgroup to be propagated
widely, you must not only follow the letter of the guidelines; you
must also follow its spirit.  And you must not allow even a whiff of
shady dealings or dirty tricks to mar the vote.  In other words, don't
tick off system administrators; they will get their revenge.

So, you may ask: How is a new user supposed to know anything about the
"spirit" of the guidelines?  Obviously, he can't.  This fact leads
inexorably to the following recommendation:

  If you are a new user, don't try to create a new newsgroup. 

If you have a good newsgroup idea, then read the "news.groups"
newsgroup for a while (six months, at least) to find out how things
work.  If you're too impatient to wait six months, then you really
need to learn; read "news.groups" for a year instead.  If you just
can't wait, find a Usenet old hand to help you with the
request for discussion.  (All votes are run by neutral third-party
Usenet Volunteer Votetakers).

Readers may think this advice unnecessarily strict.  Ignore it at your
peril.  It is embarrassing to speak before learning.  It is foolish to
jump into a society you don't understand with your mouth open.  And it
is futile to try to force your will on people who can tune you out
with the press of a key.

THE CAMEL'S NOSE?
-----------------

As was observed above in "What Usenet Is Not," Usenet as a whole is
not a democracy.  However, there is exactly one feature of Usenet that
has a form of democracy: newsgroup creation.

A new newsgroup is unlikely to be widely propagated unless its sponsor
follows the newsgroup creation guidelines; and the current guidelines
require a new newsgroup to pass an open vote.

There are those who consider the newsgroup creation process to be a
remarkably powerful form of democracy, since without any coercion, its
decisions are almost always carried out.  In their view, the
democratic aspect of newsgroup creation is the precursor to an
organized and democratic Usenet Of The Future.

On the other hand, some consider the democratic aspect of the
newsgroup creation process a sham and a fraud, since there is no power
of enforcement behind its decisions, and since there appears little
likelihood that any such power of enforcement will ever be given it.
For them, the appearance of democracy is only a tool used to keep
proponents of flawed newsgroup proposals from complaining about their
losses.

So, is Usenet on its way to full democracy?  Or will property rights
and mistrust of central authority win the day?  Beats me.

IF YOU ARE UNHAPPY...
---------------------

Property rights being what they are, there is no higher authority on
Usenet than the people who own the machines on which Usenet traffic is
carried.  If the owner of the machine you use says, "We will not carry
alt.sex on this machine," and you are not happy with that order, you
have no Usenet recourse.  What can we outsiders do, after all?

That doesn't mean you are without options.  Depending on the nature of
your site, you may have some internal political recourse.  Or you might
find external pressure helpful.  Or, with a minimal investment, you can
get a feed of your own from somewhere else. Computers capable of taking
Usenet feeds are down in the $500 range now, UNIX-capable boxes are going
for under $1000 (that price is dropping fast, so by the time you read
this, it may already be out-of-date!) and there are several
freely-redistributable UNIX-like operating systems (NetBSD, FreeBSD,
386BSD and Linux from ftp sites all around the world, complete with
source code and all the software needed to run a Usenet site) and at
least two commercial UNIX or UNIX-like systems in the $100 price range.

No matter what, though, appealing to "Usenet" won't help.  Even if
those who read such an appeal are sympathetic to your cause, they will
almost certainly have even less influence at your site than you do.

By the same token, if you don't like what some user at another site is
doing, only the administrator and owner of that site have any
authority to do anything about it.  Persuade them that the user in
question is a problem for them, and they might do something -- if they
feel like it, that is.

If the user in question is the administrator or owner of the site from
which she posts, forget it; you can't win.  If you can, arrange for
your newsreading software to ignore articles from her; and chalk one
up to experience.

WORDS TO LIVE BY #1:
 USENET AS SOCIETY
--------------------

  Those who have never tried electronic communication may not be aware
  of what a "social skill" really is.  One social skill that must be
  learned, is that other people have points of view that are not only
  different, but *threatening*, to your own.  In turn, your opinions may
  be threatening to others.  There is nothing wrong with this.  Your
  beliefs need not be hidden behind a facade, as happens with
  face-to-face conversation.  Not everybody in the world is a bosom
  buddy, but you can still have a meaningful conversation with them.
  The person who cannot do this lacks in social skills.

                                     -- Nick Szabo

WORDS TO LIVE BY #2:
 USENET AS ANARCHY  
--------------------

  Anarchy means having to put up with things that really piss you off.

                                     -- Unknown

Currently, Usenet readers interact with the news using a number of
software packages and programs.  This article mentions the important
ones and a little of their history, gives pointers where you can look
for more information and ends with some special notes about "foreign"
and "obsolete" software.  At the very end is a list of sites from which
current versions of the Usenet software may be obtained.

Note that the number of software packages available to run news,
especially on PCs, is increasing.  This article lists only a few of
the many news packages available, and the presence or absence of any
particular software package should not be construed as indicating
anything about its suitability or usefulness.

The material contained in this post is probably not 100% up-to-date.
Many of the software packages described in this posting are undergoing
constant development, and it is not always possible to know when new
releases have been made.  Should you discover that information in this
post has been superseded by a new release, please send mail to the poster
of this article with the corrected information.

While the "official" ftp archive sites for packages are listed, note that
most large archive sites carry news software; please try the one nearest
to you before you use up expensive bandwidth on a trans-continental
network link.  You can check the official site for the current version
number, if you want to make sure you're getting the latest version.  In
general, a good place to get recent versions of the more popular news
transport and reading software by anonymous ftp is
ftp.uu.net:/networking/news/ directory.


History
-------

Usenet came into being in late 1979, shortly after the release of V7
Unix with UUCP.  Two Duke University grad students in North Carolina,
Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, thought of hooking computers together to
exchange information with the Unix community.  Steve Bellovin, a grad
student at the University of North Carolina, put together the first
version of the news software using shell scripts and installed it on
the first two sites: "unc" and "duke." At the beginning of 1980 the
network consisted of those two sites and "phs" (another machine at
Duke), and was described at the January Usenix conference.  Steve
Bellovin later rewrote the scripts into C programs, but they were never
released beyond "unc" and "duke." Shortly thereafter, Steve Daniel did
another implementation in C for public distribution.  Tom Truscott made
further modifications, and this became the "A" news release.

In 1981 at U. C. Berkeley, grad student Mark Horton and high school
student Matt Glickman rewrote the news software to add functionality
and to cope with the ever increasing volume of news -- "A" News was
intended for only a few articles per group per day.  This rewrite was
the "B" News version.  The first public release was version 2.1 in
1982; the 1.* versions were all beta test.  As the net grew, the news
software was expanded and modified.  The last version maintained and
released primarily by Mark was 2.10.1.

Rick Adams, at the Center for Seismic Studies, took over coordination
of the maintenance and enhancement of the B News software with the
2.10.2 release in 1984.  By this time, the increasing volume of news
was becoming a concern, and the mechanism for moderated groups was
added to the software at 2.10.2.  Moderated groups were inspired by
ARPA mailing lists and experience with other bulletin board systems.
In late 1986, version 2.11 of B News was released, including a number
of changes to support a new naming structure for newsgroups, enhanced
batching and compression, enhanced ihave/sendme control messages, and
other features.

The current release of B News is 2.11, patchlevel 19.  Article format is
specified in RFC 1036 (see below).  B News has been declared "dead" by a
number of people, including Rick Adams, and is unlikely to be upgraded
further; most new UUCP sites are using C News or INN (see next
paragraphs).

In March 1986 a package was released implementing news transmission,
posting, and reading using the Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
(as specified in RFC 977).  This protocol allows hosts to exchange
articles via TCP/IP connections rather than using the traditional
uucp.  It also permits users to read and post news (using a modified
news user agent) from machines which cannot or choose not to install
the Usenet news software.  Reading and posting are done using TCP/IP
messages to a server host which does run the Usenet software.  Sites
which have many workstations like the Sun and SGI, and HP products
find this a convenient way to allow workstation users to read news
without having to store articles on each system.  Many of the Usenet
hosts that are also on the Internet exchange news articles using NNTP
because the load impact of NNTP is much lower than uucp (and NNTP
ensures much faster propagation).

NNTP grew out of independent work in 1984-1985 by Brian Kantor at U.  C.
San Diego and Phil Lapsley at U. C. Berkeley.  Primary development was
done at U. C. Berkeley by by Phil Lapsley with help from Erik Fair,
Steven Grady, and Mike Meyer, among others.  The NNTP package (now called
the reference implementation) was distributed on the 4.3BSD release tape
(although that was version 1.2a and out-of-date) and is also available on
many major hosts by anonymous FTP.  The current version is 1.5.12.1.  It
includes NOV support and runs on a wide variety of systems.  It is
available from ftp.academ.com:/pub/nntp1.5/nntp.1.5.12.1.tar.Z.  For
those with access to the World-Wide Web on the Internet, the WWW page
http://www.academ.com/academ/nntp.html contains a description and news
about NNTP.  A different variant, called nntp-t5, implements many of the
extensions provided by INN (most notably News Overview NOV support -- see
below).  It is available from
ftp.uu.net:/networking/news/nntp/nntp-t5.tar.gz.

One new version of news, known as C News, was developed at the University
of Toronto by Geoff Collyer and Henry Spencer.  This version is a rewrite
of the lowest levels of news to increase article processing speed,
decrease article expiration processing and improve the reliability of the
news system through better locking, etc.  The package was released to the
net in the autumn of 1987.  For more information, see the paper "News Need
Not Be Slow," published in The Winter 1987 Usenix Technical Conference
proceedings.  This paper is also available from ftp.cs.toronto.edu in
doc/programming/c-news.*, and is recommended reading for all news software
programmers.  The most recent version of C News is the Sept 1994 "Cleanup
Release."  C News can be obtained by anonymous ftp from its official
archive site, ftp.cs.toronto.edu:pub/c-news/c-news.tar.Z.

Another Usenet system, known as InterNetNews, or INN, was written by Rich
Salz <rsalz@uunet.uu.net>.  INN is designed to run on Unix hosts that
have a socket interface.  It is optimized for larger hosts where most
traffic uses NNTP, but it does provide full UUCP support.  INN is very
fast, and since it integrates NNTP many people find it easier to
administer only one package.  The package was publicly released on August
20, 1992.  For more information, see the paper "InterNetNews:  Usenet
Transport for Internet Sites" published in the June 1992 Usenix Technical
Conference Proceedings.  INN can be obtained from many places, including
the 4.4BSD tape; its official archive site is ftp.uu.net in the directory
/networking/news/nntp/inn.  The current version is 1.4sec, last release
22-dec-1993.

In June 1995, David Barr began a series of unoffical releases of INN based
on 1.4sec, integrating various bug-fixes, enhancements and security
patches.  The current release is 1.4unoff3, found in
ftp.math.psu.edu:/pub/INN.  This site is also the home of contributed
software for INN and other news administration tools.

Towards the end of 1992, Geoff Collyer implemented NOV (News Overview): a
database that stores the important headers of all news articles as they
arrive.  This is intended for use by the implementors of news readers to
provide fast article presentation by sorting and "threading" the article
headers.  (Before NOV, newsreaders like trn, tin and nn came with their
own daemons and databases that used a nontrivial amount of system
resources).  NOV is fully supported by C News, INN and NNTP-t5.  Most
modern news readers use NOV to get information for their threading and
article menu presentation; use of NOV by a newsreader is fairly easy,
since NOV comes with sample client-side threading code.

ANU-NEWS is news package written by Geoff Huston of Australia for VMS
systems.  ANU-NEWS is a complete news system that allows reading,
posting, direct replies, moderated newsgroups, etc. in a fashion
closely related to regular news.  The implementation includes the RFC
1036 news propagation algorithms and integrated use of the NNTP
protocols (see below) to support remote news servers, implemented as a
VAX/VMS Decnet object.  An RFC 977 server implemented as a Decnet
object is also included. ANU-NEWS currently includes support for the
following TCP/IP protocols: MultiNet, CMU/TEK, Wollongong WIN/TCP, UCX
(TCP/IP Services for OpenVMS), EXOS, and TCPware.  The ANU-NEWS
interface is similar to standard DEC screen oriented systems.  The
license for the software is free, and there are no restrictions on the
re-distribution.  For more info, contact gih900@fac.anu.oz.au (Geoff
Huston).  ANU-NEWS is available for FTP from kuhub.cc.ukans.edu.
Contact SLOANE@KUHUB.CC.UKANS.EDU for more info.

A screen-oriented news client for VMS that works with CMU/tek, EXOS,
MultiNet, UCX, Wollongong and DECnet is also available via ftp from
iraun1.ira.uka.de, info.rz.uni-ulm.de, and ftp.spc.edu (contact Bernd
Onasch <uranus@pilhuhn.ka.sub.org> for details).

Reader NNTP clients for VMS are also available, including VMS/VNEWS
(current release 1.4) and an upcoming reader only version of ANU-NEWS.
VMS/VNEWS is available via anonymous ftp from arizona.edu (contact
jms@arizona.edu for more information) or at any site which archives
vmsnet.source.  Although the current release of ANU-NEWS is usable as
a reader it can be difficult when used with a UNIX server.

FNEWS is a fast news reader, for VAX/VMS and UNIX.  It is basically a
mixture of NEWSRDR and ANU-NEWS, (a bit like 'nn' in how it works) giving
a nice (but different) full-screen interface and fast response to 
thousands of groups without heavily loading your local machine.  It works by
caching the news indexes from a UNIX news system (CNEWS or INN), and then
dynamically loading the items when the user wants to read them.  Indexes
are only cached for groups which are actually read, so the load and disk
usage can be very small.  FNEWS Versions are available for VMS, ALPHA-VMS
and UNIX via anonymous ftp from ftp.std.com in /ftp/vendors/emagic/fnews.
Contact chrisp@marc.cri.nz for more information.

A port of C News for the Commodore Amiga under AmigaDOS (NOT Unix), is
available.  The port was done by Frank J. Edwards <crash@ckctpa.uucp>,
and available from Larry Rosenman <ler@lerami.lerctr.org>.  Also,
Matt Dillon <dillon@overload.berkely.ca.us>, has greatly improved the
UUCP clone for AmigaDOS, currently V1.16D, available for ftp from
ftp.uu.net in /systems/amiga/dillon.  The package also includes a
newsreader very loosely like the real rn.  Dillon also has a "vn" port
provided by Eric Lee Green.  This software is also available on Bix,
and for ftp from wuarchive.wustl.edu (many other Amiga newsreaders are
also available on theis ftp site).

The traditional line-oriented "readnews" interface was followed by several
popular screen-oriented news reading interfaces.  The first of these was
"vnews" and it was written by Kenneth Almquist.  "vnews" provides a
"readnews"-like command interface, but displays articles using direct
screen positioning.  It appears to have been inspired, to some extent, by
the "notes" system (described below).  "vnews" is currently distributed
with the standard 2.11 news source.

A second, more versatile interface, "rn", was developed by Larry Wall (the
author of Perl) and released in 1984.  This interface also uses full-screen
display with direct positioning, but it includes many other useful features
and has been very popular with many regular net readers.  The interface
includes reading, discarding, and/or processing of articles based on
user-definable patterns, and the ability of the user to develop customized
macros for display and keyboard interaction.  "rn" is currently at release
4.4.4.  It is being maintained by Stan Barber <sob@academ.com>.  "rn" is not
provided with the standard news software release, but is very widely
available because of its popularity.  The software can be obtained from its
official archive site, ftp.academ.com, using FTP.  A description and some
news about it can be found on the WWW page
http://www.academ.com/academ/rn.html.

Wayne Davison's "trn" is a superset of "rn".  Trn adds the ability to
follow "threads of discussions" in newsgroups; its latest version 3.6 is
based on rn 4.4.  It uses a Reference-line database to allow the user to
take advantage of the "discussion tree" formed by an article and its
replies.  This results in a true reply-ordered reading of the articles,
complete with a small ascii representation of the current article's
position in the discussion tree.  Trn is also capable of "menu-based"
selection of articles, allows one to do useful things to operate on a set
of selected newsgroups.  Trn can be obtained from ftp.uu.net in the
/networking/news/readers/trn directory, and from many other archive
servers world-wide.

xrn is an X11-based interface to NNTP that was written by Rick Spickelmier
and Ellen Sentovich (UC Berkeley) and is currently maintained by Jonathan
Kamens (OpenVision Technologies, Inc.).  The current version is 8.01,
available by anonymous ftp from ftp.x.org in /contrib/applications/xrn.  xrn
supports many features, including sorting by subject, user-settable key
bindings, graceful handling of NNTP server crashes, and many of the features
of rn (including KILL files and key bindings similar to rn).

Another X11-based newsreader is xvnews, written by Dan Currie, currently
maintained by Hans de Graaff <J.J.deGraaff@twi.tudelft.nl>.  xvnews is an
OPENLook newsreader written primarily for Sun workstations running
OpenWindows, but it will run on any X workstation which has the XView
libraries. It works with NNTP only, and is compatible with rn style
commands. The current version is 2.2.1 and is available from its archive
site ftp.twi.tudelft.nl in the /pub/news directory.

There are two macro packages named "Gnus" (formerly "GNUS") and "Gnews"
that can be used with the GNU Emacs text editor.  These allow reading,
replying, and posting interaction with the news from inside the Emacs text
editor.  In addition, Gnus now has mail-reading capabilities as well.
Client code exists to get the articles using NNTP rather than from a local
disk.  Copies can be found on most archive sites that carry the GNU
archives eg. ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp, archie.au, archive.eu.net,
gatekeeper.dec.com, prep.ai.mit.edu.  More information about the latest
Gnus version (5.1, included with emacs 19.30) can be found at
http://www.ifi.uio.no/~larsi/ding.html

"nn" is yet another reader interface, developed by Kim F. Storm of Texas
Instruments A/S, Denmark, and released in 1989.  nn differs from the
traditional readnews and vnews by presenting a menu of article subject and
sender-name lines, allowing you to preselect articles to read.  nn uses NOV
index files for fast access to article header information.  nn is now
maintained by Peter Wemm <peter@dialix.oz.au>, and the "offical" ftp
location is the /pub/nn directory on uniwa.uwa.edu.au.  The current version
of nn is 6.4.18.  Non-Australian sites should request the sources from
their nearest backbone site.

Yet another newsreader is the "tin" reader.  It operates with threads, uses
NOV-style index files if available, has different article organization
methods, and is full-screen oriented.  tin works on a local news spool or
over an NNTP connection.  It has been posted to alt.sources; further
information is available from Iain Lea (iain.lea@erlm.siemens.de). The
current release of tin is 1.22.  Tin is based more on the Notes and tass
systems than "rn".  There is an extensive list of features, including
interfaces to batch modes and auto unpacking mechanisms.  The official ftp
site for tin is ftp.germany.eu.net, the Unix version can be found in
/pub/news/newsreader/unix/tin and the OS/2 version in
/pub/news/newsreader/os2/tin

Pine(tm) --a Program for Internet News & Email-- is a tool for reading,
sending, and managing electronic messages.  It was designed specifically
with novice computer users in mind, but can be tailored to accommodate the
needs of "power users" as well.  Pine uses Internet news and mail message
protocols and runs on Unix and PCs.  Pine is copyrighted, but freely
available.  The latest version, including source code, can be found on
the Internet host "ftp.cac.washington.edu" in the file "pine/pine.tar.Z"
(accessible via anonymous FTP).  To try Pine out from the Internet, you
may telnet to "demo.cac.washington.edu" and login as "pinedemo".  There
is also a Pine-specific Internet news group (comp.mail.pine).  For
further information, send e-mail to pine@cac.washington.edu.  Pine was
originally based on Elm, but there is little if any Elm code left.  Pine
is the work of Mike Seibel, Steve Hubert, Mark Crispin, Sheryl Erez,
David Miller and Laurence Lundblade* at the University of Washington
Office of Computing and Communications.  Pine and Pico are trademarks of
the University of Washington.  (* Laurence is now at Virginia Tech.)

An NNTP newsreader for Macintoshs is available called HyperNews.  It is
implemented as a HyperCard stack and depends on MacTCP.  It is available
from many Mac archives, including ftp.apple.com and
sumex-aim.stanford.edu.

A newsreader preferred by many Macintosh users is NewsWatcher by by
j-norstad@nwu.edu (John Norstad).  The current version is 2.0b8 and is
available in ftp.acns.nwu.edu:/pub/newswatcher.

Nuntius is another newsreader for the Mac, written by Peter Speck
<speck@ruc.dk>.  It can be obtained from frederik.ruc.dk, or the Cornell
mirror site ftp.cit.cornell.edu in /pub/mac/comm/test.

There is also an NNTP-based netnews reader for Symbolics Lisp Machines
(under Genera 7) available for anonymous FTP from ucbvax.berkeley.edu
[128.32.133.1] in pub/nntp-clients/lispm written by Ian Connolly
<connolly@coins.cs.umass.edu> and maintained by Richard Welty
<welty@lewis.crd.ge.com>.  In addition, another NNTP-based news
browser is available running under Genera 7 and Genera 8.  It provides
mouse driven hierarchic browsing of newsgroups and articles, with
support for X11 servers on remote machines.  It is available for
anonymous FTP on flash.bellcore.com [128.96.32.20] in the directory
pub/lispm/news-reader/.  It is written and maintained by Peter
Clitherow <pc@bellcore.com>

A TOPS-20 reader was developed by Dave Edwards of SRI
<dle@kl.sri.com>, but current availability is unknown.  An NNTP reader
suite for PC's running MS-DOS and having Excelan boards is available
for ftp from ames.arc.nasa.gov; get the pcrrn files.  There are two
MS-DOS news readers that can be obtained from bcm.tmc.edu in the "nfs"
directory.  They both require PC-NFS (from Sun) to work.  They will
both work under PC/TCP from FTP Software early this year.  Source will
be provided at that time.

"trumpet" is a NNTP based news reader for DOS and Windows. There is Lan
Workplace version which is also available.  It runs over packet drivers,
which can work side-by-side with a Novell Network.  For information on
the Crynwr Packet Driver Collection, send mail to <info@crynwr.com> or
send a FAX to +1-315-268-9201.  Trumpet offers a very intuitive interface
with most of the basic facilities required in a newsreader (but without
some of the 'bells and whistles found in something like rn).  It has
facilities for using SMTP to forward/reply etc.  The latest version is
1.07 and is shareware available at most main ftp sites.

trumpet       ftp.trumpet.com.au:/trumpet/
wintrumpet    ftp.trumpet.com.au:/wintrump/

"WinVN" is a public domain NNTP newsreader for Microsoft Windows and
Windows NT.  There are versions available for WINSOCK, Novell LWP, and
DEC Pathworks/LanMan.  It supports the XOVER extension, and can display
articles in thread trees.  SMTP and MAPI outgoing mail are supported.
The latest version is 0.99.2.  Sources and binaries are always available
from:

ftp.ksc.nasa.gov:[.pub.win3.winvn].
ripem.msu.edu:/pub/pc/win/winvn/titan.ksc.nasa.gov (mirror).

Details on several newsreaders for systems running "Waffle" may be
found in the FAQ posted to the comp.bbs.waffle newsgroup on a regular
basis.  At least 8 different readers are available, and all can be
obtained via ftp and mailserver from ftp.halcyon.com (look in
/pub/waffle/news).

Details on many other mail and news readers for MSDOS, Windows and OS/2
systems can be found in the FAQ posted to the comp.os.msdos.mail-news.

At least one IBM VM/SP (CMS) version of the Usenet software is
available.  It is known as PSU NetNews, and it is maintained by Linda
Littleton (lrl@psuvm.bitnet/psuvm.psu.edu).  Version 2.4 of the
software is available from LISTSERV@PSUVM.  PSU NetNews supports only
3270 terminals, and uses XEDIT as its screen driver.  Most major VM
sites appear to use this package.  NetNews supports locally-stored
news, not NNTP reading.

Since January 1993, a complete NNTP server is available for VM systems.
It provides news reading, posting and feed processing compatible to the
Unix NNTP implementations.  The code is written in IBM's VM Rexx.
It assumes that you already have installed PSU VM NETNEWS.  The VM NNTP
package, written by Kris Van Hees (gutest6@cc1.kuleuven.ac.be) who also
takes care of the maintenance.  The current version is 1.0.1 and requires
IBM's FAL TCP/IP and Arty Ecock's RXSOCKET which is available from the
IBMTCP FIELLIST on listserv@pucc.  The VM NNTP package can be obtained
from the NNTP PACKAGE on listserv@blekul11.

There is NNTP support for PSU NetNews for bulk news receipt: NNTPXFER
will poll another site for news, and NNTPRCVR will receive news sent
from a Unix NNTPXMIT process.  Either program sends the news articles
to NetNews for processing.  Contact Andy Hooper (hooper@qucdn.bitnet
or qucdn.queensu.ca) for more information, or obtain them from
listserv@qucdn in PUBLIC FILELIST.  These programs are provided with
source, and require IBM's FAL TCP/IP and Pascal.  An NNTPXMIT sender
that works in cooperation with PSU NETNEWS is available from Herman
Van Uytven (SYSTHVU@cc1.kuleuven.ac.be).

There is at least one NNTP news-reader for VM using XEDIT as its
screen manager: NNR.  Contact Paul Campbell (pc@mbunix.mitre.org) for
information.  The program requires IBM's FAL TCP/IP.  The software is
available for anonymous ftp from ftp.uni-stuttgart.de
in the directory pub/comm/news/beginner/software/nnr/*.

An NNTP news reader is available for TSO/ISPF, called NNMVS. NNMVS is
written by Steve Bacher <seb@draper.com> at Draper Laboratory.  It
requires C/370 V1R2 or SAS/C; ISPF V2; and TCP/IP for MVS (either
IBM's "FAL" or SNS).  It is now available via anonymous ftp at
ftp.uni-stuttgart.de under the directory
/pub/comm/news/beginner/software/nnmvs and from ftp.mic.ucla.edu,
directory /pub/mvs/netnews.  The current version is Version 3
Release 2.  There's also an object-code-only distribution for folks
without C compilers, but that's an at-your-own-risk distribution,
and requires the IBM C/370 run-time library.  The source code
distribution can be compiled with either C/370 or SAS/C.

Newsfeed management software
------------------------

Gup, the Group Update Program is a Unix mail-server program that lets a
remote site change their newsgroups subscription on their news feed
without requiring the intervention of the news administrator at the feed
site.  Gup operates with the INN (and likely the C News) batching
mechanisms.  The news administrators at the remote sites simply mail
commands to gup to make changes to their own site's subscription list.
The mail/interface is password protected.  Gup checks the requests for
valid newsgroup names, patterns that have no effect and so on. Gup's
authors are Mark Delany <markd@mira.net.au> and Andrew Herbert
<andrew@mira.net.au>.  Its official ftp location is
ftp.mira.net.au:/unix/news/gup-0.4.tar.gz, but since that's not
as well connected as uunet, people are strongly advised to obtain it from
a mirror site. eg.  ftp.uu.net:/networking/news/misc/gup-0.4.tar.gz

dynafeed is a package from Looking Glass Software Limited that maintains a
.newsrc for every remote site and generates the batches for them.  Remote
sites can use uucp or run a program to change their .newsrc dynamically.  It
comes with a program that the remote site can run to monitor readership in
newsgroups and dynamically update the feed list to match reader interest.
The goal of this is to get a feed that sends only exactly the groups
currently being read.  dynafeed can be obtained from ftp.clarinet.com as
sources/dynafeed.tar.Z.

News processing software
------------------------

Software also exists to automatically archive Usenet newsgroups.  The package
rkive, written by Kent Landfield <kent@sterling.com> can be configured to
archive news automatically based on different headers -- Archive-Name,
Volume-Issue, Chronological, Subject and External-Command to name a few.  It
can be run in batch mode from the command line or from cron.  It can also be
installed in the sys/newsfeeds file to process articles as they are
received.  rkive supports local spool directories as well as NNTP based
access.  rkive is available via ftp from ftp.sterling.com in the directory
/rkive.

Newsclip is a programming language for writing news filtering programs, from
Looking Glass Software Limited, marketed by ClariNet Communications Corp.  It
is C-like, and translates to C, so a C compiler is required.  It has
data-types to represent the kinds of things found in article headers and
bodies.  It can maintain databases of users, message-ids, patterns,
subjects, etc.  These can be used to decide whether to ignore or select an
article.  Newsclip can either operate as a standalone program or as part of
rn. It is free for non-commercial use and is available from ftp.clarinet.com
as sources/nc.tar.Z.  Contact clari-info@clarinet.com with
a subject line of "newsclip" for more info.

Commercial software
-------------------

DNEWS is a commercial product from NetWin.  DNEWS licenses are provided
free to educational institutions for non profit use. With DNEWS, the news
is stored in a database so as not to overload the raw file system.  DNEWS
supports 'sucking' where only groups which users read are pulled over from
the feeder site. DNEWS is currently known to run on VMS, Windows NT,
Solaris, SunOS, Unixware, HP/UX.  DNEWS binaries are available by
anonymous ftp from ftp.std.com in /ftp/vendors/netwin/dnews
or from
        http://world.std.com/~netwin/
DNEWS sources can be obtained on request, see the file source.txt in the
ftp area for more information.


Special note on "notes" and old versions of news
------------------------------------------------

Many years ago, there was another distributed "news" system called
"notes".  The "notes" software package used a different internal
organization of articles, and a different interchange format than that
of the standard Usenet software.  It was inspired by the notesfiles
available in the PLATO system and was developed independently from the
Usenet news.  Eventually, the "notes" network and Usenet were joined
via gateways doing (sometimes imperfect) protocol translation.
"notes" was written in 1980-1981 by Ray Essick and Rob Kolstad, (then)
grad students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The
first public release of "notes" was at the January 1982 Usenix
conference.  The last release of notes was version 1.7; it is no
longer being actively maintained and the newsgroup for discussing
it (news.software.notes) was removed in April 1995.

"B" news software is currently considered obsolete.  Unix sites
joining the Usenet should install C news or INN to ensure proper
behavior and good performance.  Most old B news software had
compiled-in limits on the number of newsgroups and the number of
articles per newsgroup; the increasing volume of news means that B
news software cannot reliably cope with a moderately-full newsfeed.


Software versions & availability
--------------------------------

You can obtain the version number of your news software by issuing
some form of "v" command to show the current version -- consult the
man page for details.  Current software is obtainable from almost any
major Usenet site as well as the sites noted in the body of the
article, above.

The following sites probably have sources to the current news software
available for anyone needing a copy:

                Site            Contact
                ----            -------
                munnari         kre@munnari.oz.au
                osu-cis         postmaster@cis.ohio-state.edu
                philabs         usenet@philabs.philips.com
                pyramid         usenet@pyramid.com
                rutgers         usenet@rutgers.edu
                tektronix       news@tektronix.tek.com
                watmath         usenet@watmath.waterloo.edu
                uunet           info@uunet.uu.net

Sources for most of the news readers and software, including news
2.11, C News, "rn", and "trn" are also available in the
comp.sources.unix archives.  European sites should request the sources
from their nearest backbone site.

The "archie" service can be used to locate ftp archives containing
various news software packages.  There are regular postings in the
comp.answers newsgroup about how to use the "archie" service.

For a relatively low price, you can buy one of many CD-ROM distributions
of freely-redistributable software.  This may be cheaper than a
long-distance phone call.

Standards
---------

News programs communicate with each other according to standard
protocols, some of which are described by RFCs.  An RFC is a Request For
Comment, a de facto standard in the Internet Community.  It is a form of
software standard, published by the Internet Network Information Center
(InterNIC).  Copies of RFCs are often posted to the net and obtainable
from archive sites.  Current news-related RFCs include the following:

    RFC 822 specifies the format of messages; RFC 1036 uses this.
    RFC 977 specifies NNTP, the Network News Transfer Protocol.
    RFC 1036 specifies the format of Usenet articles.
    RFC 1123 amends RFC 822.
    RFC 1153 specifies the digest format some moderated groups use.

See the accompanying posting "How to Get Information about Networks"
for instructions on getting copies of the RFCs.

Henry Spencer has a draft of a successor to RFC1036 that attempts to
document and explain all subsequent enhancements and existing practice as
implemented in the newer news systems.  This draft (often called
son-of-1036) can be obtained by anonymous ftp from ftp.zoo.toronto.edu as
/pub/news.txt.Z (the text version) or /pub/news.ps.Z (a PostScript
version).  Son-of-1036 is intended to be stand-alone reading and does not
require that one also read RFCs 822 or 1123.

Subject: Introduction

Configuring electronic mail systems can be quite a complicated
subject.  Often far more complicated than, say, setting up
a Usenet news feed.  This is because, unlike news, email is
expected to traverse multiple types of networks using their own
protocol, whereas, Usenet news tends to be a single protocol
supported by hook or by crook on different networks.

This document is intended for system administrators who need to
know how to set up their UNIX systems for email communication with
the outside world.  It is intended for the email-naive SA
who gets more than a little confused by the acronyms, RFC's and
plethora of software.

This is intended to be a general survey of the software available,
so I won't spend too much time on some of the details.  Most of
the available software comes with documentation that can
explain things much better than I can.

Additional detail can be obtained from several sources, such as:

    Quarterman, John S.: "The Matrix -- Computer Networks
        and Conferencing Systems Worldwide", Digital Press 1990,
        (Order No.  EY-C176E-DP), ISBN 1-55558-033-5.

    Adams, Rick and Frey, Donnalyn: !%@:: A Directory of Mail
        Addressing and Networks, 3rd Ed., O'Reilly & Associates 1993,
        Provides a good reference for people seeking information
        on how to access the various email networks.
        ISBN 1-56592-031-7.

    Kehoe, Brendan P.: Zen and the Art of the Internet: A
        Beginner's Guide, Second Edition, Prentice Hall 1992,
        ISBN 0-13-010778-6.  Edition 1 is available via FTP on
        cs.widener.edu in the tar file zen-1.0.tar.Z. [I think]

    Krol, Ed: The Whole Internet: User's Guide & Catalog.
        First edition, O'Reilly & Associates Sept. 1992.
        ISBN: 1-56592-025-2.  Very good introduction to
        the Internet, history, facilities, uses, services,
        etc.  I learned a lot.
    
    Albitz, Paul & Liu, Cricket: DNS and BIND, First edition,
        O'Reilly & Associates, October 1992.  ISBN: 0-56592-010-4.
        Describes in great detail everything from what a domain
        is, to how to install and configure BIND.  A *MUST* for
        people setting up large networks, or connecting
        machines to the Internet.  It has become mandatory reading
        for network administrators in a large corporation for
        good reason.

    Costales, Bryan and Allman, Eric and Rickert, Neil: Sendmail.
        O'Reilly & Associates, Nov (?) 1993. ISBN 1-56592-056-2
        (ISBN from galley proof, which I've had a preview of).
        An absolute necessity for anyone diving into the configuration
        of sendmail.  The material is presented in a very clear
        form, and is quite exhaustive in its coverage.  Perhaps a bit
        too wordy and overlong, but that's a more than welcome contrast
        to previous documentation (or lack thereof) on sendmail.

Further, this is primarily oriented towards UNIX email systems.
This is unfortunate, because it would be nice to have a general
document covering email in all of its forms.  However, each
operating system tends to have radically different email mechanisms,
so it would be difficult to do justice to any other environment.
It seems more useful to cover one environment well here, and have
companion documents for other environments.  Speaking of which,
why hasn't anybody else stepped in to do FAQs on other environments?
Like DOS, Mac etc.

And finally, this document is not intended to be pedantically
correct.  Knowledgeable readers will know that I'm glossing
over a lot of detail, and absolute precision has been balanced
against readability and effectiveness in helping people get
going.

This FAQ is laid out in the following sections:

        + An overview of how mail systems go together.

        + A glossary of the important terms to know.

        + A list of general do's and don'ts of mail systems.

        + Configuration Issues

        + Several suggested mail configurations. 

        + General overviews of specific software.

------------------------------
Subject: Electronic mail - A General Overview of Structure

Electronic mail generally consists of three basic pieces:

    1) The link level transport - which could be
       UUCP, TCP/IP, or a host of others.  We'll call
       this the "transport medium" (TM)

    2) the "Mail Transport Agent" (MTA) which is responsible for
       transporting mail from source to destination, possibly
       transforming protocols, addresses, and routing the mail.

       The MTA often has several components:
            - Routing mechanisms
            - Local delivery agent (LDA)
            - Remote delivery agent
       Many MTA's have all of these components, but some
       do not.  In other cases, it is possible to replace
       certain components for increased functionality.

    3) The "User Agent" (UA) is the user interface -
       the software that the user uses to read his mail,
       sort things around in folders, and send mail.
       Sometimes called "Mail User Agent" (MUA).

------------------------------
Subject: Glossary

Rather than alphabetic, this glossary tends to group terms
referring to similar functionality together.

Transport Medium:

    UUCP (Unix to Unix Copy Program):
        Back in the mists of time, UNIX systems communicated only
        over RS232 serial lines, usually over modems.  UUCP is a
        suite of programs developed back in the early 70's to
        provide this communications link.  All that UUCP does is
        transfer files from one system to another.  There is an
        additional mechanism where one system can direct the
        destination system to run a file through a specific program.
        Electronic mail in UUCP is simply requesting the destination
        machine to run "mail" on a data file.

        UUCP communicates by means of "protocols", the most common
        being "g", a method for transmission of data over telephone
        lines and ensuring that the data is not corrupted.  There
        are several other protocols, none universally available,
        and most oriented towards communication media other than
        telephone voice lines (such as dialup X.25, PAD X.25, or
        LAN connects).

        UUCP operates over fixed system-to-system links, so sending
        mail from one system to another often has to traverse
        other intermediate systems.

    TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):
        TCP/IP is a protocol that allows any system on a network to
        talk "directly" to any other, by passing packets of
        information back and forth.  TCP/IP (and its later relative
        OSI) is usually used over networks built on top of Ethernet,
        Token-Ring, Starlan and other LANS.

    SMTP:
        Or, "Simple Mail Transfer Protocol", is the communications
        protocol used most commonly over TCP/IP links in UNIX
        environments for mail.  SMTP usually operates directly between
        the source and destination machines, so intermediate machines
        don't get involved (except for gateways, see below).  SMTP
        is usually part of the MTA.

    SLIP (Serial Line Internet Protocol):
        SLIP is an implementation of TCP/IP designed for use over
        RS232 serial lines (ie: modems).  The other difference is
        that some SLIP implementations have the ability to "dial the
        phone" to make a connection for a specific transfer, whereas
        LAN TCP/IP is physically continuously connected.  You'd also
        need TCP/IP to run a SMTP mail connection.

    PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
        A successor to SLIP.

    X.25/X.29:
        X.25 is a packet switched data network which is usually
        half-duplex.  In this context, it's really an alternative
        to dialup over voice telephone lines with modems.  X.25
        is available in several "flavours", either direct X.25
        trunk connects over leased lines, through "PAD" interfaces,
        or by ordinary dialup modem access to X.25 "ports".

        To be useable in the context of mail transfers, you also
        have to use a file transfer protocol/mechanism of some
        sort on top of X.25.  The most common being UUCP "f" protocol
        (through PADS or dialup), or "x" with direct X.25 connects.

        Whether you use X.25 or phones plus modems depends on a number
        of factors - usually the determining factor is cost.  In North
        America, high speed modems (eg: 9600 baud and above) over telephone
        lines tends to be less expensive.  However, Europe's really
        wierd phone system structure usually makes X.25 more cost-effective,
        and therefore, X.25 use in UNIX mail systems is much more common
        in Europe than North America.

        X.29 is the command set used to configure and establish
        X.25 connections when you're using asynchronous connections
        to a PAD.

Networks:

    Internet:
        An "internet" is a network comprised of computers that talk
        to each other using TCP/IP, and usually SMTP for mail.

        The "Internet" is a vast network of hundreds of thousands of
        machines using SMTP protocol mail, communicating with
        each other over relatively high speed lines.  But not all
        "internets" are connected to *the* Internet.

        The Internet grew out of a US government funded project in
        inter-computer communications that grew into an enormous network
        of systems.

        One of the principle characteristics of this network is that
        machines are addressed by domain names which identify the
        destination, rather than addresses that are constructed out
        of the route from machine-to-machine-to-machine.

    UUCP Network:
        The UUCP network is that set of machines that talk to each other
        via UUCP.  Sending mail through this network requires that the sender
        know the network topology of UUCP links, and specify a path from one
        machine to the next.  (There are, of course, ways around this.
        See the section on "do's and don'ts".)

Mail addresses:

    Addresses:
        An email address is a method of specifying a given person on
        a specific machine.  There are scads of conventions, usually
        determined by the presence of "@"'s, "!"'s and other special
        characters in the name.  An address usually consists of
        two parts: a userid/name and a machine specification.

        A Domain address usually looks like:
            userid@domain-address
        Whereas a UUCP address usually looks like:
            siteA!siteB!siteC!userid

    Domain Addresses:
        Domains are a way of uniquely specifying a destination.
        Much like a postal address, a domain specifies a set of
        progressively more restrictive "domains" of the potential
        address space.  It would perhaps be illustrative to give an
        example:

            clewis@ferret.marketing.fooinc.com

        You read these things right to left: "com" means the
        commercial domain.  "fooinc" is the name of an organization
        within the commercial domain.  "Marketing" is the name of a
        suborganization within fooinc, and ferret gives the name of
        a machine (usually).  Domains can have any number of levels.

        The top level domain (com in the above example) has many
        possible values.  In the United States, "com", "mil", "edu",
        and "gov" are fairly standard.  Elsewhere, the top level
        domain tends to be a country code, the second level tends to
        be a province or state, OR a classification like "edu" or "ac"
        for academic (such as ac.jp, go.jp, ac.uk, edu.au, etc)
        and the third an organization.  But, for example, there are
        many .com and .edu sites in Canada and other countries.

    FQDN
        A fully-qualified-domain-name (FQDN) has a entry for each
        level of the domain, from individual machine to top-level
        domain.  In many cases, an organization has implemented an
        organizational "gateway" at a higher level of domain, so
        that people from outside don't have to specify FQDN's to get
        to a specific person.  In the above example, for instance,
        "fooinc.com" may be sufficient to get to anyone inside
        fooinc, and "ferret.marketing" may not be necessary.

        On the other hand, people sometimes leave out the higher
        levels of the address, as in "ferret.marketing".
        This is a bad idea - because if the mail is cc'd out of the
        organization, chances are the external recipient cannot reply,
        because "ferret.marketing" is incomplete.  So use addresses
        that are specified sufficiently for external users to use.
        (fooinc.com if a organizational gateway is used, the whole
        ferret.marketing.fooinc.com if not)

    NIC
        Internet TOP-LEVEL domains (edu, com, gov, mil) are controlled
        by a single organization, the NIC (internic.net).  An organization
        "gets a piece" of the namespace by registering with the NIC, and
        then they are free to administer their own namespace (everything
        under fooinc.com) as they choose.  The same is true for foreign
        countries; Once they have their top-level domain (usually the
        two-letter ISO country code) registered with the NIC, they do
        the rest, and divide it as they see fit.
 
        In contrast, on UUCPnet, all machine names everywhere share a
        single flat namespace.  So it is important to choose a name
        that has not been used before. (See do's and don'ts).  This is
        why FQDN's help.  We can tell the difference between
        ferret.fooinc.com and ferret.blah.edu by their full names.
        (Instead of UUCP paths which may turn out to be wrong, and
        autorouting will probably send the mail to the wrong machine)

    MX record:
        A non-SMTP/Internet site that wishes to register on the Internet
        will need to get a "nearby" Internet site to set up a MX
        record for them.  An MX record is essentially a domain-server
        database record that (effectively) registers your domain name
        on the Internet, and indicates that the Internet site knows
        how to forward mail to you.  Usually via some non-SMTP/Internet
        route, such as UUCP.  You can get an MX record for one site, or
        a "wildcard" MX record so that you can have your own subdomains.

    Bang-Paths:
        With UUCP mail, the MTA has to specify a route to get from one
        machine to another.  "A!B!C!userid" means go to machine A,
        then B, then C, then user "userid" on C.  You should strive,
        however, for a MUA that allows you to use domain addressing,
        and let the MTA figure out the bang routing as appropriate.

Miscellaneous:

    Gateways:
        There are several meanings of this term, only three are relevant
        here.

        The first is a mechanism for getting from one network to another
        network that uses different protocols.

        The second is a mechanism for getting from one logical (often
        organizational) network to another using the same protocol.
        Often for example, there will be a LAN in one department of
        an organization, and one machine in the LAN has the connection
        to another LAN in another department.  This means that mail from
        one LAN to the other has to pass thru the gateway machine.

        Another form, which we'll mention later is that of mail to
        news gatewaying.

    Routers:
        There are several definitions, but the most important is that
        part of the TA that figures out how to send a message to
        a given machine.  This often uses a database that provides
        routes from one machine to the other machines on the network.

    Smarthost:
        In many cases, your machine won't know how to get to a specific
        destination.  You can usually set up your mail system to send mail,
        that it doesn't know how to deliver, to a machine that is more
        likely to.

    RFC's:
        A set of documents that include formal descriptions of mail
        formats used on the Internet, and are adhered to by many
        non-Internet systems.  More specifically, in the "worldnet"
        of Usenet, Internet and UUCP, the RFC's set the standards
        for mail exchange.  RFC822, 1123 and 976 are the most important
        for Internet/UUCP mail.

        It should be pointed out, however, that there are some
        regions where the RFC's are not entirely respected.  For example,
        the British academic email networks (JANET) uses domains, but
        they're specified backwards (they drive on the wrong side of
        the road too ;-).

    MIME:
        Mime is the official proposed standard format for multimedia Internet
        mail encapsulated inside standard Internet RFC 822 messages.  Facilities
        include sending multiple objects in a single message, character sets
        other than US-Ascii, multi-font text messages, non-textual material
        such as images and audio fragments, and other extensions.  For an
        overview of Mime, see ftp.uu.net:networking/mail/metamail/MIME-overview.txt.Z.
        The defining document is Internet RFC 1341: N Borenstein & N Freed,
        ``Mime (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) mechanisms for specifying
        and describing the format of Internet message bodies'' (June 1992).
        Also see RFC 1344: N Borenstein, ``Implications of Mime for Internet
        mail gateways'' (June 1992).
        RFC1341 and 1342 have since been superceded by RFC 1521 and 1522.

        Mime covers only message bodies, not message headers; to see how to
        represent non-Ascii characters in message headers, see Internet
        RFC 1342: K Moore, ``Representation of non-Ascii text in Internet
        message headers'' (June 1992).
    
    X.400:
        A CCITT standard for email formats, more or less an alternative
        to RFC 822/976/1123.  This format will probably start taking over
        from RFC 822/976/1123 mail.  It is likely to (already has?) become an
        ISO/IEEE standard along with OSI etc.

    "The Maps":
        A set of files describing machine-to-machine links distributed
        over Usenet in the group comp.mail.maps.  These are usually posted
        on a monthly schedule, and can be automatically received and
        transformed into a routing database that describes the "optimal"
        route to each machine.  These are operated by the "UUCP Mapping
        Project".  See the README posted along with the maps for
        more details.

    Aliases:
        Aliases are a mechanism by which you can specify the destination
        for mail on your machine.  Through the use of aliases you can
        redirect mail to "virtual userids".  For example, you should
        have a mail destination on your machine called "postmaster", which
        is aliased to send the mail to the System Administrator (ie: you
        probably).  Aliasing often also permits you to send mail to groups
        of users (not necessarily on the same machine as you) pipelines of
        commands or to specific files.

    Mailing lists:
        Are similar to Usenet newsgroups.  They are usually aliases
        pointing to groups of users, and allow mail to be sent to the
        whole group at once.  Mailing lists are set up to carry certain
        subjects.  The difference between a mailing list and a Usenet
        newsgroup is that the messages are sent by mail, probably as
        a copy to each recipient, rather than broadcast.

------------------------------
Subject: Do's and Don'ts:

1) Register a domain name.  Even on UUCP, where <machine>.UUCP is often
   used as a kludge, it is MUCH preferred that you obtain a real
   domain address.  If you are directly connecting to the Internet,
   you will get one as part of your registration with the NIC.

   If you aren't connecting directly to the Internet, obtaining a
   registration will usually require you finding a nearby friendly
   Internet site willing to act as a mail forwarder to you from
   the Internet - the site that will set up a "MX record" for you.
   Many sites will do this for you for free, and several of the
   commercial email services (eg: uunet) will do it for you for a
   nominal charge (without requiring you buy the rest of their
   services).

   There are occasions where you can join what is called a "domain
   park".  These are most often small regional groups of systems that
   have gotten one of their number properly registered as a domain,
   and provides forwarding services out to other systems.  For
   example, in my address "ferret.ocunix.on.ca", "ocunix.on.ca"
   is a domain park made up of the Ottawa-Carleton UNIX User's Group,
   one of the other machines in the group provides a gateway between
   our systems and the Internet.

2) If your machine is going to "speak" UUCP to the outside world,
   choose a unique UUCP name.  You can find out whether a name you
   want is taken by consulting the UUCP maps.  Or by asking someone
   else who's using them.

3) Register your machine with the UUCP Mapping Project if you're going
   to use UUCP.  Information on how to do this is included in the
   monthly maps postings in the file "README".  This is usually only
   required when your machine talks UUCP to the outside world, or when
   other machines have to address you by your UUCP name.  If you don't
   do this, somone else may choose the same name, and gross confusion
   will arise when smart routers won't be able to tell whether to send
   a piece of mail to you, or your doppelganger[s].  If you register
   with the UUCP Mapping Project, you have prior use, and people who
   choose the same name afterwards will be told to get a new one.
   
   If you're "behind" an organizational gateway, don't do this.
   (Your organizational gateway is the thing that needs to be
   registered)

   If you do fill in a map, please take the time to fill it in
   carefully, giving contact people and phone numbers.  Just in
   case your machine goes crazy and starts doing something nasty.
   Note expecially the latitude and longitude.  Get it right,
   or omit it.  Brian Reid gets really annoyed with sites that
   are half a world away from where they really are.

4) If you're going to be setting up multiple machines, have only
   one or two connections to the outside world.

5) Install a mail system that understands domain addressing, even
   if you aren't registered.  (In fact, all of the suggested
   configurations in this FAQ do)

6) *Never* use UUCP bang-routing with the MUA if you can possibly
   avoid it - each of the suggested mail configurations provide
   mechanisms where you, the user, do not have to specify routes 
   to the MUA - you can specify domains, and the TA will do the
   routing (possibly bang-routing) for you.

   Important: many mailers that understand UUCP attempt to be
   pedantically "UUCPish" in the construction of headers, such
   as generating "bang routes" in From:/To: etc. lines.  Which,
   given that the whole "mail network" is generally converging on
   more Internet-like standards, and that even UUCP sites are
   using fully domain-capable mailers, is a big mistake.  RFC976
   attempts to codify a "meta standard" that allows the coexistance
   of RFC822/1036 (Internet mail) with UUCP-based networks.  What
   this means is, essentially, that headers are formed in the
   SMTP form, even if the transport will be via UUCP.  Unfortunately,
   however, many mailers insist on "UUCP-izing" perfectly useable
   Internet/domain headers.  "Fixing" them to prevent this is sometimes
   difficult.  Sendmail is almost always a problem in this regard.

7) Find a friendly neighboring SA to help.  A SA who has already
   operating mail in your area will help smooth over the regional
   "gotchas" that are bound to crop-up.  And advise you on the
   right software to use, where to obtain it, and how to install it.

8) Do NOT use "any old" Map unpacking program.  Most available
   map unpacking programs automatically run the shell (or shar)
   to unpack map articles.  Since it is trivially easy to forge
   map articles, using this type of unpacking program can
   easily let very destructive trojan horse or virus programs
   into your machine.

   The two specific map unpackers described in this FAQ are known
   to be secure from such attacks.  Do not run any other unpacker
   unless you are aware of the issues and can inspect the code for
   such vulnerabilities.  [If you know of other "secure" map
   unpackers that are generally available, please let me know]

9) If the people on your site, or small network, receive mailing
   lists, it's often a good idea to gateway them to news:

   Netnews often performs many of the same services as email.
   The primary difference is that messages are centrally stored,
   rather than delivered to individual's mailboxes, and that
   distribution looks more like a broadcast then a set of point-to-point
   communications.  This means usually means that news can handle more
   volume, more efficiently, then email can.

   Because of the differences (and also the similarities) people often
   want to tie news and mail together.  This is known as "gatewaying."
   For example, a small software development site might subscribe to the
   X Windows mailing list.  Rather than have (say) eight copies of each
   mail message sent to their host, they would rather have it stored as a
   local newsgroup that everyone in the company can read, and which can
   be centrally archived.  This is a typical use of a "mail to news"
   gateway.  When a user makes a posting to this local group the article
   should be sent back out to the mailing list; this is a typical use of
   a "news to mail" gateway.

   On a larger scale, the "inet" groups are bi-directional gateways of
   Internet mailing lists.  Within mainstream Usenet, many popular
   groups such as comp.windows.x, comp.protocols.tcp-ip, comp.unix.wizards,
   and so on, are gatewayed to mailing lists and back.

   Many subtle issues often come up when gatewaying mail and news, so
   unless you are experienced you should use one of the already-available
   packages for your local organization.  For example, you probably do not
   want to write a brand-new Perl script and create a new "inet" newsgroup.
   The C News distribution includes some basic gateway tools in the
   contrib/nntpmail directory.  Many people use Rich $alz's "newsgate"
   package that appeared in comp.sources.unix Volume 24; it includes
   discussion of some of the more subtle issues that come up.

   Before starting a mailing list gateway, apart from the technical aspect
   of the job you should also be aware of one important point: mailing-lists
   are considered private, whereas newsgroups are public.
    
   One can know who gets a list, but not who reads the group. It is always
   wise to get the authorization of the mailing-list manager and of the readers
   before creating a mail/news gateway.

10) If you're connecting to the Internet, or are setting up a large local
   internet, you really should get a copy of the DNS and BIND book mentioned
   in the bibliography.

Subject: Configuration Issues:

What you need for email connectivity is determined by:

    1 What networks you intend to connect to.
      The Internet (hence SMTP)?  UUCP sites?  X.400?
      Bitnet?  Others?  Combinations?
    2 What links you have or are willing to install
      Internet T1?  T2?  UUCP?  Other?  [Details on how to
      make your connections is beyond the scope of this FAQ,
      but can usually be found out from the provider (other end)
      of the link]
    3 what user interface you want to use.  This is largely
      an independent issue, so consult the Specific Package
      Reviews directly.

------------------------------
Subject: Recommended MTA Configurations:

These configurations are based upon my own experience, and the
experience of others.  Careful installation of any of these
configurations will result in a solid, reliable mail system
that respects the appropriate "do's and don'ts".  Each configuration
represents a compromise of ease of installation and maintenance
versus sophistication and capabilities.

One thing you should consider is what you already have on your
system.  You will invariably have "binmail", and will have a good
chance at already having sendmail.  Some systems come with
smail (if 2.3, junk it)  The configurations shown below are *minimal*
configurations, so you should consider whether you want to use what
you already have or not.

Scenario 1:  Only UUCP connections.

    Smail 2.5.  If you want to set up a routing database of
    your own, you will also need pathalias, and unpackmaps or
    uuhosts.  Instead, though, you can configure smail 2.5 to
    smart-host most destinations to a nearby friendly site
    who'll do your routing for you without having to run
    the routing software.  Note further, that you can run
    pathalias on just a subset of the full set of maps.
    [Unpackmaps makes this particularly easy to do]

    Smail 2.5, as shipped, does not support mail-to-pipeline
    or mail-to-file aliasing.  If you need these, at a minimum,
    you should obtain lmail.  If you intend more than casual
    use of these features, it is recommended that you obtain
    deliver or procmail instead of lmail.

    Even if you have sendmail already, you can integrate smail 2.5
    with it to do your UUCP routing.  (though, some later versions
    of sendmail can do routing themselves)

    If you're a little more demanding of your mail connections, smail 3
    is also a good choice, and works particularly well for systems that
    are UUCP connected to Internet sites.

Scenario 2:  SMTP connections (optionally, some UUCP connections too).

    Generally speaking, sendmail will do this for you and you have
    a good chance to have it already.  However, for the novice, it
    is recommended that smail 3 be used instead [see review of
    sendmail below].  Smail 3 includes all of the routing software
    and can do mail-to-pipeline and mail-to-file, so none of the auxiliary
    programs mentioned in scenario 1 are necessary.

    Most sendmails don't include UUCP routing mechanisms, so you would
    need pathalias and unpackmaps or uuhosts if you wish to set up
    a UUCP routing database.  Further, most sendmails don't know
    how to query a pathalias database directly, so you may have to hack
    your own path lookup program into the sendmail.cf (smail 2.5 can
    be used for this purpose provided that you will have a UUCP link
    to the outside world)

    Both MMDF and PP can also be used, but PP is usually overkill.

    Deliver or procmail are still quite useful in this configuration
    for extended alias facilities.

Scenario 3:  Connections to other networks (optionally including
    SMTP or UUCP), or very high loading.

    Your best bets are MMDF, PP or zmailer.
    
    You can implement other network interfaces with sendmail, but
    not only will you probably have to roll your own, but sendmail
    can't cope with high loading very well.  Ditto smail 3.

There are other configurations.  See the Package Reviews to
determine which packages are appropriate.

------------------------------
Subject: Package Reviews

Honesty requires me to point out which software packages were
reviewed by their author (including me ;-).  I do so by appending
a "*" to the name of the author.  In some cases, the material
has been cribbed from FAQ's or general information blurbs.

It is worth noting, though, that most of these packages are well
known, and have been in operation at many sites for periods of
a year or more.  These packages do their job well, and have been
extensively thrashed out in the best debugging laboratory in the
universe (Usenet ;-)

A few packages have been mentioned prior to their release.
(unpackmaps 4, the occasional beta version).  It is
recommended that these versions be avoided by novices until they
have had a chance to settle for a little while.  This FAQ will
note when such software seems (according to rumour *I* hear) to be
stable enough for general use.

Some of these packages are capable, by various bits of hackery,
of doing a lot more than is claimed for them.  But I refrain
on telling you how to "take the covers off".  Given the
intended audience, that would be tantamount to trying to
teach preschoolers do-it-yourself brain surgery.  Please don't
take this as condescending - I've been working on/in/with email
systems for over 12 years and I *still* won't play with (as
just one example) sendmail.cf's.

Therefore, I restrict myself largely to "out-of-the-box" functionality,
"fill-in-the-blank" configurability, and normal documented installation
procedures.  Beyond that, you're on your own.

binmail

    binmail is usually really called "mail". On System V prior to
    Release 4, it is a really simple UA that does dual duty as the
    TA.  It's pretty awful because it doesn't know how to set up
    headers properly, doesn't even know what a "Subject:" line is,
    and there's no way to do any kind of aliases.

    On BSD, binmail invokes sendmail to do the MTA function.  On
    System V prior to Release 4, you really do want to replace binmail's
    MTA functionality with something else.  However, you should not
    replace it in its "mail" (UA) functionality, because many
    system-level administration mechanisms will break.  Any new UA
    should be installed as a different name than "mail".

    Beginning with System V Release 4, "binmail"'s transfer agent
    capabilities were considerably enhanced to have similar capabilities
    to Smail 3 and sendmail.  There is usually no need to replace it with
    another mail agent.  (See SVR4 mail discussion below)

    Binmail stores mail in "mbox" format.

rmail

    binmail's TA functionality is implemented by linking mail
    to rmail.  It's rmail that you'd want to replace with smail 2.5
    etc.

Mail

    The original BSD UA.  It can support local profiles, aliases, folders,
    header previewing, out-going mail recording and all sorts of good stuff.
    An "okay" UA.  Available from BSD "freed-sources" archives.

    Mail stores mail in "mbox" format.

mailx

    AT&T's answer to BSD "Mail", from which it is descended.  Some versions,
    such as the 3b1 one, should be avoided because of a buggy port.  Not
    available in source form (it's proprietary but ubiquitous enough to be
    mentioned here).

    Mailx stores mail in "mbox" format.

mush: author Dan Heller* <argv@well.com>

    The "Mail User's Shell" is a "shell" for mail users.  That is, it
    has its own environment where you can configure not only the user
    interface, but the actual internal mechanisms.  Internally, mush
    has a csh-like scripting language, altho it's not as powerful as
    csh.  It has command-line aliases, file completion, if-else state-
    ments, command piping, and so on.  Because you can build your own
    commands, you can virtually build your own library of email features.

    Mush has two tty-based interfaces: the standard tty-mode (ala BSD
    Mail or sys-v mailx) and the fullscreen/curses mode (ala vi, emacs
    or even Elm).  You can set up key bindings that execute one or more
    mush commands, personalized commands or even UNIX commands.  You
    can even emulate keyboard input with keyboard macros and mappings.

    Mush also has a SunView interface that is more powerful than Sun's
    Mailtool, yet backwards compatible with most versions.  Most sunview
    users (if there are any left these days) prefer MushView over Mailtool.

    The current version of Mush is 7.2.3, last posted in comp.sources.misc
    volume 18 (with subsequent patches).  All three interfaces are
    available in one runtime binary.  Except for the MushView interface
    (which is only available on for suns), Mush is portable to everything
    that runs UNIX.  There is also a DOS port available for PCs and can
    run on most 286 machines. An older version of Mush (6.5) can run on
    as little as 640 of RAM.  (Mush-PC is typically used with UUPC.)

    The "next generation" of Mush is a commercial product called Z-Mail
    from Z-Code Software (mail info@z-code.com for details).  All aspects
    of Mush are retained, yet it has grown to be far more powerful.  It
    runs under X windows with either a Motif or Open Look interface
    and also supports multi-media, user "functions" and a suite of new
    features.

    Mush stores its messages in "mbox" format, or MMDF format if you're
    using MMDF as your MTA.

    The newsgroup comp.mail.mush is dedicated to it.

    [Note: Z-Mail is not related at all to Zmailer.  Zmailer is a MTA]

elm: coordinator Syd Weinstein* <syd@DSI.COM>

    (cribbed from comp.mail.elm FAQ)

    Elm is designed to run with "sendmail" or "/bin/rmail"
    (according to what's on your system) and is a full
    replacement of programs like "/bin/mail" and "mailx".  The
    system is more than just a single program, however, and
    includes programs like "frm" to list a 'table of contents'
    of your mail, "printmail" to quickly paginate mail files (to
    allow 'clean' printouts), and "autoreply", a systemwide
    daemon that can autoanswer mail for people while they're on
    vacation without having multiple copies spawned on the
    system.

    The most significant difference between Elm and most other
    mail systems is that Elm is screen-oriented.  Upon further
    use, however, users will find that Elm is also quite a bit
    easier to use, and quite a bit more "intelligent" about
    sending mail and so on.

    Current release is Elm 2.4 PL24..  Information on access is
    available from the server at DSI.COM:
        send mail to archive-server@DSI.COM
        send elm index

    [Ed: elm is particularly good for novices.  The only drawback
    that I've heard is that elm is a bit less user configurable than,
    say, mush]

MM: Contact Joseph Brennan* <info-mm@cunixf.cc.columbia.edu>
                Columbia University in the City of New York

    (cribbed from MM man page.)

    mm is a powerful electronic mail system which allows you to send, read,
    edit and manage messages quickly and easily.  It is designed to have the
    same interface as the MM program written and developed for DEC20s over a
    period of many years.

    mm was written using the CCMD package developed at Columbia.  Thus, it
    has copious internal help, completion of partially typed commands on use
    of the TAB key, and help on partial commands when ? is typed.

    mm can read several mail-file formats.  Its default is mbox, the same
    format used by unix mail.  It also can read babyl, used by emacs rmail,
    and mtxt and MH.  It can copy messages from one file type to another.

    MM is a Freeware MUA copyright by Columbia University (as is this
    description).

    MM is available by anonymous ftp from cunixf.cc.columbia.edu, directory mm.
    The file mm-intro.txt there is a longer description of how it was developed.

    [Ed: MM also appears to be a good UA for novices.  From the examples
    in the manual page, it handholds extensively and is not screen oriented.]

MH: Maintainer John Romine <Bug-MH@ics.uci.edu>

    The big difference between MH and most other "mail user agents" is
    that you can use MH from a UNIX shell prompt.  In MH, each command
    is a separate program, and the shell is used as an interpreter.  So,
    all the power of UNIX shells (pipes, redirection, history, aliases,
    and so on) works with MH--you don't have to learn a new interface.
    other mail agents have their own command interpreter for their
    individual mail commands (although the mush mail agent simulates a
    UNIX shell).  Mail messages are stored in individual files.

    The current version of MH is 6.8.3 and supports MIME.  MH comes
    standard with Ultrix 4.0 and later, and AIX 3.1 and later.

    comp.mail.mh discusses MH, and contains a FAQ article.

    Jerry Peek wrote a book about MH called "MH & xmh: E-mail for Users &
    Programmers", ISBN 1-56592-027-9, published by O'Reilly and Associates,
    second edition, September 1992.

XMH: <extracted from the manual page>

     The xmh program provides a graphical user interface  to  the
     MH Message Handling System.  To actually do things with your
     mail, it makes calls to the  MH  package.   Electronic  mail
     messages  may  be composed, sent, received, replied to, for-
     warded, sorted, and stored in folders.  xmh provides  exten-
     sive mechanism for customization of the user interface.

     xmh is part of the standard X distribution from the X Consortium.

EXMH: Author Brent Welch* <welch@parc.xerox.com>
     exmh is an X interface to the MH mail system.  It is written in John
     Ousterhout's Tcl/Tk language system and requires that you have both
     Tcl/Tk and MH installed.  If you have metamail installed, exmh
     supports MIME.

    As well as providing the usual layer on top of MH commands, exmh
    has a number of other features:

        MIME support!  Displays richtext and enriched directly.  Parses
        multipart messages.  Displays hot buttons that invoke external viewers
        (metamail) for things not directly supported.  Built-in editor allows
        simple composition of text/enriched format.

        Color feedback in the scan listing so you can easily identify
        unseen messages (blue), the current message (red), deleted
        messages (gray background), and moved messages (yellow background).
        Xresources control these color choices.

        A folder display with one label per folder.  Color highlights
        indicate the current folder (red), folders with unseen messages
        in them (blue), and the target folder for moves (yellow background).
        Nested folders are highlighted by a shadow box.  A cache of
        recently visted folder buttons is also maintained.  Monochrome
        highlights are reverse video for the current folder, bold box
        for folders with unseen messages, and stippled box for the
        target of move operations.

        Clever scan caching.  MH users know that scan is slow, so
        exmh tries hard to cache the current state of the folder to
        avoid scanning.  Moves and deletes within exmh do not
        invalidate the cache, and background incs that add new messages
        are handled by merging them into the scan listing.  The
        scan cache is compatible with xmh.

        Numerous other features, such as "facesaver" display, backgrounds,
        dialog-box interface to MH "pick", folder searching and listing,
        designed for inclusion of user "hooks" and interfaces etc.

GNU Emacs Rmail:

    Rmail is an Emacs subsystem for reading and disposing of mail.  Rmail
    stores mail messages in Rmail files in BABYL format (originally used
    under the ITS operating system), although it can incorporate new mail
    from MMDF and Unix format files, or mixed-format files.  Reading the
    messages in an Rmail file is done in a special major mode, Rmail mode,
    which redefines most letters to run commands for managing mail.
 
    Rmail can do the standard things such as displaying, deleting, filing,
    or replying to messages.  Replying uses another Emacs subsystem, Mail
    mode.  Messages can be saved in either BABYL or Unix format.  Rmail
    maintains per-message attributes and user-defined labels.  Rmail can
    burst message digests.

VM: Author Kyle Jones* <kyle@uunet.uu.net>

    VM (View Mail) is a GNU Emacs subsystem that allows UNIX mail to be read
    and disposed of within Emacs.  Commands exist to do the normal things
    expected of a mail user agent, such as generating replies, saving
    messages to folders, deleting messages and so on.  There are other more
    advanced commands that do tasks like bursting and creating digests,
    message forwarding, and organizing message presentation according to
    various criteria.

    The current version of VM is VM 4.41.
    FTPable from:

      ftp.uu.net                        networking/mail/vm-5.72beta.tar.gz
    archive.cis.ohio-state.edu  pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/packages/vm-4.41.tar.Z

    VM is discussed in gnu.emacs.vm.info, or by mailing list by sending
    an e-mail request to info-vm-request@uunet.uu.net.

MH-E: Maintainer: Stephen Gildea <gildea@bbn.com>

    MH-E is an interface to MH from within GNU Emacs.  It helps if MH was
    compiled with the MHE compiler flag.  MH-E is distributed with both GNU
    Emacs and MH.  Choose the later version.

C-Client: Author Mark Crispin <mrc@panda.com>

    Software writers only:

    C-client is a general library useful for creating MUA's.  It provides
    a high level logical interface for retrieving and manipulating
    mail messages.  It supports the latest draft of MIME (proposed
    Internet standard for multipart, multimedia, typed electronic mail).
    It is driver based, and easily ported to new platforms and MTA's,
    already supports BSD, SysV, DOS, Macintosh and TOPS-20(!),
    and supports present mail and mailbox formats.

    Just the thing if you want to write a new MUA.

    Contact the author for more details.

Metamail: Author N. Borenstein
    [Described by Paul Eggert, eggert@bi.twinsun.com]

    Metamail is a software implementation of Mime, designed for easy
    integration with traditional mail-reading interfaces -- typically,
    users do not invoke metamail directly.  Ideally, extending the local
    email or news system to handle a new media format is a simple matter
    of adding a line to a mailcap file.  Mailcap files are described in
    RFC 1343: N Borenstein, ``A user agent configuration mechanism for
    multimedia mail format information'' (June 1992).  The source code
    for metamail can be found in ftp.uu.net:mail/metamail/mm.tar.Z.
    To join its mailing list, write info-metamail-request@thumper.bellcore.com.


MailManager: Author Mark Crispin <mrc@panda.com>

    A MUA implemented using C-Client for NeXT computers.

Pine: Authors Lundblade, Seibel, and Crispin <pine@cac.washington.edu>

    Pine is a mailer developed by the University of Washington Office of
    Computing and Communications. It has been designed for ease-of-use and
    with the novice computer user in mind. It is based on Internet mail
    protocols (e.g. RFC-822, SMTP, IMAP, and MIME) and currently runs on
    a variety of UNIX platforms, and a version is apparently available for
    MSDOS. 

    The guiding principles for achieving ease-of-use in Pine were:
    careful limitation of features, one-character mnemonic commands,
    always-present command menus, immediate user feedback, and high
    tolerance for user mistakes. It is intended that Pine can be learned
    by exploration rather than reading manuals.

    A stand-alone version of Pico, Pine's message composition editor, is also
    included. It is a very simple and easy to use text editor with text
    justification and a spelling checker. 

    Features:
       - Mail index showing a message summary which includes the status, 
         sender, size, date and subject of messages.

       - View and process mail with the following commands:  forward, reply, 
         save, export, print, delete, capture address and search.

       - Address book for saving long complex addresses and personal 
         distribution lists under a nickname. 

       - Multiple folders and folder management screen for filing messages.

       - Message composer with easy-to-use editor and spelling checker.
         The message composer also assists entering and formatting
         addresses and provides direct access to the address book.

       - Online help specific to each screen and context.

       - Supports access to remote mail repositories via the IMAP2 protocol
         defined in RFC-1176.
         
       - Soon to support multi-part mail conforming to proposed MIME Internet
         standard, allowing sending of sounds, graphics such as GIF and TIFF
         files, and binary files such as spreadsheets. 

    Pine, including source code, is freely available via anonymous FTP from
    ftp.cac.washington.edu on the Internet. Other provisions for distribution
    have not been made. From the Internet, you may try out Pine and leave
    comments by telneting to "demo.cac.washington.edu" and logging in as
    "pinedemo". To join the Pine mailing list for announcements send a 
    email request to "majordomo@cac.washington.edu" with body
    "subscribe pine-info". 

    Pine is very portable and runs on a variety of UNIX machines including
    DECstations, NeXTs, VAX's and Suns. Pine was originally based on Elm, 
    but it has evolved much since, ("Pine Is No-longer Elm"). 

    For further information send e-mail to pine@cac.washington.edu. Pine is
    the work of Mike Siebel, Mark Crispin, and Laurence Lundblade at the
    University of Washington. 

Ream: Author: Paul Dourish* <dourish@europarc.xerox.com>

    Ream is a curses-based mail user agent for a variety of UNIX flavours;
    at one time or another, it's run on everything from a PC running Linux
    to a Cray Y/MP running UNICOS. It was originally written at the
    University of Edinburgh, and has spread not least through the
    subsequent geographical distribution of alumni. It remains minimally
    supported by its author (Paul Dourish <dourish@europarc.xerox.com>).

    Ream is similar to elm in a number of ways, but considerably smaller
    and with a stronger separation between MUA and MTA behaviours. It runs
    over sendmail, mmdf and PP. It is available by anonymous ftp from
    parcftp.xerox.com, in pub/europarc/reamXXX.tar.Z, where XXX is a
    slowly incrementing version number.

XLView: Author: Several.  Mike Macgirvin* <mtm@camis.stanford.edu>

    Current version 1.1 (Developer Release).  XLView (previously known as
    "Ximap") is an X based mail reader using the IMAP (IMAP2bis) protocol,
    for managing complex mail tasks.  It utilizes the X window system to
    allow independant processing of multiple mailboxes (even on multiple
    servers) simultaneously.  Each "read" and "compose" process is handled
    in an independant window as well.  It handles many complex MIME messages
    with the help of external multi-media handlers based partially on
    "metamail", and include facilities for file attachments of several
    common types.  It includes an address book with insert completion
    abilities and for maintaining addresses.  Of course it has the normal
    move/copy/save/reply/forward/print etc., functions one would expect and
    text may be cut and pasted from other open X sessions.  The most
    powerful feature of the latest release is the "Logical Viewer" which
    allows one to create rule based sorting of their mailbox based on
    addresses, dates, contents, message flags and other criteria.  Each
    existing message (and each new message) is evaluated and stored in the
    appropriate logical view, which may be opened as if it were a separate
    mailbox (but all the while it only represents a different ``view'' of
    your system mailbox).  Each mailbox or saved folder may have independant
    rulesets.  Status changes also are evaluated as they occur and the rules
    applied accordingly.  The rule language is powerful, yet easy to grasp;
    i.e.

Z-Mail: Z-code Software Corp, Barbara Tallent* <tallent@ncd.com>

    Z-Mail, a UNIX World Magazine "Product of the Year" winner for
    1991, is a complete electronic mail system for workstations, PCs,
    ASCII terminals and Macs.  Z-Mail provides Motif and Open Look
    graphical user interfaces, as well as two character modes.  The
    software has been ported to nearly every system that runs UNIX, and
    it works with all standard UNIX mail transport agents including
    sendmail, binmail, smail, MMDF and X.400 gateways.  Z-Mail can
    replace or coexist with standard mail user agents on the system,
    including BSD Mail, AT&T mailx, Sun Mail Tool, Elm or Mush.  Most
    anyone can use Z-Mail "off the shelf" and immediately benefit from
    its simple interface and advanced features.

   The 'fullscreen' character mode has become its own product, Z-Mail Lite.
   It's available immediately.

    Z-Mail also includes Z-Script, a powerful scripting language that
    enables users to customize and extend Z-Mail's capabilities.  Z-Mail's
    multi-media capabilities allow easy integration with best-of-class
    products including spreadsheets, desk-top publishing, graphics, fax,
    voice, and video.  For example, when users receive a spreadsheet file,
    Z-Mail can be configured to automatically launch the associated
    application and load the the attachment automatically and transparently
    to the user.  Z-Mail understands MIME-format documents and is also
    compatible with Sun's multimedia Mailtool.

uumail:

    Uumail is a very old and obsolete precursor to smail 2.5.  Included
    here only because I know that uumail sites still exist.  You
    should not install uumail in new configurations, and existing
    uumail sites should convert to something more modern.

smail 2.5: author The UUCP Mapping Project

    Smail 2.5 is a small, simple and hard-coded rule MTA for use on
    UUCP networks.  It understands RFC compliant headers, will
    generate RFC compliant Internet-style headers, can
    use domains, aliases, a pathalias UUCP routing database, and
    is very simple to install.  For full functionality, you will
    also want pathalias and a map unpacker.  The one thing
    it cannot do by itself is mail-to-pipe and mail-to-file aliasing.
    For that, you need Zeeff's lmail, deliver or procmail.

    Smail 2.5 has the capability of coalescing addresses into single
    UUCP transfers, and knows how to query UUCP for the names
    of UUCP neighbors, and autoroute if necessary.

    Smail 2.5 has a few bugs that are (usually) pretty rarely seen
    in operation.  There have been a number of patches posted for it,
    but it is recommended that you do not apply them - some were
    ill-conceived, buggy in their own right, or conflicting with others.
    The only patches that I feel safe in recommending is Chip
    Salzenberg's patches for use with Xenix MICNET - which are
    unnecessary unless you are in the unfortunate position of having
    to actually *use* MICNET.  Chip Salzenberg's "deliver" package
    (see below) combined with "smail-deliver.pch" from comp.sources.unix,
    volume 25 issue 107, makes the MICNET modifications to smail
    itself unnecessary.

    In particular, do not apply the "mail-to-pipe/file" patches that
    float around for smail 2.5.  These are a major security hole.

    Smail 2.5 can also be used with sendmail as a UUCP router.

    Smail 2.5 was posted in comp.sources.unix in 1987, volume 11
    with archive name "smail3" (but it isn't the same thing as
    smail 3 below).

lmail: Author Jon Zeeff <zeeff@b-tech.ann-arbor.mi.us, zeeff@ais.org>

    When you install smail 2.5, you link the original /bin/mail (binmail
    above) to /bin/lmail to perform the task of actually delivering the
    mail to the user's mailbox (LDA).

    Since smail 2.5 was not capable of doing mail-to-pipe and mail-to-file
    aliasing, Jon Zeeff wrote a replacement lmail that implemented
    these (along with user mailbox delivery).

    Jon's program is okay for casual use, but has some pretty serious
    bugs.  Fixed versions are available, but you're probably better
    off installing deliver or procmail.

smail 3: Author Ronald S. Karr* <tron@veritas.com> and Landon Curt Noll.

    Smail3.1 is a domain-capable mail router and delivery program that
    works in the UUCP zone and on the Internet and that is capable of
    gatewaying between the two.  It was written primarily by me (Ronald
    S.  Karr) and Landon Curt Noll, with the blessings of the original
    Smail1 and Smail2 authors.

    Smail3 supports SMTP, UUCP mail, alias files, .forward files, mailing
    list directories, pathalias files, /etc/hosts files, the domain name
    system, and can also query uucp for neighboring sites, automatically.
    It also supports use of encapsulated SMTP commands for delivery over
    UUCP connections, which allows batching of multiple messages into a
    single UUCP transaction, and allows many addresses to be passed with a
    single message transfer, which can greatly decrease the traffic
    generated for large mailing lists.  It is also very simple to configure
    with a reasonable certainty of correctness.

    Smail3 includes pathalias and a reliable map unpacker.

    Rather than using configuration files to resolve addresses based on
    their syntax, ala sendmail, Smail3 uses a database metaphore for
    resolving addresses based on their contents.  The set of methods that
    Smail3 uses for resolving local addresses and hosts is configurable and
    extensible.  Smail3's methods for parsing addresses are not
    configurable.  It is the opinion of the authors that addressing on the
    Internet and in the UUCP zone has become sufficiently standardized that
    attempts to allow configurability in this area are now a hindrance to
    the correct working of the network.

    Questions related to Smail3 are usually discussed in comp.mail.misc.
    There are also two discussion mailing lists.  To join the mailing
    lists, send mail to:

        smail3-users-request@cs.athabascau.ca

    The current release of Smail3 can be found on uunet, in the file
    /archive/networking/mail/smail/smail-3.1.29.1.tar.Z.  New versions
    are released on a haphazard basis.  Official releases are always
    made available in the /archive/networking/mail/smail directory
    on uunet.

    Smail 3 is covered under the GPL (if it matters)

sendmail: Original author Eric Allman

    Sendmail is the granddaddy of all intelligent MTA's.  It can do just
    about anything.  It's main problem is that it can do just about
    anything.  Modification of sendmail's configuration tables (which is
    necessary with most vendor-supplied versions) is NOT for novices.
    The language of the sendmail.cf is cryptic, but that isn't really
    the problem (and this problem can be solved by using "EASE", a
    sendmail.cf writing language, or the UIUC IDA kit's configuration
    file building tools).  The problem is that it's extremely difficult
    to know when the rules you are implementing are the right thing--
    many sendmail configurations do slightly buggy, or even extremely
    buggy, or illegal things.  The default configurations generated by the
    UIUC IDA kit are, however, very good at Doing the Right Thing under most,
    if not all, circumstances.  I hear similar things about the Sendmail
    8.6 package.

    Worse, every vendor's version of sendmail is different, and many
    of their sendmail.cf's don't work at all.  HPUX is one example
    of where the sendmail.cf is actually pretty sane.  HP is to
    be congratulated.  On the other hand, some vendors, who shall
    remain nameless, can't even get their sendmail to deliver to local
    users, let alone get their sendmail to speak SMTP on a LAN.

    The major problem with sendmail is that it tries to do too many
    things.  Rather than confining itself to handling local mail, and
    simply routing external mail and leaving transport-specific
    format/standards conversions to transport software, it attempts
    (nay virually *insists*) that you have to do all of the
    format/standards conversions for different transports all at once.
    Which results in configuration files that are veritable nightmares
    to maintain.  And that many sendmail.cf files depend on out-of-date
    standards for different transports, rather than trying to unify
    them (as in RFC976).

    Indeed, while common wisdom and practice mandates that MTAs don't
    rewrite headers, sendmail makes it extremely difficult to *not*
    rewrite headers.  Which results in many major systems attempting to
    "be nice", yet, totally scramble return addresses and the like.

    There are several different sendmail lineages in the world but they
    seem to be coming together now with Eric Allman's work creating
    sendmail V8.x.  Sendmail V8.1 was shipped with BSD 4.4 UNIX.  V8.2
    and above (available from ftp.cs.berkeley.edu) is the latest.  V8.6.9
    is now current.  Another solid "modern" version is UIUC IDA version 5.65c
    (5.65d in alpha test), from ftp.uu.net or uxc.cso.uiuc.edu.  This version
    has been pretty stable since 1991.  Paul Pomes, <Paul-Pomes@uiuc.edu>,
    is controlling the IDA Sendmail releases.

    If you want to use sendmail, it is strongly recommended that you
    obtain the UIUC IDA or sendmail 8.6+ versions.  They are much
    more likely to do the right things with mail coming from, or
    ultimately going to, UUCP sites and is much easier to maintain.
    IDA sendmail can handle pathalias-style UUCP routing quite well.
    
    Another point to remember is that sendmail, historically, has been
    where a large number of severe security holes have been found.  From
    the infamous RTM Internet Worm, to the two latest ones "CERT"d in
    the past 6 months.  Indeed, if your application is security-critical,
    you should *not* use sendmail on your security-critical systems, such
    as your firewalls.  Theoretically, all of these problems have been
    removed from sendmail 8.6.5 or later, but, there's bound to be more
    found.  While some of this can be due to the much larger installed
    base of sendmail, other mailers with improved function partitioning
    (such as the channel-oriented MMDF or PP) will usually be inherently
    more secure.

    I am being harsh on sendmail - sendmail programming is, after all, a
    good source of revenue for consultants ;-)  But, if you obtain a good
    configuration (like the aforementioned HPUX version), or are willing
    to spend the time to learn it, sendmail will do what you want.
    Well.  IDA or 8.x sendmail is STRONGLY recommended.  Don't, however,
    even think of playing with the configuration files without a copy of the
    Sendmail book by Costales, Allman and Rickert mentioned in the
    book list above.  It is *absolutely* essential.

    Sendmail is discussed in comp.mail.sendmail.

    EASE version 3.5 was posted in volume 25 of comp.sources.unix and
    is available from wuarchive.wustl.edu [128.252.135.4] (directory
    /usenet/comp.sources.unix/volume25/ease) and many other c.s.u
    archives. 



ZMailer: Original author  Rayan Zachariassen* <rayan@cs.toronto.edu>
         Current author   Matti Aarnio <mea@nic.funet.fi>

    ZMailer is intended for gateways or mail servers or other large site
    environments that have extreme demands on the abilities of the mailer.

    Code and Design features:

    + Strong limits on host impact.
    + Secure design (and hopefully implementation).
    + Natural fit for client/server environments.
    + Extremely customizable configuration mechanism.
    + Flexible database interface with support for: sorted files, unsorted
      files, dbm, ndbm, gdbm, nis (yellow pages), dns (BIND resolver),
      /etc/hosts file, and in-core data.
    + Efficient message queue management.
    + Fast binary-transparent SMTP server and client.
    + MIME-facilities for message transport.
    + Low-technology implementation, with high-tech options for performance.

    Default configuration file features:

    + Default configuration will work for most sites.
    + Network protocol support for: smtp, uucp, bitnet, mail to news.
    + An easy way of overriding any external routing information.
    + Automatic handling of mailing lists.

    It is available by anonymous FTP from:
        ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/unix/mail/zmailer/   (Mr. Aarnio's versions)
    Alternate (some of them old) versions:
        ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/edwin/zmailer2.2.e4.tar.Z
        ftp://ftp.cs.toronto.edu/pub/zmailer.tar.Z

MMDF: [reviewed by I.Sparry@gdt.bath.ac.uk]

    MMDF is a MTA. It works on the principle that you have communications
    channels, both incoming and outgoing, and it arranges for messages to
    pass between them.

    Strong points include:
        * Ability to turn up and down debugging level on the fly
        * Very strong on authentication, and permission checking.
        * Can block mail based on who it came from, how it got there,
          who it is going to.

    It is older than sendmail, simpler than sendmail, and it is a great
    pity that it was not shipped as standard instead of sendmail.

    [MMDF is standard on some systems - primarily SCO UNIX.]

    It has one major advantage to people in the UK, in that it knows how to
    handle mail addresses in our 'correct' format (Most significant part first,
    e.g. net.uu.uunet), as well as the thing the rest of the world uses :-) :-)

    A mailing list for MMDF discussion is at mmdf2@a.cs.okstate.edu
    requests for addition to the list to mmdf2-request@a.cs.okstate.edu.
    The most recent release of MMDF is available for anonymous FTP from
    a.cs.okstate.edu:/pub/mmdf-2.43.tar.Z.

PP: Author University College London

    PP is a Message Transfer Agent, intended for high volume message
    switching, protocol conversion, and format conversion. It is targeted for
    use in an operational environment, but may also be useful for investigating
    Message related applications. Good management features are a major
    aspect of this system. PP supports the 1984 and 1988 versions of the
    CCITT X.400 / ISO 10021 services and protocols. Many existing RFC 822
    based protocols are supported, along with RFC 1148 conversion to X.400.
    PP is an appropriate replacement for MMDF or Sendmail, and also supports
    SMTP and UUCP mail.

    For more information contact: support@xtel.co.uk or xtel@cs.nott.ac.uk
    The latest version is PP-6.0, which was posted in comp.sources.misc,
    volume 27.

    [Ed note:]
    PP is usually used in combination with the ISODE package, which
    also provides copious documentation for PP.  PP itself is
    "freeware", but ISODE and the PP documentation is not - site
    licenses are rather pricy.  PP is *very* large, and has quite a
    number of more esoteric functions, such as FAX transmission using
    the appropriate modems.  PP is ideal for large organizations with
    demanding email requirements (eg: 100s of machines and 1000s of
    users), where PP would be used as "backbone mail servers", and something
    simpler on the "client" computers.  It does have _substantial_
    learning and support requirements, and is *not* suitable for smaller
    installations.  It does, however, shine in large production environments,
    where policy-based routing, high levels of security, or extensive
    gatewaying to different transports is required.

SVR4 mail: Author AT&T (description written by Tony Hansen,
    hansen@pegasus.att.com)

    The System V Release 4 mail system is a domain-capable mail router and
    delivery program that works in the UUCP zone and on the Internet and
    that is capable of gatewaying between the two.

    SVR4 mail supports SMTP, UUCP mail, alias files, forwarding files,
    mailing list directories, /etc/hosts files, the domain name system, and
    can also query uucp for neighboring sites, automatically.  (System V
    Release 4.1 also allows batching of multiple messages into a single UUCP
    transaction, and allows many addresses to be passed with a single
    message transfer, which can greatly decrease the traffic generated for
    large mailing lists.)  It is also very simple to configure with a
    reasonable certainty of correctness.

    It also supports mail-to-pipe and mail-to-file.

    SVR4 mail uses configuration files to resolve addresses based on their
    syntax, somewhat similar to sendmail, but using regular expressions and
    a more easily understood syntax. The set of methods that SVR4 mail uses
    for resolving local and remote addresses and hosts is configurable and
    extensible.

    Questions related to SVR4 mail are usually discussed in comp.mail.misc.

    SVR4 mail is a standard part of System V Release 4; unfortunately, some
    vendors have not realized that SVR4 mail is not the same mailer as the
    SVR3 mail system, and have replaced it with other inferior mail systems.

deliver: Author Chip Salzenberg* <chip@fin!chip@dg_rtp.dg.com>

    Deliver allows any user to write a shell script that processes all
    incoming mail messages for that user.  The system administrator may
    also install scripts that process all messages by installing
    it as the Local Delivery Agent (lmail replacement).

    The output of a script is a list of mail addresses, files and programs
    that should receive the message.  It has access to each message as it
    is processed, so the action can be content dependent.  The script may
    also generate automatic replies, like the "vacation" program, or pass
    along a modified version of the original message.

    Deliver can be used to construct mail-based services (e.g. automatic
    mailing list maintenance).  It can also be used to filter mail
    automatically in prearranged ways (e.g. encryption and decryption,
    tossing junk mail, or vacation notices).

    Deliver was last posted in comp.sources.reviewed, volume 1.  The
    current version is 2.1.12.
    It can be retrieved from <ftp:ftp.cs.uni-sb.de/pub/mail/deliver>

procmail: Author Stephen R. van den Berg*
                <berg@pool.informatik.rwth-aachen.de>

    Can be used to create mail-servers, mailing lists, sort your incoming
    mail into separate folders/files (real convenient when subscribing to
    one or more mailing lists or for prioritising your mail), preprocess your
    mail, start any programs upon mail arrival (e.g. to generate different
    chimes on your workstation for different types of mail) or selectively
    forward certain incoming mail automatically to someone.

    Procmail can be used:
        - and installed by an unprivileged user (for himself only).
        - as a drop in replacement for the local delivery agent /bin/mail
          (with biff/comsat support).
        - as a general mailfilter for whole groups of messages (e.g. when
          called from within sendmail.cf rules).

    The accompanying formail program enables you to generate autoreplies,
    split up digests/mailboxes into the original messages, do some very
    simple header-munging/extraction, or force mail into mail-format (with
    leading From line).

    Also included is a comprehensive mailinglist/archive management system.

    Since procmail is written entirely in C, it poses a very low impact
    on your system's resources (under normal conditions, when you don't
    start other programs/scripts from within it).

    Procmail was designed to deliver the mail under the worst conditions
    (file system full, out of swap space, process table full, file table
    full, missing support files, unavailable executables; it all doesn't
    matter).  Should (in the unlikely event) procmail be unable to deliver
    your mail somewhere, the mail will bounce back to the sender or reenter
    the mailqueue (your choice).

    A recent version can be picked up at various comp.sources.misc archives.
    The latest version (3.03) can be obtained directly from the ftp-archive at:
        ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de (137.226.225.3)
        (g)zipped:          pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.gz       <160KB
        compressed:         pub/packages/procmail/procmail.tar.Z        <224KB

    [Ed note: I had noted reported difficulties in integrating procmail
    with System V and/or smail 2.5.  The 2.70 version of Procmail eliminated
    these difficulties.]

mailagent: Author Raphael Manfredi* <ram@acri.fr>

    The mailagent is yet another mail filter, written in perl, which will let
    you do anything with your mail. It has all the features you may expect from
    a filter: mailing lists sorting, forwarding to MTA or to inews, pre-processing
    of message before saving into folder, vacation mode, etc... It was initially
    written as an ELM-filter replacement, but has now enough power to also
    supplant MMDF's .maildelivery. There is also a support for @SH mail hooks,
    which allows you to automatically distribute patches or software via command
    mails.

    The mailagent was designed to make mail filtering as easy as it can be. It
    is highly configurable and fairly complete. Rules are specified in a lex-like
    style, with the full power of perl's regular expressions. The automaton
    supports the notion of mode, and header selection has many magic features
    built-in, to ease the rule writing process.

    To give a simple example, the two following rules:

        Subject: /cron output/  { SAVE cron };
        To Cc: dist-users               { FORWARD friend@acri.fr; LEAVE };

    would save in a folder 'cron' all cron-related mail, and forward mail
    from the dist-users mailing list to a friend, leaving a copy in the system
    mailbox for immediate processing...

    It supports delivery to plain UNIX folder, to MMDF-style folders or to
    MH folders with built-in unseen sequence updates, as specified in your
    ~/.mh_profile. It may therefore replace MH's slocal program as well.

    Mailagent can be dynamically extended (that's the advantage of having it
    written in perl) with new filtering commands that will behave exactly
    like built-in ones; this operation being done without changing a single
    source line in the program itself, of course. It also provides a generic
    mail server layer, where user-defined commands can be easily plugged in,
    mailagent taking care of the lower-level stuff.

    The distribution comes with a set of examples, an exhaustive test suite,
    and naturally a detailed manual page. It should be noted that the mailagent
    will work even if your system administrator forbids "| programs" hooks in
    the ~/.forward, provided you have access to some sort of cron daemon.

    The mailagent program is available from any comp.source.misc archive and
    thanks to Christophe Wolfhugel <Christophe.Wolfhugel@grasp.insa-lyon.fr>,
    from ftp.univ-lyon1.fr (134.214.100.6) under /pub/unix/mail/tools, file
    mailagent-3.0.tar.gz

pathalias: Author Peter Honeyman

    Pathalias reads the UUCP Map Project maps (they need to be extracted
    from the postings first) and constructs a database containing the
    minimum cost route to any machine in the maps.  This database can
    then be used with any mailer that knows how to search the database
    (eg: smail 2.5, Zmailer?, and some versions of sendmail.  Smail 3
    comes bundled with pathalias).

    There were previous versions of this program.  You must use
    pathalias version 10 (latest version), because some map format
    changes have been made and only pathalias 10 can parse them.
    If your pathalias doesn't give a syntax error on:
        echo "file {foo}" | pathalias
    It's the new one.

    There were other route-generating programs, but all (as far as
    I know) are very obsolete, and none run as fast as pathalias
    (still, which can be rather hard on machines with smallish virtual
    memory or RAM capacities).

    pathalias 10 is available from comp.sources.unix archives,
    volume 22.  A patch was just released in comp.sources.unix
    (vol 25) that addresses an oddity when used with smail (not that
    I've ever noticed it).

uuhosts: Author John Quarterman

    The "defacto" standard UUCP Map Project map unpacker.  Includes
    a program to arbitrarily view individual map entries.  Uuhosts
    implements trojan horse/virus security by running under
    a "chroot()" system call.  Uuhosts does not appear to be
    actively maintained, and the last versions that I have inspected
    were unable to easily compress the maps (a full set of maps
    is >6000 blocks), had no provision for automatically
    running pathalias, and will not work with the newest version
    of cnews.  Further, uuhost's header checking is so picky
    that the slightest change in the map format will cause
    uuhosts to reject map updates.

    Use of uuhosts now will require some minor hacking - and this
    hacking will stretch your knowledge of Bourne shell programming.

    The last edition, "uuhost4" (version 1.69) appears to have
    been posted in comp.sources.unix in volume 3, 1986.

    Do not be confused by Jan-Piet Mons "uuhost 2.0" program posted
    in alt.sources.  This is not a map unpacker.  It is just
    a map viewer, and is a subset of the real uuhosts.

unpackmaps: Author Chris Lewis* <clewis@ferret.ocunix.on.ca>

    Unpackmaps is a superset of the functionality of uuhosts.
    It obtains its security by doing the map unpacking with
    a specialized parser that knows the map article format
    rather than invoking a shar/shell.  Compression and pathalias
    invocation is automatic, correctly takes into account
    the change date of local configuration files, and will
    work with the latest Cnews.

    The newest version of unpackmaps, version 4.1, has been
    released to comp.sources.misc, and appeared in volume 34.
    This version is entirely written in C, is considerably faster
    than unpackmaps 3 or uuhosts, has considerably more features,
    and will work with Brian Reids PostScript net maps too.

unshar: Author Lee Ward, modified by Mark Moraes* <moraes@deshaw.com>

    unshar is evolved from getmaps by Lee Ward.  It is has a specialized
    and limited parser that understands most simple shar formats.  It is
    capable of automatically unpacking new files from a newsgroup spool
    directory, and requires no interaction whatsoever with the news
    system.  Apart from UUCP maps, it can be used to automatically and
    safely unpack shar files from the sources newsgroups.  It does not
    handle some of the newer, esoteric shar formats that do automatic
    uudecodes, etc.  Ftp'able from
    ftp.cs.toronto.edu:/pub/moraes/unshar.tar.gz.

<br><br>
The <strong>Rosewood Consort</strong> is a group of early music enthusiasts who play
<A HREF="http://www.dotlogic.com/vdgsa/chest/chest.html#DEFINE">viola da gamba</a> (a bowed string instrument that enjoyed great popularity 
in the 16th and 17th centuries) and recorder (a woodwind instrument that
was popular during the same period). 

 <strong>Rosewood</strong> was founded
in 1995 by four viola da gambists in the Beacon-Poughkeepsie area who
share a love of playing Renaissance music on instruments of that time.

<strong>Rosewood</strong> offers a variety of programs:  Christmas Music
from the thirteenth through the seventeenth centuries; Early American
Traditional Music; and a Tapestry of Renaissance Music.  The group numbers
from a minimum of four violas da gamba to a maximum of six or seven
when augmented by recorders.

(3/7/96)</EM></CENTER></H3>

<P>
<CENTER>by Anthony Zic</CENTER>
<P>
For many years, the state of WRCM (The Manhattan College Radio
Station) has been below average. But now, it is time for change.
<P>
I, along with the rest of the WRCM Board of Directors- Paul Karazuba,
Rich Carbonaro, Jeanne McNamara, and Chris Calabro, are taking
steps that will allow the faculty and students to hear and enjoy
us.
<P>
On Thursday, February 15<SUP>th</SUP>, we took our first of mant
steps to improve the state of our station. On this date, Professional
Engineer, John Ladely, came to look at the station's present equipment,
in order to determine what will be needed to improve our wiring
system. This new wiring system will allow us not only to be heard
in the cafterias, but in the dorms as well. This aspect will help
you, the Manhattan College community, hear the radio station on
campus aside from hearing us solely in Thomas Hall. Until we receive
the engineer's report, we will continue on our own to improve
the sound quality in the cafeterias, including the Leo Cafeteria.
This willbe done with the help of Andrew Goodman, Elaine White,
and other administration members.
<P>
Along with these technical enrichments, there willbe other improvements.
In afew weeks, a Program Guide, describing our radio shows will
be compiled and posted in primary locations. In addition, WRCM
is planning a coffehouse along with the Manhattan Magazine and
the Quadrangle. Also, a music pick of the week will be given by
DJ and Board Member, Jeanne McNamara, as well as music reviews
by various other board members. 
<P>
These things mentioned above will take time and the support of
the entire school, REMEMBER IT IS YOUR RADIO STATION.

<EM>Dave Matthewes Band</EM>, &quot;Under the Table and Dreaming&quot;,
RCA Records.<BR>
<BR>
Although this CD is fairly old, I wanted to start my music articles
with an album that recently caught my interest.  Released this
past summer, many of you might remember the hit single played
often on the radio, &quot;What Would You Say.&quot;  After listening
to the tune constantly, my opinion of The Dave Matthews Band was
not very high.  However, after hearing hits, &quot;Ants Marching&quot;
and &quot;Satellite,&quot; I decided to give the CD a try.  Well,
needless to say, my response wa surprising.  Their sound is smooth
with a funky beat to it.  Matthew's voice is electric and the
music demands attention.  For instance, the song &quot;Satellite&quot;
comes across as a romantic love song, however, if you read the
accompaniment that comes with the CD, you will see that the song
is just a simple ode to TV.
<P>
In the past, I used to think people who listened to Dave Matthew's
Band were hippies, deadheads, and trendies.  However, after I
listened to &quot;Under the Table&quot; and &quot;Dreaming,&quot;
my philosophies have been disregarded.
<P>
My suggestion to you is to go outand buy this CD and lose the
fear that someone may call you a granola head!<BR>

<TITLE>Proposal for the Revival of WRCM</TITLE>

<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Microsoft Word 2.0z Beta">

<BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#FFFFFF" LINK="#00FF00" VLINK="#00FF00">

<P>
<CENTER><B>Proposal for the Revival of WRCM</B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B>by Richard Carbonaro, Chief Engineer</B></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Background:</B>
<P>
As most people on campus know, WRCM is the Manhattan College radio station.  What mostof the student body also knows, however, is that it is not a &quot;real&quot; radio station.  A &quot;real&quot; radio station is one that broadcasts over the air waves, so that when someone turns on their radio to the proper frequency, they can tune in.  Officially WRCM is licensed to be on 850 on the AM band.  At this time though, there is not a single person on campus that can tune in WRCM on their stereo or walkman.  This is a problem that previous WRCM board of directors have tried to address, but to only limited levels of success.
<P>
Currently, when a member
of the student body hears WRCM, it is only when they are in Thomas
Hall.   The WRCM signal can only be heard in Locke's Loft and
Dante's Den.  Even though it can be heard in these two areas,
at times it cannot be heard at all because the volume is not high
enough, or because the WRCM amplifiers are unplugged by people
who have no authority in dealing with the radio station.  What
is the point then of having a campus radio station that does not
broadcast anywhere?  There is a definite need and call for a campus
wide radio station, in fact, no college campus should be without
one.  It is an essential part of student life, and can be a means
for communication throughout the campus.  As some of the long-standing
members of the radio station know, there is support of the station
by the student body.  This is evident as this past semester more
D.J.'s applied for a show then shows that were available.  What
happens gradually thereafter, however, is that the D.J.'s of the
station soon realize that while they are spending an hour and
a half of their time in the studio doing their show, there is
absolutely no one listening on campus except Br. James in room
507 down the hall.  It is not that the student body does not want
to listen, the fact of the matter is that they can't listen.
<P>
In attempting to address
the problems that the station faces, WRCM realized very quickly
that no one currently involved with the station had the technical
ability to do anything about it.  To counteract our lack of knowledge,
the station hired an electrical engineer, John Ladley, to come
in and assess WRCM's situation.   Our contact with John stems
from conversations with Prof. Fitzgerald at the College of Mount
Saint Vincent.  Our General Manager, Anthony Zic, was contacted
by Prof. Fitzgerald because he was interested in getting CMSV's
radio station off the ground.  John was recommended to us by Prof.
Fitzgerald because John had been contracted to do some work for
CMSV's station.  John presently is the Chief Engineer at WSIA
in Staten Island.  Due to John's work over at CMSV, their radio
station is slated to begin broadcasting on April 1.  In the following
months after our initial contact with John, our Chief Engineer,
Rich Carbonaro, arranged to have John come in and look at the
operation of the station.  This was done at a slight cost to WRCM
($225), under the stipulation that a formal report would be delivered
to the station by John, and that the $225 fee would be refunded
if he were contracted to do any additional work on the station.
 This report that was sent to WRCM by John Ladley includes the
technical means by which the station can be fixed, along with
cost estimates for parts and labor.  The cost estimates were given
to WRCM through John, by the LPB company.  This company specializes
in the manufacturing of college radio equipment.  All of the price
quotes for equipment in John's report as well as in this proposal
are based upon figures given by the LPB company.  This proposal
combines the ideas and wishes of the present board of directors
of WRCM, with the recommendations of a professional trained in
the area of college radio.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Phase 1 - Thomas
Hall, Chrysostym, and Jasper Hall:</FONT></B>
<P>
THOMAS HALL: 
<P>
 Currently, Thomas Hall
has the WRCM signal playing in the cafeteria speakers of Locke's
Loft, and Dante's Den.  The volume in the two cafeterias, however,
is at times too low for anyone to hear.  This happens both at
the peak lunch and dinner hours.  A second problem is that the
WRCM amplifiers are continually unplugged.  Our amplifiers are
located in locked metal boxes that are mounted to the wall.  
The board members of WRCM have spoken to various people on campus
who have seen Marriott employees unplugging the amplifiers for
no apparent reason.  They have absolutely no authority in the
broadcasting of the radio station.   An additional problem that
WRCM has encountered in Thomas Hall is faulty cafeteria speakers.
  The board of WRCM would like to follow through on the following
to improve the quality of our signal in Thomas Hall:
<OL>
<LI>The purchasing and
installation of 2 potentiometers.  As quoted by John in his report
they cost $50.00 each.  The cost of installation of these would
be $75.  The connecting wires seem to be in place for both Locke's
Loft, and Dante's Den.  Physical plant would have to be used to
mount metal boxes with locks on them to house the potentiometers.
 At this time, there are metal boxes covering the existing potentiometers,
but the reason why the installation of new potentiometers is required
is because the old ones were too small, and seemed to have burned
out.  A larger casing is required for the larger potentiometers
that are to be installed. 
<LI>One way in which
WRCM can counteract the problem of being unplugged is through
the purchasing and installation of  &quot;guards&quot; for the
electrical outlets that the amplifiers are using for power.  
Physical Plant  can be contacted about the covering up of the
electrical outlets.  This will therefore be of little or no cost.
 Opponents to this idea have stated that the addition of these
guards will not allow administrators who have the power to regulate
WRCM or even board members of the station to turn off or lower
the volume in the cafeterias.  The problem of WRCM being too loud
or having to turn off the amp under rare circumstances is solved
by the use of the potentiometers.
<LI>Andrew Goodman's
assistance is needed for the replacement of the faulty cafeteria
speakers.  We currently have the speakers, and they are easily
replaced.  With some help from Andrew, this would come at no cost
to WRCM or the school.
</OL>
<HR>
<P>

JASPER and CHRYSOSTYMHALL:
<P>
 There is equipment
in Jasper Hall now, but  it has not been maintained in years.
 According to John, several things must be done to bring the signal
to these two buildings.  The current set up is as follows:  phone
lines bring the signal to Jasper, the signal is then split, with
half of the power staying in Jasper and the other half traveling
over coaxial cable to Chrysostym.  According to John, the reason
why this setup is not working is because of two reasons.  First
the equipment that is being used to distribute the signal in Jasper
needs replacing, and second, there is a significant loss in power
when the signal is split and sent to Chrysostym.  John's report
outlines a plan for rectifying this problem.  Through the use
of proper equipment and setup, the signal would be able to be
heard in both buildings.  The equipment that would need to be
purchased for Jasper and Chrysostym include an LPB Coupler, a
signal splitter to send the signal from Jasper to Chrysostym,
an amplifier, and repair of one piece of existing equipment in
Jasper.  John's quote for the work to be done in these two buildings
is $1,820.  This includes the price of parts and labor, it does
not include, however, the price of servicing the transmitter that
is in currently in place in Jasper.  We, therefore, expect the
price of bringing the WRCM signal to these two buildings at approximately
$2,000.  The report sent to WRCM by John goes into the technical
details of bringing the signal to these two buildings.
<P>
 Phase 1 of our plan
involves work to be done on Thomas Hall, Chrysostym, and Jasper.
 The Estimated cost of this work comes to $2,175.  There has been
some discussion, however, between the Director of Student Activities
and WRCM, about possibly fixing Thomas Hall at no cost to WRCM,
but from another one of the college's accounts.  If this is possible,
the financial burden would be slightly lessened from WRCM.  The
current balance in WRCM student government account is around $3,300.
  Based on the above information, WRCM would like to draw up a
contract with John Ladely to perform the above mentioned work.
 We would like to do so using our existing budget from this (Spring
1996) semester.  Not all of the work that is part of phase 1 of
this proposal involves an outside party.  Physical Plant and Andrew
Goodman's assistance are needed, and if John is contracted to
do this work, the college's electrician or some other person that
is an employee of the school would have to be present to assist
and oversee his work.<BR>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Phase 2 - Leo Engineering:
</B>
<P>
There are currently
two problems with the WRCM signal in Leo.  First of all, when
we brought John in to evaluate the station, he informed us that
the signal was not reaching Leo.  Second of all, the amplifier
that was picking up the signal and distributing it to the cafeteria
speakers was missing.  The first thing we need to have done is
have NY-Telephone fix this phone line.  The chief engineer at
the station, Rich Carbonaro, has been working on this, and it
seems as if this may come at no cost to the school whatsoever.
 Rose from the phone center informed WRCM that the NY-Tel representative
would look into this situation as a favor to her, and therefore
the school would not incur any cost to the school.  If this problem
cannot be rectified easily, however, a cost may come to WRCM for
the fixing of the line.  This would solve the first problem that
WRCM has in Leo.
<P>
The second problem
for WRCM broadcasting in Leo is that the amplifier was stolen.
 The stolen piece of equipment was reported to security, and a
report has been written up.  Our general manager, Anthony Zic
has spoken with Mr. Joe Perillo, the Dean of Judicial Affairs,
and we at WRCM have been informed by him that the amplifier will
be replaced at no cost to WRCM.  The estimate given to WRCM by
John for an amplifier for this type of application is $875 for
a Crown Com-Tech 200 Amplifier.  The estimate from John Ladley
for the work to be done in this building is $400.  This cost may
be eliminated if the electrical engineering department has the
ability to set up the amp for WRCM.  This possibility will be
explored with Dr. Silverman, the chair of the electrical engineering
department.  The estimated cost for the Leo Engineering building
as quoted is $1275.00.  If indeed the electrical engineering department
can accomplish this, the cost would be brought down to only $875,
the cost of the replacement of the amp, that is to be covered
by Mr. Perillo.   In addition, a metal box to house the amplifier
will also be needed to prevent future theft.  For this reason
Physical Plant's assistance is needed in Leo.
<P>
The work that is to
be done to fix the signal down to Leo is dependent solely upon
time.  Time is a factor in the phone company fixing the line down
to Leo, but this process is underway.  The funding for the equipment
is also time dependent.  Talks with Mr. Perillo have been positive,
but at this time, we have not been reimbursed.  It is only after
the finances, and the connection for Leo are set that work can
be done in this building.  Re-establishing the WRCM signal in
Leo is something that WRCM would like to strongly peruse after
these are taken care of.  Fortunately, this work should be able
to be accomplished by WRCM even with a budget of $0.00.<BR>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Phase 3 - East Hill:</B>
<P>
At this point in time,
East Hill is not currently serviced by WRCM.  There is some broadcasting
equipment in the building, but it is not in the proper location,
and the signal is not reaching that equipment.  This is due solely
to poor planning by those introducing the WRCM signal to East
Hill in 1990 when the building was constructed.  There are many
problems with trying to get the WRCM signal throughout East Hill.
 These are all described in John's report.  The recommendations
that John have made for East Hill all have a dollar amount attached
to them for both parts and labor.   Phase 3 of this proposal is
more complicated than phases 1 and 2 because NY-Tel would be required
to move the existing phone lines that carry the signal to the
building to another location in East Hill, this being the main
electrical closet of the building.  Circuit breakers would also
have to be installed to maintain safety.  It is apparent that
Vice President for Facilities advice and intervention would be
needed in setting up this equipment in Easthill.  The figured
quoted to us by John for East Hill is $3,890 for parts and labor.
 WRCM does not currently have enough money in our budget to cover
this.  WRCM would like to explore the finances for East Hill with
the Vice President for Student Life, Dr Lee.  WRCM is aware that
we will be receiving a Student Government budget in the Fall,
but we do not feel that the financial burden for such an operation
should fall solely on our shoulders.  WRCM feels this way because
college radio is a part of student life that is necessary, and
also lacking on this campus.
<P>
Phase 3 of this proposal
is something that WRCM would like to peruse after phases 1 and
2 have been put into effect.  WRCM is aware that input from many
people is necessary for phase 3 of this proposal to become a reality.
 The exact details of the work that is to be done are outlined
in John Ladley's report to WRCM.  Interactions with Dr. Lee, Bob
Mahan, and Elaine T. White are necessary and desired by WRCM especially
in this matter.
<P>
An issue that has been
discussed by WRCM is the reliability of the engineer that we contracted.
 WRCM's association with John has only been a limited one, but
we feel him to be a reliable source.  His price quotes for the
equipment  manufactured by LPB that is necessary to implement
his recommendations are consistent with those in the LPB catalogue.
 In addition to this, he is aware that if he were to be contracted
to any work for WRCM and Manhattan College, he is liable if any
of that work does not meet the expectations of WRCM or the college.
<BR>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Summary:</B>
<P>
In summary, this proposal
outlines the work on the station that the board of directors of
WRCM would like to have done in the upcoming months.  The different
problems that the station have been split up into different &quot;phases.&quot;
 They have been done so according to the time frame in which we
feel that they can be accomplished.  Attached to this proposal
is the report that was sent to WRCM by John Ladely.  This gives
a more technical description of what is necessary to bring the
WRCM signal to the buildings

<p>New and emerging electrotechnologies are environmentally superior to many conventional treatment techniques and offer substantial operating savings to the municipal utility industry.  In many cases, these savings provide rapid payback for capital investments.</p>

<p><b><i>Disinfection</i></b> by electric-based processes solves challenges associated with chlorine's inability to control some harmful micro-organisms in drinking water; its toxic disinfection by-products (DBPs); and its health and safety risks to plant personnel.</p>

<p><i>Ultraviolet (UV) light </i>radiation is an effective alternative to chlorination-decholrination at wastewater plants and is being tested to determine its effectiveness in inactivating <i>crystosporidium</i> in drinking water.  UV systems are inexpensive to install, safe, easy to operate, and competitive in costs to chlorination-decholrination systems.  <i>Ozone</i>, a powerful disinfectant commonly used in European water treatment, will be used to treat 15-20% of the US drinking water supply within the next 10 years.  Used as a partial replacement for chlorine, ozone, reduces formation of DPBs and improves water taste, odor, and color.  <i>Membrane filtration</i> removes microbial contaminants and organic and inorganic compounds at water facilities.  This technology is being used for drinking water treatment and wastewater reclamation.</p>

<center><IMG SRC="ozone.jpg" ALT="Ozone Optimization"></center>

<p><b><i>Water treatment residuals and wastewater biosolids (sludge) </i></b>are a serious concern due to decreasing availability of landfill disposal sites in many regions, increased restrictions of water content in residuals and biosolids, and closer monitoring of pollutant concentrations.</p>

<p><i>Pulsed power technology</i> can improve mechanical dewatering and increase the effectiveness of anaerobic digestion to produce stabilized biosolids.  It also increases methane gas production, reducing plant supplemental fuel requirements.  <i>Infrared (IR) heaters</i> for sludge drying are compact, easily installed and operated, and available at capital costs competitive with other biosolids drying technologies.  These heaters can also be used with off-peak power to lower operating costs.  <i>Mechanical freeze/thaw conditioning</i> for sludge conditioning and dewatering can be applied at both water and wastewater treatment plants.</p>

<p><b><i>Advanced wastewater treatment process</i></b> such as nitrification and nutrient removal will be required due to increasingly stringent regulations.  These added requirements will significantly increase electric energy demands for wastewater treatment over the next decade.  Aeration and filtration processes account for most of the energy use.</p>

<p>Desalination and water reuse technologies provide two means of increasing water supply.  This benefits regions of the United States that experience serious shortages of surface and groundwater supplies.</p>

<p><i>Microfiltration membranes</i> are increasingly being used for wastewater reclamation and as pretreatment for reverse osmosis processes.  <i>Brine disposal modeling</i> can simulate ocean conditions and discharge scenarios for sea water desalination plants.  The modeling technique can be used for system design and for gaining federal approval of such plants.  <i>Co-disposal</i> of wastewater and desalination brine provides improved dispersion of waste brine into offshore discharge locations.</p>

<IMG SRC="energy.gif" ALT="Energy Management">  

<p>Energy management involves evaluation of plant equipment processes, installation of controls, and reduction of operating costs by implementing energy management systems.</p>

<p><b><i>Pumping processes</i></b>, which typically account for more than 90% of the electricity used in drinking water treatment and 15% of wastewater processes, can be improved significantly.  <i>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)</i> systems can manage water pumping and distribution to reduce operating costs by as much as 15%.  <i>Adjustable speed drives (ASDs)</i>, applied to new or existing ac motors, can operate pumps at variable speeds without throttling or cycling, while saving energy and reducing wear and tear on equipment.  ASDs can also be linked to intelligent control systems for even greater operating benefits.</p>

<center><IMG SRC="scada.jpg" ALT="SCADA Control Systems"></center>

<p><b><i>Aeration</i></b> often accounts for more than half of the electricity used in a wastewater plant.  During the next 20 years, as these facilities are enlarged and upgraded, aeration will create a 40% increase in process electricity consumption.  One energy management method now under development, <i>respirometry</i>, measures the actual oxygen requirements of the wastewater entering the aeration tanks, enabling plant operators to preset aeration rates to match oxygen demands.  <i>Dissolved oxygen (DO) probes</i>, now used by many wastewater utilities, permit continuous in situ measurements at aeration basins.  Both respirometry and DO probes, when linked with control systems, will significantly reduce the problem of over-aeration.  Operating cost savings can be as high as 50%.</p>

<IMG SRC="environ.gif" ALT="UNDER CONSTRUCTION" ALIGN="BOTTOM">

<p>The treatment and disposal of infectious medical waste are serious environmental health and safety concerns.  Recent federal and state mandates have broadened the definition of infectious waste to include many materials capable of transmitting disease, whether infectious organisms are actually present.  Regulations encompass laboratory and surgery wastes; syringes and needles; blood and human tissue; and animal research tissue, among other items.  Facilities must meet specific safety requirements for on- or off-site treatment, regardless of the quantities generated.  Costs and liabilities associated with transportation and disposal, and air quality concerns with on-site incineration, are often prohibitive for healthcare facilities.  In addition, cradle to grave regulations holds the generator of medical and infectious waste accountable for their waste even after it has reached a disposal site.</p>

<p>The HCI responds to this interest and demand by supporting the introduction or development of environmentally attractive electrotechnologies for all types of healthcare facility hazardous wastes, including low-level radioactive by-products.</p>

<p>Electrotechnologies cost-effectively destroy infectious and medical waste without incineration.  Beneficial electrotechnologies include the following:</p>

<p><i>Dry heat sterilization</i> uses a combination of high-temperature convection, conduction, and infrared heating to provide rapid, dry heat sterilization of medical waste.  This technology is ideally suited to clinics, medical and chemical laboratories, nursing homes, blood banks and plasma centers, and small to medium hospitals.</p>

<p><i>Pyrolysis and oxidation</i> can be used to handle a variety of medical wastes, which are converted to an inert, sterile, nonleachable ash.  Air emissions are negligible with maximum reduction in mass and volume of waste.  Heat recovery is available as hot water or low-pressure steam.</p>

<p>In <i>microwave waste disinfection</i>, the waste is loaded, shredded, then passed through an internal microwave system that renders it noninfectious.  The waste is discharged as an unrecognizable, volume-reduced product that can be landfilled as municipal solid waste.</p>

<p><i>Electron beam irradiation</i> delivers a lethal dose of ionizing radiation to kill microorganisms in medical waste.  The sterilization is achieved without heating or combustion and results in no air emissions except for limited off-gassing of ozone.</p>

<p><i>Stream sterilization</i> involves placing infectious waste in autoclave bags and loading into the sterilization chamber.  The waste is exposed to steam emitting no smoke, ash, chemicals, or combustion by-products.</p>

<p><i>Medwaste Alternative Technology Evaluation System(MATES)</i>, a software programs that compares the relative economic advantages of disposal alternatives, can help healthcare customers select the best disposal options.</p>

<center><IMG SRC="mates.jpg" ALT="MATES software program"></center>

<p>Other HCI activities include facility assessments, regulatory compliance assessments, and technology deployment.  The HCI is working with member utilities on a project to assist the healthcare customer in detection, minimization, transportation, and final disposal of low-level radioactive wastes.</p>

<IMG SRC="indoor.gif" ALT="Indoor Air Quality" > 

<p>Tuberculosis, a disease practically eradicated decades ago, is once again a significant public health concern, in part due to the antibiotic-resistant strains of today's TB bacteria.  New guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) call for control of this and other airborne diseases in acute-care facilities and other healthcare settings.</p>

<p>EPRI's NRCEC has joined with <a href="http://www.coned.com">Consolidated Edison of New York,</a> <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu">Harvard University,</a> St. Vincent's Hospital of New York, the New York State Energy and Research Development Authority, and major utilities in the National Tuberculosis Coalition, to spearhead TB prevention based on UV light equipment and ventilation.  Key technologies include:</p>

<p><i>High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters</i> for use in isolation rooms where ventilating of air to outside is not possible.  These filters can remove nearly all airborne bacteria to prevent infected air from escaping into public areas.</p>

<p><i>UV light</i> can disinfect TB bacteria in waiting rooms, emergency departments, and other common areas in healthcare facilities.  UV lamps can also control the spread of bacteria that cause measles, chicken pox, and other particulate airborne diseases.</p>

<center><IMG SRC="tuber.jpg"  ALT="UV Light and Tuberculosis"></center>

<p><i>Ventilation</i> air replacement is the most common method of achieving acceptable indoor air quality and removing contaminants.</p>

<p><i>Legionella pneumophila</i> places AIDS, organ-transplant, cancer patients, and others with impaired immune systems at risk.  The CEC is demonstrating use of ozone in cooling towers to prevent the spread of this disease through air-conditioning systems within hospitals.</p>

<h2>THE PLANT KINGDOMS</h2>

<dd>A basic knowledge of plant classification is necessary for understanding the relationships that exist between morphology and anatomy.  When classification schemes were first developed, all living organisms
could easily be placed in a general category, like Kingdom Plantae or Kingdom 
Animalia.</p>
<dd>General categories, such as Kingdoms
still work well in classification but they break down 
when some organisms in one category have characteristics which are similar to organisms in another category.   A case in point is 
the one-celled organism, <i>Euglena</i>, which bears both animal and plant 
characteristics.</p> 

<dd>The establishment of a third Kingdom, proposed by J. Hogg and Ernst 
Haeckel around 1860, which contained organisms that did not 
develop complex tissues somewhat solved this
problem.  The kingdom which was called Protoctista, or Protista, describes a 
heterogeneous variety of organisms including algae, fungi, and sponges.</p>
 
<dd>A better but not perfect solution was proposed some 50 years later, when Copeland assigned 
the name Monera to all single celled organisms with prokaryotic cells 
and the remaining organisms with eukaryotic cells were placed in the 
Kingdom Protoctista. </p>

<dd>Copeland's four kingdom system of classification was considered to be 
a definite improvement but his system did not recognize the character of nutrition which is
a major distinctive element.  All differences 
 in the mode of nutrition among organisms were lumped into
Kingdom Protoctista and this still posed a major classification problem.</p>

<dd>In 1969, R. H. Whittaker proposed a five kingdom system which is favored by many  biologists.   In Whittaker's system, three kingdoms of 
more complex organisms are classified according to the three forms of 
nutrition: photosynthesis, food ingestion and food absorption. The 
other two kingdoms are distinguished on the basis of differences in 
cellular structure. </p>

<dd>The five-kingdom arrangement still has some problems.
More recently, Woese, a microbiologist, responded to these problems by proposing to 
divide the Kingdom Monera into two kingdoms, based on some previously 
unrecognized fundamental differences between the major groups of 
bacteria.<p> <dd> Much more information still remains to be acquired and until 
this occurs, taxonomic categories will remain subject to different 
interpretations.  In this study, Whittaker's five kingdom system will 
be followed.  </p><hr>

The brown algae occur in oceans and seas, especially in the cold, northern latitudes.  Some do grow in warm seas but very few forms are adapted to fresh water.  They resemble the green algae in their cell wall construction with an inner wall of cellulose and an outer wall of pectin but differ in wall composition, cellular contents, and structure of motile cells. Two important phycocolloids, algin and fucoidin are important secondary metabolites and are used in the manufacture of beer, toothpaste, ice cream, paint, shaving cream, medicine and soaps.<p>

<h2>Subdivision Deuteromycotina - The Fungi Imperfecti</h2>
<h3>Class Deuteromycetes</h3><p>
This class of fungi have no sexual reproduction and are consequently called the <i>Fungi Imperfecti</i> because their life cycles are "imperfect".  Most reproduce by conidia.  It is possible that the Deuteromycetes never produce sexual stages such as ascospores or basidiospores.  They are classed in an artificial system which emphasizes the color and structure of conidia.  Many fungal diseases that infect humans belong to this Class.

<title>Lichens</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Lichens</h2><p>
Composite organisms consisting of a fungal component (mycobiont) and an algal component (phycobiont).  The mycobiont seems to play a major morphogenetic role and the phycobiont is the photosynthetic partner.  The association originated separately among a number of different groups of fungi with different algae, suggesting that lichens are polyphyletic in origin.<p>
For information on how lichens are studied as bioindicators click <a href="http://hub.terc.edu/terc/gl/LICHENS/LICHEN-1.html

<title>Division Lycophyta</title>
</head>
</body>

<h2>Division Lycophyta<br></h2>
These plants are commonly known as the lower ferns and possess true vascularized stems, leaves and roots.  The position and microanatomy of the vascular tissue is characteristic of these forms.  The leaves are described as microphylls, i.e. enations or reductions of the stem in which the vascular strand is simple, a trace, a single vein.  The spore producing bodies are on special branches and the structure is known as a "strobilus".  The sporangia which contain the spores are associated with fertile leaves known as sporophylls.  During the Carboniferous Period of geological time this group was represented by some of the largest and most numerous plants.  
<h3>The Division Lycophyta is composed of the following:<p>


<img align="left"src="grball.gif"><a href="clubms1.html">Order Lycopodiales</a> (Clubmosses)</h3>
There are many living and extinct forms known.  The Order possesses one type of spore (homosporous) from which one gametophyte produces antheridia and archegonia and the sperm cells possess two flagella.   Primary growth, dichotomous branching,  and lack of ligules (tapered structures at the base of leaves) are also characters.  There are no tree-like forms in extant species.  The term, club mosses, is used for the Order Lycopodiales or just for the Genus, <i>Lycopodium</i>.  The genus is large containing some 180 species.<br>
<h3><img align="left"src="grball.gif"><a href="spike1.html">Order Selaginellales</a> (Spikemosses)</h3>
There are living and extinct forms but only one third as many as the Lycopodiales.  This Order possesses  1) ligules,  the tapered structures at the base of leaves, and  2) two types of spores (heterosporous), microspores and megaspores, which give rise to male and female gametophytes and sperm cells with two flagella.  The development of the gametophytes is described to be "endosporic", a character peculiar to the spikemosses and the quillworts.
<h3><img align="left"src="grball.gif"><a href="quill.html">Order Isoetales</a> (Quillworts)</h3><p>Although the Isoetales possess some characteristics that are similiar to the Selaginellales: 1) presence of ligules,  the tapered structures at the base of leaves,  and 2) heterosporous spores which are endosporic, there are characters peculiar to their Order alone.  Their microphyllous leaves grow from a short tuberous stem known as a "corm" which possesses unusual secondary growth and their sperm cells are multiflagellate.

The Order is divided into two common groups known as the "horsetails" and "scouring rushes".  The horsetails have jointed hollow and narrow stems with much reduced leaves and side branches are lacking.  The scouring rushes have rough-ridges stems with side branches that are long and narrow.  These plants were formerly used for scouring utensils before the advent of modern abrasives and so was derived the common name.<p>

<title>Subdivision Cycadicae</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Subdivision Cycadicae</h2>
The fossil history of the Cycads extends back 200 million years.  The living species are the most primitive extant seed plants.  They possess unbranched trunks and some grow to more than 50 ft. tall.  Their seeds are brightly colored, usually red.  Cycads, Ginkgo, conifers and gnetes are gymnosperms, i.e, they possess naked seeds which are borne in an exposed position on the sporophyll.  The conifers are the most numerous of this Division and do not resemble the other 3 groups at all.<p>

 This division has one living member which probably originated about 250 million years ago.  Ginkgo is similar to cycads in reproductive structures and gametophyte development but the leaves are distinctly different.  It is a hardy tree which can live up to 1000 years.  After the first 10 to 20 years of vertical growth, laterally spreading branches develop.<br><br><br><br><p>

<h2>Division Magnoliophyta</h2>
The Magnoliophyta is the largest plant group on Earth.  It contains more than 250,000 described species. Some major features of this Division are presented in an abbreviated phylogeny according to Hutchinson.  The following flow charts give examples of some Orders and Families that have appeared to produce a pathway of organized development.  Select the links to follow the study. <p> <h5>For a more detailed description of the Families cited, you can link to Dallwitz, M. J. (1995 onwards). `The Families of Flowering Plants: Descriptions and
Illustrations.' URL http://muse.bio.cornell.edu/delta/.  Links for the specific Families are found at the bottom of each page. </h5>

<b>The Woody Dicots Line</b> evolved a tendency for secondary growth and woody tissues.<p>
<b>The Herbaceous Dicot Line</b> developed stems generally without secondary growth and are mostly herbaceous.<p>
<b>The Monocotyledonous Line</b> developed seeds with one cotyledon, generally parallel, veined leaves, atactostelic vascular tissue,flower parts in three or multiples of threes, generally without secondary growth, intercalary meristems common.

In all of the major plant categories, there are many other Genera, Families, Orders, etc.  The Survey is not intended to be a thoroughly comprehensive treatise on plants.  It is only an overview of plant diversity.  In addition, there are many taxonomic systems and for the beginner, this can be overwhelming.  For specific information, one should search the botanical literature and other excellent links that continue to appear on the World Wide Web.

Fucus is commonly known as seaweed and usually grows attached to rocks in intertidal zones.  Branches, known as thalli, have receptacles developing at the tips.  Special hallow chambers, known as conceptacles contain gametangia (illustrated below).  Sperm and eggs are released into the water where fertilization takes place.

<h2>Dictyostelium</h2><p>
<i>Dictyostelium</i>  primarily inhabits soil or dung and "feed" on bacteria.  Its spores have thick walls made of cellulose & protein. It is most often known only from laboratory culture in which it develops profusely under proper conditions.

After several divisions of the spore stage, the spores will give rise to amoebae (See Frames 1, 2).  When the food supply is exhausted, amoebae will begin to secrete acarsin, a hormone-like substance which attracts other amoebae causing them to stream toward a center of aggregation (See Frames 3,4).  After several such amoebae have aggregated, a pseudoplasmodium (slug) is formed (See Frame 5).  The slug behaves as a unit and responds as an entity to external conditions (See Frames 6,7,8).

<title>Physarum</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Physarum</h2><p>
<i>Physarum</i>  is representative of the true slime molds.  It's characterized by a plasmodium stage:  a creeping multinucleate mass of protoplasm with no cell walls.  In contrast to the Acrasiomycetes, organisms such as <i>Physarum</i> are easily detected in the field and may be collected in the plasmodioum or sporophore stage. 
<hr>
Life cycle of <i>Physarum</i>
<center><img src="physar1.gif">.</center><br>Spores germinate in the presence of water and liberate one or more amoeboid swarm cells, each bearing two unequal anterior whiplash flagella.  Swarm cells fuse and become zygotes or withdraw their flagella and become myxamoebae.<p>
In homothallic species all gametes are compatible and any two may fuse.  Gametes of different mating types, (heterothallic) are indistinguishable morphologically.  Those with different alleles will fuse.  Zygotes then form multinucleate protoplasmic masses, known as plasmodia.  Chemical changes trigger a plasmodium to form fruiting bodies, differentiate into a sporophore and produce sporangia.  The cells in the sporangia undergo meiosis and become mature haploid spores.

<h3>Generalized Life Cycle of the Sac Fungi</h3> 
<img align="left"src="ascycle.gif">Developmental stages of an ascus - a saclike cell in which haploid spores (ascospores) are produced.<br><hr>See below the diagram for a description of the flow chart.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<hr>
The flow chart above illustrates the following:  Ascospores <img src="gif1.gif">
germinate and develop into mycelia <img src="gif2.gif">.  At this stage,
these mycelia can produce more mycelia, then produce conidia
which can produce more conidia and eventually spores.  This repetitive
cycle is the asexual cycle.  Some mycelia as they age form two
kinds of gametangia, the female organ, ascogonium <img src="gif3.gif"> and the male
organ, antheridium <img src="gif3.gif">.  The antheridium attaches itself to the ascogonium
by means of a receptive hyphal branch, known as the trichogyne <img src="gif4.gif"> and
transfers its nuclei to it <img src="gif5.gif">.  This process which is called plasmogamy 
(the transfer of protoplasm and nuclei which do not fuse), 
stimulates the ascogonium to produce binucleate hyphae <img src="gif6.gif">.  The 
binucleate hyphae, known as dikarya become septate <img src="gif7.gif"> and bend at
the tip to form a hook cell <img src="a.gif">.  (See the flow chart below).<p>


<img align="left"src="ascus.gif">The flow chart below illustrates the following:  The nuclei in the hook cell <img src="a.gif"> divide <img src="b.gif"> and form septa.  The
septated entity forms three cells <img src="c.gif">, a uninucleate basal cell, a
uninucleate apical cell and a binucleate ascus mother-cell.  The
nuclei in the ascus mother-cell fuse (karyogamy) <img src="d.gif">.  The resulting
zygote nucleus in the young ascus is the only diploid nucleus in the
entire life cycle of the filamentous Ascomycetes.  Meiosis then takes 
place and forms a tetrad of nuclei  followed by mitosis.  This
last division is necessary for the development of a mature ascus

<img align="left"src="tuber.gif">Highly prized as food in continental Europe, particularly in France and Italy.  Occur in open forests mainly under Quercus.  Ascocarps are subterranean and  ascospores are liberated only when the ascocarp decays or is broken by animals.  Trained dogs and pigs locate the truffles and dig them up.  People then gather them.  Most U.S. species produce small ascocarps not used as human food.

When wet the leathery tissue lies flat.  The algae component is widely dispersed throughout the organism.  Crustose lichens are closely attached to substrate and are hard to remove without damaging the substrate or the lichen itself.  Occur on overhanging cliffs, near water or on rocks or forest soil.

<title>Characteristics of the Division Bryophyta</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Characteristics of the Division Bryophyta</h2>

Photosynthetic, non-vascular plants in which the female sex organ is the archegonium.  All groups show clear alternation of generations.<p>

The gametophyte generation is dominant, conspicuous and independent.  It may be thalloid or organized into leaf-like structures (phyllids), which are not true leaves; lack cuticle and stomata.<p>

The sporophyte generation consists of a stalk and capsule (together called the sporogonium) and is as conspicuous as the gametophyte but dependent on it for its lifetime, it cannot live an independent existence.  (Lower part of moss capsules may have been photosynthetic)<p>

The ovum remains in the archegonium and spermatozoids swim to it by chemotaxis.  Spores dispersed by a mechanism which ensures dispersal in dry weather only.<p>  

No vascular tissue in either generation.   Root-like structures are rhizoids.<p>

<title>Order Sphagnales</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Order Sphagnales<br>
Family Sphagnaceae<br>
Genus Sphagnum</h2><p>
This Order is recognized as the most primitive of the mosses.  The sporophyte is extremely reduced in that it lacks a seta. The capsule, a characteristic element, is spherical and bears an operculum but lacks a peristome.  There is a single Family and Genus with about 350 species.
Familiar common names for the Genus are bog moss, turf or peat moss.  These plants are aquatic or semiaquatic and grow in dense masses in swamps, ponds or lake margins.  Certain acids are liberated during growth  and cause the water to become acidic (ranging from a pH of 3.7 to 4.8). This creates conditions unfavorable to Fungi and Bacteria.  Thus the decay of dead tissue is greatly retarded and makes for favorable bog conditions.

<title>Life cycle of the Division Psilophyta</title>
</head>
</body>

<h2>Life cycle of <i>Psilotum</i></h2>

<center><img src="whiskfr3.gif"></center><p>
In the reproductive cycle of whisk ferns, a dominant sporophyte plant (1), bearing trilobed sporangia (2), produces homosporous spores (3) which germinate into
haploid gametophytes (4). The underground gametophyte forms mycorrhizal associations with fungi for nutrition and develops archegonia (5), each with 1
egg, and antheridia (6) with flagellated sperm.  After fertilization a diploid zygote (7) forms and eventually
develops into a sporophyte plant (8).  Asexual reproduction can take place by means of gemmae.  While gemmae are means of asexual reproduction in  non-vascular plants such as the liverworts, the difference is that in the non-vascular plants the gemmae develop on the gametophyte while in <i>Psilotum</i> the gemmae develop on the sporophyte.

<h2>Order Selaginellales<br>
<i>Selaginella</i>, The Spikemosses</h2>
The spike mosses are a small group of mostly tropical fern allies that closely resemble the genus Lycopodium. <br>

(A.) Field picture of <i>Selaginella </i>, a tropical species which grows as a mat on the forest floor of the rain forest. (B.) Photomicrograph of the cross section of upright stem (10x).  Cortex tissue is well developed and surrounds a central cavity which contains the vascular cylinder (stele) of xylem and phloem.  Trabeculae (ribbon-like endodermal cells) connect the stele to the cortex.  (C).  Cross section of root.<p>

This genus is a good example of the reproductive pattern of a heterosporous plant, the kind which is found in all higher plants.  See the next page for detail.

</body>

<img align="left"src="quill3.jpg"><h2>Order Isoetales<br>Quillworts</h2>
The quillworts are considered by some botanists to be the last remnant of the fossil tree lycopods because of their peculiar secondary growth, heterospory and presence of ligules.<p>
<img src="quill1.gif"><p>
<img align= "left"src="quill2.gif">Description:  The sporophyte has an enlarged perennial underground stem, known as the corm.  Roots are dichotomously branched and the annual strap shaped leaves grown in a spiral.  Leaves have ligules, vertical air chambers and megasporangia or microsporangi, depending on their position on the plant.<p>

The sporophyte (1) of <i>Equisetum</i> produces a terminal strobilus with whorls of hexagonal sporophyll scales.  Attached to each scale are sporangia (2) containing homosporous spores.  The spores go through meiosis and produced spore tetrads (3).  The spore tetrads mature with attached elater tissue necessary to keep the spores air borne

<h2>Sporangial Development</h2>

The Division Pterophyta is divided into two, but unequal groups with respect to the type of sporangium produced.<p>


<img src="fern_a.gif"><br>
The <b>eusporangiate</b> sporangium has the sporangial wall developing from superficial cells and the sporogenous tissue develops from internal cells of the sporophyll.  The sporangia are large and contain a large number of spores.<br>
The <b>leptosporangiate</b> sporangium develops entirely from the periclinal division of a superficial cell.  The number of spores produced is a multiple of 2 (between 16 and 512 in homosporous species).

<h2>Order Filicales</h2>
The Order Filicales bears several features which are common to a large number of ferns.  In particular they are noted for leptosporangiate sporangia; homosporous spores; and a reduced prothallus.  Two Families do diverge from the common characters in that they are heterosporous and live in aquatic habitats.<p>

<h1>Life Cycles I,  II,  and   III</h1>
The primitive method of reproduction in plants was asexual  and  as plants evolved, sexual reproduction also evolved.  The flow chart below summarizes the general life cycles of autotrophic plants.<p> 

<img src="lifecy2.gif"><br>
While there is no record of the actual processes of plant reproduction, patterns of reproduction can be followed. Prokaryotic organisms reproduce asexually producing filial cells, daughter colonies or fragments from simple cleavage (1).  Mitotic cell division, meiosis and the production of the haploid spores (2)  followed by gametogenesis (3) provide for cell duplication and relatively large and complex cell bodies.  The ability to link the life histories of modern plants to available fossil records suggests that the pattern of zygotic meiosis was the earliest to evolve (4).  Immediate meiosis (gametic) (5) and delayed meiosis (sporic) (6) are two patterns that evolved from the zygotic pattern by a delay in meiosis:<br> (A.) Immediate meiosis develops a haploid pattern -- <b>Haplontic Life Cycle I</b> also known as Monobiontic Haploid -- where the prominent generation is the haploid adult.<br>   (B.) Delayed meiosis develops a diploid pattern -- <b>Diplontic Life Cycle II</b> also known as Monobiontic Diploid  -- where the prominent generation is the diploid adult.<p>
<b>Dibiontic Diploid or Dibiontic Haploid Life Cycle III</b> (heteromorphic or antithetic)-- where both diploid and haploid adults are present (one being less conspicuous) in the cycle is the result of delayed gametogenesis after delayed meiosis (7).  There are some plants that are examples of Life Cycle III where both diploid and haploid adults are present in the cycle and superficially indistinguishable (isomorphic or homologous).<p>
EXAMPLES OF LIFE CYCLES: (Algae have examples of all types.)<br>
Monobiontic Haploid: <i>Chara</i> (algae)<br>
Monobiontic Diploid: <i>Fucus</i><br> 
Dibiontic Haploid (heteromorphic or antithetic): Bryophytes<br>
Dibiontic Diploid (isomorphic or homologous): <i>Ulva</i><br>
Dibiontic Diploid (heteromorphic or antithetic): <i>Nereocystis</i>, all Vascular Plants

<h2>Inflorescence in flowering plants</h2>

Inflorescence is the part of the plant which is concerned with the production of flowers. It may or may not be distinct from the vegetative part.  Thus, in some annual plants the entire branch system of the shoot may be regarded as an inflorescence, whilst in biennials the second year's growth may also be regarded.  Inflorescences are classified according to the type of branching into <a href="racemose.html">indeterminate or racemose</a> and <a href="cymose.html">determinate or cymose</a>.

<h2>Tissue systems of the shoot</h2>
The shoot is the portion of the plant above the roots and is composed  of stems  and leaves.  
<center><img src="meri_st.gif"></center><p>
The apical meristem of the stem (see the diagram above) forms  leaf  primordia  on its flanks and young stem tissues below the  apex  during  the vegetative  phase.  In flowering plants, flower primordia are produced  during the reproductive phase.<p>  

The tissue systems of the shoot are:<p>

<title>Tissue systems of the root</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Tissue systems of the root</h2>
Follow the diagram below to gain the concept of tissue position.  The  root  apical meristem produces new root  cap cells as well as cells of the ground  meristem,  and procambium.  Like the shoot, the root possesses three tissue systems:

<center><img src="root_tis.gif"></center>

1) Dermal Tissue System<br>
In  primary growth, roots are covered with epidermis.  In secondary  growth,  the epidermis and root hairs are sloughed off  when periderm forms on the outside.<p>

2) Ground Tissue System<br>
Cortex  lies between the epidermis and vascular system in  portions  of  roots undergoing primary growth.  The inner layer  of  cortex,  the endodermis  bounds the pericycle tissue  which  surrounds the  primary  vascular  system. See the diagram of the cross section of the root below. In portions  of  roots  undergoing  secondary growth, the cortex, like the epidermis, is shed as the periderm develops  cork cells.<p>

<center><img src="cs_root.gif"></center>

3) Vascular Tissue System<br>
Also see the following in the cross section of root diagram above.  In the root, unlike the stem, the primary vascular system is in a central cylinder  with xylem and phloem arranged in  an  alternate  radial manner.   Primary  xylem "arms"  radiate out from  the  center  with primary phloem  in the outer portion of the cylinder.  Between  them is procambium.  In older portions of roots, where secondary  growth is evident, the vascular cambium produces successive layers of  secondary xylem and phloem.

<h2>Fungus Blight is Threatening Potato Crops Around the World
Developing countries face the greatest risk of a potato blight.</h2>
<p>
By WARREN E. LEARY
Special to The New York Times
<p>
<dd>WASHINGTON, Oct. 23, 1993.  Scientists say variants of the fungus that caused the Irish potato blight of the 1840's are spreading throughout the world, threatening a crop that is a staple in many countries. 
<dd>Agricultural experts are calling for an international research effort to thwart the new fungal variants, which are well-established throughout Europe and into Russia, as well as in Mexico and South American countries including Ecuador, Brazil and Argentina. Infestations are also being reported in potato-growing regions of the United States, Canada, Africa, Japan and Korea, the experts said this week. 

<h2>Scientists to Meet </h2>
<dd>Modern fungicides could theoretically prevent the fungal disease, known as potato late blight, from causing widespread shortages, scientists said, but the effects could be more drastic in developing countries where potatoes have become an increasingly important crop and such chemical remedies are not as readily available. 
<dd>"All indications are that this new form of late blight is spreading around the world, and is more aggressive and harder to control than its predecessors," Dr. Hubert Zandstra, director general of the International Potato Center in Peru, said. 
<dd>Dr. Zandstra said scientists from around the world would meet in Mexico in February to organize an international research program on the problem.  He said a foundation had provided money to start the effort, but that it needed support from the United States and other wealthy nations, as well as industry, to find solutions like developing potatoes with strong resistance to many variants of the fungus.
<dd>The greatest risk is to agriculture in developing countries, where potato production is growing faster than that of any other staple crop except wheat, Dr. Zandstra said in an interview.0
<dd>The new blight could reduce prospects for increasing food supplies in areas such as India and Africa, where there are few resources to buy more fungicides and equipment to use them.  In addition, he said, the new threat could set back efforts to reduce the use of toxic chemicals in agriculture.   "We're not in the situation of the 1840's, facing famine, because we do have the chemicals," Dr. Zandstra said. "But we know the damage these chemicals cause."

<h2>Blight Came From Mexico </h2>   
<dd>Experts said the new threat, made up of fungicide-resistant variants of the common blight fungus known as A1, and a related, possibly more potent type called A2, came from Mexico. Potato late blight is caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans, which thrives in cool, moist conditions and is spread by contact or wind-blown spores. The disease, which can destroy a field in days, causes mottled, dark lesions on leaves and stems from which develop a white, velvety growth that kills the plant. Blighted potatoes develop a dark, corky rot and appear dehydrated. 
"This disease is remarkably explosive," said Dr. William E. Fry, professor of plant pathology at Cornell University. "An affected field looks like it has been burned." 

<h2>A World Priority</h2>
<dd>The fungus primarily reproduces asexually, which limits its genetic variation and makes it more likely to be killed by cold winter weather. But Dr. Fry said that when the Al and A2 types exist in the same place, they mate sexually, producing hard-hulled spores that can survive in soil for months and survive winter weather. 
<dd>Dr. John Niederhauser of the University of Arizona, who won the World Food Prize in 1990 for his work to increase potato production in developing countries, said that cultivating new potatoes with durable resistance to blight should be a world priority. 
<dd>"There has been a world growth in potato production, and finding a new potato with resistance is so important if we are going to feed the growing population of the developing world," he said in a telephone interview. 
<dd>"Forty years ago, 90 percent of potato growth was in the industrialized world, and today, 72 percent is in industrial countries and 28 percent in the developing world," he said. "China, for instance, is now the largest potato producer in the world." 
<dd>Thin-skinned potatoes are not very hardy and, because they are susceptible to diseases and pests, already require higher levels of chemical pesticides and fungicides than any other food crop, Dr. Niederhauser said. "Just when people were starting to use fewer chemicals to grow potatoes, this blight will force them to use more," he said.

<h2>Fungal Host Relationships</h2>

<img align="left"src="fhost1.gif"><img align="left"src="fhost2.gif"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>
Complex symbiotic associations develop between vascular plants and fungi by means of growths known as mycorrhiza.  There are two major forms: <b>ectotrophic</b> -- found in conifers and hardwoods.  The mycelia form a sheath around the roots of the host and hyphae invade the root cortex.  The fungus may secrete hormones, causing morphological changes in roots and absorb carbohydrates from the host.  <b>endotrophic</b> -- found in ferns and some gymnosperms.  Hyphae penetrate intercellularly and develop branched haustoria and prominent vesicles (vesicular-arbuscular - treelike mycorrhizae).<br><br><br>
<img align="left"src="fhost4.gif"><p>Genus <i>Monotropa,
</i>Family Ericaceae.  The roots of this flowering plant which lacks chlorophyll are dependent on mycorrhizae.

<title>Lifecycle of Spikemosses</title>
</head>
</body>
<h2>Life Cycle of <i>Selaginella</i></h2>See a description of heterosporous reproduction below this diagram.
<img src="spikelc.gif"><p>
Starting with the sporophyte (1), some branches bear at their tips aggregations of sporangium-bearing leaves, called sporophylls.  They form loose, conelike structures called strobili (2).  Each strobilus usually contains two kinds of sporophylls, microsporophylls bearing microsporangia and megasporophylls bearing megasporangia. The outer wall of the sporangia is a sterile jacket of cells that surrounds and protects the enclosed sporogenous tissue.  In the microsporangia, the diploid sporocyte cells undergo meiosis to form numerous meiospores which in turn form haploid microspores. In the megasporangium, the entire contents of the megasporangium forms one large megasporocyte  that, by meiosis, produces four haploid
megaspores.<p>

Upon rupture of mature microsporangia, the small, lightweight microspores (3) are readily dispersed by air currents but the larger, heavier megaspores often remain in place in the strobili.  Germination of a microspore produces a male gametophyte (microgametophyte) that develops totally within the confines of the microspore wall (endosporic). At maturity, the entire male gametophyte consists of a one-cell-layer-thick antheridium (4) and fertile tissue that forms biflagellated sperm. Sperm are released by rupture of the microspore wall (6).<p>

Megaspores (3) germinate to begin development of a female gametophyte (megagametophyte) (5) within the confines of the megaspore wall (endosporic).  Absorptive hairlike structures, rhizoids which absorb water and dissolved minerals, develop on the female gametophyte.  Archegonia also develop on the exposed upper surface of the female gametophyte. Each archegonium contains a single egg, and at maturity, the neck and ventral canal cells disintegrate to form an open passageway to the egg (7). Sperm, attracted by substances released from the matured archegonlum, swim through a film of water and enter the open passageway. One sperm eventually fertilizes the egg to form a zygote (8).<p>

Development of the embryonic sporophyte occurs within the archegonium in the female gametophyte. Durlng its early development as an embryo, the sporophyte is parasitic upon the female gametophyte.  Breakdown of the parent sporophytic strobili releases the germinated megaspores (female gametophyte), and the young sporophytes soon develop a root and shoot system to become independent plants (9).

When an antheridium is mature and sufficient water for sperm movement is present, the antheridium cover cell opens and motile sperm swim out.  Here, the antheridium cover is seen in pictures 2 and 3.   A motile sperm is also released in picture 3.   Picture 4 shows a large mass of sperm cells being liberated.  Under similar conditions, the cover cells at the tip of the archegonium neck open.  The neck and ventral canal cells degenerate, leaving an open passway, the neck canal, for the migration of the sperm cells to the egg.  Chemical substances serve as sperm attractants are released by the archegonium.  (See diagram on the previous page.)

After fertilization when the zygote forms, early sporophyte development takes place within the archegonium.  Pictures 1 and 2 show this taking place.  A mass of sporophytic tissue, the foot, forms within the archegonial chamber (picture 3) and functions in the absorption of nutrients from the gametophyte.  As development of the sporophyte progresses, a shoot and root system, capable of supporting the sporophyte is produced (pictures 4 and 5),  further development (pictures 6 and 7).  While still quite small, the sporophyte becomes and independent-living plant (picture 8).  The spent gametophyte soon dies and decomposes.

Sorus structure has been the basis for dividing the Filicales into Families.  This character is sufficiently comprehensive to further subdivide the Families.  In recent decades the efforts of botanists to recognize differences within the sorus has developed "groups within groups".  Opinions still prevail with the realization that Family classification can be artificial.  One survey recognizes 6,400 species and 235 genera  within the Filicales while another describes 9,000 species and 300 genera.<p><br><br><br>

<h2>Indeterminate or Racemose Inflorescence</h2>

A typical racemose inflorescence has an elongate central axis from which the individual pedicels arise.  Each pedicel is axillary to a bract.  Flowering progresses evenly from the bottom upwards, and theoretically the axis may continue to elongate and produce new flowers indefinitely (as long as conditions remain favorable).  Indeterminate inflorescence may be classified as <a href="raceme.html">raceme</a>, <a href="corymb.html">corymb</a>, <a href="spike.html">spike</a>, <a href="umbel.html">umbel</a>, <a href="head.html">head</a> and <a href="panicle.html">panicle</a><p>

<h2>Dermal Tissue System</h2>

The outer layer of the apical meristem gives rise to the epidermis  of  the primary plant body (note the diagram below). 
<center><img src="derm_st.gif"></center>
 In the stems  of  plants  with  secondary  growth, the epidermis is replaced by periderm, commonly called  the "outer  bark".  Periderm consists of the meristematic cork  cambium  producing cork (phellem) outward and the phelloderm (inward).<p>

<h2>Vascular Tissue System</h2>
In the diagram below note the following:  the procambium is also derived from the apical meristem.  It  initiates  the  vascular system with cells that differentiate  inside  into  primary xylem, and outside into primary phloem.  In plants  with secondary growth, there also develops  the vascular cambium  which makes possible added layers of secondary xylem and phloem.  The persistent growth of the vascular cambium results in an increase in stem diameter.

<title>Meristems</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Meristems</h2>

In the primary state of stem growth, the apical meristem  at the  shoot apex produces cells that differentiate into the  three primary meristems.  They are the (1) ground meristem, which gives rise  to pith, cortex, and the mesophyll of leaves, (2) the  procambium which produces primary xylem and phloem of the  vascular system,  and (3) protoderm which produces the  epidermal  system.  In plants with secondary growth, the protoderm is replaced by the vascular cambium. <p>
Another less common meristem, the  intercalary meristem  is temporary.   It  is  located between tissues that already have differentiated.  Eventually  it matures and produces no more new growth.

If the vascular tissue  forms  a ring between the cortex and the center of the stem, the center is known  as pith.

<h2>Ground tissue systems - conifer</h2>
Comparable  to  gum ducts in some dicot stems, some conifers have  resin  ducts.  Secondary  xylem tissue, "wood", may be composed of sapwood and heartwood in proportions that vary from genus to genus.  Sapwood consists  of  live xylem  components, active in the transport of water.   The  inner heartwood  is composed of inactive xylem that has lost water  and stores  waste  products.  Organic compounds such as  oils,  gums, resins,  and  tannins fill in the cells and give  the  wood  more resistance to fungi and other organisms that cause wood to rot.  <br>

<img align="left"src="vasa1.gif">In woody dicot and conifer stems, the vascular bundles are arranged in a ring around the stem.  In plants with secondary growth, some of the meristematic cells remain and form a contiguous ring of vascular cambium which begins to produce secondary phloem outside and secondary xylem inside.  The yearly additions are known as growth rings.  The cambium forms two systems of vascular tissue, one vertical up the axis and one horizontal across the axis called a ray system.  Inward from the cambium, xylem rays are produced.  Outwardly, phloem rays are produced.

<h2>Ground tissue systems - monocot</h2>

<img align="left"src="vasb1.gif">Monocots have no vascular or cork cambia and therefore no secondary growth.  They exit in a primary state of growth.  In large plants, such as palms, a thickening of the trunk occurs by multiple divisions of the parenchyma cells of the procambium.  In some members of the Lily family, divisions occur outside of the vascular bundles.

<h2>Ground tissue systems - woody dicot</h2>

WOODY DICOT STEMS:   In  primary growth,  all cells of the procambium differentiate  into  primary vascular  tissue.  In  plants  with secondary  growth, such as the case in woody dicots,  some of the meristematic cells remain and form a contiguous ring of vascular cambium, which begins to produce secondary phloem outside, and secondary xylem inside.   The  yearly additions of secondary xylem  are  commonly called "growth rings".  The cambium forms two systems of vascular tissue,  one vertically up the axis, and the  other  horizontally across the axis (called a ray system).  Inward from the  cambium, xylem  rays are produced.   Outwardly  and continuously,  phloem rays are  produced.  Associated  with the rays are gum ducts in dicots  which  contain resins, oils, gums, and mucilages.  <br>

It produces new root cap cells below the meristem and contributes to the protoderm, the ground meristem of the cortex and procambium (the three primary meristems that initiate tissues) above the meristem. <p>

<img align="left"src="rootderb.jpg">ROOT CAP: The function of the root cap is to protect the apical meristcm and to penetrate the soil as the root elongates. It is composed  of parenchyma cells whose cell walls, along the surfaces of thc root cap are mucilaginous which allows for easier passage through soil particles. As cells are sloughed off, more cells are produced by the apical meristem.

<h2>Root tissue - ground tissue system</h2>

CORTEX:  Cortex tissue is made up of parenchyma cells.  In conifers and dicots with secondary growth, the cortex is shed; in monocots, without secondary growth, it is retained.  In cortical cells, food is stored as starch in  amyloplasts  and  proplastids may develp into chloroplasts if the root is exposed to light.<br>

<img src="rootgrnd.gif"><p>

ENDODERMIS:  This is the innermost layer of the cortex that encircles the vascular tissue.  Along the radial and transverse walls is a fatty layer, the Casparian strip which acts as an effective filtering system.  Water and minerals pass through the system to reach all parts of the plant. <br>

<body>

LEAF TISSUES - DICOT<br>
The outer surface of the leaf  blade is epidermal tissue and the ground tissue is the photosynthetic mesophyll which is interspersed with vascular bundles (known as "veins"). The vascular bundles connect with the blade and stem and pass through the petiole.<p>

EPIDERMIS:  The walls of  the outer layer of epidermal cells are cutinized and form a tough outer surface.  In many species, stomata are present in both upper and lower epidermal surfaces while others contain stomata only in  the lower surface.  Hairs, known as trichomes, are attached to epidermal cells.<br>
GROUND TISSUE:  Parenchyma cells of ground tissue are divided into palisade and spongy mesophyll.  Usually the columnar cells of the palisade layer lie under the upper epidermis and contain most of the chloroplasts.  The spongy parenchyma possesses irregularly shaped cells with air spaces between.  Sclerids may also be present. <br>
VASCULAR TISSUE:  Leaf veins (vascular bundles) usually possess xylem on the upper side and phloem on the lower side.  The reverse may be true in major veins. Small veins are usually enclosed by a layer of parenchyma cells (bundle sheath) which functions in moving materials between the vein and mesophyll tissue.<br>

<img align="left"src="repand.jpg"><h2>Corymb</h2>Similar to the raceme is the corymb, which may be regarded as a modification of a typical raceme.  The mother-axis is relatively shorter, and, owing to the elongation of the lower pedicels, all the flowers come to one level.  The flowers are in a spiral around the buds, and the fruits are at the outside of the cluster.  The buds are at the center of the inflorescence near the terminal buds of the stem which forms the axis.  This renders the whole inflorescence more conspicuous to insects, and the individual flowers tend to remain small.<p>

A spike is similar to a raceme, but the pedicels are supressed and the flowers are sessile.  By this arrangement small flowers may be aggregated in a cylindrical mass.  There are two special forms: the spadix and the catkin.<br><p>

<img align="left"src="thapsia.jpg"><img align="right"src="umbel.gif">
<h2>Umbel</h2>An umbel is another kind of flat-topped cluster of flowers.  It is an inflorescence without an obvious central axis.  A branch is terminated by a number of nodes separated by exceedingly short internodes so that apparently there is no axis at all within the inflorescence.  The pedicels of many flowers appear to rise from the same point.  Usually these pedicels are of the equal length.  Often a ring of bracts (involucre) subtends the umbel.  In a true umbel the buds are in the center (at the apex of the stem) and the flowers are intermediate and the fruits outside.  An umbel is really a shortened raceme, that is, one with only a very short axis.  The fundamentally lower flowers bloom first.<br><br><br><br><br><p>

<h2>Panicle</h2>
A panicle is a compound raceme.  It is a branched raceme with the upper branches usually progressively shorter.  Many of the panicles, such as lilac, actually bloom in a mixed sequence (partly determinate, partly indeterminate) and are more technically mixed panicles.<p>

<title>Diachasium</title>
</head>
<body>

<img align="left"src="sardus.jpg"><h2>Diachasium</h2>In plants with opposite branching the terminal bud of the stem forms a flower and the two axillary branches at the first node below the flower elongate.  Each of these forms a flower, and again the the two axillary buds at the next node of each branch elongate, forming flowers and continues the procedure.  The result is a more or less flat-topped cluster of buds, flowers, and fruits with the oldest fruit in the center.  This development can continue to an unrestricted size (diameter but not length) because there is no theoretical  limit to the repitition of development of the pair of axillary buds into flowers with accompanying development of a pair of subordinate axillary buds.<p>

<title>Sympodial Cyme</title>
</head>
<body>

<h2>Sympodial Cyme</h2><p>A special type of modified cyme which superficially resembles a raceme or spike is the sympodial cyme, in which the apparent main axis consists of a succession of short axillary branches.  Each flower is terminal to its true axis, but the side branch originating just beneath the flower produces its own terminal flower with another side branch just beneath it, so that theoretically <br><img align="left"src="helicyme.gif"><img align="left"src="scorcyme.gif">the inflorescence can elongate indefinitely by producing a branch just below each flower.  Sympodial cymes are of two types, helicoid and scorpioid.  In a helicoid cyme the branches are all on the same side of the developing axis, so that the inflorescence is curved or circinately rolled.  Often the inflorescence is conspicuously circinate when young and progressively unrolls as flowering proceeds.  In a scorpioid cyme the branches are alternately on opposite sides of the developing sympodial axis, so that the axis has a zig-zag appearance.  Helicoid cymes are commoner than scorpioid cymes and are expecially frequent in the Boraginaceae and Hydrophyllaceae.<p>

<h2>Root vascular tissue system</h2>

XYLEM:  Primary xylem arms radiate from the center of the root and vary in number.  The dicot types include diarch (2 arms), triarch (3 arms) or tetrarch (4 arms, see red circle below), and the monocot type is polyarch (many arms).  Several types of cells, living and nonliving, make up xylem tissue.  Tracheary and vessel elements conduct water and nutrients.  Fibers provide support and living parenchyma cells store food.  In monocots, vessel elements whose walls have been stretched and broken by elongation, result in spaces known as lacunae.<p>

<center><h2><b>So Close</b></h2></center>
<p><center><b>submitted by  Timothy Lee</b></center>

<p>When I began the 1995-96 crew season for Manhattan College, I had a great deal of 
excitement.  In the previous spring, The Heavyweight Novice Four I was in had a relatively successful run.
We won the MAAC race by defeating Loyola and Iona.  We also qualified for the semi-finals of the Dad Vail Regatta.  This was the first time in recent memory that a novice boat raced on Friday and was still around on Saturday. 
To top it all off, we had three rowers returning from this boat, along with the entire Varsity Heavyweight Four from the previous semester.  How quickly things can change.
<p>In the Fall Head Season, we competed in a Heavyweight 8 boat both at Connecticut and 
Schuylkill.   We also rowed the eight at our two sprint races during the fall.  Following the second sprint race, the heavyweight population quickly cut in half.  Three of the guys quit and one decided to lose a couple of pounds and row lightweight in the spring.  While most crews may have been destroyed by these events, the remaining four of us knew that we would have a pretty good four man to look forward to rowing at Vails.  
<p>This concept was soon out of the window.  One of the guys, who happened to be the stroke of the boat, decided to leave early in the second semester and get an internship.  And then, out of no where, the three seat in our four came down with mononucleosis.  Our boat had fallen apart before our eyes.  All was left were two sophomores, John Kiernan and myself, who had raced a total of two varsity sprint races.  Our coach, Mike Ward, decided then that we would be rowing a pair at Dad Vail in May.  Although John and I were a little nervous about the idea, we knew we had no other option.  Upon our return from Spring Break, we got the pair out of storage, just to find a four-inch wide hole in the middle of the bow. 
 With two months left in the season, we brought it over to the New York Athletic Club to get fixed up.  Until then we would row in a four man boat.

<p>Rowing heavyweight has always been fun.  We had always been at a disadvantage, however.  John and I both weigh in at about 185 pounds.  Although this is easily heavier than the 160 pound limit for the lightweight class, it is also about twenty pounds lighter than the "ideal"
heavyweight.  To top it all off, all of our heavyweight four races at the various regattas included a different pair of lightweights in the boat with us.  While most crews would give up at this point, it only pushed John and myself more.  We were competitive in all of the races, and John and I, along with Mike Martin and Colin Brady from the lightweight boat, took home the MAAC title in the Heavy Four.  This kept us happy and somewhat fulfilled.  Every morning we would jump into the light eight, and row just to keep in shape, as we waited for the pair.  And waited....
<p>The first weekend in May is the New York Rowing Championships.  Last year it was held in Rome, New York.  In this race a rower can only row once, and since there was no pair, we played the role of spectators.  This was when it first hit us: one week left in the season, until Dad Vail Regatta.  Without any practice in the pair, our anxiety level was higher than the two of us had ever had before, and frustration from not rowing in Rome, the two of us really thought about what we should do.  Ward promised that we would have the pair on Monday, and the three of us (along with coxswain Maureen Nelan) would have a full week of practice.  
<p>Upon our return from Rome, I received a call from our coach. Ward said that the boat would not be ready until Thursday, the day before Vails.  John and I sat down and decided that we did not want to be embarrasses in front of the thousands of spectators in Philadelphia.  Ward told us not to worry about it, and that he wanted us to row.  John and I reconsidered, and on Thursday, the day in which we left for Philly, we took to the water for the first time in two weeks and for the first time in our pair with, the "Blue Bomber".
<p>Once we got to Philadelphia, John and I were relaxed.  We did not have to row on Friday, which meant two things: we could enjoy Friday and we had a straight final on Saturday.  After the races had concluded on  Friday, John, Maureen, and I took the boat up and down the course, planning our race.  After dinner, John and I needed to relax.  We were nervous about the race, but the boxing matched on HBO seemed to calm our fears.  We finally got to bed at midnight, but the hotel's fire alarm went off at three in the morning.  We were up until five, and wondered what else could go wrong.  
<p>When we woke Saturday morning, John and I looked at each other, and gave our typical morning welcome, "I don't want to row today!".  We got into the van and headed over to the race course.  After watching some more races and getting some fluids in us, we walked slowly back to our trailer, were the "Bomber" awaited.  Mike Ward gave us the typical speech: "O.K. Engine Room, just go out and do what you have to do.  Make sure you have fun. Row hard, but have fun."  As we headed up the river, we noticed that the wind had shifted and that the race would include a headwind.  We saw some of the lightweights on the shore yelling "good luck!"
We got to the starting line as nervous as ever, but knew we couldn't go back.
<p>Five, four, three, two, one...ROW!!!  We were on it, sort of.  We began the piece cautiously, knowing we weren't in the best of shape.  Waves were filling up the boat rather quickly. The two of us were having a hard time keeping keel.  As we approached the Strawberry-
Mansion Bridge, we were in dead last.  Maureen took the turn well heading into the bridge, but John and I just weren't clicking.  All of a sudden, John caught a tiny crab, and I soon followed.  I began cursing and immediately heard John do the same.  It was at about the 1000 meter point were we realized what we had to do.
<p>John and I have rowed every race in our Manhattan College careers together.  We know each others ability, what ticks us off, and most importantly, we know the other one hates to lose. We also knew at this point of the race that if we didn't start making the move, we never would.  Soon enough we were picking up speed. Our strokes were powerful, our catches were strong, and we were making up distance on the other crews.  As we went between the 1000 and 1500 meter marks, we heard Maureen scream that we were in fourth place, and two lengths down on third. At the five hundred meter mark to go in the race, we saw two crews in front of us.  Second place was still three or so lengths ahead of us.  
We gave it all.  On the shore, right before the grandstand, we heard Mike Ward and Colin Brady yelling. We pulled harder. We were dead even with University of Queens (Canada) with 200 meters to go.  John and I had nothing left, we pulled as hard as we could, with the little strength we had.  As we crossed the finish line, we knew we had third place, good enough to medal at the Dad Vail Regatta.  
<p>When we went to the medal platform, everyone cheered for us. It was a truly great moment.  I'm sure for John, as well as myself, that this was the greatest moments in our entire sport careers.  We began the season with high expectations, which were quickly turned to desperate pleas for help. Although we went through that brief phase of wanting to give it all up, we knew we were better than that.  Our coach and teammates stood behind us and pushed us when we didn't want to be bothered.  They kept us motivated.  With everyone's help, we turned what could have been the longest season for any heavyweight crew in Manhattan College history into one of the greatest stories.  
John and I head into this season with different attitudes than we did before.  We are now the experienced heavies on the team.  Our goal is this year is to stand on the medal stand in Philadelphia, the second weekend in May, for the second straight year.  We know it can be done with hard work and dedication.  We also know that it takes a team, as a whole, for any individual rowers to be successful.

<title>So Close</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"  text="#000000" link="#238E23" vlink="#8E2323">
<center><h2><b>So Close</b></h2></center>
<p><center><b>submitted by Robert Vitelli</b></center>

<h3><p>The day seems so clear in my mind.



<p>Philadelphia.  May, 1994.  The breeze off the river blows
against my face.  Its sunny out and hot.  And I feel the sun
because I just cut off all of my hair on a dare with one of my
teammates.  Now I have a flat top.  I am sweating ever so
slightly, because I have no more water left in my body.  I ran
last night to lose more weight.  I lost 2.5lbs since yesterday. 
122.5lbs.  I have won the bet with my teammates, I knew I could
weigh less than 125.  Who would have ever of thought I could
lose 14 lbs in one semester.  As unhealthy as I was, I felt
great.



<p>We watch the other crews row towards the starting line.  This is
it, the big day.  We have made the finals.  Its our chance to do
it.  <b>To win.</b>



<p>There is a good feeling among the team.  The other guys are
psyching themselves up, patting each other on the backs, teasing
one another.  They have taped messages on each other's backs.   
Messages to remind them of the early mornings and long strenuous
workouts than brought us this far.  <I>"This is it."  "Gold." 
"Everything."  "No return."  "Welcome death."  </I>  



<p>The white tape seems pale, almost too real in comparison to the
bright kelly green jerseys, glimmering in the sunlight.



<p>We make our circle for one last pep talk.  All nine of us
looking each other in the eyes.  Going over the race strategy
again.  Anticipating the start.  The rowers  accepting the pain
to come, welcoming it.  For me, I just can't screw up.  We have
come too far.



<p>Coach nods his head at me.  It is time.  Our time.  I know what
I have to do.



<p><I>"Hands-on." </I> Eight serious faces grip the shell.  The fiberglass
shines with a magical glow.  



<p><I>"Come-on, Bro.  Let's go do it!"</I>



<p>We row to the start.  It is as beautiful and wondrous as it has
always been.  Eight shiny kelly green blades rowing together, as
one.  Every stroke as perfect as the one before it.  Smooth.  



<p>The sun still beats down on my head.   The skin is burning.



<p>We align with the other boats.  I look to my left at the other 5
boats.  I look at the coxswains.  Then I look at Hoover, the
stroke-man.  His face, usually serious, now with a small smirk.  

<p><I>"Oh, I just wanted to let you know.  We are getting a medal."  
</I>
'<p>Yes' I think to myself.  He has won national championships
before.  He knows what it is like.  I am going to feel it soon
too.



<p>I go over the race in my head.  High 20, settle.  Ten before the
bridge.  Tiller to starboard, ease back to port.  Another ten. 
Twenty at the one-thousand.  And crank-it on the last
five-hundred.  I quickly review all of the training I have
received to motivate this crew.  To keep them charged.  I
remember all of the articles I have read.  All the planning.  I
have gone over my calls.  Deep breath.



<p>I hear the water and the quiet talk of the thousands of people
on the shore.



<p><I>"We have alignment....GO!!!"  </I> We start.

<p>I open my mouth, and the words just pour out.  

<p><I>"Three-quarter, full!  High twenty!"   
</I>
<p>We are movin'!!  Yes!  

<p><I>"Rating: 43!" </I> 

<p>Woo.  Forty-three strokes a minute.  

<p><I>"Settle."  </i>Like clockwork.  

<p><I>"Rating: 39!" </I> 

<p>We are coming to the bridge, we are in the front of the pack.  

<p>We make the turn under the bridge.  

<p><I>"Power ten!"  
</I>
<p>NO!  Oh, no!  

<p>Why are we suddenly in fourth??  

<p>The bridge turn.  

<p>How could I have let that psyche me up?   

<p><I>"Legs!!" </I> We are on the straight away and seven-hundred and
fifty meters into the race.  I look to my left.  We are seat and
seat, dead even.  

<p><b>"THAT'S IT!  LET'S TAKE 'EM!!  Ten to focus on leg drive!!" </b> 

<p>We pull up a seat. 

<p>They pull up a seat.  

<p>Up and down.  

<p>Back and forth.  

<p><I>"Twenty!"  </I>

<p>The race is half over.  

<p>First place is one-hundred meters ahead.  

<p>Second is about fifty.  

<p>And the other four-60ft long eights are all with 25 meters of
each other, but we want it more than them!  

<p>I am yelling my cadences.  Screaming my motivational words that
have won us gold medals before.  But never for a regional
championship.  

<p>We are starting to pull up, more now.

<p><b>"YES!  We are doing it!"</b>

<p>Four seats up.  Now we almost have third. 

<p><I>"Last 500!  Build in three to sprint!"</I>

<p>Just a little more and we can medal.  Now, that boat is pulling
up on us again.  NO.

<p><I>"Just hang on guys.  We can take 'em!"</I>

<p><I>"Power 10!  </I>

<p>Legs!  

<p>Drive!  

<p>Fast hands!  

<p>Keep that focus!  

<p>Yes!  

<p><I>"Keep going!!"</I>

<p>Suddenly, for the first time in seven months, I am lost for
words.



<p>In a split second, every practice, every article, every pep
talk, every ounce of planning ran through my head.  I had nothing
left to say.  All of my motivational senses were blank.  Nothing
I could say could make them understand how close we are to
keeping fourth and reaching for third.  These guys didn't
understand.

<p>In anguish, looking up into the heavens quickly, at the 250
meter mark, I manage to scream, with my harsh, worn voice,



<p><b>"OH MY GOD.....WE'RE SOOOO CLOSE!"
</b>


<p>I look my stroke man in the eye.  He understands.  I don't ever
remember him breathing so deeply.  I am scared.  I continue.

<p><b>"YEAH!!  BALLS TO THE WALL!!  THERE IS NO TURNING BACK.  WE
HAVEN'T PRACTICED EVERY FREAKIN' MORNING TO LOSE IT NOW.  WE'RE
GOING FOR IT!!"
</b>
<p><b>"LAST 200 METERS!"</b>

<p>We are locked into fourth place.

<p><b>"LET'S CRANK IT OUT!   WE ARE ALMOST THERE!"</b>

<p>Less than 100 meters.  We are pulling up.

<p><b>"WE'RE MOVING, WE'RE ALMOST THERE!"</b>

<p>I hear the crowd.  I know the entire team is there, screaming,
chanting, praying. They want to be proud.

<p><b>"LAST TWENTY!!  EVERYTHING!!!"
</b>
<p>It is over.

<p><b>"PADDLE!"</b>

<p>Hoover takes his last stroke, and gasped like I have never seen
anyone gasp before.  He opened his mouth so wide, I felt like I
could see the disappointment, the pain, the anguish, the
disgust.  I could see his soul.  I thought he was going to die.



<p>The shell glided under the finish line bridge.  Everyone is
gasping for breath. We don't know how we finished.  Fourth? 
Third even??



<p><I>"Manhattan:  5th."</I>

<p><b>"UUUUUCCCKK!!!"</b>    I hear from the far end of the boat. These
eight guys, that have spent an entire semester, or even four
years together, didn't win.  We didn't even get a medal.  Our
dreams of the respect and victory and the feeling of bringing
home a medal is gone forever.



<p>With my gravely, spent voice, "<i>That was an awesome race.  We
were so close.  We gave them a run for their money."</I>



<p><I>"Let's get the hell outta' here, " </i>says Hoover.



<p>As we row slowly  back to the dock, the sun is setting.  



<p>My head isn't burning as much now.  All I feel is the pain from
screaming in my throat, and feeling like someone took a knife to
my stomach.  I almost cried.



<p><I>"Let them know that we gave everything we had," </i>said Hoover.



<p>Then, I saw them.  Little pieces of tape.   <I>"No return." 
"Through the wall."  "This is it."  "Last chance."  "Welcome
death."  </i>Floating in the water.   It was one of the most
magical, eerie, poetic moments in my life.



<p>I watched the tape glide by, and felt lost.  They gave
everything, but still didn't get it.  



<p>Suddenly, I realized how much meaning two simple words could
have.

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

Due to cultural ideals of feminine beauty, young women feel a strong
desire to be thinner than their bodies naturally tend to be.  As a
result, they change their eating patterns and they may develop eating
disorders.  The most common eating disorders are Anorexia Nervosa and
Bulimia. Both eating disorders are more common among young adults than
at any other age.

Below you will find information on
<ul>
<li><b>ANOREXIA NERVOSA
<li>BULIMIA
<li>WHAT CAUSES ANOREXIA NERVOSA & BULIMIA
<li>PHYSICAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ANOREXIA NERVOSA &
BULIMIA
<li>WAYS TO HELP
<li>WHERE TO FIND HELP</b>
</ul>
<p><br>
<h3>WHAT IS ANOREXIA NERVOSA ?</h3>

Anorexia Nervosa is a serious psychological and physiological disorder.
Anorexia Nervosa has the following characteristics:
<ol>     
<li>The anorexic restricts eating to the point of emaciation.

<li>The anorexic may exercise constantly and take laxatives or
          diuretics to lose weight.
   
<li>The most common ages of onset are 11 and 18, the beginning
          and ending of adolescence.
     
<li>The disorder is mostly diagnosed in the upper middle class.
          However, both rich and poor can develop the disorder.
     
<li>Even though anorexics are extremely thin and underweight,
        most insist that they are not hungry or thin.

<li>With psychological help about 1/3 of all anorexics get  
          better.  About 20% die of the disorder.

<li>Approximately 60% of all anorexics also develop bulimia.
</ol> 

<h3>WHAT IS BULIMIA ?</h3>

Bulimia is binge-eating followed by self-induced vomiting or the use of
laxatives.  Bulimia has the following characteristics:
<ol>     
<li>The disorder usually begins in late adolescence and early   
          adulthood. 
     
<li>It is not easily recognized by others because bulimics may be
          of normal weight or a little overweight.

<li>Bulimics are aware of the problem and try to keep it a        
          secret.

<li>Bulimics may become depressed, guilty, and disgusted with
          their binge-purge cycles.  Yet they will not stop the
          behavior.
</ol>


<h3>WHAT CAUSES ANOREXIA NERVOSA & BULIMIA ?</h3>
1.   A desire for control, competence, and independence.
<p>
2.   Discomfort with sexual thoughts and feelings.
<p>
3.   Perfectionism.
<p>
4.   A desire for quick results from dieting.

<h3>PHYSICAL & PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ANOREXIA NERVOSA &
BULIMIA</h3>

<em>NOREXIA NERVOSA</em>
<p>
1.   Loss of approximately 30% or more of body weight leading to
     emaciation.
<p>
2.   Irregular or complete loss of menstrual period.
<p>
3.   Dry skin.
<p>
4.   Hair loss.
<p>
5.   Growth of fine body hair.
<p>
6.   Withdrawal and isolation.
<p>
7.   Death.
<p>
<em>BULIMIA</em>
<p>
1.   Abdominal pain due to overeating.
<p>
2.   Heart and kidney problems.
<p>
3.   Excessive constipation.
<p>
4.   Digestive problems.
<p>
5.   Swollen salivary glands.
<p>
6.   A tear in the esophagus.
<p>
7.   Diarrhea.
<p>
8.   Feelings of depression, guilt, self-disgust and loss of control.
<p>
9.   Loneliness and isolation.
<p>
10. Frequent weight fluctuation.



<h3>WAYS TO HELP</h3>

1.   Talk openly and freely and ask direct questions about the person's
     eating patterns.
<p>
2.   Listen to what is said and treat it seriously. Do not add to the
     person's guilt by nagging about eating/not eating or gossiping
     about the person among your friends.
<p>
3.   Encourage the person to seek professional help.

<H3><B>Away From Home:  Coping with the Unexpected

</B></H3><HR>

Regardless whether the 'unexpected' or crises at home is a change in

financial support, a natural disaster, an illness or death of a loved one, etc.

you might experience some or all of the following emotional responses:<BR>

<UL>

<LI>panic (what am I going to do?...I can't handle this...etc.)

<LI>shock (I can't believe this is happening; there must be a

mistake..) 

<LI>fear (what if things are worse than I know right now? 

how can I go on without...? etc....)

<LI>denial (maybe it isn't true etc...)

<LI>guilt (I should have been there! Perhaps feeling glad to be

safe, yet, at the same time guilty for not being there. etc....)

<LI>anger (why does this happen to me?...Your family's wishes and 

needs may be in conflict to your own.)

<LI>depression (feeling all alone, isolated, hopeless, desperate, you 

may have difficulties concentrating, sleeping, eating, etc....)</UL>

<BR><P>

Besides these emotional reactions you may also experience physical

symptoms such as:

     <UL>

<LI>stomach aches,

<LI>headaches,

<LI>diarrhea or

<LI>back pain</UL><BR><P>



You may worry not only about your situation at home but also about how

your academic work is affected.   You may need to take some time to address your particular
situation by first talking it over with a trusted friend.  Perhaps you may come to the point of
needing to take some time off from

school or withdrawing from one of  your classes.  It's generally not advisable to make hasty
decisions but to explore a number of possibilities with the assistance of some other people.  There
are some people around campus who may be helpful to you.  It might be good to try to make a
list of specific people now ... before you desparately need to ask for their assistance.<P>
<p>

Since your usual support system and ways of coping with problems may not

be available to you, it might be helpful to know who might be able to help you while being away
from home.  <BR>

For example:<BR>
<ul>
<li>To deal with your emotional responses and physical symptoms, you may want to talk to a
counselor at the <B>Counseling Center</B> (501 Miguel Hall: (718) 862-7394) and / or see
the doctor at the <B>Infirmary</B> (East Hill Rm 813: (718) 862-7217).   You can come to the
Counseling Center anytime between Monday and Friday from 9:00 am to 4:30 PM.  Services
are free and confidential.  You may want to bring a friend along to feel more comfortable. 
<il>If you have to miss some classes or feel you may need to withdraw from a class or two, you
might be helped by seeing your Academic Advisor (whose office is in your Academic Dean's
Office).
</ul>
<br>
Specific preparation is always very helpful.  Please take a moment and list the people in this
country (USA) who might be able to help you:

 <PRE>                        NAME    &   PHONE NUMBER

     Family members___________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

     Academic Advisor________________________________________________

     International Advisor________________________________________

     Resident Assistant__________________________________________

     Other____________________________________________________

     ________________________________________________________

</PRE><P><BR>

Being far away from home it might be helpful to think about the issues

involved in dealing with a crises situation ahead of time.  Certainly the hope

is that nothing difficult will happen especially while you are separated from

your family.  Should you need to speak with someone if a crisis situation arises, to whom would
you turn?  It is easy to tell yourself  "I'll handle that when and if I get to it.  Things will take care
of themselves later."  It is very sad when it is too late.<P>

It may be helpful to have  names, phone numbers and

addresses available of family members, friends, and neighbors at home who

might be a resource in the case of an emergency.  Please take a moment

and note these.  If you don't have all the information available, be sure to fill it in soon.

When needing to deal with a crises, it is helpful to think about how you may

have dealt with difficult situations in the past.  It also might be beneficial to

let friends and other significant people in your present life know how they

best can assist you in certain circumstances.   It may be important for others

to know how your customs and ways of handling problems may differ,

especially when your own cultural background is different from those of the

people around you.  For instance, in this country if a parent is sick he or she

may share his / her illness in detail with other family members to feel close

and to get support, while in your country a parent may not inform you about 

his/her illness to protect you.  Generally in this country people tend to relate

information regarding an illness and / or a death in the family very directly,

while in your country the respectful way might be to wait for an appropriate

time which may be several weeks after the fact.  Keeping these differences

in mind , please think about :

<UL>

<LI> Who ideally would relate difficult 'news' to you?

<LI>How  best would information regarding a difficult event be shared

with you?

<LI>Who else should be present? 

<LI>What are some of your ways to deal with stress?</UL>

<P>

Some coping ways that you may not have considered are:

<UL>

<LI>Write down thoughts and feelings;  keep a journal.

<LI>Express your feelings to a friend.

<LI>If you live in a dorm, talk to your resident  assistant.

<LI>Exercise, go for a run, swim etc....

</UL><P>



As mentioned earlier, the hope is that you won't have to confront a crises

situation during your stay at College.  If, however, you have to, this

information may at least be helpful in dealing with the issues at hand.

Also, remember that in every crises lies an opportunity.<BR><P>

<H1>Answers to Your Questions About Panic Disorder</H1>
<HR>

<P>
Panic Disorder is a serious condition that around one out of every
75 people might experience. It usually appears during the teens
or early adulthood, and while the exact causes are unclear, there
does seem to be a connection with major life transitions that
are potentially stressful: graduating from college, getting married,
having a first child, and so on. There is also some evidence for
a genetic predisposition; if a family member has suffered from
panic disorder, you have an increased risk of suffering from it
yourself, especially during a time in your life that is particularly
stressful.
<H3>Panic Attacks: The Hallmark of Panic Disorder</H3>

<P>
A panic attack is a sudden surge of overwhelming fear that comes
without warning and without any obvious reason. It is far more
intense than the feeling of being &quot;stressed out&quot; that
most people experience. Symptoms of a panic attack include:
<UL>
<LI>raging heartbeat
<LI>difficulty breathing, feeling as though you &quot;can't get
enough air&quot;
<LI>terror that is almost paralyzing
<LI>dizziness, lightheadedness or nausea
<LI>trembling, sweating, shaking
<LI>choking, chest pains
<LI>hot flashes, or sudden chills
<LI>tingling in fingers or toes (&quot;pins and needles&quot;)
<LI>fear that you're going to go crazy or are about to die
</UL>

<P>
You probably recognize this as the classic &quot;flight or fight&quot;
response that human beings experience when we are in a situation
of danger. But during a panic attack, these symptoms seem to rise
from out of nowhere. They occur in seemingly harmless situations--they
can even happen while you are asleep.
<P>
In addition to the above symptoms, a panic attack is marked by
the following conditions:
<UL>
<LI>it occurs suddenly, without any warning and without any way
to stop it.
<LI>the level of fear is way out of proportion to the actual situation;
often, in fact, it's completely unrelated.
<LI>it passes in a few minutes; the body cannot sustain the &quot;fight
or flight&quot; response for longer than that. However, repeated
attacks can continue to recur for hours.
</UL>

<P>
A panic attack is not dangerous, but it can be terrifying, largely
because it feels &quot;crazy&quot; and &quot;out of control.&quot;
Panic disorder is frightening because of the panic attacks associated
with it, and also because it often leads to other complications
such as phobias, depression, substance abuse, medical complications,
even suicide. Its effects can range from mild word or social impairment
to a total inability to face the outside world.
<P>
In fact, the phobias that people with panic disorder develop do
not come from fears of actual objects or events, but rather from
fear of having another attack. In these cases, people will avoid
certain objects or situations because they fear that these things
will trigger another attack.
<H3>How to Identify Panic Disorder</H3>

<P>
Please remember that only a licensed therapist can diagnose a
panic disorder. There are certain signs you may already be aware
of, though.
<P>
One study found that people sometimes see 10 or more doctors before
being properly diagnosed, and that only one out of four people
with the disorder receive the treatment they need. That's why
it's important to know what the symptoms are, and to make sure
you get the right help.
<P>
Many people experience occasional panic attacks, and if you have
had one or two such attacks, there probably isn't any reason to
worry. The key symptom of panic disorder is the persistent fear
of having future panic attacks. If you suffer from repeated (four
or more) panic attacks, and especially if you have had a panic
attack and are in continued fear of having another, these are
signs that you should consider finding a mental health professional
who specializes in panic or anxiety disorders.
<H3>What Causes Panic Disorder: Mind, Body, or Both? </H3>

<P>
<B>Body:</B> There may be a genetic predisposition to anxiety
disorders; some sufferers report that a family member has or had
a panic disorder or some other emotional disorder such as depression.
Studies with twins have confirmed the possibility of &quot;genetic
inheritance&quot; of the disorder.
<P>
Panic Disorder could also be due to a biological malfunction,
although a specific biological marker has yet to be identified.
<P>
All ethnic groups are vulnerable to panic disorder. For unknown
reasons, women are twice as likely to get the disorder as men.
<P>
<B>Mind:</B> Stressful life events can trigger panic disorders.
One association that has been noted is that of a recent loss or
separation. Some researchers liken the &quot;life stressor&quot;
to a thermostat; that is, when stresses lower your resistance,
the underlying physical predisposition kicks in and triggers an
attack.
<P>
<B>Both: </B>Physical and psychological causes of panic disorder
work together. Although initially attacks may come out of the
blue, eventually the sufferer may actually help bring them on
by responding to physical symptoms of an attack.
<P>
For example, if a person with panic disorder experiences a racing
heartbeat caused by drinking coffee, exercising, or taking a certain
medication, they might interpret this as a symptom of an attack
and , because of their anxiety, actually bring on the attack.
On the other hand, coffee, exercise, and certain medications sometimes
do, in fact, cause panic attacks. One of the most frustrating
things for the panic sufferer is never knowing how to isolate
the different triggers of an attack. That's why the right therapy
for panic disorder focuses on all aspects -- physical, psychological,
and physiological -- of the disorder.
<H3>Can People with Panic Disorder lead normal lives? </H3>

<P>
The answer to this is a resounding <B>YES</B> -- if they receive
treatment.
<P>
Panic disorder is highly treatable, with a variety of available
therapies. These treatments are extremely effective, and most
people who have successfully completed treatment can continue
to experience situational avoidance or anxiety, and further treatment
might be necessary in those cases. Once treated, panic disorder
doesn't lead to any permanent complications.
<H3>Side Effects of Panic Disorder </H3>

<P>
Without treatment, panic disorder can have very serious consequences.
<P>
The immediate danger with panic disorder is that it can often
lead to a phobia. That's because once you've suffered a panic
attack, you may start to avoid situations like the one you were
in when the attack occurred.
<P>
Many people with panic disorder show &quot;situational avoidance&quot;
associated with their panic attacks. For example, you might have
an attack while driving, and start to avoid driving until you
develop an actual phobia towards it. In worst case scenarios,
people with panic disorder develop agoraphobia -- fear of going
outdoors -- because they believe that by staying inside, they can
avoid all situations that might provoke an attack, or where they
might not be able to get help. The fear of an attack is so debilitating,
they prefer to spend their lives locked inside their homes.
<P>
Even if you don't develop these extreme phobias, your quality
of life can be severely damaged by untreated panic disorder. A
recent study showed that people who suffer from panic disorder:
<UL>
<LI>are more prone to alcohol and other drug abuse
<LI>have greater risk of attempting suicide
<LI>spend more time in hospital emergency rooms
<LI>spend less time on hobbies, sports and other satisfying activities
<LI>tend to be financially dependent on others
<LI>report feeling emotionally and physically less healthy than
non-sufferers.
<LI>are afraid of driving more than a few miles away from home
</UL>

<P>
Panic disorders can also have economic effects. For example, a
recent study cited the case of a woman who gave up a $40,000 a
year job that required travel for one close to home that only
paid $14,000 a year. Other sufferers have reported losing their
jobs and having to rely on public assistance or family members.
<P>
None of this needs to happen. Panic disorder can be treated successfully,
and sufferers can go on to lead full and satisfying lives.
<H3>How Can Panic Disorder Be Treated?</H3>

<P>
Most specialists agree that a combination of cognitive and behavioral
therapies are the best treatment for panic disorder. Medication
might also be appropriate in some cases.
<P>
The first part of therapy is largely informational; many people
are greatly helped by simply understanding exactly what panic
disorder is, and how many others suffer from it. Many people who
suffer from panic disorder are worried that their panic attacks
mean they're &quot;going crazy&quot; or that the panic might induce
a heart attack. &quot;Cognitive restructuring&quot; (changing
one's way of thinking) helps people replace those thoughts with
more realistic, positive ways of viewing the attacks.
<P>
Cognitive therapy can help the patient identify possible triggers
for the attacks. The trigger in an individual case could be something
like a thought, a situation, or something as subtle as a slight
change in heartbeat. Once the patient understands that the panic
attack is separate and independent of the trigger, that trigger
begins to lose some of its power to induce an attack.
<P>
The behavioral components of the therapy can consist of what one
group of clinicians has termed &quot;interoceptive exposure.&quot;
This is similar to the systematic desensitization used to cure
phobias, but what it focuses on is exposure to he actual physical
sensations that someone experiences during a panic attack.
<P>
People with panic disorder are more afraid of the actual attack
than they are of specific objects or events; for instance, their
&quot;fear of flying&quot; is not that the planes will crash but
that they will have a panic attack in a place, like a plane, where
they can't get to help. Others won't drink coffee or go to an
overheated room because they're afraid that these might trigger
the physical symptoms of a panic attack.
<P>
Interoceptive exposure can help them go through the symptoms of
an attack (elevated heart rate, hot flashes, sweating, and so
on) in a controlled setting, and teach them that these symptoms
need not develop into a full-blown attack. Behavioral therapy
is also used to deal with the situational avoidance associated
with panic attacks. One very effective treatment for phobias is
in vivo exposure, which is in its simplest terms means breaking
a fearful situation down into small manageable steps and doing
them one at a time until the most difficult level is mastered.
<P>
Relaxation techniques can further help someone &quot;flow through&quot;
an attack. These techniques include breathing retraining and positive
visualization. Some experts have found that people with panic
disorder tend to have slightly higher than average breathing rates,
learning to slow this can help someone deal with a panic attack
and can also prevent future attacks.
<P>
In some cases, medications may also be needed. Anti-anxiety medications
may be prescribed, as well as antidepressants, and sometimes even
heart medications (such as beta blockers) that are used to control
irregular heartbeats.
<P>
Finally, a support group with others who suffer from panic disorder
can be very helpful to some people. It can't take the place of
therapy, but it can be a useful adjunct.
<P>
If you suffer from panic disorder, these therapies can help you.
But you can't do them on your own; all of these treatments must
be outlined and prescribed by a psychologist or psychiatrist.
<H3>How Long Does Treatment Take? </H3>

<P>
Much of the success of treatment depends on your willingness to
carefully follow the outlined treatment plan. This is often multifaceted,
and it won't work overnight, but if you stick with it, you should
start to have noticeable improvement within about 10 to 20 weekly
sessions. If you continue to follow the program, within one year
you will notice a tremendous improvement.
<P>
If you are suffering from panic disorder, you should be able to
find help in your area. You need to find a licensed psychologist
or other mental health professional who specializes in panic or
anxiety disorders. There may even be a clinic nearby that specializes
in these disorders.
<P>
When you speak with a therapist, specify that you think you have
panic disorder, and ask about his or her experience treating this
disorder.
<P>
Keep in mind, though, that panic disorder, like any other emotional
disorder, isn't something you can either diagnose or cure by yourself.
An experience clinical psychologist or psychiatrist is the most
qualified person to make this diagnosis, just as he or she is
the most qualified to treat this disorder.

<H1>Controlling Anger -- Before It Controls You</H1>
<HR>

<P>
We all know what anger is, and we've all felt it: whether as a
fleeting annoyance or as a full-fledged rage.
<P>
Anger is a completely normal, usually healthy, human emotion.
But when it gets out of control and turns destructive, it can
lead to problems: problems at work, in your personal relationships
and in the overall quality of your life. And it can make you feel
as though you're at the mercy of an unpredictable and powerful
emotion. This brochure is meant to help you to understand and
get a handle on handling anger.
<H3>What is Anger?</H3>

<P>
<I><B>The Nature of Anger<BR>
</B></I>Anger is &quot;an emotional state that varies in intensity
from mild irritation to intense fury and rage,&quot; according
to Charles Spielberger, Ph.D., a psychologist who specializes
in the study of anger. Like other emotions, it is accompanied
by physiological and biological changes; when you get angry, your
heart rate and blood pressure go up, as does the level of your
energy hormones, adrenalin and noradrenalin.
<P>
Anger can be caused by both external and internal events. You
could be angry at a specific person (Such as a coworker or supervisor)
or event (a traffic jam, a canceled flight), or your anger could
be caused by worrying or brooding about your personal problems.
Memories of traumatic or enraging events can also trigger angry
feelings.
<P>
<I><B>Expressing Anger<BR>
</B></I>The instinctive, natural way to express anger is to respond
aggressively. Anger is a natural, adaptive response to threats;
it inspires powerful, often aggressive, feelings and behaviors,
which allow us to fight and to defend ourselves when we are attacked.
A certain amount of anger, therefore, is necessary to our survival.
<P>
On the other hand, we can't physically lash out at every person
or object that irritates or annoys us; laws, social norms and
common sense place limits on how far our anger can take us.
<P>
People use a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes
to deal with their angry feelings. The three main approaches are
<I>expressing, suppressing, and calming.</I>
<P>
Expressing your angry feelings in an assertive --not aggressive
-- manner is the healthiest way to express anger. To do this,
you have to learn how to make clear what your needs are, and how
to get them met, without hurting others. Being assertive doesn't
mean being pushy or demanding; it means being respectful of yourself
and others.
<P>
Anger can be suppressed, and then converted or redirected. This
happens when you hold in your anger, stop thinking about it and
focus on something positive. The aim is to inhibit or suppress
your anger and convert it into more constructive behavior. The
danger in this type of response is that if it isn't allowed outward
expression, your anger can turn inward -- on yourself. Anger turned
inward may cause hypertension, high blood pressure or depression.
<P>
Unexpressed anger can create other problems. It can lead to pathological
expressions of anger, such as passive-aggressive behavior (getting
back at people indirectly, without telling them why, rather than
confronting them head-on) or a personality that seems perpetually
cynical and hostile. People who are constantly putting others
down, criticizing everything and making cynical comments haven't
learned how to constructively express their anger. Not surprisingly,
they aren't likely to have many successful relationships.
<P>
Finally, you can calm yourself down inside. This means not just
controlling your outward behavior but also controlling your internal
responses, taking steps to lower your heart rate, calm yourself
down and let the feelings subside.
<P>
As Dr. Spielberger notes, &quot;when none of these three techniques
work, that's when someone - or something -- is going to get hurt.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Anger Management<BR>
</B></I>The goal of anger management is to reduce both your emotional
feelings and the physiological arousal that anger causes. You
can't get rid of, or avoid, the things or the people that enrage
you, nor can you change them, but you can learn to control your
reactions.
<H3>Are You Too Angry?</H3>

<P>
There are psychological tests that measure the intensity of angry
feelings, how prone to anger you are and how well you handle it.
But chances are good that if you do have a problem with anger,
you already know it. If you find yourself acting in ways that
seem out of control and frightening, you might need help finding
better ways to deal with this emotion.
<H3>Why Are Some People More Angry Than Others?</H3>

<P>
According to Jerry Deffenbacher, Ph.D., a psychologist who specializes
in anger management, some people are really more &quot;hotheaded&quot;
than others; they get angry more easily and more intensely than
the average person. There are also those who don't show their
anger in loud spectacular ways but are chronically irritable and
grumpy. Easily angered people don't always curse an throw things;
sometimes they withdraw socially, sulk or get physically ill.
<P>
People who are easily angered generally have what some psychologists
call a low tolerance for frustration, meaning simply that they
feel that they should not have to be subjected to frustration,
inconvenience or annoyance. They can't take things in stride,
and they're particularly infuriated if the situation seems somehow
unjust: for example, being corrected for a minor mistake.
<P>
What makes these people this way? A number of things. One cause
may be genetic or physiological; there is evidence that some children
are born irritable, touchy and easily angered, and that these
signs are present from a very early age. Another may be sociocultural.
Anger is often regarded as negative; we've taught that it's all
right to express anxiety, depression or other emotions but not
to express anger. As a result, we don't learn how to handle it
or channel it constructively.
<P>
Research has also found that family background plays a role. Typically,
people who are easily angered come from families that are disruptive,
chaotic and not skilled at emotional communications.
<H3>Is It Good to &quot;Let it All Hang Out&quot;?</H3>

<P>
Psychologists now say that this is a dangerous myth. Some people
use this theory as a license to hurt others. Research has found
that &quot;letting it rip&quot; with anger actually escalates
anger and aggression and does nothing to help you (or the person
you're angry with) resolve the situation.
<P>
It's best to find out what it is that triggers your anger, and
then to develop strategies to deep those triggers from topping
you over the edge.
<H3>What Strategies Can You Use to Keep Anger at Bay?</H3>

<P>
<B>Relaxation<BR>
</B>Simple relaxation tools such as deep breathing and relaxing
imagery can help calm down angry feelings. There are books and
courses that can teach you relaxation techniques, and once you
learn them you can call upon them in any situation. If you are
involved in a relationship where both partners are hot-tempered,
it might be a good idea for both of you to learn these techniques.
<P>
Some simple steps you can try:
<UL>
<LI>Breathe deeply, from your diaphragm; breathing from your chest
won't relax you. Picture your breath coming up from your &quot;gut.&quot;
<LI>Slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as &quot;relax&quot;,
&quot;take it easy&quot;. Repeat it to yourself while breathing
deeply.
<LI>Use imagery; visualize a relaxing experience, from either
your memory or your imagination.
<LI>Non-strenuous, slow yoga-like exercises can relax your muscles
and make you feel much calmer.
</UL>

<P>
Practice these techniques daily. Learn to use them automatically
when you're in a tense situation.
<P>
<B>Cognitive Restructuring<BR>
</B>Simply put, this means changing the way you think. Angry people
tend to curse, swear or speak in highly colorful terns that reflect
their inner thoughts. When you're angry, your thinking can get
very exaggerated and overly dramatic. Try replacing these thoughts
with more rational ones. For instance, instead of telling yourself,
&quot;oh, it's awful, it's terrible, everything's ruined,&quot;
tell yourself, &quot;it's frustrating, and it's understandable
that I'm upset about it, but it's not the end of the world and
getting angry is not going to fix it anyhow.&quot;
<P>
Be careful of words like &quot;never&quot; or &quot;always&quot;
when talking about yourself or someone else. &quot;This machine
never works,&quot; or &quot;you're always forgetting things&quot;
are not just inaccurate, they also serve to make you feel that
your anger is justified and that there's no way to solve the problem.
They also alienate and humiliate people who might otherwise be
willing to work with you on a solution.
<P>
For example, you have a friend who is constantly late when you
make plans to meet. Don't go on the attack; think instead about
the goal you want to accomplish (that is, getting you and your
friend there at about the same time). So avoid saying things like,
&quot;You're always late! You're the most irresponsible, inconsiderate
person I have ever met!&quot; The only goal that accomplishes
is hurting and angering your friend.
<P>
State what the problem is, and try to find a solution that works
for both of you; or take matters into your won hands by, for instance,
setting your meeting time a half-hour earlier so that your friend
will, in fact, get there on time, even if you have to trick him
or her into doing it! Either way, the problem is solved and the
friendship isn't damaged.
<P>
Remind yourself that getting angry is not going to fix anything,
that it won't make you feel better (and may actually make you
feel worse).
<P>
Logic defeats anger, because anger, even when it's justified,
can quickly become irrational. So use cold hard logic on yourself.
Remind yourself that the world is &quot;not out to get you,&quot;
you're just experiencing some of the rough spots of daily life.
Do this each time you feel anger getting the best of you, and
it'll help you get a more balanced perspective.
<P>
Angry people tend to demand things: fairness, appreciation, agreement,
willingness to do things their way. Everyone wants these things,
and we are all hurt and disappointed when we don't get them, but
angry people demand them, and when their demands aren't met their
disappointment becomes anger. As part of their cognitive restructuring,
angry people need to become aware of their demanding nature and
translate their expectations into desires. In other words, saying
&quot;I would like&quot; something is healthier than saying &quot;I
demand&quot; or &quot;I must have&quot; something. When you're
unable to get what you want, you will experience the normal reactions
--frustration, disappointment, hurt -- but not anger. Some angry
people use this anger as a way to avoid feeling hurt, but that
doesn't mean the hurt goes away.
<P>
<B>Problem-Solving<BR>
</B>Sometimes, our anger and frustration are caused by very real
and inescapable problems in our lives. Not all anger is misplaced,
and often it's a healthy, natural response to these difficulties.
There is also a cultural belief that every problem has a solution,
and it adds to our frustration to find out that this isn't always
the case. The best attitude to bring such a situation, then, is
not to focus on finding the solution but rather on how you handle
and face the problem.
<P>
Make a plan, and check your progress along the way. (People who
have trouble with planning might find a good guide to organizing
or time management helpful.) Resolve to give it your best, but
also not to punish yourself if an answer doesn't come right away.
If you can approach it with your best intentions and efforts,
and make a serious attempt to face it head-on, you will be less
likely to lose patience and fall into all-or-nothing thinking,
even if the problem does not get solved right away.
<P>
<B>Better Communication<BR>
</B>Angry people tend to jump to --and act on-- conclusions, and
some of those conclusions can be pretty wild. The first thing
to do, if you are in a heated discussion, is to slow down and
think through your responses. Don't say the first thing that comes
into your head, but slow down and think carefully about what you
want to say. At the same time, listen carefully to what the other
person is saying and take your time before answering.
<P>
Listen, too, to what is underlying the anger. For instance, you
like a certain amount of freedom and personal space, and your
&quot;significant other&quot; wants more connection and closeness.
If he or she starts complaining about your activities, don't retaliate
by painting you partner as a jailer, a warden or an albatross
around your neck.
<P>
It's natural to get defensive when you're criticized, but don't
fight back. Instead, listen to what's underlying the words: the
message that this person might feel neglected and unloved. It
may take a lot of patient questioning on your part, and it may
require some breathing space, but don't let your anger --or a
partner's-- let a discussion spin out of control. Keeping your
cool can keep the situation from becoming a disastrous one.
<P>
<B>Using Humor<BR>
</B>&quot;Silly humor&quot; can help defuse rage in a number of
ways. For one thing, it can help you get a more balanced perspective.
When you get angry and call someone a name or refer to them in
some imaginative phrase, stop and picture what that word would
literally look like. if you're at work and you think of a co-worker
as a &quot;dirt-bag&quot; or a &quot;single-cell life form,&quot;
for example, picture a large bag full of dirt (or an amoeba) sitting
at your colleagues desk, talking on the phone, going to meetings.
Do this whenever a name comes into your head about another person.
If you can, draw a picture of what the actual thing might look
like. This will take a lot of the edge off your fury; and humor
can always be relied on to help un-knot a tense situation.
<P>
The underlying message of highly angry people, Dr. Deffenbacher
says, is &quot;things oughta go my way!&quot; Angry people tend
to feel that they are morally correct, that any blocking or changing
of their plans is an unbearable indignity and that they should
NOT have to suffer this way. Maybe other people do, but not them.
<P>
When you feel that urge, he suggests, picture yourself as a god
or goddess, a supreme ruler who owns the streets and stores and
office space, striding alone and having your way in all situations
while others defer to you. The more detail you can get into your
imaginary scenes, the more chances you have to realize that maybe
you are being a little unreasonable; you'll also realize how unimportant
the things you're angry about really are.
<P>
There are two cautions in using humor. First, don't try to just
&quot;laugh off&quot; your problems; rather, use humor to help
yourself face them more constructively. Second, don't give in
to harsh, sarcastic humor; that's just another form of unhealthy
anger expression.
<P>
What these techniques have in common is a refusal to take yourself
to seriously. Anger is a serious emotion, but it's often accompanied
by ideas that, if examined, can make you laugh.
<p>
<b>Changing Your Environment<br></b>
<P>
Sometimes it's our immediate surroundings that give us cause for
irritation and fury. Problems and responsibilities can weigh on
you and make you feel angry at the trap you seem to have fallen
into, and all the people and things that form that trap.
<P>
Give yourself a break. Make sure you have some &quot;personal
time&quot; scheduled for times of the day that you know are particularly
stressful. One example is the working mother who has a standing
rule that when she comes home from work, for the first fifteen
this brief quiet time, she feels better prepared to handle demands
from her kids without blowing up at them.
<P>
<B>Some other tips for easing up on yourself:</B>
<UL>
<LI><I>Timing:</I> if you and your spouse tend to fight when you
discuss things at night -- perhaps you're tired, or distracted,
or maybe it's just habit -- try changing the times when you talk
about important matters so these talks don't turn into arguments.
<LI><I>Avoidance:</I> if your child's chaotic room makes you furious
every time you walk by it, shut the door. Don't make yourself
look at what infuriates you. Don't say&quot;well, my child should
clean up the room so I won't have to be angry!&quot; That's not
the point. The point is to keep yourself calm.
<LI><I>Finding alternatives:</I> if your daily commute through
traffic leaves you in a state of rage and frustration, give yourself
a project -- learn or map out a different route, one that's less
congested or more scenic. Or find another alternative, such as
a bus or commuter train.
</UL>

<H3>Do You Need Counseling? </H3>

<P>
If you feel that your anger is really out of control, if it is
having an impact on your relationships and on important parts
of your life, you might consider counseling to learn how to handle
it better. A psychologist or other licensed mental health professional
can work with you in developing a range of techniques for changing
your thinking and you behaviors.
<P>
When you talk to a prospective therapist, tell her or him that
you have problems with anger that you want to work on, and ask
about his or her approach to anger management. Make sure this
isn't only a course of action designed to &quot;put you in touch
with your feelings and express them&quot; --that may be precisely
what your problem is.
<P>
With counseling, psychologists say, a highly angry person can
move closer to a middle range of anger in about 8 to 10 weeks,
depending on circumstances and the techniques used.
<H3>What About Assertiveness Training?</H3>

<P>
It's true that angry people need to learn to become assertive
(rather than aggressive), but most books and courses on developing
assertiveness are aimed at people who don't feel enough anger.
These people are more passive and acquiescent than the average
person; they tend to let others walk all over them. That isn't
something most angry people do. Still, these books can contain
some useful tactics to use in frustrating situations.
<P>
Remember, you can't eliminate anger -- and it wouldn't be a good
idea if you could. In spite of all your efforts, things will always
happen that will cause you anger. Life will always be filled with
frustration, pain, loss and the unpredictable actions of others.
You can't change that; but you can change the way you let such
events affect you. Controlling your angry responses can keep them
from making you even more unhappy in the long run.<HR>

<h1>SUICIDE PREVENTION</h1>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    
     After accidents and homicides, suicide is the third leading cause of
death among young adults ages 15-24.  It can be prevented. Men are more
likely to commit suicide than women. They usually use violent means to
end their own lives.  Females, on the other hand, are more likely to
attempt suicide.  They usually use drugs or poison to try and end their
lives.  You should note that a suicide attempt is a "cry for help" and a
request for social support.  The suicidal person is letting his/her
feelings be known.  His/her problems seem overwhelming and too difficult
to handle.

<h3>WHY DO COLLEGE STUDENTS KILL THEMSELVES ?</h3>
     
     Because each individual is unique there is no single reason as to
why a student commits suicide.  However, there are several factors that
may contribute to a student having suicidal thoughts.  These include:
<p>
1. <b>Major life transition</b>, such as loss of a loved one, breaking up with
     a boyfriend/girlfriend, moving to a new town or school, failing an
     exam or course, not getting into one's choice of major, etc.  These
     major life changes can cause a college student to feel unloved,
     depressed, isolated and lonely. 
<p>
2. <b>Feelings of hopelessness and helplessness</b>.  Problems in living seem
     more than one can bear.  No matter what one does things do not seem
     to be getting better and no one seems to care or can help.
<p>
3. <b>Negative feelings about oneself</B>.  A student who is suicidal
     experiences feelings of worthlessness and of being a failure. 
     He/she may not be doing well in school or may not be excelling in
     academic or social areas that are of interest.
<p>
4. <b>Wanting to end unbearable pain/problems</B> that are so overwhelming.
<p>
5. <b>Alcohol and substance abuse</B> can cause a student to lose self control
     and engage in impulsive suicidal behaviors.
<p>
Note that depression is a major contributing factor to suicidal thinking. 
Depression may result from several factors, including the recent loss of
a family member or friend, disappointments in romantic relationships, or
failure to live up to one's own or others' expectations.


<h3>MYTHS AND FACTS ABOUT SUICIDE</h3>

There are many myths about suicide:                                     
<p>
<em>MYTH</em>
<p>
1. Asking a student if he/she is thinking about suicide will put the
   idea into his/her head.
<p>
2. Once a student decides to commit suicide there is no way of stopping
   him/her.
<p>
3. Suicide happens without warning.
<p>
4. Students who commit suicide are mentally ill.
<p>
<em>FACT</em>
<p>
1. Discussing the problem openly
shows the suicidal student that
someone cares and wants to
help.
<p>
2. Most students who are suicidal
do not want to die. They are
making a "cry for help".
<p>

3. 75% of the people who attempt
or commit suicide have shown
some warning sign(s).
<p>
4. Students who are suicidal are
not necessarily mentally ill.

<h3>WARNING SIGNS</h3>
    
     There are verbal and non-verbal warning signs of suicide that will
let you know that your classmate or friend is crying for help.
<p>
<em>NON-VERBAL warning signs include:</em>
<p>
1. Giving away personal or prized possessions.
<p>
2. Increased alcohol or drug use.
<p>
3. Sleeping too much or too little.
<p>
4. Lack of interest in personal appearance.
<p>
5. Lack of interest in friends.
<p>
6. Lack of interest in social activities that were formerly of
     interest.
<p>
7. Poor performance in school.
<p>
8. Boredom, restlessness, and loss of concentration.
<p>

Please note that many of these warning signs are signs of depression. 
Depression does not necessarily mean that a person is contemplating
suicide.  But depressed people often think of suicide.
<p>
<em>VERBAL warning signs include such negative statements as:</em>
<p>     
1. "Instructors, classmates, families and friends do not care".
<p>
2. "Life isn't worthwhile".
<p>
3. "People are better off without me".
<p>
4. "Everything seems to be going wrong".
<p>
5. "I don't need this any more".

<h3>WAYS TO HELP</h3>
   
1. Talk openly and freely and ask direct questions about the
     student's intention.
<p>
2. Listen to what is said and treat it seriously. Do not add to your
   friend/classmate's guilt by debating, arguing or lecturing about
   whether or not suicide is right or wrong.
<p>
3. NEVER leave a student who is suicidal alone.
<p>
4. Encourage the student to seek help.
<p>
5. Get help immediately.

<TITLE>Coping With Depression</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<H2>A Few Suggestions For Combating Depression</H2>
<HR>

<H2>Assume a "Coping" Attitude</H2><P>

<H3>Even though we are not able to change all the things we would
like to in our lives, we still have control over how we cope with
adversity.  When we take on a coping attitude we are recognizing
that we almost always have choices available to us, even if that
choice is to do nothing.
</H3><P>

<H2>Practice Assertion</H2><P>

<H3>Assertion can most simply be defined as truly being oneself. 
Part of being a unique, assertive person involves learning to
identify one's feelings and thoughts.  This should result in a
confident expression of oneself and a greater understanding on
the part of others.</H3><P>

<H2>Talk To a Friend</H2><P>

<H3>Try to be open with others by sharing your thoughts and feelings. 
Isolation often increases depression while activity and social
support frequently decrease it.</H3><P>

<H2>Use a Self-Rescue List</H2><P>

<H3>Create a list of things you can do which might help you feel
better when you're depressed or overwhelmed.  Think of things
which have worked for you in the past.  Some suggestions might be
to go out for a soda with a trusted friend, engage in a sporting
activity, nurture yourself with a warm bath
or cup of tea.</H3><P>

<H2>Set Life Goals</H2><P>

<H3>College is a time when one often wonders "where am I going with my 
life?"  When these questions come up it can help to create a list of 
life goals for oneself.  This list should be updated as
your interests and values change.  It can also be helpful to
visualize what your life would be like if you fulfilled the
various goals.</H3><P>

<H2>Laugh and Play</H2>

<H3>Set aside time for spontaneous, unstructured activities.  This
can be done alone or with others and can involve things which you
have never done before.
</H3><P>

<H2>Get Help If You Need It</H2><P>

<H3>It may be that you have tried all of these things at one time or
another with little or no success.  Don't give up!  It might be
time for you to seek professional help which you are likely to
benefit from.  It's always harder to do it alone, especially when
one feels alone to begin with.  We owe it to ourselves to get
help!

<CENTER><p><h2>How does Counseling Work?</h2></center>

<blockquote><H3><p>The "Counseling-Relationship" is different from social and typical
friendship relationships.  Rather than give specific advice, for example, as a trained
professional, the Counselor acts as a skilled listener, helping you clarify your
situation.  In this way you may be better able to understand yourself, your situation, and the
factors that affect you.  Moreover, the Counselor doesn't tell you what to do. 
The Counseling-Relationship often helps you to discover what you really want
to do, helping you get a better understanding of yourself, and helping you to
develop more effective coping skills.  In other words, the Counselor doesn't "do
things to you" but "works with you".</blockquote></H3>

emergency situations involving danger to oneself or others).  The identity of those who use the
Counseling Center is also regarded as confidential.</H3></blockquote>

<h2><u><b>Program Description</b></u></h2>
<p align=left>
The US Global Change Research Information Office (GCRIO) provides access 
to data and information on global change research, adaptation/mitigation strategies and technologies, and global change-related educational resources on behalf of the various US Federal Agencies and Organizations that are involved in the <a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/">US Global Change Research Program </a>(USGCRP).   GCRIO offers the following products and services to its users:
<p>
<ul>
<li>GCRIO acts as a clearinghouse for selected key documents and reports that are either generated or sponsored by the US Government or by specific Federal Agencies.  GCRIO generates abstracts of  these documents and places them into an on-line searchable

 <a href="http://sedac.ciesin.org:80/Harvest/brokers/GCRIO/query.html">bibliographic data base</a>.  Links to other 
relevant bibliographic systems are also maintained.  GCRIO can respond to requests for copies of these documents either directly or indirectly by forwarding the request or the user to
 the proper Government/Agency contact.  Selected documents are available <a href="online.html">on-line</a> in their entirety.</li>
<p>
<li>GCRIO provides high-level User Services for the interagency <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">Global Change Data and Information System </a>(GCDIS).  The function is designed to complement the existing User Support functions already in place at the various Federal Agencies.  Requests for data and information from GCDIS are processed by GCRIO User Services staff and forwarded to the appropriate Agency contact, as appropriate.</li>
<p>
<li>GCRIO performs outreach services to both domestic (Federal, state, and local) and international target audiences (including governments, institutions, researchers, educators, students, and the general public) in an effort to showcase relevant activities and results of the US Global Change Research Program and to help increase the awareness of the availability of data and information resources of the participating Federal Agencies.</li>
<p>
<li>The <a href="http://www.gcrio.org/">GCRIO Home Page</a> (http://www.gcrio.org) provides access to selected  bibliographic data bases; web sites at the participating Federal Agencies; relevant environmental data, catalog, and library systems; and a special section that deals with environmental education and research funding opportunities.  Brochures describing GCRIO's products and services are available in English, French, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, and Chinese.</li>

<h2><u><b>History of GCRIO</b></u></h2>
<p align left>
In 1990, Congress passed and the President signed Public Law 101-606, <a href="http://www.gcrio.org/gcact1990.html">The Global Change Research Act of 1990</a>.  The purpose of the legislation was: 
<p>
<blockquote>
. . . to require the establishment of a United States Global Change Research Program aimed at understanding and responding to global change, including the cumulative effects of human activities and natural processes on the environment, to promote discussions towards international protocols in global change research, and for other purposes.
</blockquote>
<p align left>
Under Title II (International Cooperation in Global Change Research) of the Act, Section 204 requires that a Global Change Research Information Office (GCRIO) be established.  The stated purpose of the GCRIO is:
<p>
<blockquote>
 . . . to disseminate to foreign governments, businesses, and institutions, as well as citizens of foreign countries, scientific research information available in the United States which would be useful in preventing, mitigating, or adapting to the effects of global change.
</blockquote>
<p align left>
In June 1991, the Working Group on Global Change (WGGC) of the Committee on Earth and Environmental Sciences (CEES) [now the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR) of the Committee on the Environment and Natural Resources (CENR)] convened a Task Group representing several Federal agencies to analyze the requirements of the Law and to establish GCRIO.  In November 1991, the Task Group produced a report of its recommendations including direction to expand the target audience of GCRIO to include US citizens and organizations.  In May 1992, the SGCR designated that GCRIO be implemented within the <a href="http://www.ciesin.org/">Consortium for International Earth Science Information Network </a>(CIESIN) under the direction of a GCRIO Oversight Panel established within the SGCR.  The initial GCRIO Implementation Plan was submitted to the SGCR in November 1992.  A formal Statement of Work for GCRIO was approved by the GCRIO Oversight Panel in early 1993 and GCRIO began formal operation in May 1993.

<h1>Global Change Documents and Publications</h1>
<p align=left>
One of GCRIO's primary mission elements is to serve as a <strong>clearinghouse</strong> for documents and publications that pertain to global environmental change research, adaptation/mitigation strategies and technologies, and education.  Although GCRIO 


facilitates access to documents from many different sources, the emphasis is on those derived from relevant activities of US Federal Agencies and Organizations.   GCRIO performs this function in two ways:
<p align=left>
<ul>
<li>First, GCRIO provides access to <a 
href="biblio.html">bibliographic data bases</a> that enable a user to identify relevant documents and publications based on free-text searches of the title, abstract, and various keywords.  GCRIO maintains its own bibliographic data base which consists pr
imarily of information on global change-related documents that have been generated by US Federal Agencies and Organizations.  In parallel, some Agencies maintain their own bibliographic data base, and in an effort to minimize any duplication of effort, GC
RIO simply provides links to those agency data bases.  Finally, GCRIO also provides links to other non-Federal and commercial bibliographic systems.  There are many such systems in the world today; we have tried to identify a few that contain information 
that is relevant to our mission area. (Many commercial services tend to be business oriented.)  Note that in most cases, one needs an account to use the commercial system.  This list is certainly not exhaustive.  We welcome suggestions for other relevant 
systems to add to our list. </li>
<p>
<li>Second, GCRIO provides access to selected documents and publications <a href="online.html">on-line</a> in their entirety.  These documents are typically selected on the basis of their widespread appeal (i.e., <i>Our Changing Planet</i> provides

 an annual overview of activities of the USGCRP) or because they support the timely dissemination of important events or results related to global environmental change.</li>

<h1>Global Change Data and Information Resources</h1>
<p align=left>
In terms of access and dissemination, GCRIO's primary responsibility lies in the realm of <a href="/docpub.html">documents and publications</a>.  Providing and facilitating access to global change-related <strong>data and information resources</strong> that are derived from Federal Agencies and Organizations is one of the overall goals of the <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">GCDIS</a>.  GCRIO supports the GCDIS in terms of high-level users services and outreach, but it should not and does not attempt to duplicate the access and dissemination infrastructure provided by the "GCDIS approach" to increasing interagency interoperability.   GCRIO can, however, provide a set of links to existing Federal (and relevant non-Federal) information systems, while in parallel, 

GCDIS strives to make these systems more interoperable.
<p align=left>
For this effort, GCRIO defines four classes of information systems that are relevant to the GCRIO mission:
<dl>
<dt><a href="/catalog.html">Catalog Systems</a>
<dd>These systems provide access to <strong>metadata</strong> or <i>information about data</i>.  Generally, these systems are used to identify, locate, and in some instances, browse, and order data and information resources of interest.  In general, there

 are two levels of "location metadata."  <strong>Directory-level metadata</strong> describes entire datasets or data resources at a very high level.  It tells a user about the existence and location of a dataset (i.e., what the content is, where it is archived, its temporal and spatial extent, and who to contact for more information.)  <strong>Inventory-level metadata</strong> describes individual products that are available from a particular dataset or data resource.
<p align=left>
<dt><a href="/guide.html">Guide Systems</a>
<dd>Guide information is also considered metadata, but unlike Directory-level or Inventory-level metadata, it's function is to help a user understand or exploit the dataset as opposed to identifying or locating it.  A dataset guide can be thought of as the "200 page User's Manual" that describes all aspects of the dataset in great detail.  The concept of a "dataset guide" has been expanded to include guides on satellites, sensors, programs, organizations, entire countries, and even issues or themes.  Many guides are developed using html-constructs so establishing appropriate hypertext links between them provides a powerful mechanism for building comprehensive documentation libraries.
<p align=left>
<dt><a href="datasys.html">Data and Information Access Systems</a>
<dd>These systems permit a user to access actual data and information resources directly on-line (as opposed to just the metadata about the resources.)
<p align=left>
<dt><a href="browse.html">Browsing, Visualization, and Integration Tools</a>
<dd>These systems allow a user to browse and/or manipulate the data and information resource in some value-added fashion. 
</dl> 
<p align=left>
Please note that the classification scheme is not perfect.  Many of the systems that GCRIO links to fit into more than one of the categories listed above.  Thus, some systems may appear in more than one list.

<h1>US Global Change Research Program</h1>
<p align=left>
Organized in 1989 and created by the Global Change Research Act of 1990, the <a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/">U.S. Global Change Research Program </a>(USGCRP), an integrated effort of various Agencies and Organizations of the Federal Government,  has been working to better understand  and to deal with natural and human-induced changes in the Earth's environment.  Changes in the global environment, including ozone depletion, climate change and greenhouse warming, natural  variations in the climate, and land use change have the potential for inducing signficant effects on human society  and the Earth's natural ecosystems. 
<p>
The USGCRP is dedicated to sponsoring research on these and other global 
change issues, to use this information to project future climate 
conditions, and to improve understanding of possible consequences of 
global climate change. More detailed information about the USGCRP can be found at the <a href="http://www.usgcrp.gov/">USGCRP Home Page</a>.  An overview of some important aspects of the USGCRP is presented below.

<h1>Global Change Data and Information System (GCDIS)</h1>
<p align=left>
The <a href="http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov/">Global Change Data and Information System</a> (GCDIS) is the set of individual agency data and information systems that support global change research supplemented by a minimal amount of crosscutting new infrastructure, and made interoperable by the use of standards, common approaches, technology sharing, and data policy coordination.  The GCDIS user community extends from global change researchers to other researchers, policy makers, educators, private industry, and private citizens.  Through the GCDIS, these users are able to learn about the existence and location of relevant data and information resources, have key holding available in useful forms, and be assured of their quality and continued availability.
<p>
The individual agency components of the GCDIS are funded through their respective budgets.  There will neither be a lead agency nor a separately funded budget for the GCDIS.  Interagency GCDIS implementation will be coordinated through the GCDIS Subgroup of the Data Management Working Group (DMWG) of  the Subcommittee of Global Change Research (SGCR). 
<p>
More detailed information about the GCDIS can be found at the <a href=http://www.gcdis.usgcrp.gov>GCDIS Home Page</a>.  An overview of some important aspects of the GCDIS is presented below.
