<H3><B>Chapter 7 :</B> <B>Disarmament treaties</B></H3>
<P>	<BR>
The reporting procedure on the implementation of disarmament treaties is called verification. One of the main goals of &quot;verification&quot; is confidence-building between old adversaries, most notably the USA and the former USSR.<BR>

<P>There is no general official and universally-accepted definition of verification. It includes the following components:<BR>

<P>(1)	the existence of an obligation, the fulfilment and observance of which must be verified;<BR>
(2)	the gathering of information relating to fulfilment of the obligation;<BR>
(3)	the analysis, interpretation and evaluation of the information from a technical, legal and political viewpoint;<BR>
(4)	assessment concerning observance or non-observance of the obligation, which concludes the actual verification exercise. While the consideration of appropriate reactions to possible violation of an obligation appears to be a logical consequence of this exercise, it is not in itself an integral part of verification.[34]<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>7.1 Organizations</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Two types of practices and proposals can be distinguished in the field of verification of arms control agreements. There are <U>organizations dedicated solely to verification</U>, and there are <U>international organizations</U> with a broader mandate that have received, or will receive a verification or monitoring function. There are only a few organizations, exclusively devoted to verification/monitoring.<BR>

<P>The idea of multilateral and international organizations dedicated to or operative in the field of the verification of arms control agreements is currently receiving renewed and heightened interest, under the impetus of the CFE, CSCE and CW negotiations, and of the Gulf War settlement.<BR>

<P>Various factors may explain this renewed interest in the role of international organizations:<BR>
-	increased importance is being attached to the verification of disarmament agreements;<BR>
-	the institution-building process is considered to have a high confidence-building potential;<BR>
-	economic considerations may motivate advocacy of involvement by international organizations;<BR>
-	the wish to deny access to certain types of weapons can also be considered a positive factor.[35]<BR>

<P>The involvement of international organizations is opposed, however, on the grounds of economic circumstances and the confidentiality of the data. Another major objection is related to the political and legal elements of the verification process: no State is eager to delegate decisions that involve compliance to a third party or to an international body. There is a fine line between fact-finding and the political qualification of facts in an international co-operative environment.[36]<BR>

<P>The UN Security Council may intervene in the verification process. The Council may carry out its own investigations and make its own assessments, as it did, for example, when chemical weapons were used in the conflict between Iraq and Iran.<BR>

<P>Issues relating to the Gulf War, and the disarmament measures adopted by the Security Council in Resolution 687 (1991), which involve international control, raise problems of a different kind, namely, the consequences and settlement of an international conflict, rather than the verification of certain treaties. The obligations verified are those resulting from the Resolution and not directly from the treaties to which it refers. Certain obligations, for example, those relating to the destruction of missiles, do not fall under the aegis of any specific treaty.[37]<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>7.2 Functions</B></H4>
<P>
<P>An international organization can provide technical services and assistance, or it can be a political mechanism for consultation. The former necessitates far greater investment and warrants a more integrated type of organization than does the latter. However, if the latter is really involved in evaluating data in compliance issues, it will sooner or later also require an independent information and data-assessment capability. <BR>

<P>Apart from the above, the organizations can have three functions: fact-finding (i.e., the collection and analysis of information and data); political and legal qualification of facts; and enforcement (i.e., responses, including possible sanctions).<BR>

<P>The initial provision of data is the responsibility of each State concerned, and usually involves an exchange of data. It may, however, involve some participation by international organizations.<BR>

<P>There are two types of fact-finding methods: <BR>

<P><B>Surveillance</B> is the systematic observation of some place or activity on a continuous or periodic basis; this may be divided into:<BR>

<P>-	intrusive methods, i.e., methods implying the presence of either a human agent or an instrument on a State's territory; and <BR>
-	non-intrusive methods, such as remote-sensing techniques, particularly observation by satellites or perusal of scientific material. <BR>

<P><B>Reconnaissance</B> is carried out in the form of missions or <I>ad hoc</I> activities, generally aimed at a specific objective which for some reason has attracted attention. <BR>

<P>Further distinction may be made between:<BR>
-	hard/objective methods, i.e., information collected by technical means such as satellites, on-site inspection, or documentary control, and <BR>
-	soft methods, i.e., information collected through political consultation mechanisms.[38]<BR>

<P>Extra information-gathering techniques are a procedure for monitoring the data, possibly with on-site inspection measures, carried out by the parties on the basis of an international instrument. These inspections can be carried out either at random, or in the event of questionable activities. In this context, an international organization may, on occasion, intervene in order to establish the facts, as in the case of investigations into the alleged use of chemical or biological weapons.<BR>

<P>The monitoring step is accompanied or followed by an information-processing step in which data recorded by the monitoring device are assembled into some appropriate form. <BR>

<P>The technical analysis of data collected usually remains the responsibility of each State party; it may be simplified by cooperation among the parties in an <I>ad hoc</I> or pre-established context, by international assistance, or by an autonomous international mechanism, although the latter continues to be an exception. <BR>

<P>The political and legal qualification of the data is, in principle, also the responsibility of each of the parties concerned; however, it may involve an international dimension, in particular through the machinery of advisory commissions among the parties, or through a genuine collective procedure.<BR>

<P>An assessment of the seriousness of a possible breach is made in the same way, although its nature is more directly political. What must be assessed are the implications of the breach for the security of the States concerned. Possible publication and dissemination of the data continue to be at the discretion of the parties concerned.<BR>

<P>A new method of verification is &quot;citizens' verification&quot;, which in principle resembles the individual complaints procedure under the UN Human Rights Conventions. There is a precedent in US national law, where it is a duty of employees in the defence industry to report companies that are defrauding the government. It would be necessary to provide a duty and protection under the treaty, as well as mechanisms for evaluating information. At the moment it is doubtful whether such a system would receive support from States involved in or contemplating disarmament.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>7.3 Treaties past and present</B></H4>
<P>
<P>There are currently 24 arms control agreements in force, or recently signed; of these, three provide for the establishment of <B>international organizations with the specific aim of verifying compliance</B> with the agreement: the Modified Brussels Treaty of 1954, establishing the Western European Union and the now defunct Arms Control Agency; the Treaty of Tlatelolco establishing OPANAL (Agency for Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America, 1976, known by its Spanish acronym); and the Guadalajara Agreement between Argentina and Brazil establishing the Argentine-Brazilian Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC).<BR>

<P>The bilateral (US-USSR) treaties, as well as the multilateral CFE Treaty, opted for a less institutionalized mechanism, namely, the <B>Consultative Commission</B>. The Antarctic Treaty, which should also be mentioned, establishes a <B>Meeting of Contracting Parties</B>.<BR>

<P>The vast majority of multilateral agreements, however, do not provide for the establishment of an international organization or mechanism dedicated to verification, though some of the agreements leave open the possibility for creation of such a mechanism, through a clause permitting resort to &quot;appropriate international procedures&quot;.<BR>

<P>There are also treaties, such as the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases and of bacteriological warfare, that have no verification system. <BR>

<P><B>7.3.1 Specialized institutions</B><BR>

<P>The Arms Control Agency (ACA) is now defunct, but some remarks can be made on its functioning. It has been, over the years, a relatively independent and autonomous body, even with regard to the Council of the Western European Union, to which the Agency was directly answerable. <BR>

<P>The Agency was always relatively small: in 1971, for instances, it had a staff of 52, including 21 of officer grade, and an annual budget of 3,900,000 BFrs.<BR>

<P>The most interesting aspect of the WEU verification scheme lies in the fact that an integrated, international body carried out the verification. Most noteworthy in this respect are its experiences in the fields of data exchange and of random inspections.<BR>

<P>Since 1984, when Member States decided to reactivate the WEU and to abolish all conventional controls by 1986, the status of the ACA has become unclear. A Director was supposed to be appointed in 1988, but never was. Apparently the Council annual reports no longer include Agency activities, and the Agency has <I>de facto</I> ceased to exist.<BR>

<P>Compared with ACA, the OPANAL is far more institutionalized and autonomous (integrated). The fact-finding methods at its disposal to verify compliance include:<BR>

<P>-	semi-annual reports by the parties incorporating statements that &quot;no activity prohibited under the Treaty has occurred&quot;;<BR>
-	special reports by the parties which may be requested by the General Secretary with the authorization of the Council;<BR>
-	special reports or studies by the General Conference, the Council or the General Secretary;<BR>
-	special inspections carried out by the Council;	<BR>
-	routine inspections carried out under a safeguards agreement negotiated by each party with the IAEA.<BR>

<P>The legal and political evaluation of facts is left to the General Conference. OPANAL has a very small international staff and an annual budget of $ 316,251. Little is published on the workings of OPANAL, and the proceedings of its General Conference are not widely disseminated. The comprehensiveness - both in terms of functions assigned to it and in terms of procedures and methods it is capable of invoking - as well as the international nature of the organization stand somewhat in contrast to its known activities. The fact that it has not yet had to implement any special procedures, such as inspections or requests for special reports, seems to be a positive sign. Nonetheless, it should not be forgotten that for the major countries of the region the Treaty has not yet entered into force. As in the case of the ACA, political reasons preclude OPANAL's fully exercising its theoretically far-reaching powers.<BR>

<P>The ABACC has in principle the same form and objective as the OPANAL, but covers only Argentine and Brazil. It is thought that ABACC will eventually become a part of OPANAL.<BR>

<P><B>7.3.2 Other possibilities</B><BR>
There is the Conflict Prevention Centre (CPC), which was established by the Charter of Paris for a New Europe, signed in November 1990. The Centre assists the equally newly-created Council of CSCE Ministers in reducing the risk of conflict and gives support to implementation of the CSBMs, as stipulated in the Vienna Document 1990.<BR>

<P><B>Consultative Commissions</B>, as set up for example as a Joint Consultative Group (JCG) for the multilateral CFE Treaty, are another possibility for verification of compliance with a treaty. In theory, the Commissions have no authority whatsoever with respect to the political and legal evaluation of compliance. Formally, they do not make any decisions in this field. Nevertheless, with the antagonism between the US and the USSR retreating into the background, compliance issues lose their explosive political character, and assessment hence becomes more dependent on objective and technical factors.<BR>

<P>In 1990 the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) was adopted, limiting military personnel. Extensive inspections are foreseen in this treaty as a confidence-building measure between former adversaries and as an opportunity to share sophisticated technologies vi East-West cooperative inspection teams.[39] The States agreed that manpower, weapon systems, weapons and production facilities would be monitored.<BR>

<P>CFE is a multilateral treaty, but it proceeds from East-West logic and thus has naturally followed the bilateral practice in establishing the JCG. The Group, like the other Commissions, has no fact-finding functions nor does it make any judgements concerning compliance; it is a deliberative body. It provides a forum in which parties may meet, discuss questions arising after data collection and analysis, and through which they may clear up ambiguities. Decisions or recommendations are made by consensus, and deliberations are private.<BR>

<P>The <B>Meeting of Contracting Parties</B> was established by Article IX of the Antarctic Treaty and has been operative since 1961. It is composed of the original signatories and of those States that have acceded to the Treaty and that demonstrate their interest in Antarctica, by conducting substantial scientific research activity in the region, such as the establishment of a scientific station or the dispatch of a scientific expedition.<BR>

<P>Only members of the Meeting are entitled to verify compliance with the Treaty. Verification (i.e., aerial observation and on-site inspections) may be carried out unilaterally or jointly, and possibly also through the Meeting, which is,<I> inter alia</I>, responsible for recommending measures regarding &quot;the facilitation of the exercise of rights of inspection provided for in Article VII of the Treaty&quot;. The meeting convenes at regular intervals and is also the place where consultations take place and where data are exchanged.<BR>

<P>The verification mechanism installed by the Antarctic Treaty (i.e., the Meeting of Contracting Parties) is of a highly discriminatory character and runs counter to the principle that all States have equal rights to participate in verification of the agreement to which they are parties.<BR>

<P>Existing international organizations may also involve themselves with the verification of arms-control obligations, as provided for in the different existing agreements, or deriving from their more general mandates in the field of international peace and security. Examples are the United Nations, or regional organizations such as the Organization of American States (OAS), the Organization of African Unity (OAU), and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), or organizations which have a specific technical or legal mandate, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), whose authority is usually confined to technical assistance or fact-finding missions. Organizations in the first category may also derive their authority to intervene from their statutes. <BR>

<P>Numerous proposals exist to establish organizations dedicated to non-treaty-specific verification or monitoring. Since they are not<I> </I>related to any specific agreement, they can exercise monitoring functions only by gathering data. No such body has yet been established or is likely to be set up in the near future.[40]<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>7.4 Treaties - proposals</B></H4>
<P>
<P>There is the <U>Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)</U>, regarded as the cornerstone of efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. It is not global and is not aimed at disarmament but at preventing proliferation.<BR>

<P>As its basic system of reporting, NPT requires States to set up a <B>national</B> verification system, which reports to a <B>central documentation centre</B>, that sends monthly reports to the International Atomic Energy Agency<BR>
(<B>international level</B>). The data are stored in the Safeguards Information System (ISIS), a computerized data bank.<BR>

<P>This system is enhanced by containment and surveillance measures, which are usually technical and concentrated on specific nuclear specific issues, for example, surveillance cameras at nuclear installations, and satellites.[41]<BR>

<P>The<U> Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)</U> is a historic multilateral agreement, banning all chemical weapons worldwide, imposing a wide spectrum of inspections to verify the ban, outlawing any use of these weapons and imposing a strict ban on all activities to develop new chemical weapons. The CW Organization has been assigned only fact-finding tasks.<BR>

<P>The verification system envisaged for the CWC faces two main challenges not previously encountered on such a large scale and with so many variables. First, there is verification of the measures to meet non-production requirement (e.g., closure of production facilities, destruction and conversion activities) and, second, there are measures to ensure that there is no violation as a result of non-prohibited activities.<BR>

<P>The international verification organization will be made up of three bodies: a conference of States parties, an executive council and a technical secretariat, supported by an international inspectorate and with national provision of information as the basis for verification activities.<BR>

<P>The possibility of requesting challenge inspection, applicable to all activities regulated by the CWC, gives the system an element of deterrence and will also increase confidence in the CWC.<BR>

<P>The implementation of the Convention at national and international level will require lines of communication between the various components of the verification organization and the national authority of each state party; such a communications system will probably be multi-purpose.<BR>

<P>In general, CWC verification focuses specifically on the civilian chemical industry and the particular destruction undertaking; however, limited use of some applied technologies and verification tools will also be relevant for conventional arms-control verification.[42]<BR>

<P>Estimates have been made of the human resources and finances required. The Organization would probably need a total of 603 inspectors (340 would supervise destruction operations and 138 would carry out challenge inspections) and a support staff of 400, making a total of 1,000. Total costs would be around $160 million.<BR>

<P>The <U>Open Skies Treaty</U>, negotiated from 1989 onward, would allow flights by unarmed reconnaissance aircraft over the territories of states. Potentially, the treaty improves openness and transparency, facilitates the monitoring of compliance with existing or future arms-control agreements and strengthens the capacity for conflict prevention and crisis management within the framework of the CSCE. It is a possible method of verification.<BR>

<P>The <U>United Nations Register of Conventional Arms</U>, if complied with universally, could develop into a far-reaching international control mechanism which could create unprecedented transparency, both in the international trade in arms and in the national production of arms. It is a framework for dialogue in a specific area of military activity and a basis for future verifiable limitations and reductions.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>7.5 Conclusion</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Verification procedures are included in disarmament treaties for the very reason that they should not be included in other treaties, since they make the system inflexible. States do not want disarmament verification systems to change.<BR>

<P>Procedures for verification of disarmament are treaty-specific. They are extremely expensive when equipped with an institution for verification, and not very effective without one. Moreover verification works only when the scope of the treaty is limited in time and objectives. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency are only atttainable when there is a limited group of like-minded and similarly resourced States, as, for example, in Western Europe. In universal or multilateral contexts, where the discrepancies in means, both technical and financial, are great, costs are often considered prohibitive. Indeed, those States with the strongest financial and technical resources end up paying for a collective effort, with no notable or concrete returns. The proposal for a UN-operated International Monitoring Agency is an example of this kind.<BR>

<P>The low level of institutionalization for multilateral treaties is therefore not surprising. Indeed, the ACA and to a greater extent OPANAL and the future CW organization appear to be real exceptions. Furthermore, even if institutionalized, their functions and the methods at their disposal remain limited to fact-finding. On-site challenge inspections remain the solution to everything  both in the CWC framework as in the CFE context. The legal/political evaluation of facts, let alone responses, has not yet been considered in negotiations despite increasing recognition of its importance. Nonetheless, States are increasingly recognizing the importance of international consultation on compliance and feel the need to institutionalize this process.<BR>

<H3><B>Chapter 8 : Environment treaties</B></H3>
<P>	<BR>
Supervision on the implementation of international environmental regulations can be delegated to a specific State, to each State party[43] or to a special international body.[44]<BR>

<P>An example of delegation of supervision to a specific state is when a ship voluntarily enters a port or off-shore installation the coastal state can investigate.[45]<BR>

<P>Most environmental treaties require States to submit periodic reports on the implementing measures that they have taken. The extent of this obligation varies, but it usually covers at least the measures taken by parties towards <B>implementing their obligations</B>.[46] Information must also usually be provided to enable assessment of <B>how effectively the treaty is operating</B>. The 1974 Paris Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Land-based Sources, for example, calls on the parties to report on levels of marine pollution and on the effectiveness of measures adopted to reduce it. The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes requires an annual report on all aspects of transboundary trade and disposal of such substances, and on such matters as the conference of the Parties shall deem relevant.[47] Similarly, Article 8 of the 1973 Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) requires the parties to maintain records of trade in listed species and to report on the number and type of permits granted. This information must be made available to the public. In some cases, reporting requirements are designed to <B>monitor how well the parties are enforcing a treaty</B>. Thus, the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the 1991 Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection oblige the parties to submit reports by national inspectors concerning infractions, while the 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships (MARPOL) calls for reports from national authorities on action taken to deal with reported violations and on incidents involving harmful substances.<BR>

<P>Among international supervisory bodies is the Organization of African Unity, responsible for the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources. The CITES requires States to file reports annually to its Secretariat, like the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone Layer, which also has its own Secretariat.[48]<BR>

<P>The information gathered is meant to enable the parties to review and evaluate the impact of a treaty. When the information must be made public, NGOs and other interested groups are also able to monitor progress. The obvious weakness is that much will depend on the diligence and accuracy of the reporting authorities. Therefore use is also made of fact-finding methods, research and inspection.[49]<BR>
	<a name=9>	<BR>

<H3><B>Chapter 9 : Overview, characteristics and a possible system for international humanitarian law</B></H3>
<P>	<BR>
This chapter is divided in three parts. The first part discusses the concept of a reporting system: what it is, how it functions, its effectiveness, and what it requires in terms of human and financial resources within the framework of international organizations other than the ICRC. <BR>

<P>The second part evaluates the characteristics that influence the success or failure of a reporting system. The third part puts forward a possible reporting system, on national measures of implementation of international humanitarian law which already have to be taken in peacetime.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>9.1 The concept of a reporting system</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Unfortunately, humanitarian agreements tend to be utilized as tools of domestic political rhetoric, allowing States to &quot;reap the public image benefits of signature without bearing the cost of implementation&quot;. Even if an intention to comply is present at the time of signature, this is not of itself sufficient to guarantee effective implementation. First, officials or agencies that negotiate agreements are not always those authorized to ratify or otherwise implement them.[50]  Second, the accepting government may fall from power and its successor may be unwilling or unable to honour its commitments. Third, a government's administrative capacity may be insufficient to permit discharge of its obligations.[51]  One of the goals of a reporting system would be to overcome this problem and end, or at least limit, non-implementation.<BR>

<P>A reporting system is part of an implementation system. It supplies information from each State on the operation and implementation of a treaty by that State, it monitors at national level. One way of supplying information is by a self-evaluating report. Self-evaluating reports are assessments of a State's performance by that State, not by other States or by independent agents, such as special rapporteurs or non-governmental organizations, through these may later play a role in verifying the data received.<BR>

<P>The information thus obtained may be submitted to an international institution having a supervisory role. <BR>

<P>The <B>key tasks of an international supervisory institution</B> are those of gathering information and data by receiving, for example, self-evaluating State reports, of facilitating independent monitoring and inspection, and acting as a forum for reviewing the performance of States or the negotiation of further measures and regulations. Such institutions may thus acquire semi-official law-enforcement and law-making functions. Law-enforcement consists in requiring States to be accountable to other Member States, i.e., imposing a form of collective or communal supervision. To the extent that supervisory bodies are open to participation by other interested parties or NGOs with observer status, this accountability may extend to a wider public.<BR>

<P>Supervision of this kind also entails the negotiation and drafting of detailed rules, standards or practices, usually as a means of giving effect to the more general provisions of treaties. Not only does this form of law-making or international regulation facilitate treaty implementation, it also gives treaties a dynamic character and enables the parties to respond to new problems or priorities.<BR>

<P>Thus, the combination of regulatory and supervisory functions in the hands of international institutions is of importance in making international agreements operate more effectively. The absence of any provision for institutional supervision or regulation is, by contrast, often a sign that the treaty in question is bound to remain ineffective.<BR>

<P>Proper supervision of the operation and implementation of treaty regimes depends on adequate information, much of it supplied by self-evaluating State reports. But international institutions are not confined to a passive role as recipients of information: in many cases they are competent to conduct fact-finding or research. The most assertive method of information-gathering and supervision allows international institutions to undertake inspections (in-country or on-site) to verify compliance with international agreements and standards.[52] Some systems have a follow-up procedure, e.g., technical assistance, field missions or field representatives, or there are subsidiary procedures to correlate the information received, for example, inter-state and/or individual complaints procedures, enquiry procedures, also reports from various sources and on-site missions.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>9.2 Evaluation</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The thorough study of various reporting systems highlights certain factors that influence the success of a system. One factor alone is usually not decisive, but combinations of factors can determine the effectiveness of a system. On the basis of these factors, an outline of a possible reporting system on national measures of implementation of international humanitarian law is put forward.<BR>

<P><B>9.2.1 Influencing factors</B><BR>

<P><B><I>The sensitivity of the subject</I></B><BR>

<P>The more sensitive an issue, the less likely States are to report on it. For example, torture and racial discrimination are sensitive issues: no State likes to admit that these occur on its territory. Disarmament and humanitarian subjects are sensitive because they are linked to the national security of a State, always a sensitive issue. Cultural identity used not to be sensitive, but in recent years States and peoples react violently on this subject. Children are an example of an issue that is  not sensitive. Every State is eager to report on all it does to help  children.<BR>

<P><B><I>The economic value of the subject</I></B><BR>

<P>A subject that may increase prosperity is a positive incentive for reporting. Good examples are the OECD and the WIPO, where States may benefit economically when they share information or adhere to a Convention.<BR>

<P><B><I>The specificity of the subject</I></B><BR>

<P>This aspect is closely linked to the national level on which the reports are produced. The more specific the reporting requirements are the more likely it is that meaningful reports will be produced. For example the ILO, OECD, UNESCO, Disarmament and Environment Conventions deal with very specific issues, but the topics of the CRC, HRC, CESCR and WIPO tend to be more general in scope. When a Convention is broad and general, difficulties in reporting can be reduced by restricting the reporting obligation to very specific subjects, with very specific guidelines.<BR>

<P><B><I>The popularity of the subject in the media</I></B><BR>

<P>Media coverage is usually a positive incentive, but linked with a sensitive subject it can become a deterrent to reporting by States.<BR>

<P><B><I>Secretarial support</I></B><BR>

<P>This factor is crucial for the functioning of a reporting system. Without a well-staffed secretariat a reporting system is inoperable, since not only the organization of the reporting system, but also its quality and effectiveness, depend on the secretariat. It could be argued that the role of a secretariat is more crucial than that of a supervisory body.<BR>

<P>The importance of adequate secretarial support is underlined by the following: the chairpersons of the human-rights treaty bodies have noted that there is a &quot;close link between adequate secretariat resources and the effective functioning of the treaty body system&quot;.[53]<BR>

<P><B><I>The flexibility of the reporting procedure</I></B><BR>

<P>Reporting systems usually function for decades. As situations and concepts change, the system should be, to a certain extent, adaptable to these changes to avoid becoming obsolete. Therefore it is better to leave the procedural aspects of a system out of a Convention as much as possible, in order to keep the procedure flexible, adaptable and up to date.<BR>

<P><B><I>A permanent body to which to report</I></B><BR>

<P>The Convention on the Elimination of the Crime of Apartheid is a good example why an <I>ad hoc</I> body does not work. During one of the most important eras in its history, the elections in South Africa, it was not possible to convene the body because it had no members. Accordingly, the establishment of a supervisory body with a permanent character is recommended to ensure continuity.<BR>

<P><B><I>The quality and efficient functioning of a supervisory body</I></B><BR>

<P>States are much more keen to report to a body composed of important people, since this lends weight to the body's conclusions concerning a State. High-ranking people also have personal contacts that may persuade a State to submit a report. The Human Rights Committee is a good example: it is considered as a body of high standing that develops human-rights law, and States are willing to report to it.<BR>

<P>The degree of institutionalization of an international organization depends largely on the existence and/or diversity of its inter-state and/or integrated bodies, which are distinguished by their composition. An inter-state body is composed of representatives of Member States, while an integrated body is made up of independent experts having no obedience to a particular Member State.[54]<BR>

<P>Experts should be good, discreet, professional and well informed, and their judgements should be consistent. For them to be well informed, they must have access to information from a variety of sources or be able to initiate information. This heightens the standing of the body and makes States take their obligations more seriously. When bodies take contradictory decisions or appear to be prejudiced, it has an adverse effect on the submission of reports. Political tendencies should be at all times avoided, since they act to the detriment of the system.<BR>

<P><B><I>Follow-up</I></B><BR>

<P>The existence of any form of follow-up, either to the state report or to the conclusions from the supervisory body, is a major factor in the effective functioning of the reporting system. <BR>

<P>The reaction to a state report can be a report, an opinion or a judgement. These may be public or confidential. The strength of the conclusion can benefit a State, which will have clear guidelines, and it can be used by others to facilitate follow-up. <BR>

<P>It is best if the reporting system is combined with other systems of preventive monitoring and ideally also with a system providing a means of reacting to violations at international level. Examples of preventive monitoring are the initiation of inquiries or requests to a body or a person to investigate a situation or a country. Examples of systems that react to violations are individual or inter-state[55] complaints procedures, and investigations by a body or a person, e.g., a fact-finding commission. These systems may be either confidential or public. If the latter, the resulting publicity may constitute additional follow-up.<BR>

<P>The availability of technical assistance programmes is also a positive incentive for a State to submit a report, especially to States that are not otherwise able to produce a report or have difficulties with regard to the implementation of a convention.<BR>

<P><B><I>Admission to an international instrument</I></B><BR>

<P>The OECD, the WIPO and the Council of Europe use the mechanism of admission, and so far it appears very effective. States are forced to act on the recommendations of the body if they wish to reach a member status.<BR>

<P><B><I>The existence of a national monitoring body</I></B><BR>

<P>At national level there is one crucial factor underlying all the problems of the reporting systems. This is the existence or absence of a national reporting/monitoring structure. This topic will be further discussed in section 9.3.2.<BR>

<P>Certain factors, such as the sensitivity and the economic value of a subject, cannot be influenced. On the other hand,<B> the secretarial support, the specificity of the reports demanded,</B> and <B>the follow-up</B> can be influenced and are crucial for the success of a reporting system. These aspects should therefore receive most attention when considering a new reporting system.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>9.3	Possible focused reporting system on national measures of implementation of international humanitarian law</B></H4>
<P>
<P>In its &quot;Final Declaration&quot; adopted 1 September 1993, the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims (Geneva, 30 August to 1 September 1993) referred to an intergovernmental group of experts to be convened by the Swiss Government, with the task of studying, <I>inter alia</I>, <B>&quot;practical means of promoting full respect for and compliance with [international humanitarian law], and to prepare a report for submission to the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent&quot;.</B><BR>

<P>The Meeting's main topic - respect for international humanitarian law (IHL) - may be divided into <B>three aspects</B>: <BR>

<P>(1)	<B>universal applicability</B> of the pertinent international instruments; <BR>
(2)	<B>prevention</B> of violations of IHL; and <BR>
(3)	<B>observation</B> of IHL and <B>repression</B> of violations. <BR>

<P><B>9.3.1 At the international level</B><BR>

<P>In a reporting system for the ICRC, States should be required to report on:<BR>
(<I>a</I>)	implementation<BR>
-	of national measures for the repression/punishment of violations,<BR>
-	of an internal monitoring system on the observation of IHL by armed forces,<BR>
-	of a national interministerial committee,<BR>
-	of cooperation between States for<BR>
-	regional seminars organized by the ICRC, and<BR>
-	communication of data to a central body (ICRC);<BR>

<P>(<I>b</I>)	dissemination<BR>
-	education of armed forces,<BR>
-	coordination of efforts to spread the knowledge of IHL (e.g., in schools) by, for example, the Ministry of Education.<BR>

<P>The information required must be very specific, for example, translations of the Conventions, national laws, then military manuals and, later, updating of national laws. The reports are thus very specific and constitute a focused reporting system, to ensure effectiveness. It has become apparent that a widespread general approach is much less effective than small-scale intensive approaches. This point will be discussed in more detail below. <BR>

<P>A feature of the system could be a reporting cycle of four years, to coincide with that of the International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. The ICRC would then submit a report to each International Conference on the results of the most recent reporting cycle. <BR>

<P>A secretariat is essential for requesting reports, organizing the meetings and distributing the papers, but also for carrying out research into reporting States (e.g., finding earlier reports by these States for other bodies such as the UN, UNESCO, ILO, etc.) and making specific inquiries. It must also be possible for the secretariat to assist States in producing reports. The staff of the secretariat will have to include specialists[56] on humanitarian law, on reporting/monitoring/technical assistance and on advisory services. In existing reporting systems, the expertise within the secretariat is such as to justify reports being submitted, not to a supervisory body, but only to the secretariat. Such a procedure would eliminate the judgemental factor almost completely, and the main focus would be on cooperation between the secretariat and the State - an ideal situation for the ICRC, since any hint of criticism of a State can imperil operations in the field and may even endanger the lives of personnel.<BR>

<P>The incorporation of such a secretariat within the ICRC would be relatively simple. The secretariat could continue the work already performed by the ICRC, but in a more detailed and specialized way.<BR>

<P>Reporting countries could be divided into categories, possibly according to the existing ICRC practice of zoning, whereby a small department of 3 professionals deals with the reports from a single zone. This practice permits specialization on a zone, and lawyers can team up with operational staff to exchange information to their mutual benefit. For example, if there are 186 reporting States, then the six ICRC operational zones would each include 31 States, i.e., 8 States per year would send reports.<BR>

<P>An international supervisory body could be established. It should consist of outstanding scholars, members of the armed forces, diplomats and possibly social workers or field delegates/development experts, to get the broadest representation of specializations and interests. The experts could be independent or state representatives. With state representatives, the system is less costly; and another advantage might be that States would feel less attacked by observations coming from state representatives rather than from independent experts. The body itself must be free to decide whether its conclusions will be published or not. It should meet once or twice a year, depending on the volume of reports received. Intervals between meetings should be flexible, and for the body itself to decide. <BR>

<P>The creation of a supervisory body has some advantages. One of the weakest points of a reporting system is that States cannot be forced to submit a report. Several psychologically important factors can offset this weakness: States may be pressured into submitting a report by media attention, by a prestigious body, or by intensive follow-up of a report or the request for a report. These factors all influence each other, but the first two points, media attention and the prestige of a body, are closely linked. When there is no supervisory body, the follow-up and the attention of secretariat staff to States must be intensified.<BR>

<P>A documentation centre,[57] where crucial documents can be stored and are accessible to the secretariat, and computerized retrieval,[58] are essential to the proper functioning of the system.<BR>

<P>The review of reports could result in advice on IHL, technical assistance or other positive incentives being offered to States. The body would be able to advise on accession to international fact-finding commission/inquiry procedure and thereby help that procedure to become more effective.<BR>

<P>The reporting system does not have to function indefinitely: reassessment after two to three four years cycles will show whether it meets expectations. That way the system is kept flexible.<BR>

<P><B>9.3.2 At the national level</B><BR>

<P>The fundamental problem of a reporting system is not at international level, but at national level. The crucial nature of this factor cannot be fully appreciated unless the nature of a reporting system is completely understood. <BR>
A reporting system is a mechanism whereby States assess the level of implementation of international treaties in, for example, their own national legislation. The reports are not primarily a method of control/verification, but a means of verifying the functioning of state systems of accountability and control, ensuring by independent measurements and inspections that the state is meeting its obligations.<BR>

<P>It is vital for a reporting system at international level to be supplied with reports produced at national level. But in order to produce such reports, a State must possess a reporting system at national level, provided with data by specialists within the country who know about national legislation and legal practice, government policy, the armed forces and national security. Unless all this knowledge is used for preparation of an international report, the report is unlikely be satisfactory. <BR>

<P>Another aspect is more directly linked to the effectiveness of prevention. The best deterrent to violators is effective prosecution,[59] which requires an effective legal mechanism. The absence or the shortcomings of a legal system can be noted in reports on such matters. These reports, followed up by a technical assistance programme, could go a long way towards making prevention more effective.<BR>

<P>There is always the risk that recommendations made by the international supervisory body are not followed up at national level, because no national entity has been mandated to implement the recommendations. The failure by States to follow up the general comments and concluding observations of the experts of international organizations is the reason why most reporting systems are not more effective. <BR>

<P>This problem has been recognized by a number of international organizations. For example, the ILO uses the employers' and workers' associations at national level to check government reports and to supply commentaries. Thus there is a means of determining whether the recommendations of the international body are put into practice. An advantage of this system is that the non-government party or parties know(s) the situation within the country. For the ICRC, the National Societies of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent may fulfil this role by urging States to submit reports, by monitoring their contents and by verifying implementation of the Conventions.<BR>

<P>A similar system is developing for the human rights treaties, with specialized NGOs taking over several tasks of the secretariat, supplying extra information on the government reports and using the concluding observations to pressure governments to follow up the recommendations. <BR>

<P>The offer of technical assistance can be an important incentive to the reporting States. The aim of assistance should be to set up within the government a system, staffed by local personnel from different backgrounds, to prepare national reports describing the situation in their country.<BR>

<P>ICRC delegates in the field would be able to support the National Societies through bilateral steps with governments or by explaining the reporting system.<BR>
<a name=10><BR>

<H3><B>Conclusion</B></H3>
<P>
<P>A reporting system is essential if any progress is to be made in the implementation of international humanitarian law and in preventing violations. <BR>

<P>The system can be operated by an independent body of distinguished experts from widely different backgrounds. It must be supported by an adequate secretariat that can develop initiatives when it deems it to be necessary.<BR>

<P>At national level, there should be a system for monitoring the situation within a State and for preparing reports to national and international bodies.<BR>

<P>A reporting procedure alone however is not sufficient. The Secretariat should be enabled to help a State to derive the fullest benefit from the Conventions it has signed. Technical assistance should be given to those States that ask for it, or that are considered to be in need of assistance by the international body. In addition, the Secretariat should be capable of assessing needs and carrying out missions in the field in order to help States. The National Societies should be integrated into the system of monitoring implementation at national level.<BR>

<P>In brief an effective reporting system should be supervised by an independent international body, but it is possible to operate it with a technical secretariat. Incentives to comply with reporting obligations should be provided by assistance programmes at international level, and by encouraging States to set up national monitoring machinery. Adequate human and financial resources are essential to the effectiveness of a reporting system.<BR>

<H3><B>Meeting of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 23-27 January 1995 </B></H3>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Introductory remarks</B></H4>
<P>
<P><I>In its final declaration, the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims (30 August to 1 September 1993) called upon the Swiss government to convene an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts to study practical means of promoting full respect for and compliance with international humanitarian law (IHL), and to prepare a report for submission to the States and to the next session of the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.</I><BR>

<P><I>Having accepted that mandate, the Swiss Federal Council has scheduled the meeting of experts (the &quot;Experts&quot;) for 23 to 27 January 1995.</I><BR>

<P><I>After requesting all States that had been invited to the War Victims Conference to provide contributions on issues which, in their opinion, should be dealt with by the Experts as a matter of priority, the Swiss government convened a preparatory meeting (&quot;Preparatory Meeting&quot;) of 60 States in order to prepare a working document for the Experts. The meeting took place from 26 to 28 September 1994.</I><BR>

<P><I>The Preparatory Meeting submitted </I><B><I>nine recommendations </I></B><I>to the Experts, defining, in general terms, possible measures to promote compliance with IHL and proposing that the Experts explore ways in which those broad measures might be translated into specific and practical means (according to one recommendation the ICRC would be called upon to analyse certain additional measures which could </I>i.a.<I> ensure universal respect for IHL). Those recommendations were sent in November 1994 to all States and other entities invited to the meeting of Experts.</I><BR>

<P><I>In an effort to facilitate the Experts' work, the Swiss authorities, which are organizing the meeting, have drawn up </I>i.a., <I>and on the basis of contributions from governments, the present working paper which contains a number of suggestions on how the measures to promote compliance with IHL set forth in the above recommendations may be translated into more concrete means. It is understood, however, that this paper does not restrict the Experts' freedom to devise practical means as they themselves see fit.</I><BR>

<H4><B>I. Ways and means to facilitate accession to IHL instruments</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[1]<BR>

<P>Universal applicability of IHL instruments is a precondition for proper implementation of their provisions. Indeed, the fact that belligerents may not all be bound by the same IHL instruments may lead to confusion and a degradation of humanitarian standards.<BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>Explore ways and means of facilitating States' accession to IHL instruments, notably the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols, the 1980 Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons and its three Protocols, and the 1954 Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, taking into consideration the services that, in particular, the ICRC, the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation and the National Committees referred to below may be able to provide in that regard;</I><BR>

<P><I>Consider, in this context, ways and means of facilitating States' recognition of the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission according to Article 90 of Additional Protocol I.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that<BR>

<P>- the States party to IHL instruments promote accession thereto in their bilateral and multilateral contacts with non-contracting States;<BR>
- the depositaries of IHL instruments appeal to each non-contracting State to accede to the respective instruments, and publish periodically, e.g. in the <I>International Review of the Red Cross</I>, the state of accessions;<BR>
- the UN and other intergovernmental and regional organizations regularly include appeals to accede to specific IHL instruments in their agendas;<BR>
- the States that have recognized the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission promote recognition thereof in their bilateral dealings, particularly with High Contracting Parties to Additional Protocol I that have not made the declaration under its Article 90, and make voluntary contributions as provided for in paragraph 7 of said provision, in order to facilitate promoting the recognition of the Commission's competence;<BR>
- national committees referred to under heading V below support their governments in the process of acceding to pertinent IHL instruments.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>II. Ways and means of clarifying the role of customary rules of IHL</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[2]<BR>

<P>The vast majority of today's armed conflicts are non-international. With regard to those conflicts in particular, there is a widely-held view that the applicable rules and the state of accessions to the few existing international instruments in the relevant area of international law are inadequate. In addition, there appears to be a considerable measure of uncertainty as to the scope and the role of customary rules governing both non-international and international armed conflicts.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>

<P><I>&quot;Examine ways and means of clarifying the role of customary rules of IHL in the areas of international and non-international armed conflicts.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that<BR>

<P>- States contribute to the clarification of customary rules of IHL by drawing up, for their armed forces, IHL manuals governing without distinction non-international and international armed conflicts;<BR>
- international bodies having the requisite expertise in IHL, such as the ICRC and scientific and academic institutions, e.g. the &quot;Institut f&uuml;r Friedenssicherungsrecht und humanit&auml;res V&ouml;lkerrecht der Ruhr-Universit&auml;t Bochum&quot; or the &quot;International Institute of Humanitarian Law&quot; in San Remo, prepare a study clarifying the role of customary rules of IHL in the areas of international and non-international armed conflicts and submit the study to all States, with the assistance of the depositary of the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols (the &quot;Depositary&quot;), and to the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent;<BR>
- States support efforts to obtain an internationally recognized status for the Declaration of Minimum Humanitarian Standards adopted by a group of experts in Turku in December 1990.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>III.	Ways and means of providing advisory services to States in their efforts to implement IHL and disseminate its rules and principles</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[3]<BR>
To be effective, IHL must be implemented at the national level, and its rules and principles must be disseminated within the armed forces as well as the population at large. Many States party to IHL instruments find it difficult, however, to take implementation measures and to disseminate IHL in practice, whether for lack of trained personnel or for linguistic, financial or other reasons.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>

<P><I>&quot;Study ways and means whereby bodies dealing with IHL, such as the ICRC, the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation, may, possibly with the assistance of academic institutions, provide advisory services to States in their efforts to implement IHL and disseminate its rules and principles.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that<BR>

<P>- the ICRC, with the assistance of the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation, and of scientific, academic and other institutions, strengthen the advisory services it provides to States in their efforts to implement and disseminate IHL, on the basis, <I>i.a.</I>, of reports by the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, pursuant to heading VI below;<BR>
- the States indicate to the ICRC the specific needs they may have for such advisory services;<BR>
- the ICRC submit periodic reports on its advisory services to the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>IV. Ways and means of improving dissemination of IHL</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[4]<BR>

<P>Proper application of IHL presupposes that those who are expected to apply it are thoroughly familiar with its principles and rules. Yet, as with increasing frequency in today's armed conflicts people who take up arms do not belong to regular armed forces, it is of utmost importance that dissemination of IHL reach not only national armed forces, but the population as a whole. Teaching programmes for these two target groups in fact already appear to exist in a number of States. Much could be gained from international cooperation in this field.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>
<I>&quot;Examine ways and means of improving dissemination of IHL, putting particular emphasis on the education of students of all ages and increasing media awareness, as well as on the training of armed forces, and the preparation of handbooks on the law of armed conflicts in an effort to harmonize, to the extent possible, the manner in which IHL is disseminated and implemented in different States.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that<BR>

<P>- the ICRC and the UN, including its organs and specialized agencies, such as UNESCO, coordinate their efforts to disseminate IHL;<BR>
- the States increase their efforts to educate and train the members of their armed forces and security forces, according to their specific ranks and functions, in the law of armed conflicts;<BR>
- the States draw up IHL handbooks which must be used by their armed forces as an integral part of military training;<BR>
- the ICRC prepare, in cooperation with experts from different regions of the world, a model handbook on IHL for armed forces and submit a draft thereof to the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent;<BR>
- the States increase their efforts to educate, where appropriate with the assistance of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the civilian population in the law of armed conflicts;<BR>
- academic and other institutions involved in educating the public devise specific programmes and teaching materials designed to imbue students of all ages with the principles of IHL and make those programmes available to interested States;<BR>
- governments, international organizations and other bodies dealing with IHL organize seminars with representatives of the national and international media in order to increase their awareness of IHL.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>V. Ways and means whereby the creation of national committees may foster implementation and dissemination of IHL</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[5]<BR>

<P>Coordination of measures to implement and disseminate IHL is crucial not only at the international level but at the national level as well. While it appears that in many countries different government authorities are dealing with different aspects of IHL and are largely unaware of each other's endeavours, some governments have created committees of varied composition in order to coordinate national measures in the area of IHL.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>Explore ways and means whereby governments may benefit from the creation of national committees to advise on and assist in national implementation and dissemination measures.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that<BR>

<P>- States that have created national committees to advise governments on national implementation and dissemination measures share the benefit of their experience with States interested in the establishment of such committees;<BR>
- national committees already in existence cooperate with the body providing advisory services (see point III.3 above) to governments in their efforts to implement and disseminate IHL;<BR>
- an international body, such as the ICRC or a scientific or academic institution, organize a meeting of governmental experts from States having already instituted national committees and make a report of the meeting's conclusions available to other States interested in the creation of such committees.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>VI. Ways and means whereby States could report to an international body dealing with IHL on their efforts to implement and disseminate IHL</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[6]<BR>

<P>An exchange of information among States on national measures of implementation and dissemination is desirable, as it allows States with less experience in this area, or more modest resources, to benefit from the experience and accomplishments of other States; moreover, certain aspects of such an exchange constitute a legal obligation under the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Additional Protocol I and the 1954 Hague Convention.<BR>

<P>Yet, for various reasons this system of reporting on national measures has never worked satisfactorily.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>Examine ways and means whereby States could report to an international body dealing with IHL, such as the ICRC or the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, on their efforts to implement IHL and to disseminate its rules and principles.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that a system be established whereby<BR>

<P>- States, where appropriate with the assistance of national committees and National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, report every four years to a commission of governmental experts, to be established pursuant to rules to be adopted at the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, on national measures taken to implement and disseminate IHL, including<BR>
		*	national measures for the repression of violations of IHL;<BR>
		*	the establishment of an internal system to monitor observance of IHL by the armed forces;<BR>
		*	measures to train the armed forces in the application of IHL rules;<BR>
		*	measures to educate the general population, particularly students of all ages, in the principles and rules of IHL;<BR>
		*	legislation on the protection of the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblem;<BR>
- the ICRC provides the necessary administrative services to the commission referred to above;<BR>
- said commission prepares a summary report on the States' reports for submission to the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent or to a special conference convened by the Depositary, and makes any recommendation it may deem appropriate.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>VII. Ways and means whereby the international community could react to violations of IHL and international cooperation could be improved in order to ensure respect for IHL</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[7]<BR>

<P>IHL reflects universally accepted human values. Violations of its principles and rules must therefore be a subject of grave concern to the international community as a whole, and they warrant joint reactions.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>Examine ways and means whereby the international community could react in the face of violations of IHL, as well as the possibilities of improving cooperation between States and the United Nations or other international fora and bodies in order to ensure respect for IHL.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that the States<BR>
- exert, in compliance with international law, whatever influence they may have, including through diplomatic and economic means, in order to ensure respect for IHL by the parties to an armed conflict;<BR>
- cooperate within universal and regional frameworks<BR>
		*	to exert, where appropriate, political, economic or any other pressure on persistent violators of IHL, and<BR>
		*	to establish and enforce demilitarized zones for the protection of civilian populations;<BR>
- establish arms export and control policies that distinguish States that comply with IHL from those that do not;<BR>
- strengthen their commitment to prosecute or extradite war criminals apprehended in their jurisdictions;<BR>
- support efforts to establish, on a global and a regional level, criminal jurisdictions for the prosecution of violators of IHL and implement all national measures necessary to ensure their proper functioning;<BR>
- cooperate with universal and regional intergovernmental organizations and with the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission in their efforts to enquire into violations of IHL, by providing them, whenever requested, with funds, experts and logistical support.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>VIII. Ways and means of dealing with specific violations of IHL and discussing general problems regarding the application of IHL</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[8]<BR>

<P>While enforcement of IHL and repression of its violations are primarily the responsibility of the civilian and military authorities of the parties to an armed conflict, the conviction that particularly serious violations of IHL ought to be the concern of the international community at large, has of late gained considerable ground. This new attitude is reflected by the establishment of international tribunals for war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the progress which the creation of an international criminal court has made in recent years, and the fact that more States have recognized the competence of the International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission in the last four years than in the previous thirteen.<BR>

<P>What may still be lacking, however, is an international forum dealing with specific violations of IHL on an intergovernmental level.<BR>

<P>In addition, there may be a need for a forum to discuss measures of improving observance of IHL in general.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>Explore practical ways and means of dealing with specific violations of IHL and discussing general problems of the application of IHL, e.g., by strengthening the role of the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and by making better use of the forum provided for in Article 7 of Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider recommending that<BR>

<P>- States assist international and national fora dealing with specific violations of IHL by providing information received, <I>i.a.</I>, from refugees who have been the victims of or have witnessed serious violations of IHL;<BR>
- the Depositary or the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent organize, in the period immediately preceding or following, or periodically between Conferences, a meeting of government representatives and interested intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, in order to discuss specific violations of IHL on the basis of information provided by States, intergovernmental or non-governmental organizations; and that the meeting draw up a report to be submitted to the Conference and propose recommendations that the Conference may wish to communicate to the States concerned;<BR>
- the States step up their discussions of specific violations of IHL within the framework of the UN Commission on Human Rights and continue to convene, in situations where grave violations of human rights and IHL instruments have occurred, extraordinary sessions of said Commission in order to deal with those violations;<BR>
- the Depositary organize periodic meetings - of the kind provided for in Article 7 of Additional Protocol I - of the States party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions to discuss general problems regarding the application of IHL.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>IX. Analysis by the ICRC of measures ensuring universal respect for IHL, the protection of women and children and the rights of refugees, and of situations where States' structures have disintegrated</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>1. Introduction</B>[9]<BR>

<P>The debate at the Preparatory Meeting showed that there are important issues, relating to armed conflicts and the protection of their victims, that are too complex to be considered by the Experts within the short time at their disposal, and that thorough discussion thereof should take place at a later date, on the basis of preparatory studies conducted by the ICRC.<BR>

<P><B>2. Recommendation</B><BR>

<P>The Preparatory Meeting recommends that the Experts call upon the ICRC to<BR>

<P><I>(a) analyse measures which could ensure, </I>i.a,<BR>
		<I>-	universal respect for IHL, particularly as it relates to civilians who are more and more often the victims of the use of means and methods of war consisting of systematic and large-scale killings by any armed groups, as well as of other violations of IHL in any armed conflict,</I><BR>
<I>		-	full protection for women and for children from violations of IHL,</I><BR>
<I>		-	full protection of the rights of refugees from violations of IHL, including the 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees;</I><BR>

<P><I>(b)	examine situations where States' structures have disintegrated as a result of non-international armed conflicts.&quot;</I><BR>

<P><B>3. Practical means</B><BR>

<P>The Experts may consider calling upon the ICRC to analyse the measures and examine the situations referred to under paragraph 2 above.<BR>

<H2>&quot;Le dilemme humanitaire. Entretien avec Philippe Petit&quot;</H2>
<P><I>By Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Berger</I>
<P>
<P>Rony Brauman,&quot;Le dilemme humanitaire. Entretien avec Philippe Petit&quot;, &Eacute;ditions Textuel, Paris, 1996, 106 pp.[1]<BR>

<P><B><I>Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Berger</I></B><I>, ICRC Delegate</I><BR>

<P>What is very stimulating about Rony Brauman is the free-thinking approach, whether spontaneous or reflective, that he adopts in order to gain a clearer picture of the purpose of humanitarian action in today's world. In this short collection of interviews with the journalist Philippe Petit, the former President (1982 -1994) of MSF-France [2]  gives the reader a generous insight into his thought and creativity as he talks about the way humanitarian action has evolved and the main challenges it has to face. Compared with the current trend of stereotyped thinking, there is true delight to be found in this philosophical exercise offered by an accomplished practitioner of modern philanthropy, who at his best proves to be brilliant at demolishing generally accepted ideas.<BR>

<P>With conventional &quot;stamps of approval&quot; excluded by definition from the conversation, the exchange of questions and answers spotlights the errors and shortcomings of humanitarian players against the setting of this century's major tragedies. We take a look back at the Second World War and the ICRC's deathly silence on the Jewish question, which Rony Brauman interprets as a logical consequence of all that remained unspoken from 1938, when the German Red Cross expelled its Jewish members in droves. Stressing the untypical nature of this moral abdication, which can be explained to some extent by the prevalent refusal to see what was going on, he points out that the ICRC had condemned the use of gas in warfare during the First World War. During the decolonization period of the 1950s and 60s, development aid was at the top of the solidarity agenda, well ahead of humanitarian action. The 1970s, on the other hand, saw the emergence of, as Rosenau put it, &quot;new agents free of national sovereignty&quot;, [3]  including private charities, which began to move into areas traditionally reserved for States and diplomacy. <I>M&eacute;decins sans fronti&egrave;res</I> was created in 1971, after the Nigeria-Biafra war, by French Red Cross doctors led by Bernard Kouchner who were unhappy with neutrality. Emergency aid then became overlaid with a duty to speak out in public, an attitude which, in the author's view, amounted in the event to involuntary propaganda in favour of the Biafran secessionist cause. In 1979, after some very lively internal debates, MSF took a majority decision to adopt an independent and more operational structure, detaching itself by the same token from the informal early &quot;legitimists&quot;, represented by Bernard Kouchner. Making MSF more professional was also, for Rony Brauman, a way of undoing the harm done by the sort of &quot;third-worldism and poetic illusion&quot; which was so deeply ingrained in the minds of young left-wingers at the time. &quot;With Claude Malhuret, we began systematically to criticize tyrannies in virtuous disguise.&quot; This deconditioning was followed up by increasingly firm opposition to State humanitarianism, institutionalized in 1988 by the ever-present Bernard Kouchner, who had meanwhile been elevated to the status of Minister of the Republic: &quot;A State is always suspected of ulterior motives (...) and inevitably places contacts with the authorities on the level of political transaction&quot;. What really arouses Brauman's indignation, however, is the shameful &quot;cover-up&quot; of injustice that results from State humanitarianism, as in Kurdistan, Somalia, Rwanda or Bosnia-Herzegovina, insofar as it &quot;served more to mask our own collective abdication in the face of large-scale excesses than to strengthen any resolve to eliminate them&quot;. As a means of countering this trend, Rony Brauman quite rightly urges governments to make use of the instruments of international humanitarian law which they have ratified.<BR>

<P>For MSF-France, one of the great testing grounds has been Ethiopia, which from 1984 was ravaged by famine. &quot;MSF protested against the forced population transfers organized by the Ethiopian government using the logistic resources of international aid (...). The idea that humanitarian action can be used to impose a cruel political measure, and will not necessarily serve the interests of the victims in the end, is the basic lesson to emerge from Ethiopia.&quot; This stance was to lead to the expulsion of MSF from the country in 1986, for which Rony Brauman accepts full responsibility. He sets this responsibility in clear opposition to the demagogic sentimentality of Bob Geldof, the organizer of the &quot;concert of the century&quot;, who &quot;just made the situation worse and aggravated the plight of the very people he was trying to help&quot;.<BR>

<P>Whence the notion of the humanitarian trap, which became a commonplace in the debate on the right of interference.<BR>

<P>Taking his consideration of the perverse effects of humanitarian aid a step further, the author roundly condemns &quot;the mechanization of humanitarian action&quot;, with all its paraphernalia of &quot;trucks, four-wheel drive vehicles, walkie-talkies, satellite-operated telephones and computers, which create an artificial environment, placing the teams in a quasi-virtual world where time and space are measured in units quite foreign to the country where they are operating&quot;. This &quot;bubble&quot; effect, the antidote for which consists in greater simplicity and common sense, tends to make the &quot;humanitarian horde&quot; behave irresponsibly and to increase the risks in the field.<BR>

<P>A further concern is the excessive media attention focused on humanitarian action. While admitting the need for information, and especially the value of pictures, which are so often indispensable for the conduct of relief work, Rony Brauman rejects the view that television could prevent &quot;another Auschwitz&quot;. &quot;For a mere technique to become, as if by magic, a moral or political standard is already dubious. But to go on spouting such inanities after all the horrors that have occurred at the end of this century is frankly beyond belief.&quot;<BR>

<P>With his scrutiny of the links between humanitarian and political action, Rony Brauman drives a wedge into the sacrosanct principle that one should not abandon victims unless forced to do so. Taking the view that the margin allowed for humanitarian action was not always wide enough to work in, and that humanitarian operations were all too clearly a fig-leaf for political inaction, MSF-France took the decision to withdraw, either provisionally or <I>sine die</I>, from situations as varied as Somalia, Zaire, the former Yugoslavia (after Vukovar), or Bougainville in Papua New Guinea. To leave or to stay is a dilemma that can arise anywhere at any time, as the ICRC well knows. The choice becomes even more difficult when it depends on parameters such as the degree of danger or ethical doubts, areas in which the threshold of acceptability is particularly hard to establish. What will become of the French-led &quot;ethic of refusal&quot; remains to be seen, in view of MSF's current efforts to strengthen its central structure and make it more international.<BR>

<P>Displaying a lucidity which is at times disheartening, Rony Brauman occasionally indulges in sweeping generalizations, such as when he states that non-governmental organizations maintain an artificial climate of emergency to serve their own material ends and to keep a high profile. To avoid picking the wrong target, he might have done better to support his argument with a sharper reminder of the root causes of conflicts. In this sense, his systematic but rather reductive dismantling of the humanitarian phenomenon could ultimately have a demotivating effect. There is no denying, however, the relevance of most of his clinical observations, which show no trace of leniency. And if some admissions of failure seem to be attributable to passing moments of disillusion, they may also be a way of arousing our vigilance, which is so easily dissipated.<BR>

<H3><B><I>A l'origine de l'embl&egrave;me</I></B></H3>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>1859</B>	Henry-Dunant est t&eacute;moin de la bataille de Solf&eacute;rino: des milliers de bless&eacute;s sont laiss&eacute;s sans soins, les cadavres sont abandonn&eacute;s aux pillards et aux animaux sauvages.   Les services sanitaires des forces arm&eacute;es sont inop&eacute;rants,<I> notamment faute d'&ecirc;tre signal&eacute;s par un embl&egrave;me</I> <I>uniforme, </I>donc reconnaissable par toutes les parties au conflit.<BR>

<P><B>1863</B>	La Conf&eacute;rence Internationale, r&eacute;unie &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve pour &eacute;tudier les moyens de pourvoir &agrave; l'insuffisance du service sanitaire dans les arm&eacute;es en campagne, adopte la croix rouge sur fond blanc comme signe distinctif des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de secours aux militaires bless&eacute;s (les futures Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge).<BR>

<P><B>1864</B>	La premi&egrave;re Convention de Gen&egrave;ve est adopt&eacute;e: la <I>croix</I> <I>rouge sur fond blanc </I>est reconnue comme signe distinctif des services de sant&eacute; des forces arm&eacute;es.<BR>

<P><B>1876</B>	Lors de la Guerre d'Orient, qui fait rage dans les Balkans, l'Empire Ottoman d&eacute;cide qu'il utilisera le <I>croissant</I> <I>rouge sur fond blanc &agrave; la place de la croix rouge.  </I> L'Egypte suivra avec le m&ecirc;me signe, puis l'Empire Perse choisira le lion-et-soleil rouge sur fond blanc.  Ces Etats feront des r&eacute;serves aux Conventions et, enfin, ces signes d'exception feront leur entr&eacute;e dans les Conventions en 1929.<BR>

<P><B>1949</B>	L'art. 38 de la l&egrave;re Convention de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949 confirme les embl&egrave;mes de la croix rouge, du croissant rouge ou du lion-et-soleil rouge sur fond blanc comme signes de protection des services sanitaires des arm&eacute;es. <I>Il exclut donc l'usage d'autres signes d'exception </I>que le croissant-rouge et le lion-et-soleil rouge.<BR>

<P><B>1980</B>	La R&eacute;publique Islamique d'Iran renonce &agrave; utiliser le lion-et-soleil rouge pour adopter le croissant rouge.<BR>

<P><B>1982</B>	<I>La F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge </I>adopte comme embl&egrave;me la croix et le croissant rouge sur fond blanc.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B><I>L'embl&egrave;me symbole...</I></B></H3>
<P>
<P>... <B>DE PROTECTION</B> <B>(USAGE PROTECTEUR)</B><BR>

<P>C'est l&agrave; sa signification essentielle: en temps de <I>conflit</I>, l'embl&egrave;me est la manifestation visible de la protection accord&eacute;e par les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve.  Il signale aux combattants que des personnes (volontaires des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, personnel sanitaire, d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s du CICR, etc.), des <I>unit&eacute;s sanitaires </I>(h&ocirc;pitaux, postes de secours, etc.) ou des <I>moyens de transport </I>(par terre, par eau ou par air) sont prot&eacute;g&eacute;s par les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve et leurs <I>Protocoles additionnels.</I><BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur doit alors d&eacute;clencher, chez les <I>combattants, </I>un r&eacute;flexe <I>d'abstention, de respect. </I>Il doit donc &ecirc;tre de <I>grandes dimensions.</I><BR>

<P>... <B>DE L'APPARTENANCE AU MOUVEMENT (USAGE INDICATIF)</B><BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me sert alors &agrave; indiquer, en temps de  paix principalement, qu'une personne ou un objet a un <I>lien avec le Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge,</I> soit plus pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment avec une <I>Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</I> <I>de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge, </I>avec la <I>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge</I> <I>et du Croissant-Rouge, ou</I> avec le <I>Comit&eacute; international</I> <I>de la Croix-Rouge.  </I>Il doit alors &ecirc;tre de <I>dimensions plus</I> <I>petites.  </I>L'embl&egrave;me rappelle aussi que ces institutions travaillent conform&eacute;ment aux <I>Principes fondamentaux du</I> <I>Mouvement; </I>il est donc aussi <I>un symbole:</I><BR>

<P><B>D'HUMANIT&Eacute;, D'IMPARTIALIT&Eacute;, DE NEUTRALIT&Eacute;, D'IND&Eacute;PENDANCE DE B&Eacute;N&Eacute;VOLAT, D'UNIT&Eacute; et D'UNIVERSALIT&Eacute;</B><BR>

En utilisant l'embl&egrave;me, les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales s'engagent &agrave; ne d&eacute;ployer que des activit&eacute;s conformes aux Principes fondamentaux, soit <I>l'assistance b&eacute;n&eacute;vole et impartiale &agrave; toutes les personnes qui souffrent.</I>(Photo 1)<BR>

<P><IMG src="304e_1.gif"> 1.<BR>

<P>Les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales peuvent aussi utiliser l'embl&egrave;me pour leurs <I>manifestations </I>ou leurs <I>campagnes de collectes de fonds</I>, aux conditions d&eacute;finies par l'Art. 23 al. 1 et 2 du R&egrave;glement sur l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me par les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales (Photos 2 et 3); des tiers (entreprises commerciales, autres organisations) peuvent &ecirc;tre associ&eacute;s &agrave; ces manifestations ou ces campagnes, mais &agrave; des conditions assez restrictives (Art. 23 al. 3, Arts 24 et 25 R&egrave;glement sur l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me).<BR>

<H3><B><I>Les abus de l'embl&egrave;me</I></B></H3>
<P>
<P>Chaque Etat Partie aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve a l'obligation de prendre des mesures pour emp&ecirc;cher et r&eacute;primer en tout temps les abus de l'embl&egrave;me.  Il doit notamment &eacute;dicter une <I>loi sur la protection des embl&egrave;mes de la croix rouge et du</I> <I>croissant rouge.</I><BR>

<P>Constitue un <I>abus de l'embl&egrave;me tout usage qui n'est pas express&eacute;ment autoris&eacute; </I>par les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve et leurs Protocoles additionnels. Ce sont par exemple:<BR>

<P>
<P><B>LES IMITATIONS</B><BR>

<P>Il s'agit de l'utilisation <I>d'un signe risquant de cr&eacute;er une confusion </I>avec l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge. Ce sont, par exemple, les imitations par la couleur ou par la forme.<BR>

<P><B>LES USURPATIONS</B><BR>

<P>- L'utilisation de l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge par des <I>entit&eacute;s </I>ou des <I>personnes qui n'y ont pas</I> <I>droit </I>(entreprises commerciales, organisations non-gouvernementales, simples particuliers, m&eacute;decins priv&eacute;s, pharmaciens, etc.);<BR>

<P>- Par des <I>personnes qui y ont normalement droit, </I>mais qui l'utilisent pour des <I>activit&eacute;s non conformes aux Principes</I> <I>fondamentaux du Mouvement </I>(une personne autoris&eacute;e &agrave; arborer l'embl&egrave;me l'utilise pour passer plus ais&eacute;ment les fronti&egrave;res lors de ses loisirs, etc.).<BR>

<P><B>LES ABUS GRAVES (PERFIDIE)</B><BR>

<P>Il s'agit de l'utilisation en temps de conflit de l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge pour <I>prot&eacute;ger des combattants arm&eacute;s ou du mat&eacute;riel de guerre </I>(par ex. une ambulance portant l'embl&egrave;me transporte des combattants arm&eacute;s; on masque un d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de munitions par un drapeau croix rouge, etc.). Ces abus sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme des <I>crimes de guerre.</I><BR>

<P><I>constatant avec une profonde inqui&eacute;tude </I>le d&eacute;veloppement de m&eacute;thodes de torture physique et psychologique toujours plus sophistiqu&eacute;es, qui infligent &agrave; ceux qui en sont victimes des souffrances qui ne laissent parfois aucune trace visible,<BR>

<P><I>soulignant </I>que la torture est une pratique qui nuit non seulement &agrave; l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; physique et psychologique de ses victimes imm&eacute;diates, mais porte atteinte &eacute;galement &agrave; leurs familles et &agrave; toute la soci&eacute;t&eacute; dans laquelle elle se produit et qu'elle jette le plus grand discr&eacute;dit sur ceux qui en sont responsables et les Etats qui l'autorisent, la tol&egrave;rent ou s'en rendent complices,<BR>

<P><I>rappelant </I>la r&eacute;solution XIV<B> </B>sur la torture de<B> </B>la XXIVe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge,<BR>

<P><I>rappelant </I>que cette r&eacute;solution demandait &agrave; l'Organisation des Nations Unies d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer l'adoption d'une convention internationale contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&eacute;gradants,<BR>

<P><I>1. accueille avec satisfaction </I>l'adoption par l'Assembl&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Nations Unies, le 10 d&eacute;cembre 1984, de la Convention contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&eacute;gradants <I>et invite les</I> Etats &agrave; la ratifier,<BR>

<P><I>2. encourage </I>les Etats et les organisations intergouvernementales r&eacute;gionales &agrave; entreprendre ou &agrave; poursuivre des travaux conform&eacute;ment &agrave; leurs r&egrave;gles et pratiques, en vue de l'&eacute;laboration de conventions r&eacute;gionales contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&eacute;gradants, pr&eacute;voyant des m&eacute;canismes de contr&ocirc;le efficaces,<BR>

<P><I>3. demande </I>aux gouvernements de poursuivre et d'amplifier leurs efforts en vue de parvenir, au-del&agrave; des interdictions formelles, &agrave; l'&eacute;limination r&eacute;elle de la torture sous toutes ses formes,<BR>

<P><I>4. appelle </I>les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et la Ligue &agrave; poursuivre et d&eacute;velopper leur action en vue de sensibiliser le public et d'intensifier son appui en faveur de la lutte contre la torture, et &agrave; soutenir tous les efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s, en particulier par le CICR, pour pr&eacute;venir et &eacute;liminer la torture.<BR>

<H2>Books and reviews: &quot;Le droit international humanitaire&quot;</H2>
<P><I>By Marie-Claude Roberge</I>
<P>
<P>Patricia Buirette, &quot;Le droit international humanitaire&quot;, &Eacute;ditions La D&eacute;couverte, Paris, 1996, 124 pages (Collection Rep&egrave;res)<BR>

<P><B><I>Marie-Claude Roberge</I></B><I>, ICRC Legal Division</I><BR>

<P>This 124-page book on international humanitarian law was written by Patricia Buirette, a professor of public international law at the University of Evry-Val d'Essonne in France. At first sight, given its slender format and rather general title, it just seems another book introducing international humanitarian law. Yet with each new chapter one realizes that the scope covered is much broader, for besides the fundamental principles of that law and of the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions, the author also deals with a variety of other subjects. They range from the paradoxical aspects of international humanitarian law to neutrality, the development of human rights philosophy, the evolution of the international community, intervention and humanitarian aid, the rightful place and limits of the latter and the role of the United Nations in this area. <BR>

<P>Although the book is somewhat theoretical in parts, especially those relating to international humanitarian law, the author goes beyond merely giving an exhaustive account of the rules, and has generally made her text come to life. It is understandable, even to those who may know little about humanitarian law and human rights. Nor does she confine herself solely to stating the principles; she explains them and provides the background.<BR>

<P>Probably out of a desire to simplify occasionally complex ideas, some statements are also rather lacking in precision. By deciding to write a short, concise book, Patricia Buirette has limited her account to the main points and has left out certain details or exceptions which are often important - for instance the setting up of ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, and their impact on the repression of violations of international humanitarian law and the possible creation of a permanent international tribunal. <BR>

<P>In the book as a whole, only the introduction leaves the reader somewhat perplexed by the immediate confrontation with some paradoxes of international humanitarian law: on the one hand, the enthusiasm in recent years for humanitarian operations and, on the other, the widespread criticism made of them. It is not until the last paragraph of this chapter that the author gives the reader a clear indication of her intention: &quot;This book seeks to describe the complex relationships between the importance and usefulness of international humanitarian law and the problems arising from humanitarian operations. It tries to encompass the developments and changes undergone by a law which stemmed from a determination not to accept the unacceptable&quot;.<BR>

<P>The first part, entitled &quot;Red Cross international humanitarian law&quot;, devotes considerable space to the work of Henry Dunant and the origin of the Red Cross. This historical section is quite detailed and very interesting. The ICRC's philosophy is also explained, especially one of its key principles - neutrality - which is frequently misunderstood and criticized. The author stresses that &quot;the neutrality of the ICRC is necessary for it to carry out its humanitarian mission and a <I>sine qua non</I> for its work in aid of victims. So as to maintain the trust of the parties between which it places itself and thus be able to reach out to all the victims, it must at all costs avoid taking sides.&quot; There then follows a description of the components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, including the International Conference.<BR>

<P>The contents of international humanitarian law and its links with public international law and human rights are outlined, as well as the latest developments in these areas. It is regrettable, however, that non-international armed conflicts are mentioned only briefly, since they are today the most frequent type of conflict. <BR>

<P>The second part of the book deals with the United Nations bodies responsible for humanitarian aid and their institutional and operational cooperation with the Red Cross. The third and last part is entitled &quot;Aid, intervention and the law&quot;. It summarizes concepts which have caused a lot of ink to flow, especially at the beginning of the 1990s, such as the development of the idea of intervention on humanitarian grounds and the role of non-governmental organizations, the interdependence of States and the emergence of individual liability under international law. <BR>

<P>From a general point of view, Patricia Buirette's book on international humanitarian law is interesting and easy to read. Its few shortcomings, undoubtedly due to the brevity of the work, can be easily overlooked.<BR>

<H2>Books and reviews: &quot;Defenseur des libert&eacute;s, serviteur de son pays et de la Communaut&eacute; internationale&quot;</H2>
<P><I>By Fran&ccedil;oise Perret</I>
<P>
<P><B>Victor Monnier</B>, <I>William E. Rappard.  Defenseur des libert&eacute;s, serviteur de</I> <I>son pays et de La Communaut&eacute; internationale, </I>Published by Slatkine, Geneva, Helbing and Lichtenhahn, Basel, and Champion, Paris, 1995, 900 pages.<BR>

<P>This work, prepared under the guidance of Professor Giovanni Busino and with a preface by Professor Olivier Reverdin, is a very detailed and vividly written biography of William E. Rappard.  After describing Rappard's New York childhood in his family of Swiss origin and his studies in Geneva, Berlin, Munich, Harvard, Paris and Vienna, Victor Monnier tells us of his appointment to the chair of economic history at the University of Geneva in September 1913, on the eve of the First World War.<BR>

<P>The author goes on to relate how William E. Rappard took part in a mission of five delegates sent to the United States by the Swiss government from August to November 1917 in order to give the Americans a better knowledge and understanding of Switzerland and to explain to them the extremely difficult situation in which the war had placed it, particularly from the economic point of view.  During this mission, Rappard was granted a personal interview with President Wilson, who told him about his plan to promote the creation of a League of Nations with a view to establishing a new international order.  As a result of this mission, the United States and Switzerland concluded an agreement on 5 December 1917 which included the provision of supplies for Switzerland.<BR>

<P>In October 1918, Rappard returned to the United States to sound out President Wilson's attitude towards the role of Switzerland and other neutral countries in the future League of Nations.  On meeting the President for the second time, Rappard realized that he was not in favour of admitting neutral countries to the League, but nevertheless tried to persuade him to accept all the neutrals, as well as Germany - when the latter adopted a democratic system.  After his return to Switzerland at the end of December, William Rappard took part in Swiss overtures to join the League of Nations, in the course of which he became more closely acquainted with the Legal Adviser to the Swiss Political Department (Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Max Huber - who was to become President of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1928.  The two men thereafter held each other in great mutual esteem.<BR>

<P>In January 1919, the Swiss government sent Rappard to the Peace Conference in Paris in order to &quot;put out feelers&quot; to the Allied delegates, particularly those of the United States, with regard to cooperation by Switzerland in establishing the League of Nations.  In Paris Rappard again met President Wilson, who then stated that he was in favour of locating the League's headquarters in Geneva.<BR>

<P>In the ensuing months, Rappard continued his efforts to enable Switzerland to join the League of Nations while retaining its neutrality, and also took part in a commission dealing with international labour legislation. On 28 June 1919, the Allies and the German plenipotentiaries signed the Treaty of Versailles, Article 435 of which provided that the signatories of the Treaty <I>&quot;recognise the guarantees stipulated by the</I> <I>Treaties of 1815... in favour of Switzerland&quot;, </I>in other words, its neutrality.<BR>

<P>It was this Article 435, the adoption of which had been negotiated by Federal Councillor Gustave Ador - who was also President of the International Committee of the Red Cross, from 1910 to 1928 - that subsequently enabled Switzerland to join the Ieague of Nations while retaining its neutral status.<BR>

<P>The next chapter is devoted to the services that William E. Rappard rendered to the international community.  Victor Monnier here describes how Rappard came into contact with the Red Cross by working, from July to October 1915, at the International Prisoners-of-War Agency established in August 1914 by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). Two years later, in July 1917, Rappard became a member of that Committee.<BR>

<P>During his missions in the United States in 1917 and 1918, Rappard established contacts with representatives of the American Red Cross, particularly with the President of its War Council, Harry P. Davison, whose proposal to set up a federation of National Red Cross Societies aroused his enthusiasm.  In early February 1919, Davison convened a meeting in Cannes of the Red Cross Societies of the five Allied Powers - the United States, Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan - whose delegates drafted a joint plan of action for peacetime and went to Geneva to discuss their project with the ICRC.  On 21 February 1919, in Paris, Davison gave representatives of governments and of the international press an account of his plan for setting up a League of Red Cross Societies, which was officially constituted on 5 May 1919 by the National Societies of the five Allied countries.  Davison was elected President of the League and Rappard became its Secretary General.<BR>

<P>In 1920, Rappard was appointed Director of the Mandates Section of the league of Nations, a post he held until 1924.  At the same time he left his post at the League of Red Cross Societies, but remained a member of the ICRC, from which he finally resigned on 17 March 1921, mainly because of differences of opinion with his colleagues in that body concerning the division of tasks between the League of Red Cross Societies and the ICRC.<BR>

<P>The Mandates Section provided the secretariat for the league of Nations Permanent Mandates Commission responsible for supervising the trusteeship exercised by the victorious States - the mandatory powers - over the former German colonies and the territories detached from the Ottoman Empire, namely Syria and Lebanon, which were administered by France, and Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq, which were administered by Great Britain.  One of the tasks of the Mandates Section was therefore to analyse the reports regularly submitted by the Mandatory Powers.<BR>

<P>On being appointed Rector of Geneva University, William Rappard became convinced that the presence of international organizations in the city should be conducive to the study of international matters.  This idea was shared by several Geneva professors and politicians and was finally put into practice by the establishment of the Graduate Institute of International Studies, of which Rappard was appointed Director in October 1928.  He nevertheless continued to take an interest in the work of the League of Nations, and in 1928 the Federal Council asked him to be a member of the Swiss delegation to the League; he subsequently combined this assignment with his work for the Mandates Commission.<BR>

<P>In the 1930s, Rappard denounced the political systems of the USSR, Italy and Germany with equal vigour.<BR>

<P>Throughout the war, Rappard pursued his activities at Geneva University and at the Graduate Institute of International Studies and took an active part in the work of the <I>Comit&eacute; international pour le placement des</I> <I>intellectuals r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s </I>(International Committee for the Placing of Refugee Intellectuals) set up in Geneva in 1933.  He also undertook several missions for the Swiss government.  After the war, Rappard negotiated the return of the International Labour Office to Geneva, and the Swiss government entrusted him with yet another mission to the Government of the United States, this time with a view to restoring mutual trust between the two countries.  In later years he represented Switzerland at several international conferences on the European economic situation and also at the sessions of the International Labour Conference held in San Francisco in June 1948 and in Geneva in 1949 and 1950.<BR>

<P>During the final years of his life, Rappard continued his university career and published studies on the economic and political situation of the time, marked by the Cold War between the United States and the USSR.  He also took an interest in the founding of the State of Israel, which he visited in 1949.  He died on 29 April 1958.<BR>

<P>This 900-page biography by Victor Monnier, based on extensive research in a wide variety of sources, will serve as an authoritative reference work on the life, personality and achievements of William E. Rappard.<BR>

<P><I>By Nguyen Van Noi</I>
<P>
<P><I>A Vietnamese reader has just sent the Review an article entitled &quot;A look at the Red Cross of Viet Nam&quot;. He tells us of the challenges Viet Nam is currently facing, especially in view of its new open policy towards the other countries in South-East Asia. We are publishing below some extracts dealing directly with the work of the Red Cross of Viet Nam, while preserving the author's very individual style.</I><BR>

<P>
<P>I should like to talk about the efficiency which consolidates, strengthens and embellishes the work of the Red Cross of Viet Nam in the most trying of times, such as the present. Whether it is a question of protecting human lives and alleviating suffering, combating hunger and disease, or promoting tolerance and solidarity, the same attitude always prevails. This attitude is based not only on the moral grounds for and the urgency of a humanitarian operation, but also - in the interests of all - on whether it is appropriate and necessary.<BR>

<P>Everyone knows that each year a dozen typhoons from the Pacific Ocean wreak havoc on almost all Viet Nam's seaboard provinces, from the north to the south. Moreover, the Mekong Delta, which is the country's granary, is repeatedly devastated by flooding. The immense losses for the population caused by such disasters, which recur year after year, are estimated at tens of millions of dollars and are difficult to recoup.<BR>

<P>Nevertheless, the victims do not give up in despair. As soon as the worst is over, the farmers go back to their fields and start again from scratch. Initially this seems an impossible task, for they are left with nothing: no food, no homes, no clothes or farming tools. Never mind, they get by with whatever they can find on the spot: they fish, gather edible plants and catch anything that can be eaten in order to survive. With the aid of their fellow countrymen living in safer areas, they make up what has been lost and through sheer hard work transform the barren soil into arich storehouse. The plains, shimmering with golden rice as far as the eye can see, are dotted with plantations and all kinds of orchards, which are the wealth of the nation. Such is the landscape. But what is behind this appearance of confidence, conscience and optimism? In fact, it is all due to the efficiency of mutual aid. The population is united; joys and sorrows are shared and dangers and perils are faced together. As a result, although utterly destitute, people manage to live for months on end without anyone going hungry. They help each other and eat whatever comes to hand. What is particularly praiseworthy in these efforts is that as well as demonstrating remarkable courage these people have always acted in the most rational way, showing the greatest understanding among themselves and vis-&agrave;-vis the world community. <BR>

<P>In 1995 there was widespread flooding along the Mekong River and an extremely violent typhoon caused devastation that will take years to repair. Organizations like the Red Cross did not launch appeals for aid to the world at large because they believe it is more decent and reasonable to start by meeting their own needs, whatever the circumstances. Nevertheless, external voluntary aid is always appreciated; it is no surprise that several friendly nations provided assistance which in a way constitutes the cement that holds together the house of humanity. Relief supplies of all kinds will be pouring in, but it is most unlikely that the adverse effects of aid provided for the victims of natural disasters will occur this time. There is no sign of long-term dependency, or of disruption to the regional economy with the arrival of large amounts of food and medicines; and no social upheaval has been invented by any undesirable intruder. The hapless victims do nothing that might harm the community; indeed, their attitude is worthy of the highest praise. <BR>

<P>So what can explain this fortunate outcome, rather than the disturbances that were feared? The real reason lies in the spirit of discipline and solidarity that is deeply rooted in the history of this people, whose glorious episodes and laurel wreaths have always been etched in blood and sweat. The same spirit imbues the Red Cross. Wherever there are people in need of help, there too is the Red Cross. It is present in schools and factories, on farms, in railway stations, in villages -in short, at the heart of society. In this country, the tenets of the Red Cross are indistinguishable from the spirit of solidarity and human kindness which shines out like a jade gemstone  a leitmotiv  set in the altar of Vietnamese traditions. First and foremost, the Red Cross is very much involved in education. This is the way to inculcate moral qualities such as humanitarianism, a sense of responsibility, active involvement in society, a capacity for organization and for doing one's duty. Involving the Red Cross in teaching creates a climate which makes it easier for schools to organize their educational activities and thereby expect to achieve good results among young people.<BR>

<P><I>After describing various needs in the health sector, the author concludes:</I><BR>

<P>Clearly, lack of the necessary resources and funds [...] has placed severe limitations on the social work done by the Red Cross of Viet Nam to help people in distress. Nevertheless, this humanitarian institution is increasingly active, alongside governmental and non-governmental organizations, among the most underprivileged people in the country.<BR>

<P>As well as inculcating proper principles and providing health education, schools must stress the benefits of gymnastics and sport. Sporting activities raise the general level of health and well-being and increase efficiency at work. Sport transforms men and women by endowing them with strength, endurance, vivacity and courage. Every school, every group of pupils living in a given region must create its own climate of well-being and joie de vivre. Each morning at sunrise, young and old alike must assemble to do gymnastics or practise various sports such as badminton or Olympic disciplines. All these activities provide a background against which young people can learn to live healthy lives and promote among the population the desire to establish a new culture. <BR>

<P>Promoting and disseminating knowledge relating to health protection and physical culture are thus vital aspects of Red Cross teaching activities. Each school can teach these precepts during school hours and put into practice what has been taught afterwards. It is constructive and humanitarian work which directly inculcates moral values in schoolchildren.<BR>

<P>At the moment both schoolchildren and students are quite actively involved in Red Cross programmes: they help with the medical treatment provided every weekend and during the holidays for poor people in crowded city areas and in remote villages. It goes without saying that, without being asked, young people have become the most dedicated and active &quot;shock troopers&quot; of the Red Cross. Their participation in other campaigns and movements with set objectives has highly significant effects on the population's everyday life.<BR>
And this is the crucial factor that has transformed the Red Cross of Viet Nam from a simple movement into an organization which quite naturally forms part of an ongoing tradition. <BR>

Elle est membre de la division juridique du CICR depuis 1987 et s'est sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e notamment dans le droit international humanitaire relatif &agrave; la conduite des hostilit&eacute;s.</I><BR>

<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1.	Introduction</B></H4>
<P>
<P>L'article 36 du Protocole additionnel I de 1977 stipule que:<BR>
<I>Dans l'&eacute;tude, la mise au point, l'acquisition ou l'adoption d'une nouvelle arme, de nouveaux moyens ou d'une nouvelle m&eacute;thode de</I> <I>guerre, une Haute Partie contractante a l'obligation de d&eacute;terminer si</I> <I>l'emploi en serait interdit, dans certaines circonstances ou en toutes</I> <I>circonstances, par les dispositions du pr&eacute;sent Protocole ou par toute</I> <I>autre r&egrave;gle du droit international applicable &agrave; cette Haute Partie</I> <I>contractante.</I><BR>

<P>Cet article n'&eacute;nonce pas une nouvelle r&egrave;gle de droit: il codifie le principe du droit coutumier qui veut que la bonne foi pr&eacute;side &agrave; l'application d'un trait&eacute; ou d'une r&egrave;gle coutumi&egrave;re.  L'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de l'article 36 est d'attirer l'attention sur le fait que de nouvelles armes continuent &agrave; &ecirc;tre d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es, en toute impunit&eacute;, et qu'il conviendrait donc, avant que ces armes ne soient d&eacute;ploy&eacute;es, de s'assurer que leur emploi ne viole pas, dans certaines circonstances ou en toutes circonstances, le droit international humanitaire.  S'il est vrai que c'est &agrave; l'Etat, qui met au point un nouveau type d'arme, qu'il incombe de s'assurer par avance du caract&egrave;re licite de l'emploi de cette arme, il n'en demeure pas moins que les autres Etats ont un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t juridique &agrave; s'assurer que la d&eacute;marche a bien &eacute;t&eacute; faite.<BR>

<P>D'autres articles de la pr&eacute;sente livraison de la <I>Revue </I>montrent que l'emploi des armes est limit&eacute; non seulement par les trait&eacute;s portant sur certaines cat&eacute;gories d'armes, mais aussi par deux r&egrave;gles fondamentales: d'une part, la prohibition des armes qui ne sont pas ou ne peuvent pas &ecirc;tre dirig&eacute;es contre un objectif militaire, ou qui causeraient incidemment des dommages excessifs et, d'autre part, la prohibition des moyens et m&eacute;thodes de guerre de nature &agrave; causer des maux superflus.  Cette derni&egrave;re r&egrave;gle est sp&eacute;cifiquement destin&eacute;e &agrave; emp&ecirc;cher que des souffrances excessives soient inflig&eacute;es aux combattants: c'est principalement sur cet aspect que nous nous pencherons dans ce court article.<BR>

<P>L'origine de cette r&egrave;gle, on s'en souvient, r&eacute;side dans le principe fondamental du droit international humanitaire de l'&eacute;quilibre entre les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s militaires et les consid&eacute;rations humanitaires.  Ce principe a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;nonc&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on on ne peut plus &eacute;loquente dans ce qui fut le premier trait&eacute; international interdisant l'emploi d'un certain type d'arme: la D&eacute;claration de Saint-P&eacute;tersbourg de 1868, interdisant l'usage, en temps de guerre, de projectiles explosibles de moins de 400 grammes.  Apr&egrave;s avoir d&eacute;clar&eacute;, avec un certain espoir, que <I>les</I> <I>progr&egrave;s de la civilisation doivent avoir pour effet d'att&eacute;nuer autant</I> q<I>ue possible les calamit&eacute;s de la guerre, </I>la D&eacute;claration indique que <I>le seul but l&eacute;gitime que les Etats doivent se proposer durant la</I> <I>guerre est l'affaiblissement des forces militaires de l'ennemi </I>et que <I>ce but serait d&eacute;pass&eacute; par l'emploi d'armes qui aggraveraient inutilement les souffrances des hommes mis hors de combat, ou rendraient</I> <I>leur mort in&eacute;vitable; l'emploi de pareilles armes serait d&egrave;s lors</I> <I>contraire aux lois de l'humanit&eacute;.</I><BR>

<P>A propos de la mise au point des armes futures, la D&eacute;claration stipulait que les <I>Parties</I>... <I>se r&eacute;servent de s'entendre ult&eacute;rieurement</I> <I>toutes les fois qu'une proposition pr&eacute;cise serait formul&eacute;e en vue des</I> <I>perfectionnements &agrave; venir, que la science pourrait apporter dans l'armement des troupes, afin de maintenir les principes qu'elles ont pos&eacute;s</I> <I>et de concilier les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s de la guerre avec les lois de l'humanit&eacute;.</I><BR>

<P>Diff&eacute;rentes &eacute;tapes furent ensuite franchies, avec non seulement la r&eacute;p&eacute;tition du principe qui interdit l'emploi d'armes de nature &agrave; causer des maux superflus (R&egrave;glements de La Haye de 1899 et 1907, article 23, alin&eacute;a e) et Protocole additionnel I de 1977, article 35, paragraphe 2), mais &eacute;galement avec la prohibition de l'emploi de balles qui s'&eacute;panouissent ou s'aplatissent facilement dans le corps humain (Ille D&eacute;claration de La Haye de 1899) et d'armes chimiques et biologiques (Ile D&eacute;claration de La Haye de 1899 et Protocole de Gen&egrave;ve de 1925).<BR>

<P>C'est dans le cadre des diff&eacute;rentes conf&eacute;rences qui ont abouti &agrave; l'adoption de la Convention des Nations Unies de 1980 qu'ont &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;es les derni&egrave;res en date des discussions &eacute;largies visant &agrave; faire le point sur le d&eacute;veloppement des armes nouvelles.  Outre les armes sur lesquelles portent les trois protocoles annex&eacute;s &agrave; la Convention de 1980, les armes suivantes avaient &eacute;t&eacute; discut&eacute;es lors des premi&egrave;res conf&eacute;rences organis&eacute;es sur ce th&egrave;me par le CICR, &agrave; Lucerne et Lugano:	les projectiles de petit calibre, les armes &agrave; effet de souffle et de fragmentation, les explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air, ainsi que les armes futures (lasers, dispositifs &agrave; micro-ondes, &agrave; infra-sons, &agrave; &eacute;clairs lumineux, armes g&eacute;ophysiques, &eacute;cologiques et &eacute;lectroniques).<BR>

<P>Apr&egrave;s ces deux premi&egrave;res conf&eacute;rences, les armes futures n'ont plus &eacute;t&eacute; discut&eacute;es, les experts estimant que les informations &agrave; disposition ne permettaient pas de proc&eacute;der &agrave; une &eacute;valuation.  Toutefois, au cours de la Conf&eacute;rence des Nations Unies de 1979-1980, tant les projectiles de petit calibre que les explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air ont fait l'objet de propositions visant &agrave; imposer des restrictions sur ces armes afin d'&eacute;viter de causer des maux superflus aux combattants.  Au terme de la discussion qui s'est tenue dans le cadre de la Conf&eacute;rence des Nations Unies, il fut cependant d&eacute;cid&eacute; qu'il &eacute;tait n&eacute;cessaire de poursuivre les travaux de recherche dans ces deux domaines pour pouvoir &eacute;tablir si ces armes risquaient r&eacute;ellement de violer les r&egrave;gles du droit international humanitaire et, en ce cas, d&eacute;finir le genre de r&eacute;glementation &agrave; mettre en place.<BR>

<P>Nous nous pencherons, dans ce court article, sur quatre types d'armes qui ont fait l'objet de nouvelles &eacute;tudes depuis la Conf&eacute;rence des Nations Unies de 1979-1980, soit les projectiles de petit calibre, les explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air, l'utilisation des rayons laser sur le champ de bataille et les autres armes &agrave; faisceau d'&eacute;nergie dirig&eacute;e.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>2. Projectiles de petit calibre</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Le probl&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; soulev&eacute;, lors de la Conf&eacute;rence de Lucerne, par certaines d&eacute;l&eacute;gations qui d&eacute;fendaient l'opinion selon laquelle les balles modernes de 5,56 mm provoquaient des blessures plus graves que les balles standard de 7,62 mm qui &eacute;taient utilis&eacute;es depuis le d&eacute;but du si&egrave;cle et dont la vitesse est l&eacute;g&egrave;rement inf&eacute;rieure (d'environ 10%) &agrave; celle des nouveaux projectiles.  A Lugano, les m&ecirc;mes d&eacute;l&eacute;gations ont avanc&eacute; l'argument selon lequel, d'apr&egrave;s les recherches les plus r&eacute;centes, la gravit&eacute; de la blessure inflig&eacute;e d&eacute;pendait essentiellement de la quantit&eacute; d'&eacute;nergie lib&eacute;r&eacute;e par le projectile et qu'une plus grande quantit&eacute; d'&eacute;nergie &eacute;tait lib&eacute;r&eacute;e par le fait que la balle basculait ou se fragmentait.  Les intervenants ont recommand&eacute; de normaliser les tests de balles afin de pouvoir &eacute;valuer la quantit&eacute; d'&eacute;nergie lib&eacute;r&eacute;e.  D'autres d&eacute;l&eacute;gations ont &agrave; la fois contest&eacute; l'argument selon lequel les balles de 5,56 mm causaient des blessures plus graves et critiqu&eacute; la m&eacute;thode et les crit&egrave;res propos&eacute;s pour les tests. Toutes les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations sont, cependant, tomb&eacute;es d'accord sur un point: la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de poursuivre les<BR>
travaux de recherche.<BR>

<P>Au cours de la r&eacute;union pr&eacute;paratoire qui a pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute; la Conf&eacute;rence des Nations Unies de septembre 1979, un projet de proposition, portant sur la r&eacute;glementation des armes de petit calibre, a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute; par le Mexique et la Su&egrave;de.  Ce texte pr&eacute;voyait l'interdiction des projectiles de petit calibre qui causent un grand transfert d'&eacute;nergie et citait quatre exemples de la mani&egrave;re dont ce transfert peut s'op&eacute;rer, notamment par un effet de bascule pr&eacute;matur&eacute; et une facilit&eacute; de fragmentation.  En outre, une m&eacute;thode &agrave; employer pour les tests &eacute;tait propos&eacute;e et un niveau maximum tol&eacute;rable de lib&eacute;ration d'&eacute;nergie &eacute;tait &eacute;voqu&eacute; sans &ecirc;tre d&eacute;fini.<BR>

<P>Si cette proposition n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; accept&eacute;e, c'est essentiellement parce que d'autres d&eacute;l&eacute;gations ont contest&eacute; &agrave; la fois les crit&egrave;res de base et la m&eacute;thode employ&eacute;e pour les tests.  Finalement, le 23 septembre 1979, la Conf&eacute;rence a adopt&eacute; une r&eacute;solution demandant la poursuite des travaux de recherche, afin notamment de mettre au point une m&eacute;thodologie normalis&eacute;e d'&eacute;valuation des balles et, ainsi, pr&eacute;venir l'inutile aggravation des blessures provoqu&eacute;es par ces syst&egrave;mes d'armes.<BR>

<P>Bien qu'aucun accord n'ait &eacute;t&eacute; obtenu au sujet des crit&egrave;res pr&eacute;cis &agrave; utiliser pour &eacute;valuer le potentiel de blessure de ces projectiles, un principe a &eacute;t&eacute; accept&eacute;: les armes de petit calibre ne devraient pas causer des blessures plus graves que les balles standard qui suffisent &agrave; mettre un homme hors de combat.  Il convient de se souvenir que si des projectiles de plus petit calibre ont &eacute;t&eacute; introduits, c'est seulement pour permettre aux soldats de transporter plus de munitions, et non en raison de l'effet produit par ces nouveaux projectiles.<BR>

<P>Onze ann&eacute;es se sont &eacute;coul&eacute;es depuis l'adoption de cette r&eacute;solution et, durant cette p&eacute;riode, les Conf&eacute;rences internationales de la Croix-Rouge de 1981 et de 1986 ont adopt&eacute; des r&eacute;solutions demandant aux gouvernements de faire preuve de la plus grande prudence dans la mise au point de syst&egrave;mes d'armes de petit calibre, de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; &eacute;viter une inutile intensification des effets traumatiques desdits syst&egrave;mes.  Les travaux de recherche se sont poursuivis dans ce domaine, sans toutefois toujours se conformer &agrave; la m&eacute;thodologie g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement accept&eacute;e et recommand&eacute;e dans la r&eacute;solution adopt&eacute;e en 1979 par les Nations Unies.  Des s&eacute;minaires et des conf&eacute;rences, auxquels le CICR a particip&eacute;, ont &eacute;galement eu lieu pendant cette p&eacute;riode, mais des divergences d'opinions demeurent sur certains points.  Les recherches effectu&eacute;es ont confirm&eacute; que c'est le transfert d'&eacute;nergie qui repr&eacute;sente le facteur d&eacute;terminant de la gravit&eacute; d'une blessure; or, un transfert d'&eacute;nergie de haut niveau est souvent caus&eacute;, soit par le fait que la balle bascule au moment o&ugrave; elle p&eacute;n&egrave;tre dans le corps (il est in&eacute;vitable qu'&agrave; un moment ou &agrave; un autre les projectiles basculent), soit par la fragmentation du projectile.  A l'origine de ces probl&egrave;mes il peut y avoir non seulement un manque de stabilit&eacute; (effet de bascule pr&eacute;matur&eacute;), mais aussi la construction de la balle elle-m&ecirc;me (mat&eacute;riaux utilis&eacute;es &eacute;paisseur et r&eacute;sistance de son enveloppe) qui peut provoquer l'effet pr&eacute;matur&eacute; de bascule ou la facilit&eacute; de fragmentation.<BR>

<P>Sur la base de ces informations, certains Etats ont pris des mesures visant &agrave; am&eacute;liorer la conception de leurs projectiles, en particulier afin d'augmenter leur r&eacute;sistance &agrave; la fragmentation.  Il convient de se souvenir que la D&eacute;claration de La Haye de 1899 interdit non seulement l'emploi de balles dont l'enveloppe ne couvrirait pas enti&egrave;rement le noyau, mais aussi toutes celles qui s'&eacute;panouissent ou s'aplatissent facilement dans le corps humain.  Le terme employ&eacute; dans le texte fran&ccedil;ais authentique - les balles qui s'&eacute;panouissent -, donc s'ouvrent, fait allusion &agrave; la fragmentation.  De toute mani&egrave;re, comme les balles dont l'enveloppe ne couvre que partiellement le noyau et qui s'aplatissent &agrave; des vitesses peu &eacute;lev&eacute;es, se fragmentent &agrave; des vitesses plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es, la fragmentation provoque un effet suppl&eacute;mentaire, et plus grave, que le simple aplatissement.  Par cons&eacute;quent, si les balles qui s'aplatissent facilement sont prohib&eacute;es, a fortiori, les balles qui se fragmentent facilement sont &eacute;galement prohib&eacute;es.  On se souviendra &eacute;galement que la D&eacute;claration de La Haye interdit l'emploi de toutes les balles qui s'&eacute;panouissent ou s'aplatissent facilement et que les balles dont l'enveloppe ne couvrirait pas enti&egrave;rement le noyau n'&eacute;tant mentionn&eacute;es qu'&agrave; titre d'exemple, il ne s'agit pas d'une liste exhaustive.<BR>

<P>Il faut esp&eacute;rer que tous les Etats prendront des mesures pour s'assurer au moins que leurs balles ne se fragmentent pas facilement.   Cependant, pour en arriver l&agrave;, il faudrait que les instructions n&eacute;cessaires soient donn&eacute;es aux fabricants d'armes - ce qui n'est en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral pas le cas.  D'apr&egrave;s ce que nous savons, les sp&eacute;cifications employ&eacute;es par l'OTAN pour les balles n'incluent pas l'&eacute;paisseur de l'enveloppe, ce qui a conduit certains fabricants &agrave; produire des balles ayant une enveloppe trop peu r&eacute;sistante qui facilitaient la fragmentation dans le corps.  Le probl&egrave;me semble s'&ecirc;tre encore aggrav&eacute; lors de l'introduction d'une balle plus petite encore et d'une vitesse l&eacute;g&egrave;rement sup&eacute;rieure, ce qui signifiait que son enveloppe normalis&eacute;e ne pouvait emp&ecirc;cher une fragmentation facile, m&ecirc;me si la balle correspondante, mais de 7,62 mm, n'avait pas ce probl&egrave;me.  La normalisation des m&eacute;thodes employ&eacute;es pour tester les balles repr&eacute;senterait un progr&egrave;s important sur la voie de la clarification des sp&eacute;cifications de fabrication, afin que les balles ne se fragmentent pas trop facilement et que tous les Etats se conforment &agrave; cette exigence.<BR>

<P><B><I>Autres nouveaut&eacute;s concernant les projectiles de petit calibre</I></B><BR>

<P>La presse sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e a pr&eacute;sent&eacute;, ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, des reportages sur la mise au point d'un nouveau fusil de combat (advanced combat rifle) et les programmes destin&eacute;s &agrave; en am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute; et la probabilit&eacute; de touch&eacute;.  Dans deux de ces programmes, des projectiles tr&egrave;s semblables &agrave; balle de 5,56 mm sont utilis&eacute;s: l'un des projets pr&eacute;voit deux balles dans la m&ecirc;me cartouche, l'autre utilise une cartouche sans douille et une balle plus petite (de 4,92 mm).  Dans les deux autres projets, des fl&eacute;chettes remplacent les balles, ce qui n'est pas, en soi, une id&eacute;e nouvelle, mais qui a &eacute;t&eacute; au centre d'une controverse en raison des effets de ces projectiles.  En fait, les fl&eacute;chettes ont &eacute;t&eacute; discut&eacute;es, sans r&eacute;sultat, &agrave; la fois lors des conf&eacute;rences de Lucerne et Lugano et lors des conf&eacute;rences des Nations Unies ult&eacute;rieures, mais &agrave; propos de leur utilisation en tant que munitions d'artillerie.  Employ&eacute;es en tant que substitut aux balles, les fl&eacute;chettes devraient &ecirc;tre projet&eacute;es soit une &agrave; une, soit par rafales de trois.  Les fabricants d'armes qui sont en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement des fl&eacute;chettes disent que leur longueur est suffisante pour qu'elles puissent tourner et se d&eacute;former dans le corps de mani&egrave;re &agrave; lib&eacute;rer toute leur &eacute;nergie.  Ce point de vue est contest&eacute; par d'autres experts qui doutent que les fl&eacute;chettes puissent avoir une efficacit&eacute; suffisante.<BR>

<P>On remarque, cependant, que tous les rapports sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s et tous les articles publi&eacute;s par des sp&eacute;cialistes traitant de l'efficacit&eacute; des nouveaux projets oublient de poser une question: sont-ils conformes aux exigences du droit international?  Il y a lieu de craindre que de nouvelles armes soient mises au point sans que l'on ait tenu suffisamment compte, ou que l'on n'ait tenu aucun compte, des aspects juridiques.  Pourtant, les tests de ces nouveaux projectiles devraient se d&eacute;rouler en toute bonne foi et, id&eacute;alement, en conformit&eacute; avec les crit&egrave;res normalis&eacute;s qui sont recommand&eacute;s dans la r&eacute;solution des Nations Unies de 1979.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>3. Engins &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air (FAE, fuel-air explosives)</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Au cours de la Conf&eacute;rence des Nations Unies de 1979, un document de travail a &eacute;t&eacute; soumis par le Mexique, la Su&egrave;de et la Suisse.<BR>

<P>Les auteurs proposaient d'interdire l'emploi des explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air, sauf lorsque le seul but est de d&eacute;truire du mat&eacute;riel (par exemple pour la destruction de champs de mines).  Cette d&eacute;marche tendait donc &agrave; interdire l'emploi de ces explosifs en tant qu'armes antipersonnel, mais d'autres Etats ont estim&eacute; qu'il &eacute;tait pr&eacute;matur&eacute; d'envisager d'introduire des restrictions ou des interdictions quant &agrave; l'emploi d'explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air avant que des &eacute;l&eacute;ments de preuves aient &eacute;t&eacute; apport&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re fiable et scientifique.  Il avait &eacute;galement alors &eacute;t&eacute; sugg&eacute;r&eacute; que les effets traumatiques de ces explosifs pourraient &ecirc;tre moins graves que ceux des munitions classiques utilis&eacute;es actuellement.<BR>

<P>Tr&egrave;s peu de publications ont &eacute;t&eacute; consacr&eacute;es &agrave; ce sujet, mais il ressort des articles parus &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es 80 que les explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air qui &eacute;taient utilis&eacute;s dans les ann&eacute;es 70 ont &eacute;t&eacute; largement d&eacute;pass&eacute;s, pour ce qui est de l'efficacit&eacute;, par une deuxi&egrave;me g&eacute;n&eacute;ration et qu'une troisi&egrave;me en est au stade de la mise au point.  Ils indiquent aussi que le choc physique et physiologique caus&eacute; par les explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air est d'une telle intensit&eacute; qu'il peut &ecirc;tre compar&eacute; &agrave; celui que provoque une arme nucl&eacute;aire de moins d'une kilotonne.<BR>

<P>Le principe de cette nouvelle arme repose sur la production d'un nuage a&eacute;rosol par un liquide volatile et inflammable &agrave; haut contenu &eacute;nerg&eacute;tique qui est m&eacute;lang&eacute; &agrave; l'air ambiant.  Quand le m&eacute;lange atteint la proportion voulue entre le combustible et l'air, on provoque l'explosion du nuage a&eacute;rosol.  Le r&eacute;sultat en est un puissant effet de souffle, semblable, par exemple &agrave; celui des explosions de gaz qui se produisent parfois accidentellement dans des b&acirc;timents ou dans des mines de charbon.<BR>

<P>La d&eacute;tonation du nuage a&eacute;rosol produit une onde de choc qui se propage &agrave; la vitesse du son, partant du nuage pour couvrir une distance qui peut repr&eacute;senter jusqu'&agrave; quatre fois la taille du nuage lui-m&ecirc;me.  La surpression atteint un niveau tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute; au moment de l'explosion.  Elle diminue au fur et &agrave; mesure que le diam&egrave;tre de l'onde de choc augmente, mais le rayonnement mortel est bien plus important que dans le cas d'une arme explosive de taille identique.   L'efficacit&eacute; antipersonnel est totale jusqu'&agrave; une certaine distance, puis elle d&eacute;cro&icirc;t rapidement jusqu'&agrave; z&eacute;ro.<BR>

<P>Les explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air ont &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;s au Viet Nam, essentiellement pour d&eacute;gager des zones d'atterrissage d'h&eacute;licopt&egrave;res et pour neutraliser des champs de mines.  Cependant, il semble qu'une utilisation dans un but antipersonnel soit &agrave; l'&eacute;tude.  Le nuage a&eacute;rosol se diffuse &agrave; travers la v&eacute;g&eacute;tation et suit les contours du sol, entrant dans les caches et les tranch&eacute;es qui, en d'autres circonstances, permettraient aux troupes de se mettre &agrave; l'abri des armes &agrave; fragmentation.  En fait, le m&eacute;lange combustible/air p&eacute;n&egrave;tre dans tout espace qui n'est pas herm&eacute;tiquement clos et s'infiltre donc &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur des maisons, dans les syst&egrave;mes de ventilation, dans les arriv&eacute;es d'air des moteurs, etc., emp&ecirc;chant presque compl&egrave;tement, tant les combattants que les civils, de se mettre &agrave; l'abri en cas de bombardement de ce type.<BR>

<P>Selon les informations disponibles, les cons&eacute;quences sur l'&ecirc;tre humain des ondes de choc provoqu&eacute;es par les explosifs &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air sont d'une extr&ecirc;me gravit&eacute;.  Les personnes qui se trouveraient au bord de l'onde de choc auraient leurs organes auditifs d&eacute;truits, souffriraient d'une grave commotion, de pneumothorax, d'&eacute;clatement des organes internes et de c&eacute;cit&eacute;.  Les victimes qui se trouveraient &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur ou &agrave; proximit&eacute; du nuage seraient purement et simplement an&eacute;anties.  Une personne prise au pi&egrave;ge des ondes de choc provoqu&eacute;es par l'explosion serait probablement &eacute;touff&eacute;e par son propre sang, venant des poumons &eacute;clat&eacute;s et, soit sa mort serait instantan&eacute;e, soit elle prendrait la forme d'une agonie pouvant durer jusqu'&agrave; une demi-heure.<BR>

<P>D'apr&egrave;s ce que nous savons, des armes de ce nouveau type sont d&eacute;j&agrave; fabriqu&eacute;es et mises &agrave; la disposition de certaines unit&eacute;s de plusieurs forces arm&eacute;es.  Elles &eacute;quipent en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des v&eacute;hicules d'assaut.<BR>

<P>Comme indiqu&eacute; plus haut, il est certain que, dans les laboratoires des pays industrialis&eacute;s, un travail de recherche et de d&eacute;veloppement est en cours dans ce domaine, en vue de la mise au point et de la production d'un explosif &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air de la troisi&egrave;me g&eacute;n&eacute;ration.  De telles armes devraient &ecirc;tre plus faciles &agrave; fabriquer et Ieur syst&egrave;me de d&eacute;clenchement pourrait &ecirc;tre contr&ocirc;l&eacute; par un microprocesseur.<BR>

<P>Une arme de ce type est capable, en fonction de sa charge, de produire une explosion d&eacute;vastatrice dans un rayon d'environ un demi-kilom&egrave;tre.<BR>

<P><B>4. Armes antipersonnel &agrave; laser</B><BR>

<P>Profitant des progr&egrave;s scientifiques r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans le domaine des faisceaux d'&eacute;nergie dirig&eacute;e, les militaires ont mis au point ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es diff&eacute;rentes armes antipersonnel.<BR>

<P>L'un de ces principaux d&eacute;veloppements est celui des rayons laser que les militaires utilisent d&eacute;j&agrave; depuis quelque temps pour la t&eacute;l&eacute;m&eacute;trie (range finding), la d&eacute;signation de la cible et le guidage de missiles.  Ces lasers ne sont pas des armes mais ils permettent d'am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute; des armes traditionnelles.<BR>

<P>Des articles parus r&eacute;cemment dans la presse sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e ont cependant montr&eacute; que des armes &agrave; laser destin&eacute;es &agrave; d&eacute;truire les syst&egrave;mes de sensors des v&eacute;hicules militaires, des avions et des chars, ainsi que des armes antipersonnel, sont en train d'&ecirc;tre mises au point.  Les armes de ce type utilisent des rayons lasers &agrave; basse &eacute;nergie qui ne sont efficaces que contre une seule partie du corps humain: l'oeil.  La concentration intense de cette &eacute;nergie lumineuse au niveau de l'oeil provoque une c&eacute;cit&eacute; soit temporaire soit permanente.   Les d&eacute;clarations publi&eacute;es dans la presse sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e ne laissent aucun doute sur le fait que le dernier effet mentionn&eacute; est intentionnellement recherch&eacute; lors de la mise au point de ces armes,<BR>

<P>Pendant les conf&eacute;rences de Lucerne et de Lugano, l'&eacute;ventualit&eacute; de la mise au point d'armes &agrave; laser &agrave; des fins antipersonnel avait &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;voqu&eacute;e, mais bien trop peu de renseignements &eacute;taient alors &agrave; disposition pour qu'il soit possible d'examiner soigneusement ce sujet; en outre, certains participants &eacute;taient d'avis qu'une telle &eacute;ventualit&eacute; n'&eacute;tait pas &agrave; envisager dans un proche avenir.  Pourtant, un expert avait d&eacute;j&agrave; pr&eacute;venu que les lasers antipersonnel feraient leur apparition au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 80: bien que la mention n'en soit apparue dans la presse que cette ann&eacute;e, certains bateaux sont, en fait, &eacute;quip&eacute;s de lasers depuis le d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 80.  Le but de ces lasers &eacute;tait essentiellement d'aveugler ou d'&eacute;blouir les pilotes d'avions entrant dans l'espace a&eacute;rien per&ccedil;us comme des ennemis; les articles les plus r&eacute;cents concernant les lasers &agrave; bord de bateaux ne mentionnent qu'un but: &eacute;blouir.<BR>

<P>Des rapports de sp&eacute;cialistes indiquent que plus r&eacute;cemment, des prototypes d'armes &agrave; laser portables ont &eacute;t&eacute; mis au point, notamment des dispositifs relativement l&eacute;gers, semblables &agrave; des fusils, utilisables &agrave; la fois contre les syst&egrave;mes de sensors et &agrave; des fins antipersonnel.   D'apr&egrave;s les m&ecirc;mes rapports, la fabrication de ces armes pourrait commencer dans une ann&eacute;e ou deux.<BR>

<P>Pr&eacute;occup&eacute; par les d&eacute;veloppements dans ce domaine, le CICR a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de rassembler des renseignements plus d&eacute;taill&eacute;s sur les faits rapport&eacute;s et sur les effets des armes de ce type.  Une premi&egrave;re r&eacute;union a eu lieu en juin 1989, r&eacute;unissant des experts en mati&egrave;re de technologie des lasers, des ophtalmologues, des experts en mati&egrave;re d'utilisation des lasers &agrave; des fins militaires, des psychologues sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s dans les probl&egrave;mes li&eacute;s &agrave; la c&eacute;cit&eacute;, ainsi que des sp&eacute;cialistes du droit international humanitaire.  Certains participants &eacute;taient des sp&eacute;cialistes priv&eacute;s, d'autres &eacute;taient des experts gouvernementaux venus &agrave; titre personnel.<BR>

<P>Deux faits ont &eacute;t&eacute; confirm&eacute;s lors de cette r&eacute;union: d'une part, des armes &agrave; laser anti-sensor et antipersonnel sont effectivement mises au point actuellement et, d'autre part, il n'est pas si facile de ne provoquer qu'une c&eacute;cit&eacute; temporaire, et non permanente, en particulier lorsque ces armes sont utilis&eacute;es de jour.  Les risques de c&eacute;cit&eacute; permanente sont donc tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute;s et les psychologues consult&eacute;s ont insist&eacute; sur la gravit&eacute; des effets de la c&eacute;cit&eacute; permanente.  Les sp&eacute;cialistes du droit international humanitaire &eacute;taient, quant &agrave; eux, partag&eacute;s sur la question de savoir si le fait de provoquer intentionnellement une c&eacute;cit&eacute; permanente, dans les diff&eacute;rents cas o&ugrave; des armes de ce type seraient utilis&eacute;es &agrave; des fins militaires, revenait &agrave; infliger des maux superflus.  Un point a cependant fait l'unanimit&eacute;: l'&eacute;tude de cette question doit se poursuivre.<BR>

<P>Comme l'avaient sugg&eacute;r&eacute; les participants, le CICR a organis&eacute; en 1990 deux groupes de travail compos&eacute;s d'experts scientifiques.  Le premier groupe a &eacute;tudi&eacute; plus en d&eacute;tail la nature et l'effet des diff&eacute;rents types d'armes utilisant le laser qui sont mises au point actuellement et a aussi indiqu&eacute; que l'&eacute;quipement actuellement utilis&eacute; dans le domaine de la t&eacute;l&eacute;m&eacute;trie pourrait &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute; comme une arme.  Les ophtalmologues pr&eacute;sents ont pr&eacute;venu qu'il n'existe virtuellement pas aujourd'hui, et qu'il n'existera probablement pas dans un avenir pr&eacute;visible, de moyen de traiter les blessures caus&eacute;es par ces lasers.<BR>

<P>Le deuxi&egrave;me groupe de travail, qui sera essentiellement compos&eacute; de m&eacute;decins et de psychiatres, &eacute;tudiera plus en d&eacute;tail les effets que la c&eacute;cit&eacute; peut avoir, &agrave; court et long terme, tant pour l'individu que pour la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, et les comparera aux autres blessures subies sp&eacute;cifiquement sur le champ de bataille.<BR>

<P>L'information obtenue pourra ensuite &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;e en vue d'une discussion plus approfondie des implications juridiques et des lignes de conduite &agrave; adopter en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement de ces armes.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>5. Armes &agrave; faisceau d'&eacute;nergie dirig&eacute;e (Directed energy weapons - DEW)</B></H4>
<P>
<P>A c&ocirc;t&eacute; des armes antipersonnel &agrave; laser, qui, &agrave; certains &eacute;gards, pourraient &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme des armes &agrave; faisceau d'&eacute;nergie, il existe des armes tr&egrave;s sp&eacute;ciales, comme celles qui utilisent des ondes &eacute;lectromagn&eacute;tiques de diff&eacute;rentes longueurs d'ondes et des g&eacute;n&eacute;rateurs de rayons &agrave; particules que certains experts consid&egrave;rent comme des armes antimat&eacute;riel potentiellement tr&egrave;s efficaces.  Si ce dernier type particulier d'arme, qui exige une quantit&eacute; consid&eacute;rable d'&eacute;nergie, n'a pas beaucoup de chances de devenir op&eacute;rationnel sur le champ de bataille dans un avenir proche, il en va bien autrement des syst&egrave;mes d'armement qui utilisent des faisceaux d'ondes ou d'impulsions &eacute;lectromagn&eacute;tiques.<BR>

<P>Il y a d&eacute;j&agrave; longtemps que l'on conna&icirc;t, bien que de mani&egrave;re imparfaite, les effets produits par les ondes &eacute;lectromagn&eacute;tiques sur l'&ecirc;tre humain, et les travaux de recherche se poursuivent dans ce domaine.  Selon la fr&eacute;quence utilis&eacute;e, le mode d'&eacute;mission, l'&eacute;nergie &eacute;mise, ainsi que la forme et la dur&eacute;e des impulsions utilis&eacute;es, les radiations &eacute;lectromagn&eacute;tiques dirig&eacute;es contre le corps humain peuvent provoquer de la chaleur et de graves br&ucirc;lures ou m&ecirc;me des modifications de la structure mol&eacute;culaire des tissus qu'elles atteignent.<BR>

<P>Des travaux de recherche ont &eacute;t&eacute; entrepris dans ce domaine par presque tous les pays industrialis&eacute;s, et notamment par les grandes puissances, dans le but d'utiliser les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes d&eacute;crits ci-dessus dans des armes antimat&eacute;riel et antipersonnel.  Les tests r&eacute;alis&eacute;s ont d&eacute;montr&eacute; que des impulsions puissantes de micro-ondes pourraient &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;es dans des armes destin&eacute;es &agrave; mettre des &ecirc;tres humains hors de combat ou m&ecirc;me &agrave; les tuer.  Il est possible, aujourd'hui, de g&eacute;n&eacute;rer une impulsion de micro-ondes &agrave; tr&egrave;s haute intensit&eacute; (par exemple, entre 150 et 3000 m&eacute;gahertz) atteignant un niveau d'&eacute;nergie de plusieurs centaines de m&eacute;gawatts.  Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; un syst&egrave;me d'antennes sp&eacute;ciales, ces g&eacute;n&eacute;rateurs peuvent, en principe, transmettre &agrave; une distance de plusieurs centaines de m&egrave;tres assez d'&eacute;nergie pour cuire un repas.<BR>

<P>Il est toutefois important de relever ici que les effets mortels ou invalidants que l'on peut attendre des syst&egrave;mes d'armes faisant appel &agrave; cette technologie peuvent &ecirc;tre &eacute;galement provoqu&eacute;s &agrave; des niveaux d'&eacute;nergie bien inf&eacute;rieurs.  En utilisant le principe de la concentration des champs magn&eacute;tiques, qui permet de contr&ocirc;ler la g&eacute;om&eacute;trie sur la cible (gr&acirc;ce aux antennes sp&eacute;cialement con&ccedil;ues &agrave; cet effet), l'&eacute;nergie irradi&eacute;e peut &ecirc;tre concentr&eacute;e sur de tr&egrave;s petites surfaces du corps humain comme, par exemple, la base du cerveau, o&ugrave; un niveau d'&eacute;nergie relativement bas peut avoir des effets mortels.<BR>

<P>Il semble que la technologie dont on dispose aujourd'hui signifie que la production d'armes de ce type, d'une port&eacute;e d'environ 15 kilom&egrave;tres et pouvant balayer une zone avec une s&eacute;rie d'impulsions rapides, pourrait &ecirc;tre s&eacute;rieusement envisag&eacute;e. Les soldats non prot&eacute;g&eacute;s se trouvant dans cette zone pourraient &ecirc;tre mis hors de combat ou &ecirc;tre tu&eacute;s en quelques secondes.  Une arme de ce type pourrait ais&eacute;ment &ecirc;tre install&eacute;e sur un camion et serait donc facile &agrave; transporter.<BR>

<P>Malgr&eacute; la raret&eacute; des publications portant sur ce sujet, et en d&eacute;pit du fait qu'elles sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement couvertes par le secret, les travaux de recherche entrepris dans ce domaine paraissent avoir d&eacute;montr&eacute; que de tr&egrave;s petites quantit&eacute;s de radiations &eacute;lectromagn&eacute;tiques sont capables de modifier de fa&ccedil;on sensible les fonctions des cellules vivantes.  Les travaux de recherche ont &eacute;galement r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; que des effets pathologiques proches de ceux que provoquent des substances extr&ecirc;mement toxiques peuvent &ecirc;tre produits par des radiations &eacute;lectomagn&eacute;tiques, m&ecirc;me &agrave; faible puissance; cela est particuli&egrave;rement vrai des radiations qui utilisent une forme d'impulsion contenant un grand nombre de fr&eacute;quences diff&eacute;rentes.<BR>

<P>Comme il a &eacute;t&eacute; dit plus haut, la quantit&eacute; d'&eacute;nergie n&eacute;cessaire pour obtenir ces r&eacute;sultats est souvent bien inf&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle qu'il faut utiliser pour produire un effet d'&eacute;chauffement significatif dans les tissus humains.<BR>

<P>Certaines recherches r&eacute;alis&eacute;es dans ce domaine semblent avoir confirm&eacute; que les champs &eacute;lectromagn&eacute;tiques de faible intensit&eacute;, modul&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re &agrave; &ecirc;tre analogues aux ondes c&eacute;r&eacute;brales normales, pourraient avoir de graves cons&eacute;quences sur le fonctionnement du cerveau.  Les exp&eacute;riences faites sur des animaux au sujet des champs magn&eacute;tiques puls&eacute;s auraient, dit-on, provoqu&eacute; des effets sp&eacute;cifiques (l'animal s'endormant, devenant anxieux ou agressif) selon la modulation de fr&eacute;quence utilis&eacute;e.  Par ailleurs, il est bien connu que des effets mortels peuvent &ecirc;tre &eacute;galement obtenus en utilisant des niveaux de puissance plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s que ceux qui sont utilis&eacute;s dans les exp&eacute;riences sur la modification du comportement.  Une arme antipersonnel qui serait bas&eacute;e sur de tels principes biophysiques pourrait produire des effets analogues &agrave; ceux d'un gaz agissant sur le syst&egrave;me nerveux, mais n'aurait aucun effet secondaire et ne laisserait aucune trace durable.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>6. Conclusion</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Malgr&eacute; les progr&egrave;s r&eacute;alis&eacute;s, tant en mati&egrave;re de contr&ocirc;le des armements qu'en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;sarmement et dont les m&eacute;dias se font largement l'&eacute;cho, des efforts consid&eacute;rables sont discr&egrave;tement d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s pour mettre au point des armes nouvelles ayant de tr&egrave;s s&eacute;rieuses implications du point de vue humanitaire.  La plupart des travaux de recherche concernant ces armes sont tenus secrets, ou ne sont mentionn&eacute;s qu'avec des informations insuffisantes dans des publications tr&egrave;s sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>Tous ces d&eacute;veloppements ont lieu sans que l'on ait la moindre preuve que leur conformit&eacute; avec le droit international humanitaire fait l'objet d'une analyse s&eacute;rieuse.  Les discussions qui ont eu lieu dans le cadre des conf&eacute;rences pr&eacute;paratoires ayant pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute; la Conf&eacute;rence de 1980, ainsi que lors de la Table ronde organis&eacute;e par le CICR en 1989 au sujet des armes antipersonnel &agrave; laser (battlefield laser weapons) montrent qu'il est de plus en plus difficilement admis que l'emploi d'une arme sp&eacute;cifique pourrait enfreindre la r&egrave;gle qui interdit les armes causant des maux superflus.  Alors que la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de prot&eacute;ger les civils contre les effets des hostilit&eacute;s est assez largement accept&eacute;e, on voit qu'un certain nombre d'Etats importants n'ont pas le d&eacute;sir de prendre s&eacute;rieusement en consid&eacute;ration le sort des combattants.  Si le profane ignore g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement qu'en principe les combattants ne devraient pas &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute;s avec des armes causant des maux superflus, les personnes qui connaissent bien le droit international humanitaire ne peuvent manquer de r&eacute;aliser que cette r&egrave;gle d&eacute;rive logiquement et naturellement de la philosophie fondamentale de ce droit.  Les combattants ne peuvent &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute;s que dans le but de les emp&ecirc;cher de commettre des actes militaires hostiles.  En d'autres termes, l'attaque est destin&eacute;e &agrave; pr&eacute;venir le danger que le combattant repr&eacute;sente &agrave; un moment donn&eacute;: elle n'est pas dirig&eacute;e contre l'&ecirc;tre humain en tant que tel.  Le but du droit international humanitaire est de prot&eacute;ger la dignit&eacute; des personnes, de garantir le respect et les soins auxquels ils ont droit en tant qu'&ecirc;tres humains.  Ce n'est donc pas un hasard si la premi&egrave;re codification du droit humanitaire, au XIXe si&egrave;cle, visait &agrave; prot&eacute;ger l'&ecirc;tre humain dans le combattant, en lui accordant le statut de prisonnier de guerre en cas de capture, en lui assurant des soins m&eacute;dicaux en cas de blessure et en interdisant l'emploi d'armes inutilement cruelles.  Cette protection de l'&ecirc;tre humain dans le combattant signifie que lors de la mise au point d'armes antipersonnel, il convient de prendre garde que les maux que l'on s'attend &agrave; causer ou que l'on veut causer n'aillent pas au-del&agrave; de ce qui est n&eacute;cessaire pour mettre un soldat hors de combat.  Dans ce contexte, l'expression hors de combat a une connotation manifestement temporaire, car sinon, les Etats ne seraient pas oblig&eacute;s de prodiguer des soins m&eacute;dicaux aux soldats bless&eacute;s pour que ceux-ci recouvrent la sant&eacute; ou de lib&eacute;rer les prisonniers de guerre &agrave; la fin des hostilit&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>Bien que les blessures subies entra&icirc;nent parfois une invalidit&eacute; permanente, ou m&ecirc;me la mort, ce n'est pas la m&ecirc;me chose que de vouloir provoquer une invalidit&eacute; grave et permanente ou la mort en mettant au point une nouvelle arme (ou en d&eacute;veloppant une arme qui a normalement cet effet), car il s'agit l&agrave; de punir l'&ecirc;tre humain en tant que tel et non plus de l'emp&ecirc;cher de remplir sa fonction militaire.  C'est ce raisonnement qui sous-tend la D&eacute;claration de Saint-P&eacute;tersbourg: l'objectif, l&eacute;gitime, d'affaiblir les forces militaires de l'ennemi serait d&eacute;pass&eacute; par l'emploi d'armes qui ... rendraient leur mort in&eacute;vitable.  Ce n'est pas la mort en tant que telle qui est inacceptable, car elle intervient souvent dans une bataille mais plut&ocirc;t le fait qu'elle repr&eacute;sente le but permanent recherch&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Toutes les armes que nous avons bri&egrave;vement d&eacute;crites dans cet article suscitent de graves questions - les nouvelles balles, avec leurs effets qui, souvent, ne sont pas correctement test&eacute;s, les lasers antipersonnel, dont le but recherch&eacute; est permanent, les engins &agrave; m&eacute;lange d&eacute;tonant &agrave; l'air et les armes &eacute;lectromagn&eacute;tiques, qui peuvent causer des souffrances sp&eacute;cifiques et dont on pr&eacute;tend qu'ils peuvent &ecirc;tre mortels &agrave; 100%.  Il est particuli&egrave;rement f&acirc;cheux que ces armes soient mises au point sans que leurs implications juridiques soient analys&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on exhaustive.  Bien que toutes les armes nouvelles aient une certaine utilit&eacute; sur le plan militaire (sans cela, elles n'auraient pas &eacute;t&eacute; mises au point), il ne suffit pas de leur reconna&icirc;tre une utilit&eacute; militaire r&eacute;elle pour que tout probl&egrave;me juridique disparaisse.  Cette utilit&eacute; militaire doit &ecirc;tre mise en regard des souffrances que ces armes engendrent et il faudrait que, lorsque les souffrances sont particuli&egrave;rement p&eacute;nibles, l'utilit&eacute; militaire soit r&eacute;ellement d'une importance particuli&egrave;re.<BR>

<P>Le Protocole final de la Conf&eacute;rence de Bruxelles de 1874 stipule qu'il <I>avait &eacute;t&eacute; unanimement constat&eacute; que les progr&egrave;s de la civilisation doivent avoir pour effet d'att&eacute;nuer, autant que possible, les calamit&eacute;s de la guerre, et que le seul but l&eacute;gitime que les Etats doivent</I> <I>se proposer durant la guerre est d'affaiblir l'ennemi, sans lui infliger</I> <I>des souffrances inutiles.</I><BR>

<P>Il vaut la peine de remarquer qu'ici le terme civilisation n'est pas l'&eacute;quivalent de d&eacute;couvertes scientifiques ou d'innovations technologiques, mais &eacute;voque plut&ocirc;t des restrictions que les Etats s'imposeraient &agrave; eux-m&ecirc;mes pour att&eacute;nuer les calamit&eacute;s de la guerre.  Il faut esp&eacute;rer que cette fa&ccedil;on de concevoir la civilisation n'a pas disparu et que les r&egrave;gles qui prot&egrave;gent les combattants ne se trouveront pas, dans la pratique, soit sap&eacute;es, soit balay&eacute;es dans la course aux armes nouvelles qui ne laisserait aucune place &agrave; la r&eacute;flexion sur leurs implications imm&eacute;diates ou &agrave; long terme.<BR>

<H2>Deuxi&egrave;me r&eacute;union des conseillers juridiques des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s Nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (Gen&egrave;ve, 6-7 mars 1995)</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>En vue de la XXVIe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (Gen&egrave;ve, 4-7 d&eacute;cembre 1995)</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Une seconde r&eacute;union des conseillers juridiques des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, organis&eacute;e conjointement par le CICR et la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, s'est tenue &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve les 6 et 7 mars 1995.[1]<BR>

<P>Les conseillers de quelque 20 Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, auxquels s'&eacute;taient joints des responsables charg&eacute;s du dossier de la XXVIe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, ont consacr&eacute; la premi&egrave;re journ&eacute;e de r&eacute;union &agrave; l'examen des recommandations du Groupe intergouvernemental d'experts pour la protection des victimes de la guerre qui s'est r&eacute;uni du 23 au 27 janvier 1995.[2]<BR>

<P>Lors de cette r&eacute;union que pr&eacute;sidait M. Yves Sandoz, directeur, Doctrine, Droit et Relations avec le Mouvement, les participants se sont r&eacute;jouis que le r&ocirc;le du Mouvement en qualit&eacute; de promoteur et de d&eacute;fenseur du droit international humanitaire (DIH) ait &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;affirm&eacute;, ainsi que celui de conseiller dans la mise en oeuvre du droit.  Ils ont aussi constat&eacute; que les huit recommandations du Groupe d'experts offrent une marge de manoeuvre appr&eacute;ciable aux composantes du Mouvement &agrave; qui il appartient d'inciter les Etats &agrave; poursuivre leurs efforts pour une meilleure application du droit.  En outre, les participants ont estim&eacute; que l'action du Mouvement n'&eacute;tait pas limit&eacute;e aux seules recommandations des experts, mais que celui-ci pouvait entreprendre des activit&eacute;s dans des domaines insuffisamment approfondis, tels que le syst&egrave;me de rapport obligatoire par les Etats sur la mise en oeuvre du DIH et la diffusion de celui-ci.<BR>

<P>Le d&eacute;bat qui eut lieu sur les recommandations du Groupe d'experts permis de d&eacute;gager les points majeurs suivants:<BR>

<P>- Les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ont un r&ocirc;le important &agrave; jouer dans l'adh&eacute;sion universelle aux instruments du DIH; elles sont tout &agrave; fait habilit&eacute;es &agrave; conseiller leurs gouvernements sur la mission et la comp&eacute;tence de la Commission d'&eacute;tablissement des faits.<BR>

<P>- Le CICR, avec l'assistance des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration ainsi que d'institutions acad&eacute;miques, doit renforcer sa capacit&eacute; &agrave; fournir des services consultatifs aux Etats dans leurs efforts de mise en oeuvre et de diffusion du DIH.  Ces conseils ne peuvent &ecirc;tre fournis qu'avec l'accord du destinataire.<BR>

<P>- Dans le domaine de la diffusion, les experts des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ont estim&eacute; que le CICR pourrait, soit directement d&eacute;velopper les connaissances en DIH des organisations internationales et des organes et institutions sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s de l'ONU, soit les inciter &agrave; d&eacute;velopper leurs connaissances.  En tout &eacute;tat de cause un effort important doit &ecirc;tre fourni pour la formation des forces de maintien de la paix.<BR>

<P>Les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales constituent les relais naturels du CICR et l'appui que la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration leur accorde doit &ecirc;tre coordonn&eacute; avec le CICR.<BR>

<P>Quant au r&ocirc;le de la diffusion dans la pr&eacute;vention des conflits, il s'agira pour le Mouvement d'examiner les modalit&eacute;s d'une strat&eacute;gie ax&eacute;e sur les valeurs humanitaires qui sont &agrave; la base du DIH et les moyens et m&eacute;thodes de transmettre ces valeurs dans les diff&eacute;rentes r&eacute;gions du monde, en fonction des contextes culturels.<BR>

<P>- Les experts des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ont r&eacute;affirm&eacute; l'importance des commissions nationales destin&eacute;es &agrave; faciliter et coordonner la mise en oeuvre et la diffusion du DIH.  Toutefois il convient de veiller que la participation d'organisations non gouvernementales dont les principes d'action peuvent &ecirc;tre diff&eacute;rents de ceux du Mouvement, n'induise pas les gouvernements en erreur et ne cr&eacute;e la confusion.<BR>

<P>- Le gouvernement suisse en qualit&eacute; de d&eacute;positaire des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve organisera des r&eacute;unions p&eacute;riodiques des Etats parties afin d'examiner les probl&egrave;mes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux d'application du DIH.  Il est pr&eacute;vu que les r&eacute;unions se tiennent en alternance avec les sessions des Conf&eacute;rences internationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et traitent exclusivement de l'application du droit.  Les experts des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ont particuli&egrave;rement insist&eacute; sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de coordonner la tenue de toutes ces r&eacute;unions.<BR>

<P>La seconde journ&eacute;e a &eacute;t&eacute; consacr&eacute;e &agrave; l'&eacute;tat de Pr&eacute;paration de la XXVIe Conf&eacute;rence, notamment aux propositions d'action &agrave; entreprendre par les composantes du Mouvement afin d'en assurer le succ&egrave;s.  Elle a aussi permis aux participants de passer en revue les points de l'ordre du jour provisoire de la Conf&eacute;rence et d'examiner comment les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales pouvaient s'impliquer dans la pr&eacute;paration de la Conf&eacute;rence par une mobilisation de leurs membres et par des d&eacute;marches aupr&egrave;s des gouvernements.<BR>

<P>L'ordre du jour provisoire de la Conf&eacute;rence, tel que pr&eacute;sent&eacute; par le CICR et la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration, contenait les points majeurs suivants:<BR>

<P><I>1)	Commission I</I><BR>

<P>- Rapport du gouvernement suisse sur les recommandations du Groupe d'experts pour la protection des victimes de la guerre.<BR>

<P>- Protection de la population civile pendant les conflits arm&eacute;s et autres questions d'actualit&eacute;.<BR>

<P><I>2)	Commission II</I><BR>

<P>- Principes et intervention dans l'assistance internationale et la protection humanitaire.<BR>

<P>- Renforcement de l'aptitude &agrave; aider et prot&eacute;ger les plus vuln&eacute;rables. Les experts ont fait part de suggestions ponctuelles &agrave; propos de cet ordre du jour qui doit tenir compte &agrave; la fois des priorit&eacute;s humanitaires et des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts des Etats.  Ils ont surtout soulign&eacute; combien il &eacute;tait imp&eacute;ratif que le Mouvement se pr&eacute;sente comme un front uni afin<B> </B>de d&eacute;montrer qu'il est apte &agrave; apporter une contribution importante &agrave; la r&eacute;solution des probl&egrave;mes humanitaires.<BR>

<P>Le pr&eacute;sident de la r&eacute;union leur a fait &eacute;cho dans ses conclusions, invitant les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales &agrave; aborder la Conf&eacute;rence de mani&egrave;re positive et constructive, en &eacute;vitant de donner l'impression aux Etats que le Mouvement consid&egrave;re la Conf&eacute;rence comme un lieu d'affrontement.  Il est essentiel que la Conf&eacute;rence reste un grand forum humanitaire o&ugrave; tous les acteurs montrent leur volont&eacute; de s'entraider pour d&eacute;fendre la cause des victimes.<BR>

<P><I>La Revue </I>reviendra dans un de ses prochains num&eacute;ros sur la pr&eacute;paration de la Conf&eacute;rence internationale et notamment sur son ordre du jour, lequel a &eacute;t&eacute; finalis&eacute; par la Commission permanente de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge lors de sa r&eacute;union des 1er, et 2 mai 1995.<BR>

<H2>Liberia: humanitarian logistics in question</H2>
<P><I>By Jean-Daniel Tauxe</I>
<P>
<P><I>The ICRC's Delegate General for Africa gave the Review his initial thoughts on the issue raised in the press release reproduced above.</I><BR>

<P>
<P>Since 6 April 1996, there have been new and dramatic developments in the conflict in Liberia, and there are again grounds for fearing the worst with regard to the survival of the civilian population. The ICRC once more deplores and condemns the serious and systematic violations of the elementary rules of international humanitarian law and of the minimum principles of humanity that have been committed since the start of the conflict in December 1989.<BR>

<P>For six and a half years the civilian population, the wounded, persons placed <I>hors de combat </I>and prisoners have been regularly subjected to killings, torture, mutilation, hostage-taking, forced labour, looting, destruction of property and forced displacements. Children have been enlisted to fight and even dead bodies have been desecrated. Tens of thousands of people have been killed or wounded, more than half of the country's inhabitants have been driven from their homes, traditional mechanisms of cohabitation among different groups have been swept away, moral boundaries and all reference to the principles and values that underlie and unite any human community have disappeared. The efforts made by the international community to put an end to the tragedy have not succeeded in checking this inexorable degradation.<BR>

<P>None of the many peace accords negotiated with great patience and in the face of major difficulties has been observed by the various factions involved. There has never been any real security or respect for the individual despite the presence of troops - mainly West African - charged with keeping the peace, United Nations military observers, UN specialized agencies, non-governmental organizations and the Red Cross.<BR>

<P>Once again, after its temporary withdrawals from part of the country in July 1990 and in October 1992, and following the tragic events in the interior of the country in September 1994, the ICRC lost most of its equipment and stocks during the recent developments in Monrovia. The logistic resources of the humanitarian players on the spot have been repeatedly looted and have thus served to strengthen the operational capacity of the warring factions. Vehicles and radio and telecommunications equipment, to mention only the most sensitive items, are in the hands of increasingly undisciplined combatants. Year after year, the humanitarian organizations have replaced these logistic resources and have thus unwillingly contributed to a continuous cycle of looting carried out in all impunity.<BR>

<P>Moreover, the proliferation of humanitarian organizations present in Liberia has inevitably led to compromises which have resulted in a deterioration in working procedures and in the quality of the services provided. In these circumstances, conducting a neutral and impartial humanitarian operation is becoming ever more difficult and uncertain.<BR>

<P>The ICRC has observed that successive changes in the situation have put the civilian population at the mercy of the various combatants, who live at its expense; while benefiting from emergency humanitarian aid to help them survive, civilians are also suffering its pernicious effects.<BR>

<P>The ICRC feels that the time has come for a reappraisal, and that it is no longer possible to continue assistance operations automatically, with the same predictable consequences for the victims.<BR>

<P>Humanitarian action must not serve as a pretext to mask the grim reality of a country where the law and minimum values of humanity are flouted daily, and where a false sense of security gives rise to disasters such as the one witnessed since 6 April.<BR>

<P>In the ICRC's opinion, solidarity with the victims of the situation in Liberia is and will remain indispensable. However, a humanitarian operation with lasting effects will be possible only if security is guaranteed, not only for the victims of the conflict but also for humanitarian workers. To this end, a genuine effort must be made to restore order and maintain stability. This effort must precede and be carried out independently from the humanitarian operations that will have to be set up as a matter of utmost urgency in the coming weeks.<BR>

<P>Primary responsibility lies indisputably with the Liberians themselves, and particularly with the transitional government and/or the faction leaders. Moreover, to remedy the country's chronic instability and to avoid negative repercussions in the region, the community of States, seeing that Liberia is spinning out of control, cannot limit its response to funding emergency humanitarian operations. It should step up its efforts to work out a comprehensive political solution involving the taking of decisions, diplomatic moves and practical action. Thus, should the current peace-keeping operation be maintained, it should receive support in terms of funds, equipment and manpower, to ensure that it is in a position to fulfil its mandate effectively and in all neutrality. Such an approach would make it possible to undertake the humanitarian operations that are so urgently needed to relieve the suffering endured by Liberia's civilian population, while avoiding the untoward effects that such operations have had in the past. <BR>

<P>
<H2>Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909) - a humanist of modern times</H2>
<P><I>By Vladimir Pustogarov</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>Vladimir Vasilievich Pustogarov,</I></B><I> an international jurist and Doctor of Law, was Deputy Director of the Institute of State and Law, Academy of Sciences (USSR), and is currently Senior Researcher at the Institute of Law and Government of the Russian Academy of Sciences. He is the author of the first monograph on F.F. Martens: &quot;... With the olive branch of peace. F.F. Martens -jurist, diplomat and publicist&quot; (Moscow 1993, 287 pages). In March 1996, he was awarded the Martens Prize of the Russian Academy of Sciences.</I><BR>

<P>
<P><B>Original: Russian.</B><BR>

<P>In the history of humankind, no matter how far back we look into the past, peaceful relations between people and nations have always been the ideal, and yet this history abounds in wars and bloodshed. The documentary evidence, oral tradition and the mute testimony of archaeological sites tell an incontrovertible tale of man's cruelty and violence against his fellow man. Nevertheless, manifestations of compassion, mercy and mutual aid have a no less ancient record. Peace and war, goodneighbourly attitudes and aggression, brutality and humanity exist side by side in the contemporary world as well.<BR>

<P>The primary task of modern times is to break this vicious chain and to put an end to war and violence - a goal which is all the more vital because of its close links with the need to prevent the ecological disaster that threatens the whole planet and its inhabitants.<BR>

<P>Recipes for the elimination of war are many and varied and are all worthy of attention, but at the same time no one can question the significance and fruitfulness of the noble idea of protecting the life, honour and dignity of human beings by legal means, with the ultimate aim of banishing war itself from international relations. In this connection, the importance of promoting legal awareness is primordial, since <I>homo sapiens</I> behaves in accordance with conceptions formed in his mind, and a legal norm can come into effect only when it becomes inherent in the way of thinking of a large enough number of people. The Ten Commandments of the Bible can be carved on stone tablets, cast in bronze or stamped on steel plates, but will nevertheless remain a dead letter unless they become part of the legal consciousness of society.<BR>

<P>The evolution of the moral values that determine the concept of justice (<I>justitia</I>) entails changes in the law, including international law, and the crowning points of this development are marked by the names of outstanding lawyers. It is indeed regrettable that our cultural tradition - at least, since the fall of ancient Rome - has placed lawyers far from the vanguard, behind emperors and army commanders, men of letters and painters. The poems of the 12th century minnesinger Walter von der Vogelweide are still included in anthologies of German verse, Napoleon and Suvorov are still legendary heroes of the past and the canvases of Titian and Rubens are still regarded as masterpieces - but who remembers Eike von R&auml;phoff, the first codifierof mediaeval law and the author of the rhymed <I>Saxon Mirror</I>?<BR>

<P>It was not until the 17th century that Hugo Grotius became widely known in Europe and more centuries passed before international developments in the last quarter of the 19th century brought forth a brilliant galaxy of international law experts from various countries who laid the foundations of contemporary international law.<BR>
One of the most outstanding representatives of this pleiad was Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909), a Russian jurist, diplomat and publicist whose influence on international law is appreciable to this day.<BR>

<P><B>Martens as an international lawyer</B><BR>

<P>F.F. Martens was born into a poor family in the town of Pernov (now P&auml;rnu) of the Liefland province of the Russian Empire. At that time the province comprised the territory of modern Latvia and Estonia.<BR>

<P>At the age of nine he lost both his parents and was sent to a Lutheran orphanage in St. Petersburg, where he successfully completed the full course of studies at a German high school and in 1863 entered the law faculty of St. Petersburg University.<BR>

<P>Very little is known of his childhood and youth. No doubt they were not easy. He himself did not like to recall those years, although sometimes the accumulated bitterness would suddenly burst forth, and he would write in his diary such entries as this one on the occasion of his 60th birthday: &quot;I have never had a worse day in my life, even if I think back to my childhood years&quot;. [1] Apparently the hardships of his childhood had not faded from his memory...<BR>

<P>At the university the young man was a brilliant student and his gifts caught the attention of I.I. Ivanovsky, the faculty dean, whose support enabled him to continue his studies at the university and to obtain the degree of professor of international law.<BR>

<P>Martens soon defended his master's thesis <I>On the law of private property in time of war</I> and was sent on a study tour abroad, attending lectures at the universities of Vienna, Heidelberg and Leipzig. As may be seen from his later works, he was mainly influenced by A.D. Gradovsky, professor of St. Petersburg University, who advocated the ideas of the rights of the individual and West European constitutionalism, by L. von Stein, professor at the University of Vienna, well known for his works on management and &quot;social intercommunication&quot; across State boundaries, and by J.K. Bluntschli, professor at Heidelberg University, who published<I> The Modern International Law of Civilized States </I>in the form of a code.<BR>

<P>His growing knowledge of Russian and West European schools of thought helped to broaden his outlook and to develop his spirit of innovation and independent thinking. When delivering his first lecture to students in January 1871, he defiedtradition by not continuing the course begun by his predecessor, but by criticizing the current state of the science of international law, on the grounds that it was not yet based on the study of material factors, was not trying to identify the objective laws of development and &quot;made no attempt to investigate the internal laws of communication between States and of international relations&quot;. Martens believed that it was time to &quot;start looking into the laws of the historical development of nations in their international life&quot;. [2] It was indeed bold of the young academic to claim to have created his own school of thought in international law.<BR>

<P>Martens was above all opposed to any concept implying that law was based on force. He regarded such views as unworthy of human beings and pernicious for international relations, pointing out that in such cases even prominent experts were confusing law enforcement procedures with law itself, for the fact that law was safeguarded by force did not mean that force should serve as the basis for law. According to Martens, the inviolability of human life, honour and dignity is recognized to be the right of everyone, not because it is protected by criminal law, but because everyone has an inalienable right to life, honour and dignity. <BR>

<P>With regard to the driving force of international law, Martens saw it in the development of international relations, reflecting the nations' need to communicate among themselves: &quot;<I>ubi societas ibi jus est</I>&quot; (&quot;where there is communication there is law&quot;). He wrote: &quot;The idea of international communication under which every independent State is an organic part of a single whole, linked with the other States by their common interests and rights, should serve as the basis for a scientific system of contemporary international law&quot;.[3]<BR>

<P>The real needs of States are constituted by international relations, which in turn are expressed in international law. At the same time, international law is not merely a device for recording the formation of relations between States, but is also a manifestation of the moral values of the human race.<BR>

<P>Although a down-to-earth realist, Martens stressed the &quot;ideal power of law&quot;, the power of the ideals of justice and humanity, and as a jurist and a humanist, he saw the basis for an equitable legal order, not in State sovereignty, &quot;political balance&quot; or nationalistic ideas, but solely in law: it is only law and the absolute rule of law that can ever serve as a basis for a properly organized life, free from war and violence. <BR>

<P>In his analysis of the history of antiquity, feudalism and the modern era, Martens recorded a steady shift in the correlation between law and force in favour of law. He believed that &quot;in the area of international relations, too, the time will come when the great law of social life will finally prevail, and each nation will exist for the world and the world for each nation&quot;. [4]<BR>

<P>Martens' sublime humanism and foresight caused him to situate the human being at the centre of international life. He concludes that there is but one law running through the entire history of nations, namely &quot;the principle of respect for the human person&quot;.[5]<BR>

<P>It is to his credit that he placed the human being at the centre of international law in spite of the views prevailing at the time. Martens considered protection of the rights, interests and property of a human being to be the substance of the entire system of international relations and regarded respect for human rights as a yardstick of the degree of civilization of States and international relations. &quot;It is our conviction,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that once the human being as such is recognized by the State to be the source of civil and political rights, international life will reach a high degree of development, law and order. And the reverse is also true - international relations can neither be developed nor established on a firm basis with a State in which the human person enjoys no rights and is oppressed&quot;. [6] The wording of Martens' credo is outstandingly clear: &quot;Protection of the individual is the ultimate purpose of the State and goal of international relations&quot; [7] - an idea and formulation worthy of the UN Charter or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights!<BR>

<P>Martens' humanism was incompatible with the spirit of militarism  even that emanating from his own homeland. The essay he contributed to a St. Petersburg journal in connection with the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the University of Bern (Switzerland), to which he was invited as guest of honour, is noteworthy in this respect. Martens was fascinated by the fact that a country as small as Switzerlandhad seven universities, that the university jubilee was being celebrated as a public holiday by the town and the whole canton of Bern and that this little canton maintained a university and provided for it better than Russia did for her institutions. &quot;For us Russians,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the history of this small cantonal University of Bern is enlightening at least by familiarizing us with the experiences and vicissitudes of cultural life&quot;. To this he added: &quot;The Swiss realized long ago what constitutes the true, essential and unshakeable might of every nation. It is not millions of bayonets, an immense national territory or a vast population, but it is the power before which everyone must bow and which triumphs over everything - the power of superior culture, intellect and talent&quot;. [8]<BR>

<P>Martens' scholarly outlook determined his practical activities as both a lawyer and a diplomat.<BR>

<P><B>Martens as a diplomat</B><BR>

<P>Unlike pacifists and representatives of similar trends, Martens considered the idea of the abolition of war in the immediate or more distant future to be purely utopian. In his opinion, the only solution that was compatible with the humane goals of law was to limit the horrors of war by means of clearly defined rules accepted by all States.<BR>

<P>It is worth mentioning that in Martens' time an anti-war offensive was being launched from many quarters and along different lines. The number of peace associations was growing. After emerging in the USA and Great Britain, they soon sprang up in a considerable number of countries. By 1895 there were 125 of them, including 36 in Great Britain, 26 in Germany, 14 in France, 14 in Italy, 9 in Switzerland and so forth, and at the beginning of the 20th century Russia was the only European country in which there were none. In Brussels in 1848, the peace associations held their first congress, which then became an annual event. Their activities influenced world public opinion by decrying the glorification of war, and the Interparliamentary Conferences held regularly after the first such conference in Paris in 1899 had a similar effect. [9]<BR>

<P>The idea of joining the civilized States in a single union within which all conflicts would be resolved peacefully was quite popular at the time. One of its most ardent supporters was L.A. Kamarovsky (1846-1909), a Russian jurist best known as the initiator of a permanent international court, who suggested as a first step the establishment of a union of European and American States along the lines of the USA,10 in the belief that strengthening the practice of federalism was important for promoting the idea of peace. [11]<BR>

<P>The demand for the reduction of armaments and - in some circles - the concept of universal disarmament received relatively wide support among the general public.<BR>

<P>The development and production of increasingly devastating weapons triggered a counterreaction, and in 1868, at the initiative of Russia, a number of States signed the St. Petersburg Declaration, renouncing the use, in time of war at sea or on land, &quot;of any projectile of a weight below 400 grammes which is either explosive or charged with fulminating or inflammable substances&quot;. [12] That provision was motivated by the desire to avoid excessive human suffering.<BR>

<P>Attention is usually concentrated on this particular rule, whereas the Declaration of 1868 contains a number of other important principles, for instance, that &quot;the only legitimate object which States should endeavour to accomplish during war is to weaken the military forces of the enemy&quot;. On the basis of the laws of humanity, the Declaration banned all arms, the use of which would exceed that object of war and called for control to be exercised over future technical improvements of armaments.<BR>

<P>Another fast-growing trend in mitigating the horrors of war was towards providing care for the wounded, prisoners of war and civilians. This work received a strong impetus from the activities of Henry Dunant, a young Swiss who had witnessed the aftermath of the bloody battle of Solferino (during the Franco-Austro-Italian War of 1859) and had written a book about that experience: &quot;A Memory of Solferino&quot;. At the end of his book, Dunant proposed that every country should set up a society to care for the wounded and that an international congress should be held on the subject. The proposals fell on fertile soil: the first meeting of the <I>International Committee for Aid to Wounded Soldiers </I>was held in 1863, and 1864saw the adoption of the (Geneva) <I>Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. </I>Societies for relief to the wounded began to emerge in various countries, and in 1880 Dunant's original Committee became known as the <I>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</I><BR>

<P>The picture outlined above should not, however, give a false impression of States' willingness to impose restrictions on armaments and means of warfare or to introduce more humane rules for the conduct of war. At that stage, a new legal awareness was only putting out its first shoots and the law-making process was in its early beginnings. As a matter of fact, Martens himself was soon to face some harsh realities.<BR>

<P><B>Martens and the laws of war</B><BR>

<P>With the backing of D.A. Miliutin, the Defence Minister who was close to the Tsar, Martens prepared a draft convention on the laws and customs of war, an instrument which was intended to establish universal rules of warfare for all belligerent States amd included regulations for the treatment of the civilian population and of non-combatants in general. The rules were designed to mitigate the horrors of war, in accordance with the legal awareness and humanism that were growing among the general public. <BR>

<P>At the initiative of Russia, Martens' draft was submitted to the International Conference convened in Brussels in 1874, but that assembly failed to adopt the convention. Although the text itself did not meet with any objection, the idea of restricting war by international rules came up against widespread resistance. The draft was finally adopted as a declaration of the Conference and did not become a convention until two decades later.<BR>

<P>The results of the Brussels Conference did not discourage Martens, who defended his views in the press. In 1879, he published a voluminous work entitled <I>The Eastern War and the Brussels Conference </I>in which he strongly castigated the apologists of war. Of great significance was his two-volume course <I>The Contemporary International Law of Civilized Nations, </I>published in 1881-1882, which ran into five editions and continued to be the most authoritative textbook in Russian universities for the next 30 years. It was soon translated into seven languages and was used by various foreign universities.<BR>

<P>The publication of the <I>Collection of Treaties and Conventions Concluded by Russia with Foreign States </I>brought him world-wide fame. Its 15 bulky volumes, based on materials in the Russian archives, were issued in 1874-1909. By prefacing each treaty and convention with an essay on its history, Martens turned the collection into &quot;a historical and diplomatic encyclopaedia of Russia's foreign relations&quot;. [13]<BR>
 <BR>
Martens was an active member of the Ghent Institute of International Law, participating, <I>inter alia,</I> in its work on documents relating to Red Cross activities. As from 1884, Martens represented Russia at all Red Cross conferences and was particularly active in the review of the initial Red Cross Convention at the Geneva Conference of 1906. In 1902, F.F. Martens received the Red Cross Distinguished Service Award for his services to society.<BR>

<P>Martens' authoritative status gradually gained international recognition. During his 40 years of service in the Russian Ministry ofForeign Affairs, he represented Russia at nearly all the international conferences in which it participated. He thus took an active part in preparing the documents for the Berlin Conference on Africa (November 1884-February 1885) and the Brussels Conference on African Affairs (1889-1890), and also in drafting the main provisions of the &quot;General Act on international measures for combating the maritime traffic in negroes&quot;. In 1893, Martens was a delegate to the First Conference on International Private Law and later represented Russia at the Second, Third and Fourth Conferences (1904). He acted as arbitrator in international disputes on a number of occasions, the best-known being his arbitration in the dispute between Great Britain and Holland in 1892: not only did his award satisfy both parties, but he also laid down the principle of a captain's jurisdiction, under the laws of the vessel's flag, for offences committed on the high seas. In 1899, as an umpire of the court of arbitration, Martens examined the territorial dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela (whose interests were represented by the USA). The demarcation line drawn by the court along the Orinoco river basin has ever since constituted the frontier between Venezuela and Guyana. Martens was also a member of the Russian delegation which signed the peace treaty with Japan in Portsmouth (USA) in 1905.<BR>

<P><B>The Hague Peace Conferences</B><BR>

<P>The hour of Martens' triumph as a jurist and a diplomat came with the organization and conduct of the First World Peace Conference in The Hague in 1899.<BR>

<P>We now know from archival documents that it was none other than Martens who drew up the programme of the Conference. On 12 August 1898, M.N. Muravyov, the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, circulated a note among the foreign envoys in St. Petersburg proposing that an international conference be convened with a view to ensuring &quot;genuine peace and primarily putting an end to the progressive development of armaments&quot;. The note, drawn up without any prior consultations, came as a complete surprise to foreign States and was not substantiated by any preliminary drafts or well-considered plans in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself. It was, so to speak, &quot;a bare idea&quot;, intended to produce a general impact.<BR>

<P>As it happened, the proposal to convene a disarmament conference did meet with an enthusiastic response among certain circles in several countries, and out of consideration for those feelings the Governments of Great Britain, France, Germany and other countries supported the Russian initiative. It was nevertheless clear to Martens who was following the foreign press coverage of the issue and to the senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that none of the Powers were prepared to disarm. Martens was to learn this from his personal experience: when drawing up the conference programme, he quite reasonably assumed that Russia as the initiator should set a tangible, even if minor, example of disarmament, and therefore proposed to declare at the conference that in the year of its holding Russia would reduce the number of its army recruits during that year. Tsar Nicholas II, however, commented as follows on the draft programme: &quot;I find it difficult to agree to a decrease in the strength of the Russian army&quot;.[14] <BR>

<P>Having obtained a positive public response and seeing that any form of disarmament was utopian, the senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were inclined to give the plan for the conference a quiet burial. Minister M.N.Muravyov, for instance, suggested that a meeting of the ambassadors accredited to St. Petersburg, which might come up with some kind of a declaration, should be substituted for the conference.<BR>

<P>Martens, who had shouldered the burden of preparations for the conference, was of a different opinion. Although by now he did not believe in the feasibility of any reduction of armaments, he found a way out by transforming the conference on disarmament into the first peace conference.<BR>

<P>The programme drawn up by Martens which later served as a basis for the work of the 1899 Hague Conference provided that:<BR>

<P>1. With regard to disarmament, a declaration should be adopted to the effect that the States parties &quot;in the near future undertake not to resort to military force for the protection of their rights and legal interests without prior endeavours to seek good offices, mediation or arbitration proceedings&quot;.<BR>

<P>In addition to the above it was proposed to discuss some measures for freezing armaments.<BR>

<P>2. Another aspect of the Conference's work concerned the establishment of a permanent court of international arbitration.<BR>

<P>3. The third aspect of its work was the adoption of a convention on the laws and customs of war.[15] <BR>

<P>The conference programme suggested by Martens not only brought the disarmament initiative of Russian diplomacy out of a deadlock, but also created a practicable basis for measures aimed at strengthening peaceful relations between nations and mitigating the horrors of war.<BR>

<P>When the First Hague Conference opened on 6 May 1899, bringing together the representatives of 27 States (21 European countries, the USA, Mexico, China, Japan, Persia and Siam), Martens was elected Chairman of the Third Commission, dealing with the laws and customs of war.<BR>

<P>Although the relevant draft convention had been submitted as early as 1874 in Brussels, the conciliation process in the Third Commission ran into a number of difficulties. At one point, a situation arose which Martens described as &quot;critical&quot;: a group of small countries headed by Belgium opposed the very principle of the rights and duties of armies of occupation, and demanded an unlimited right of resistance for the population of occupied territories. A solution was found in the form of the so-called &quot;Martens clause&quot;, the reservation that he proposed to insert in the preamble to the convention, reading as follows: &quot;... in cases not included in the Regulations adopted by them (<I>the States Parties </I>- V.P.), the inhabitants and the belligerents remain under the protection and rule of the principles of the law of nations, as they result from the usages established among civilized peoples, from the laws of humanity, and the dictates of the public conscience&quot;.[16] Martens' proposal was greeted by applause and the whole convention was adopted unanimously.<BR>

<P>In addition to presiding over the Third Commission, Martens repeatedly addressed the plenary meetings of the Conference and spoke in its Second Commission. His merits were so widely recognized that he came to be called &quot;the life and soul of the Conference&quot;.<BR>

<P>As a result of the discussions, the First Peace Conference adopted a resolution on the desirability of restricting military budgets, the Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land and the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, which provided in particular for the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration.<BR>

<P>The significance of the Conventions signed at the First Peace Conference and the impact they had and still have on the development of contemporary international law do not require any further comment. Individual clauses of the Hague Conventions (including those signed in 1907) have given rise to the development of separate branches of law which have become so topical today. These Conventions are a memorial to F.F. Martens, that outstanding Russian jurist, diplomat and humanitarian. In evaluating Martens' contribution to the overall results of the Conference, Jean Pictet, a well-known expert on international humanitarian law, wrote that the Martens clause had been brought into existence by its author's &quot;genius&quot;. [17] It is noteworthy that the full text of a slightly amended version of the Martens clause was included in Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. [18]<BR>
The articles of the Hague Convention on the Laws and Customs of War look strange to the modern reader. &quot;Prisoners of war may be set at liberty on parole...&quot; (Article 10); it is forbidden &quot;to kill or wound treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army&quot;, &quot;to declare that no quarter will be given&quot; (Article 23 (a) and (d)); &quot;the pillage of a town or place, even when taken by assault, is prohibited&quot; (Article 28); or (for occupied territories) &quot;pillage is formally forbidden&quot; (Article 47). But all this was a reflection of the contemporary realities of war, and it cannot be said that the provisions of the Hague Conventions are always observed in present-day conflicts. In any case, their humanitarian significance and their effect on legal awareness can hardly be overestimated.<BR>

<P><B>The Martens clause</B><BR>

<P>The Second World Peace Conference met in The Hague on 15 June 1907 with 44 countries participating. It was practically a world assembly, or &quot;an international parliament&quot; as Martens put it.<BR>

<P>Martens again had to take a most active part in preparing the Conference programme, in its proceedings and in bringing about the adoption of agreed texts of the conventions. On the one hand, the organizational work was considerably facilitated by the fact that the way had been paved by the 1899 Conference, but on the other hand a substantial number of complex questions, left unsettled because of their difficulty, had accumulated for consideration by the Second Conference. In addition, that work had to be carried out in an atmosphere of deteriorating relations between the world Powers and of the formation of military blocs in preparation for a new war. The naval rivalry between Great Britain and Germany was particularly acute.<BR>

<P>In the light of this new situation, the Tsar's Government decided to send Martens on a tour round the European capitals with a view to sounding out opinions and holding consultations.<BR>

<P>In Berlin he met Kaiser Wilhelm II, in Paris - President Falli&egrave;res, in London - Lord Grey, the Foreign Secretary, and King Edward VII, in The Hague - the whole royal family, in Italy - King Victor Emmanuel III and in Vienna  the Minister of Foreign Affairs von Ehrental and the Emperor Franz Josef. There were also numerous meetings with senior government officials and public figures. This tour by &quot;Professor Martens&quot; created quite a sensation and helped to promote the preparations for the Conference, although it naturally could not smooth over the existing Anglo-German and Franco-German differences. Wilhelm II, in particular, strongly objected to any discussion of the British proposal for the reduction of armaments, threatening to disrupt the conference if such a discussion were to be held. Tsar Nicholas II was greatly influenced by Wilhelm II's position on this issue and Martens had to prove to him the &quot;harmlessness&quot; of the British proposal. The Tsar continued to vacillate, however, and was even thinking of cancelling the Conference altogether.<BR>

<P>Those were the circumstances in which the Second Peace Conference, attended by delegates from 44 countries, started its work in The Hague on 15 June 1907. It should be noted in this connection that in Martens' theoretical course congresses of States, regularly convened at a world-wide level, were assigned the role of legislative bodies for the international community, as it was believed at the time that the prevailing trend was towards strengthening that community on the basis of law.<BR>

<P>Four commissions were set up at the Conference, and Martens was elected Chairman of the Fourth, or &quot;naval&quot;, Commission, which he called &quot;the most difficult&quot;, since the Anglo-German rivalry was most clearly manifested there and Martens often had to settle differencesbetween the protagonists. The Fourth Commission was nevertheless the first to complete its work, thanks to Martens' experience.<BR>

<P>The Second Hague Conference ultimately adopted a Final Act to which 13 Conventions and a Declaration were annexed. The States parties agreed to convene the Third World Peace Conference after a specified interval.<BR>

<P>The 1907 Conference revised and further developed a number of the provisions adopted in 1899, with the result that the documents of the First Conference are usually quoted in the form in which they were amended in 1907. The First Peace Conference has in a way been absorbed by its successor, and when reference is made to a Hague Convention it is an instrument of the 1907 Conference that is usually implied. The oblivion into which the First Peace Conference has fallen is politically and legally unjustified, and it would be more equitable to consider both conferences from the point of view of their interrelationship. Russia's initiative to mark the centenary of the 1899 Conference by convening the Third World Peace Conference is therefore worthy of support. <BR>

<P>As we have already mentioned, the anti-war offensive was launched from different directions and took various forms, but practical realities soon channelled these activities into two trends which, although interrelated, are legally and structurally quite distinct. One trend focused on the protection of war victims - the wounded, prisoners of war, internees and other non-combatants; the beginning of the codification process in this area being connected with the Geneva Conference of 1864 and the activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross. This trend is referred to in the literature as &quot;the Law of Geneva&quot;, while the other trend, focused on the rules of the conduct of war and constraints on the means of warfare and hence mainly concerned with combatants, has become known as &quot;the Law of The Hague&quot;.<BR>

<P>Martens himself personified the unity and organic interrelationship of &quot;the Law of Geneva&quot; and &quot;the Law of The Hague&quot;. He took an active part in the development of &quot;the Law of Geneva&quot; and at the 1899 Hague Conference worked successfully for the adoption of a number of important provisions on non-combatants, primarily defining the status of prisoners of war, the wounded and the shipwrecked during hostilities at sea, as well as the status of civilians in occupied territories. Those provisions were subsequently incorporated in the Geneva Conventions of 1929 and 1949.<BR>

<P><B>Martens and human rights</B><BR>

<P>Martens has already been assigned his rightful place among the creators of international humanitarian law with respect to its &quot;Law of Geneva&quot; and &quot;Law of the Hague&quot; branches, but now we can include him among those who laid the foundations of another branch, that of the protection of fundamental human rights. Its codification is considered to start with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948, and which some jurists distinguish as &quot;the Law of New York&quot;.19 It was Martens who in his works and lawmaking activities placed the human person at the centre of international life and recognized the protection of the human being to be the ultimate objective of international law.<BR>

<P>Fedor Fedorovich Martens died in 1909 and was buried in St. Petersburg.<BR>

<P>Cornelio Sommaruga, <I>Pr&eacute;sident, Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge</I><BR>

<P><I>Les conflits arm&eacute;s qui ensanglantent plusieurs r&eacute;gions du monde</I> <I>posent avec une insistance particuli&egrave;re un des probl&egrave;mes fondamentaux de l'action humanitaire en temps de guerre: comment assurer le</I> <I>respect des signes de protection derri&egrave;re lesquels les victimes de la</I> <I>violence et ceux qui les secourent peuvent s'abriter?</I><BR>

<P><I>En 1864, la Convention de Gen&egrave;ve cr&eacute;ait un signe distinctif</I> <I>uniforme des services de sant&eacute; des arm&eacute;es comme moyen d'am&eacute;liorer</I> <I>la protection des militaires bless&eacute;s et des membres des services de</I> <I>sant&eacute;.  Pr&egrave;s de cent trente ann&eacute;es plus tard, la valeur protectrice de</I> <I>l'embl&egrave;me des Conventions se trouve amoindrie par deux facteurs: les</I> <I>abus de l'embl&egrave;me et leur pluralit&eacute;.</I><BR>

<P><I>Les cons&eacute;quences de cette situation se manifestent en vies</I> <I>humaines perdues et en souffrances inutiles.  Elles concernent en priorit&eacute; le Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, dont l'un des d&eacute;fis majeurs consiste &agrave; obtenir un respect</I> <I>absolu des embl&egrave;mes.  Les opinions sur la port&eacute;e symbolique de la</I> <I>croix rouge et du croissant rouge doivent c&eacute;der le pas devant la</I> <I>pr&eacute;occupation, de renforcer la valeur protectrice de ces embl&egrave;mes.  Car</I> <I>le syst&egrave;me de protection accord&eacute; par le droit international humanitaire</I> <I>perdrait une grande partie de sa substance sans le respect de l'embl&egrave;me et de ses conditions d'utilisation.  Les lignes qui suivent examinent un aspect de cette probl&eacute;matique, celui de l'unit&eacute; et de la pluralit&eacute; des embl&egrave;mes.</I><BR>

<P>Au cours des derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, les probl&egrave;mes li&eacute;s aux embl&egrave;mes de la croix rouge et du croissant rouge et &agrave; la connotation religieuse qui leur est attribu&eacute;e ont p&eacute;riodiquement resurgi dans divers pays, sur plusieurs continents.  En particulier, l'&eacute;mergence de nouvelles Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales confront&eacute;es &agrave; des difficult&eacute;s quant au choix de l'embl&egrave;me pose des probl&egrave;mes concrets au Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge.  Une dizaine d'ann&eacute;es apr&egrave;s la dissolution, par le Conseil des D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s r&eacute;uni &agrave; Manille en 1981, du Groupe de travail charg&eacute; d'&eacute;tudier les questions relatives &agrave; l'embl&egrave;me, force est de constater que les probl&egrave;mes ayant motiv&eacute; la cr&eacute;ation de ce Groupe n'ont toujours pas trouv&eacute; de solution et que des faits plus r&eacute;cents invitent &agrave; reprendre la r&eacute;flexion &agrave; ce sujet.  Il importe d'analyser ici les raisons pour lesquelles la situation actuelle n'est pas satisfaisante et d'&eacute;num&eacute;rer les conditions que toute solution r&eacute;aliste devrait remplir.<BR>

<P>L'objectif de l'unit&eacute; du signe distinctif, qui symbolise le secours d&eacute;sint&eacute;ress&eacute; &agrave; ceux qui souffrent, est le corollaire de l'id&eacute;al fondateur du Mouvement.  L'utilisation d'un m&ecirc;me embl&egrave;me par les services m&eacute;dicaux des diverses parties &agrave; un conflit met en &eacute;vidence les valeurs fondamentales qui doivent rester communes aux adversaires: humanit&eacute; envers toutes les victimes, neutralit&eacute; de ceux qui leur portent secours et impartialit&eacute; de l'aide apport&eacute;e.  L'unit&eacute; des civilisations humaines autour de certaines normes de comportement trouve l&agrave; son affirmation.   Que ce Mouvement ait grandi jusqu'&agrave; r&eacute;unir presque toutes les cultures, les religions ou les nationalit&eacute;s, qu'il ait entra&icirc;n&eacute; la plupart des Etats du monde &agrave; &eacute;largir toujours plus la protection accord&eacute;e par le droit international humanitaire aux victimes des conflits arm&eacute;s, qu'il vienne en aide aussi aux populations frapp&eacute;es par les catastrophes naturelles, les accidents ou la maladie, sont autant de facteurs qui renforcent la justification originelle d'un ernbl&egrave;me unique.<BR>

<P>La r&egrave;gle de l'unit&eacute; du signe, qui avait &eacute;t&eacute; pos&eacute;e &agrave; l'article 7 de la Convention de 1864, devait &ecirc;tre bris&eacute;e lors de la guerre d'Orient de 1876-1878.  En effet, l'Empire ottoman informait le d&eacute;positaire de la Convention que, tout en respectant le signe de la croix rouge qui prot&eacute;geait les ambulances ennemies, il adopterait &agrave; l'avenir, pour la protection de ses propres ambulances, le signe du croissant rouge sur fond blanc [1]. Depuis, plus de vingt-cinq Etats &agrave; majorit&eacute; musulmane ont aussi adopt&eacute; le croissant rouge.<BR>

<P>L'attitude du CICR fut constante &agrave; cet &eacute;gard, mettant en garde contre les dangers inh&eacute;rents au fractionnement du signe de protection: par ce biais, on opposait &agrave; la croix rouge, dans laquelle des musulmans voient un embl&egrave;me religieux, le croissant, qui &eacute;tait l'embl&egrave;me national et religieux de l'Empire ottoman.<BR>

<P>En 1981, lors de son allocution en sa qualit&eacute; de pr&eacute;sident du CICR devant la Conf&eacute;rence internationale de Manille, feu le pr&eacute;sident Hay soulignait que <I>l'embl&egrave;me arbor&eacute; par chacun de nous n'est pas l'apanage d'un Etat, d'un peuple ou d'une religion, mais un signe de</I> <I>respect pour la victime bless&eacute;e et sans d&eacute;fense et de solidarit&eacute;</I> <I>humaine dans la d&eacute;tresse.</I><BR>

<P>Cela dit, on ne peut pas faire abstraction de l'histoire qui a conduit au choix de la croix rouge comme embl&egrave;me protecteur, puis &agrave; l'admission du croissant rouge.  La valeur intrins&egrave;que de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge ne saurait &ecirc;tre remise en cause, pas plus que l'attachement profond que leur vouent des millions d'&ecirc;tres humains.  Mais <I>la</I> <I>coexistence de deux signes a eu pour effet de renforcer la connotation</I> <I>religieuse de ceux-ci aux yeux du public.</I>  Il ne fait pas de doute que cette identification avec un groupe religieux ne reste pas sans cons&eacute;quence pour les victimes de conflits o&ugrave; chacun des adversaires fait usage d'un signe diff&eacute;rent.  Comme on l'a d&eacute;j&agrave; dit: <I>Ce qui fait la valeur protectrice de l'embl&egrave;me, c'est qu'il est identique chez l'ami et chez l'adversaire </I>[2]<I>.  </I>Si l'embl&egrave;me perd sa neutralit&eacute;, le risque est grand qu'il soit pris pour cible.  L'exp&eacute;rience du CICR dans les conflits de cette fin de XXe si&egrave;cle l'a rendu tr&egrave;s sensible &agrave; cet affaiblissement possible de la valeur protectrice de l'embl&egrave;me, qui s'accomplit au d&eacute;triment des victimes.<BR>

<P>Par ailleurs, l'identification des embl&egrave;mes autoris&eacute;s avec deux des grandes religions monoth&eacute;istes, m&ecirc;me si elle est faite &agrave; tort, est <I>peu</I> <I>compatible avec le principe d'universalit&eacute;.  </I>Elle peut donner l'impression d'un<B> </B>parti pris en faveur du christianisme et de l'islam, au d&eacute;triment d'autres religions: juda&iuml;sme, hindouisme, bouddhisme, ainsi que d'autres courants de pens&eacute;e d'inspiration religieuse ou Ia&iuml;que.  La cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; de l'embl&egrave;me aux yeux de ceux qui, &agrave; raison, ne lui attribuent pas de connotation religieuse s'en trouve affect&eacute;e.  Si les individus qui composent le Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge puisent souvent leur motivation humanitaire dans la foi, l'embl&egrave;me doit symboliser avant tout l'unit&eacute; d'inspiration et de finalit&eacute; qui les anime. La r&eacute;serve que les membres du Mouvement se doivent d'observer, dans leurs activit&eacute;s humanitaires, &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des diff&eacute;rents courants religieux, voire de la religion en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, n'entrave d'ailleurs en rien leur libert&eacute; individuelle sur le plan spirituel.<BR>

<P>Aux yeux du public, l'unit&eacute; du Mouvement devrait se refl&eacute;ter dans un embl&egrave;me unique.  Or la pluralit&eacute; des signes t&eacute;moigne d'une division, d'une incapacit&eacute; &agrave; surmonter certaines divergences et &agrave; transcender des diff&eacute;rences d'ordre religieux ou culturel.  Ce que d'autres organisations &agrave; vocation universelle ont r&eacute;ussi, notamment les institutions des Nations Unies, le Mouvement ne l'a pas r&eacute;alis&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Le Mouvement n'a pas non plus atteint l'universalit&eacute; dont il a fait l'un de ses Principes fondamentaux, en partie pour des raisons li&eacute;es aux embl&egrave;mes existants.  La population de certains pays et les membres de certaines Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s pensent ne pas pouvoir se reconna&icirc;tre dans l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge.  Ainsi, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; du Bouclier-de-David-Rouge <I>(Magen David Adom </I>en Isra&euml;l), bien que rendant des services humanitaires importants dans une r&eacute;gion troubl&eacute;e de la plan&egrave;te, ne peut appartenir formellement au Mouvement du fait qu'elle estime ne pas pouvoir adopter la croix rouge ou le croissant rouge.  D'autres Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ont, par le pass&eacute;, demand&eacute; la reconnaissance de signes diff&eacute;rents, correspondant &agrave; leurs aspirations religieuses, philosophiques ou ethniques particuli&egrave;res, puis y ont renonc&eacute;.<BR>

<P>La situation de certaines Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge dans des pays peupl&eacute;s par des communaut&eacute;s religieuses diff&eacute;rentes suscite aujourd'hui de s&eacute;rieuses pr&eacute;occupations.   Une partie de la population s'identifie avec un signe, une autre avec l'autre embl&egrave;me, divisant ainsi la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.  De tels antagonismes peuvent nuire au recrutement des volontaires ainsi qu'&agrave; la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.  En cas de conflit interne, au moment o&ugrave; la coh&eacute;sion de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale est le plus durement mise &agrave; l'&eacute;preuve, le fractionnement des branches locales qui adopteraient l'un ou l'autre embl&egrave;me ferait perdre son r&ocirc;le protecteur au signe distinctif.  La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale serait paralys&eacute;e par ces divisions au moment o&ugrave; son intervention serait le plus n&eacute;cessaire.<BR>

<P>Il faut aussi relever ici le danger de prolif&eacute;ration des embl&egrave;mes qu'entretient l'existence de deux signes dont chacun est identifi&eacute; &agrave; une religion particuli&egrave;re.  Lorsqu'une telle connotation s'est &eacute;tablie dans les esprits, surgissent d'autres demandes de reconnaissance d'embl&egrave;mes.   Multiplier les embl&egrave;mes reviendrait &agrave; diminuer chaque fois la valeur protectrice de ceux-ci.  Au pire, les signes partisans deviendraient des cibles.  L'adoption d'un ou de plusieurs nouveaux signes &agrave; connotation particuli&egrave;re, qui ne seraient valables que dans un pays ou dans un petit nombre de pays, contribuerait &agrave; diviser le Mouvement et &agrave; affaiblir l'efficacit&eacute; protectrice de l'embl&egrave;me.<BR>

<P>Il n'existe pas &agrave; l'heure actuelle de solution facile &agrave; ces probl&egrave;mes.   L'incapacit&eacute; dans laquelle s'est trouv&eacute; le Groupe de travail du Mouvement, dissous en 1981, de formuler des propositions acceptables en dit long sur les difficult&eacute;s qui jalonnent la recherche d'une solution.  N&eacute;anmoins, le Mouvement ne peut &eacute;luder ce d&eacute;fi.  Il doit tout mettre en oeuvre pour le surmonter, conform&eacute;ment au principe d'humanit&eacute;, qui l'invite &agrave; favoriser la compr&eacute;hension mutuelle et l'amiti&eacute; entre les peuples, et au principe d'universalit&eacute; qui lui impose d'&ecirc;tre ouvert &agrave; tous.  Afin d'&eacute;viter que les clivages politiques, religieux et id&eacute;ologiques qui divisent le monde contemporain ne deviennent des points de rupture, porteurs de risques de nouveaux conflits, le Mouvement a le devoir de manifester, sur le plan humanitaire, une coh&eacute;sion qui doit aussi se refl&eacute;ter face &agrave; la question de l'embl&egrave;me.  Au-del&agrave; m&ecirc;me des probl&egrave;mes concrets, li&eacute;s au caract&egrave;re religieux pr&ecirc;t&eacute; par certains aux embl&egrave;mes de la croix rouge et du croissant rouge - d'autant plus importants que dans des situations conflictuelles ou troubl&eacute;es des vies humaines d&eacute;pendent du respect de ces signes - c'est le d&eacute;fi de la coexistence entre des communaut&eacute;s culturelles et religieuses diff&eacute;rentes qui est pos&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Le CICR souhaite donc un nouvel examen de la question et souhaite y contribuer ouvertement.  La recherche d'une solution, quelle qu'elle soit, devra r&eacute;pondre &agrave; quatre exigences, dont les exp&eacute;riences pass&eacute;es au sein du Mouvement d&eacute;montrent la pertinence:<BR>

<P>- <I>cette solution devra &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s largement acceptable;</I><BR>

<P><I>- les Etats et les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales qui utilisent l'un des signes</I> <I>reconnus ne devront pas &ecirc;tre contraints d'y renoncer ou de modifier leur embl&egrave;me si telle n'est pas leur intention;</I><BR>

<P><I>- tout &eacute;ventuel nouveau signe devra avoir une simplicit&eacute; graphique</I> <I>qui lui assure une bonne visibilit&eacute; &agrave; distance, &ecirc;tre d&eacute;pourvu de</I> <I>connotation religieuse, politique, ethnique ou autre, et faire l'objet</I> <I>d'une large diffusion d&eacute;j&agrave; en temps de paix, afin de pouvoir &ecirc;tre</I> <I>identifi&eacute; facilement par ceux-l&agrave; m&ecirc;mes qui doivent le respecter;</I><BR>

<P><I>- la multiplication des signes, qui ne manquerait pas de survenir si</I> <I>une trop grande libert&eacute; de choix &eacute;tait accord&eacute;e, doit &ecirc;tre &eacute;vit&eacute;e.</I><BR>

<P>Si une nouvelle recherche est entreprise, il s'agit toutefois d'embl&eacute;e d'&ecirc;tre r&eacute;aliste sur deux points: le retour &agrave; la croix rouge comme embl&egrave;me unique, que le CICR avait longtemps appel&eacute; de ses voeux, n'est plus envisageable, pas plus qu'il n'est actuellement concevable d'imaginer un accord de l'ensemble des composantes du Mouvement pour abandonner les signes existants - auxquels des millions de personnes vouent un attachement profond.<BR>

<P>Par ailleurs, l'utilisation du double embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge et du croissant rouge juxtapos&eacute;s (qui est en contradiction avec le droit existant, l'article 38 de la premi&egrave;re Convention de Gen&egrave;ve du 12 ao&ucirc;t 1949 pr&eacute;voyant l'usage du croissant rouge &agrave; la place de la croix rouge et non pas &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; de celle-ci) ne manquerait pas de pr&eacute;senter des inconv&eacute;nients s&eacute;rieux.  La connotation religieuse des deux signes s'en trouverait renforc&eacute;e.  La g&eacute;n&eacute;ralisation de l'emploi du double embl&egrave;me aurait aussi la cons&eacute;quence f&acirc;cheuse de fermer la porte &agrave; toute solution pour les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s qui ne peuvent adopter ni la croix rouge, ni le croissant rouge; les demandes de reconnaissance de nouveaux signes continueraient &agrave; surgir p&eacute;riodiquement.  Enfin, la visibilit&eacute; &agrave; distance de tout signe combin&eacute;, &agrave; graphisme compliqu&eacute; (croix rouge et croissant rouge, ou autres signes juxtapos&eacute;s) laisse &agrave; d&eacute;sirer, de nombreux tests l'ont d&eacute;montr&eacute;.  Au moment o&ugrave; des efforts importants sont faits pour am&eacute;liorer l'identification des personnes et des biens prot&eacute;g&eacute;s par le droit international humanitaire, cet argument doit &ecirc;tre justement appr&eacute;ci&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Le CICR souhaite donc un d&eacute;bat ouvert et serein sur cette question.  Il est pr&ecirc;t, en ce qui le concerne, &agrave; y contribuer, ainsi qu'&agrave; examiner toute proposition susceptible de conduire &agrave; une solution.   Pour sa part, le CICR est arriv&eacute; &agrave; la conclusion que la solution d'un troisi&egrave;me signe pr&eacute;sente des avantages importants et m&eacute;riterait un examen approfondi au sein du Mouvement.  Dans l'hypoth&egrave;se o&ugrave; le Mouvement accepterait que fut mis &agrave; disposition des Etats et des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales qui le souhaiteraient un troisi&egrave;me signe nouveau, les inconv&eacute;nients mentionn&eacute;s ci-dessus en relation avec les embl&egrave;mes existants devraient &ecirc;tre &eacute;vit&eacute;s.  Ce signe devrait r&eacute;pondre aux exigences de la visibilit&eacute;, &ecirc;tre d&eacute;pourvu de toute connotation religieuse, politique, culturelle ou autre et devra &ecirc;tre choisi avec le plus grand soin.<BR>

<P>Certes, les embl&egrave;mes de la croix rouge et du croissant rouge jouissent toujours d'un grand respect et remplissent leur fonction de protection dans la grande majorit&eacute; des cas.  Le CICR est, en outre, tout &agrave; fait conscient du fait que seuls les Etats sont habilit&eacute;s &agrave; modifier la situation existante en mati&egrave;re d'embl&egrave;mes.<BR>

<P>Toutefois, les faits mentionn&eacute;s ci-dessus doivent inciter le Mouvement &agrave; se pencher &agrave; nouveau sur ces probl&egrave;mes.  L'&eacute;tude engag&eacute;e sur l'avenir du Mouvement lui en donne une occasion.  Toute proposition devra &ecirc;tre soumise au Conseil des D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s, puis - il va sans dire aux Etats parties &agrave; ces trait&eacute;s, si elle implique une modification des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve.<BR>

<H2>Books and reviews: &quot;Focus on humanity: A century of photography, The ICRC Archives&quot;</H2>
<P><I>By Didier Helg</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>Didier Helg</I></B><I> is Director of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum.</I><BR>

<P>The Skira publishing house has just brought out an intensely moving book on the role of photography in humanitarian action.*  Nicolas Bouvier selected the pictures for this magnificent volume with great sensitivity to their moral impact, Mich&egrave;le Mercier wrote the engrossing narrative and Fran&ccedil;ois Bugnion contributed an admirable preface. With the help of Isabelle Engammare, the authors delved deep into the storehouses of sorrow, as Nicolas Bouvier calls their main source, the photo archives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.<BR>
	<BR>
This book in all its harsh beauty shows as none has ever done before how photography, in its privileged and sometimes ambiguous relationship with war, can capture the human gesture of compassion. Beauty is used here in the special sense given to it by the philosopher Simone Weil in the epigraph to Fran&ccedil;ois Bugnion's preface, which traces the parallel between the history of photography and that of humanitarian action: A just and loving spirit sheds the radiance of beauty upon misfortune, and this alone allows us to see and reproduce it as it is. 	<BR>
Humanitarian law is built on suffering, and while it is true that the Geneva Conventions cannot be photographed, suffering can. Yet if this book successfully avoids the aesthetics of drama, in accordance with Nicolas Bouvier's wishes, it is because the authors chose photographs in which life itself seems to be called into question, and the question is directed at us. Indeed, these faces (Cyprus, 1974) appeal to us, the readers; it is towards us that these arms (Zambia, 1978) reach out. And when we look at the harrowing photograph of Armenian prisoners in Azerbaijan (Baku, 1993) we are uncomfortably aware that history can hunt us down and trap us too.<BR>
	<BR>
Thanks to the intrinsic power of these photographs and the sure hand with which they were chosen, the ultimate aim of the Geneva Conventions, summarized, explained and put into historical perspective by Mich&egrave;le Mercier, becomes self-evident and will certainly be a revelation to the lay reader. Moreover, the texts which accompany the pictures - extracts from family messages, from prisoners' letters and from reports and notes written by ICRC delegates - illustrate better than any treatise the real psychological and physical impact of international humanitarian law. <I>Focus on humanity</I> embodies moral principles which concern each and everyone of us. It brings home to us the fragility of our flesh and of our dignity as individuals in the face of man's destructive violence. But it is also a tribute to all the men and women whose unflagging work in the field is carried out with the energy of those who never feel resignation or give in to despair.<BR>

<H2>La XXVIe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge : mythe et r&eacute;alit&eacute;</H2>
<P><I>par Yves Sandoz</I>
<P>
<P><I>A Gen&egrave;ve, du 4 au 7 D&eacute;cembre 1995</I><BR>
	<BR>
La XXVIe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, attendue depuis si longtemps, a pris une dimension presque mythique au sein de notre Mouvement. On en parle un peu comme le soldat cantonn&eacute; dans un fort attendant les Tartares dans un fameux livre de Dino Buzzati (<I>Le d&eacute;sert des Tartares</I>): avec un m&eacute;lange d'espoir et d'appr&eacute;hension.<BR>

<P>Essayons, lucidement, d'analyser l'un et l'autre.<BR>
	<BR>
	<BR>

<H3><B>I. Les espoirs suscit&eacute;s par la Conf&eacute;rence internationale</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. S'unir en faveur des personnes vuln&eacute;rables</B><BR>

<P>Le progr&egrave;s technique extraordinaire et la croissance d&eacute;mographique galopante qui ont marqu&eacute; notre si&egrave;cle nous obligent &agrave; un constat: l'homme n'a pas r&eacute;ussi &agrave; g&eacute;rer ces d&eacute;veloppements au b&eacute;n&eacute;fice de l'ensemble de l'humanit&eacute; et il y a toujours plus de personnes dans la mis&egrave;re, toujours davantage de personnes vuln&eacute;rables ou exclues de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, qui ont besoin d'aide et de compassion.<BR>

<P>La mission fondamentale du Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge en faveur de ces personnes vuln&eacute;rables, en temps de conflit arm&eacute; d'abord, mais en toutes circonstances ensuite, reste donc aujourd'hui essentielle.<BR>

<P>Le plus grand espoir que la Conf&eacute;rence suscite est intimement li&eacute; &agrave; cette situation et &agrave; la vocation premi&egrave;re de cette Conf&eacute;rence: il s'agit de renouer, ou plut&ocirc;t de relancer et d'approfondir, le dialogue entre les Etats et notre Mouvement afin d'examiner comment les uns et les autres peuvent au mieux conjuguer leurs efforts pour am&eacute;liorer le sort de cette immense masse de personnes qui ne disposent pas de l'essentiel et dont la vie est souvent un calvaire sans espoir. Nous pouvons et nous devons faire plus. Nous pouvons et nous devons mieux collaborer. La Conf&eacute;rence est l'occasion d'y r&eacute;fl&eacute;chir, d'ouvrir des voies.<BR>

<P><B>2. Att&eacute;nuer et pr&eacute;venir les crises</B><BR>

<P>La communaut&eacute; internationale donne aujourd'hui l'impression de courir d'une crise &agrave; l'autre et de s'essouffler &agrave; tenter, sans moyens suffisants, de colmater des br&egrave;ches toujours plus b&eacute;antes. Le d&eacute;sarroi s'empare des peuples dont aucun n'est totalement &agrave; l'abri de ces crises ou de leurs effets, avec la cons&eacute;quence tragique de susciter des mouvements de repli sur soi-m&ecirc;me: on pr&eacute;f&egrave;re ignorer ce que l'on ne parvient pas &agrave; ma&icirc;triser. La compassion se dirige vers l'imm&eacute;diat, l'insupportable, ce que montrent les m&eacute;dias, justement parce que c'est insupportable et qu'il faut bien se donner le sentiment d'agir, mais cela au d&eacute;triment de ceux que l'on ne montre plus - des victimes oubli&eacute;es - et de la r&eacute;flexion &agrave; plus long terme.<BR>

<P>L'ambition de la Conf&eacute;rence est donc aussi de reprendre cette r&eacute;flexion sur un plan plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, d'examiner ce qui peut &ecirc;tre entrepris pour att&eacute;nuer, voire pr&eacute;venir les crises.<BR>

<P><B>a) Att&eacute;nuer les crises</B><BR>

<P>Att&eacute;nuer les crises, c'est, tout d'abord, faire mieux respecter le droit international humanitaire lors des conflits arm&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>La r&eacute;union d'un groupe d'experts intergouvernemental ouvert &agrave; l'ensemble des Etats, convoqu&eacute;e par le gouvernement suisse conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la demande faite, en 1993, par la Conf&eacute;rence internationale pour la protection des victimes de la guerre, s'est pench&eacute;e sur cette question de mani&egrave;re approfondie. Les recommandations de ces experts seront soumises &agrave; l'approbation de la XXVIe Conf&eacute;rence. Certains experts auraient souhait&eacute; qu'elles soient plus &quot;muscl&eacute;es&quot; et on peut les comprendre, tant certaines situations actuelles n&eacute;cessitent une r&eacute;action &eacute;nergique de la communaut&eacute; internationale.<BR>

<P>Mais ces recommandations, qui mettent l'accent sur la pr&eacute;vention et les mesures &agrave; prendre sur le plan national en temps de paix d&eacute;j&agrave; - adoption de lois nationales, effort accru pour la diffusion du droit humanitaire, notamment au sein des forces arm&eacute;es, cr&eacute;ation de commissions interminist&eacute;rielles, etc. - peuvent am&eacute;liorer consid&eacute;rablement la situation <I>pour peu qu'elles soient prises au s&eacute;rieux et suivies d'effets.</I> Le CICR surtout, vu son r&ocirc;le traditionnel et statutaire dans ce domaine, mais aussi les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et leur F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale sont abondamment cit&eacute;s et sollicit&eacute;s. Il est important qu'ils r&eacute;pondent &agrave; la confiance plac&eacute;e en eux, qu'ils affirment leur disponibilit&eacute; et qu'ils exploitent au maximum les ouvertures qui leur sont faites. Mais il s'agit aussi, et peut-&ecirc;tre surtout, d'inciter les Etats &agrave; investir de l'&eacute;nergie et des moyens dans ces t&acirc;ches pr&eacute;ventives peu spectaculaires mais qui peuvent, si elles sont prises au s&eacute;rieux, am&eacute;liorer consid&eacute;rablement le sort des victimes de la guerre. [1]<BR>

<P>Une meilleure gestion et une meilleure compr&eacute;hension de l'action humanitaire devraient &eacute;galement permettre d'att&eacute;nuer l'effet des crises. D'o&ugrave; l'id&eacute;e de poursuivre la r&eacute;flexion sur le droit des victimes &agrave; l'assistance humanitaire et sur les r&egrave;gles &quot;d&eacute;ontologiques&quot; que devraient observer les organisations humanitaires engag&eacute;es dans l'aide humanitaire d'urgence. Le code de conduite &eacute;labor&eacute; par la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale en collaboration avec le CICR et diverses organisations non gouvernementales sera notamment soumis &agrave; l'examen de la Conf&eacute;rence dans cette perspective, de m&ecirc;me que des questions li&eacute;es &agrave; la s&eacute;curit&eacute; de l'action humanitaire.<BR>

<P><B>b) Pr&eacute;venir les crises</B><BR>

<P>La pr&eacute;vention des crises est un domaine beaucoup plus vaste en ce qu'il touche aux racines de celles-ci, &agrave; leurs causes profondes, tels la mis&egrave;re et le sous-d&eacute;veloppement, la croissance d&eacute;mographique non ma&icirc;tris&eacute;e, la criminalit&eacute; organis&eacute;e ou la corruption.<BR>

<P>Notre Mouvement doit rester modeste quant &agrave; sa capacit&eacute; de contribuer &agrave; r&eacute;soudre de tels probl&egrave;mes. Mais il n'est pas sans atout, dont les deux principaux sont le r&eacute;seau de ses Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et ses principes fondamentaux.<BR>

<P>Un r&eacute;seau de Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales qui s'&eacute;tend dans le monde entier (principe d'universalit&eacute;), dispos&eacute;es &agrave; travailler pour les personnes les plus vuln&eacute;rables (principe d'humanit&eacute;), sans discrimination d'aucune sorte (principe d'impartialit&eacute;) et sans se m&ecirc;ler des querelles politiques (principe de neutralit&eacute;), n'est-ce pas l&agrave; ce qui r&eacute;pond pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment au besoin tr&egrave;s actuel de s'occuper sans arri&egrave;re-pens&eacute;e de ceux dont la mis&egrave;re insupportable est in&eacute;vitablement le ferment des tensions, des crises et des guerres?<BR>

<P>A cet &eacute;gard la mission et le r&ocirc;le des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales en faveur des cat&eacute;gories les plus vuln&eacute;rables de la population, tels les r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s, les enfants de la rue ou les sid&eacute;ens, devront &ecirc;tre rappel&eacute;s et pr&eacute;cis&eacute;s. La Conf&eacute;rence internationale est donc aussi une occasion unique de faire mieux saisir l'utilit&eacute; de ce r&eacute;seau, d'affiner la collaboration entre les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et les gouvernements. Ces derniers doivent comprendre leur int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; soutenir les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales sans nuire &agrave; leur ind&eacute;pendance, sans chercher &agrave; les utiliser &agrave; des fins politiciennes et, donc, sans miner le cr&eacute;dit dont elles doivent jouir aupr&egrave;s de ceux qu'elles ont pour mission d'aider.<BR>

<P>Mais la Conf&eacute;rence permet aussi &agrave; notre Mouvement de faire lui-m&ecirc;me preuve de dynamisme par rapport &agrave; sa propre mission, insuffisamment accomplie, de d&eacute;velopper l'ensemble des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales. En promouvant le r&eacute;seau des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales comme un instrument essentiel de l'aide aux plus vuln&eacute;rables et, par l&agrave;, de la pr&eacute;vention des crises, notre Mouvement doit aussi d&eacute;montrer sa volont&eacute; de d&eacute;velopper la solidarit&eacute; interne entre ses membres et de revitaliser les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, nombreuses h&eacute;las, dont l'&eacute;tat est encore tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;caire.<BR>

<P><B>3. Mobiliser le public</B><BR>

<P>Le public doit comprendre et soutenir l'action de notre Mouvement. Cette compr&eacute;hension est indispensable car la plupart des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales fondent leur action sur le b&eacute;n&eacute;volat et sur les contributions priv&eacute;es. Mais elle est aussi n&eacute;cessaire par le fait que l'image publique des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales compte beaucoup pour les gouvernements appel&eacute;s &agrave; soutenir le travail de celles-ci. Il y a donc une dynamique qui doit se d&eacute;velopper entre une action efficace aupr&egrave;s des personnes les plus vuln&eacute;rables, la sympathie du public pour cette action et le soutien des gouvernements.<BR>

<P>La Conf&eacute;rence en elle-m&ecirc;me n'est pas mobilisatrice et pourrait m&ecirc;me avoir un effet n&eacute;gatif tant il est vrai qu'une certaine lassitude gagne le public face &agrave; de grands rassemblements, co&ucirc;teux, dont on a peine &agrave; mesurer l'impact.<BR>

<P>Mais c'est la substance trait&eacute;e qui doit &ecirc;tre l'occasion, dans tous les pays, de rappeler le sort tragique des victimes et l'action de notre Mouvement pour leur venir en aide. Il a &eacute;t&eacute; jug&eacute; important, &agrave; cet effet, de parler des probl&egrave;mes concrets li&eacute;s &agrave; la protection de la population civile pendant les conflits arm&eacute;s, des exactions dont sont victimes les femmes, des drames v&eacute;cus par des milliers d'enfants, du probl&egrave;me crucial de l'eau, de la famine, &eacute;troitement li&eacute;s aux d&eacute;placements de population, de la dispersion scandaleuse des mines antipersonnel. La Conf&eacute;rence internationale est aussi une occasion de t&eacute;moigner, d'expliquer, de susciter des &eacute;lans de sympathie, de contribuer &agrave; faire refuser l'inacceptable.<BR>
	<BR>
	<BR>

<H3><B>II. Les appr&eacute;hensions face &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Les disputes sur la participation</B><BR>

<P>Les d&eacute;bats houleux et m&eacute;diatis&eacute;s ayant, en 1986, conduit &agrave; l'expulsion de la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation sud-africaine sont encore dans les m&eacute;moires de nombreuses Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales qui furent touch&eacute;es, de plein fouet, par l'impact n&eacute;gatif de ces &eacute;v&eacute;nements sur leur opinion publique.<BR>

<P>La crise provoqu&eacute;e par le report <I>sine die</I>, en derni&egrave;re minute, de la Conf&eacute;rence pr&eacute;vue &agrave; Budapest en 1991, faute d'un accord sur la forme d'une participation palestinienne, n'a, quant &agrave; elle, pas &eacute;t&eacute; oubli&eacute;e par les gouvernements, dont certains hauts repr&eacute;sentants s'&eacute;taient d&eacute;plac&eacute;s en vain.<BR>

<P>Ni les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, ni les gouvernements n'accepteraient sereinement la r&eacute;p&eacute;tition de tels &eacute;v&eacute;nements, qui pourraient conduire &agrave; une remise en cause fondamentale de la Conf&eacute;rence.<BR>

<P>M&ecirc;me si l'on ne pourra jamais se pr&eacute;munir &agrave; coup s&ucirc;r contre l'&eacute;mergence d'incidents de nature politique, dont le risque est inh&eacute;rent &agrave; toute r&eacute;union pr&eacute;tendant rassembler les Etats, tout doit donc &ecirc;tre mis en oeuvre pour &eacute;viter de tels incidents. L'identification des probl&egrave;mes potentiels a &eacute;t&eacute; entreprise et un dialogue, qui va aller s'approfondissant, s'est engag&eacute; avec les gouvernements, &agrave; travers un groupe d'ambassadeurs d&eacute;sign&eacute;s par la Commission permanente de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et avec les Etats et entit&eacute;s directement int&eacute;ress&eacute;s. Aucun probl&egrave;me n'appara&icirc;t insurmontable dans le contexte actuel, mais on ne saurait sous-estimer les difficult&eacute;s ni n&eacute;gliger d'approfondir toutes les questions ouvertes.<BR>

<P><B>2. Les querelles politiques lors de la Conf&eacute;rence</B><BR>

<P>La tentation est grande, notamment par les Etats ou entit&eacute;s engag&eacute;s dans un diff&eacute;rend politique ou militaire, d'utiliser le forum de la Conf&eacute;rence internationale comme une tribune pour d&eacute;fendre leurs points de vue et pour mettre en cause leurs adversaires.<BR>

<P>Le cadre de la Conf&eacute;rence et sa bri&egrave;vet&eacute; ne se pr&ecirc;tent pas &agrave; de tels r&egrave;glements de compte qui peuvent, par l'engrenage des droits de r&eacute;ponse, rapidement empoisonner l'atmosph&egrave;re de la Conf&eacute;rence, voire remettre en cause l'ensemble de ses r&eacute;sultats. En effet, de telles querelles se r&eacute;percutent in&eacute;vitablement sur l'esprit de consensus n&eacute;cessaire &agrave; l'adoption de r&eacute;solutions sur les questions abord&eacute;es &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence.<BR>

<P>&quot;Laissez vos couteaux au vestiaire&quot;: la fameuse formule du g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Gaulle a donc toute sa pertinence dans le cadre des Conf&eacute;rences internationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, qui ne sauraient pr&eacute;tendre r&eacute;gler des situations concr&egrave;tes, ni m&ecirc;me en d&eacute;battre en profondeur.<BR>

<P>Il est donc important de convaincre l'ensemble des participants &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence d'utiliser celle-ci pour ce qu'elle peut &ecirc;tre: un lieu de d&eacute;bat et de progr&egrave;s pour l'action humanitaire et la protection des personnes les plus vuln&eacute;rables de notre plan&egrave;te, et non comme le tremplin d'une cause politique. Ce message doit clairement passer lors de la phase pr&eacute;paratoire de la Conf&eacute;rence.<BR>

<P>Une gestion claire et ferme des d&eacute;bats pendant la Conf&eacute;rence peut &eacute;galement contribuer &agrave; surmonter cet &eacute;cueil.<BR>

<P><B>3. L'abondance de la mati&egrave;re</B><BR>

<P>Beaucoup de participants ont un souci, compr&eacute;hensible et l&eacute;gitime, d'utiliser au mieux ce dialogue tant attendu, de ne pas laisser &eacute;chapper cette occasion. Mais, comme une famille qui se retrouve apr&egrave;s une longue absence, il y a tant &agrave; dire qu'on risque de ne plus se comprendre. Il est donc n&eacute;cessaire d'op&eacute;rer des choix.<BR>

<P>Le nombre de participants et la bri&egrave;vet&eacute; du temps &agrave; disposition imposent en effet des contraintes tr&egrave;s rigoureuses dans la gestion de la Conf&eacute;rence.<BR>

<P>La Commission permanente a pris la d&eacute;cision d'organiser le travail de fond de la Conf&eacute;rence dans deux Commissions qui si&egrave;gent simultan&eacute;ment. Certaines en auraient souhait&eacute; davantage pour pouvoir parler de plus de sujets mais de nombreuses d&eacute;l&eacute;gations n'auraient alors pas &eacute;t&eacute; repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es dans toutes les Commissions. Ces d&eacute;l&eacute;gations auraient pu, d&egrave;s lors, remettre en cause, dans la s&eacute;ance pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re finale, le travail &eacute;labor&eacute; dans ces Commissions. Certaines d&eacute;l&eacute;gations ne sont d'ailleurs m&ecirc;me pas &eacute;quip&eacute;es pour travailler parall&egrave;lement dans deux Commissions et il sera important que cet inconv&eacute;nient soit partiellement surmont&eacute; par une collaboration r&eacute;gionale et par un dialogue approfondi dans la phase pr&eacute;paratoire de la Conf&eacute;rence.<BR>

<P>La Commission permanente a aussi d&eacute;cid&eacute; de ne pas avoir plus de deux th&egrave;mes de substance par Commission pour laisser &agrave; toutes les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations qui le souhaitent le temps mat&eacute;riel de s'exprimer. C'est &eacute;galement l&agrave; une contrainte indispensable qui impose le choix de certaines priorit&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>La mati&egrave;re retenue &agrave; ce stade reste cependant tr&egrave;s riche et abondante car les th&egrave;mes choisis sont de grande envergure. [2]<BR>

<P>Des suggestions compl&eacute;mentaires peuvent encore &ecirc;tre faites par les participants mais il est important que chacun d'eux prenne en compte, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, les contraintes &eacute;voqu&eacute;es ci-dessus.<BR>

<P>Une n&eacute;gociation pr&eacute;alable approfondie avec l'ensemble des participants sera par ailleurs indispensable pour qu'un accord puisse se dessiner au sujet des d&eacute;cisions que l'on peut attendre de la Conf&eacute;rence sur ces grands th&egrave;mes. Cela devrait &eacute;galement permettre aux participants de concentrer leurs interventions, qui devront &ecirc;tre br&egrave;ves, sur les points qu'ils jugent essentiels.<BR>

<P>Beaucoup de mati&egrave;re, beaucoup de monde et peu de temps: chaque participant devra se sentir responsable de r&eacute;soudre cette &eacute;quation, dont les donn&eacute;es ne sont pas modifiables!<BR>
	<BR>
	<BR>

<H3><B>III. Conclusion</B></H3>
<P>	<BR>
La Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge ne doit susciter ni illusion ni appr&eacute;hension mais doit &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;par&eacute;e s&eacute;rieusement pour qu'elle puisse, dans la s&eacute;r&eacute;nit&eacute;, remplir les objectifs que l'on est en droit d'esp&eacute;rer.<BR>

<P>La lutte en faveur des victimes de la guerre et des personnes les plus vuln&eacute;rables de notre plan&egrave;te est de tr&egrave;s longue haleine et nous n'en verrons pas la fin. Ne demandons donc pas &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence plus qu'elle ne peut donner.<BR>

<P>Ce que l'on doit attendre d'elle, en revanche, c'est qu'elle mette en relief des situations et des actions intol&eacute;rables; qu'elle identifie, par rapport &agrave; ces situations, des mesures propres, dans le court comme dans le long terme, &agrave; am&eacute;liorer le sort des personnes vuln&eacute;rables; et qu'elle prenne, enfin, des engagements fermes quant aux moyens n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; la r&eacute;alisation de ces mesures.<BR>

<P>La Conf&eacute;rence doit donc avoir &agrave; la fois une ambition mobilisatrice pour l'ensemble des peuples, qui doivent y voir l'occasion d'exprimer leur solidarit&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de ceux qui souffrent, et le souci de parvenir &agrave; des engagements pr&eacute;cis sur des points o&ugrave; des progr&egrave;s paraissent possibles.<BR>

<P>Pour atteindre ces deux objectifs, il faut prot&eacute;ger la Conf&eacute;rence de querelles politiques ou partisanes et les gouvernements doivent &agrave; tout prix, par leur aide dans la phase pr&eacute;paratoire et par leur attitude pendant la Conf&eacute;rence, contribuer &agrave; le faire.<BR>

<P>Mais le succ&egrave;s de la Conf&eacute;rence d&eacute;pend encore davantage de l'attitude de l'ensemble de notre Mouvement.<BR>

<P>C'est lui qui doit mobiliser le public et les gouvernements dans tous les pays du monde en profitant de la Conf&eacute;rence pour d&eacute;fendre ceux qu'il cherche &agrave; aider, en suscitant soutien et sympathie pour son action.<BR>

<P>Et c'est encore lui qui doit faire souffler sur la Conf&eacute;rence un esprit particulier, celui de notre Mouvement, qui doit faire de cette Conf&eacute;rence un &eacute;v&eacute;nement hors du commun, diff&eacute;rent des forums diplomatiques ordinaires.<BR>

<P>Notre Mouvement y parviendra s'il est solide et uni, non pas en cachant sa diversit&eacute; mais au contraire en expliquant la force de sa compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute;. Il pourra alors aborder sereinement la Conf&eacute;rence, qui doit &ecirc;tre per&ccedil;ue par tous les participants comme un &eacute;v&eacute;nement constructif, tourn&eacute; vers l'avenir.<BR>

<P>C'est en se pr&eacute;parant dans cet esprit que notre Mouvement contribuera, avec les gouvernements, &agrave; la r&eacute;ussite de ce rendez-vous, porteur d'espoir.<BR>

<H2>XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja:  bolet&iacute;n diario n 4</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Finalizan los trabajos de la Comisi&oacute;n I</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Los trabajos de la Comisi&oacute;n I concluyeron al final de la ma&ntilde;ana del mi&eacute;rcoles 6 de diciembre con las alocuciones de los representantes del Comit&eacute; Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja. Ambos agradecieron sinceramente a las delegaciones sus importantes contribuciones y felicitaron al presidente de la delegaci&oacute;n por la manera en que gui&oacute; los debates.<BR>

<P>Los representantes de las dos instituciones ginebrinas destacaron con satisfacci&oacute;n que las recomendaciones del grupo de expertos contaron con el amplio apoyo de las delegaciones que hicieron uso de la palabra. &Eacute;stas condenaron la violaci&oacute;n y las agresiones sexuales, as&iacute; como la participaci&oacute;n de ni&ntilde;os en las hostilidades. Pidieron la prohibici&oacute;n total de la utilizaci&oacute;n de minas terrestres antipersonal. Adem&aacute;s, todas las delegaciones se comprometieron a buscar la manera de llevar a la pr&aacute;ctica el derecho internacional humanitario, especialmente a trav&eacute;s de una mayor difusi&oacute;n entre las fuerzas armadas de sus respectivos pa&iacute;ses y entre la poblaci&oacute;n en general.<BR>

<P>Por &uacute;ltimo, varias delegaciones comunicaron sus observaciones al comit&eacute; de redacci&oacute;n para la preparaci&oacute;n de las resoluciones definitivas, que deben ser presentadas en la sesi&oacute;n plenaria del jueves, 7 de diciembre.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Finalizan los trabajos de la Comisi&oacute;n II</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Durante la &uacute;ltima sesi&oacute;n de labores de la Comisi&oacute;n II, numerosos participantes insistieron nuevamente en la necesidad de movilizar recursos humanos y financieros, para prestar asistencia a las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables tanto dentro de la colectividad como en situaciones de crisis. La condici&oacute;n de &eacute;stas &uacute;ltimas, cuyo n&uacute;mero aumenta sin cesar en el mundo, no est&aacute; &uacute;nicamente vinculada a la pobreza sino, y sobre todo, a la ignorancia, por lo que es preciso desplegar esfuerzos particularmente intensos en el &aacute;mbito de la educaci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Se reafirm&oacute; la importancia de la integridad de las Sociedades Nacionales y de su independencia, as&iacute; como de la cooperaci&oacute;n regional en materia de desarrollo. Se puso de relieve una vez m&aacute;s la necesidad de reforzar su capacidad para cumplir eficazmente su labor humanitaria en favor de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables. A este respecto, se propuso una modificaci&oacute;n al proyecto de resoluci&oacute;n para que la Federaci&oacute;n pudiese estar informada de todas las medidas adoptadas de consuno por las Sociedades Nacionales y sus respectivos gobiernos en materia de desarrollo.<BR>

<P>Se destac&oacute; la participaci&oacute;n activa de los j&oacute;venes en los programas del Movimiento. Su opini&oacute;n deber&iacute;a escucharse, declar&oacute; un representante de Sociedad Nacional. Se propuso tambi&eacute;n que se intensificara la colaboraci&oacute;n del Movimiento con las Naciones Unidas y que se prestara mayor atenci&oacute;n a las cat&aacute;strofes tecnol&oacute;gicas y a la protecci&oacute;n del medio ambiente, a cuyo respecto convendr&iacute;a adoptar medidas preventivas. Al igual que ayer, los participantes respaldaron ampliamente los proyectos de resoluci&oacute;n de la Comisi&oacute;n, reafirmando su deber de solidaridad para con las poblaciones vulnerables. Algunas Sociedades Nacionales pidieron a los donantes que incrementaran su contribuci&oacute;n para que pudieran brindar mayor protecci&oacute;n a los menos favorecidos. Algunos participantes insistieron en que el Movimiento deb&iacute;a recordar a los gobiernos su obligaci&oacute;n de autorizar a las instituciones de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja a cumplir con su deber de socorrer a las v&iacute;ctimas en forma neutral e imparcial. Pese a lo ingente de la tarea y a la complejidad cada vez mayor de las situaciones de emergencia, uno de los oradores declar&oacute; que era preciso abogar sin tregua en favor de las v&iacute;ctimas de las cat&aacute;strofes. Otros oradores preguntaron si el sufrimiento infligido a los m&aacute;s vulnerables con las sanciones econ&oacute;micas era un medio leg&iacute;timo de ejercer presi&oacute;n sobre los dirigentes pol&iacute;ticos.<BR>

<P>Al finalizar las intervenciones de los representantes de las Sociedades Nacionales, los gobiernos y los observadores, el relator de la Comisi&oacute;n present&oacute; a grandes rasgos el informe de la Comisi&oacute;n, que trazar&aacute; ma&ntilde;ana. A continuaci&oacute;n, un representante de la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional, tras agradecer a los delegados el respaldo a la labor de la Federaci&oacute;n, record&oacute; a los gobiernos la importancia de fortalecer la Sociedad Nacional de sus respectivos pa&iacute;ses y de promover la independencia de la asistencia humanitaria. Un representante del CICR record&oacute; la necesidad de difundir el derecho internacional humanitario y respald&oacute;, tambi&eacute;n, una modificaci&oacute;n a los proyectos de resoluci&oacute;n, en la cual se exhorta al establecimiento de un grupo de expertos sobre la disociaci&oacute;n entre la acci&oacute;n humanitaria y las actividades de &iacute;ndole econ&oacute;mica y pol&iacute;tica. S&oacute;lo con los actos se alivia a las v&iacute;ctimas, declar&oacute;.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Segunda sesi&oacute;n plenaria</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Durante la segunda sesi&oacute;n plenaria, del 6 de diciembre, se adopt&oacute; a la unanimidad una enmienda a los Estatutos y al Reglamento del Movimiento, por la que se sustituyen en esos textos toda referencia a la &quot;Liga de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja&quot; por &quot;Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja&quot;. Esta modificaci&oacute;n se hab&iacute;a aprobado ya en Asamblea General de la Federaci&oacute;n, celebrada en 1991.<BR>
Se adoptaron por aclamaci&oacute;n el informe de la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente y el informe de la Comisi&oacute;n Paritaria del Fondo de la Emperatriz Sh&ocirc;ken.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Elecci&oacute;n de cinco miembros de la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente</B></H4>
<P>
<P>En la segunda sesi&oacute;n plenaria de la Conferencia, celebrada el mi&eacute;rcoles, 6 de diciembre por la tarde, los delegados eligieron a los cinco miembros de la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente procedentes de las Sociedades Nacionales. Cabe recordar que integran esta Comisi&oacute;n nueve miembros: dos miembros del CICR, dos miembros de la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional y cinco miembros de Sociedades Nacionales.<BR>

<P>La presidenta de la Conferencia record&oacute; r&aacute;pidamente el procedimiento para la votaci&oacute;n. Cada Sociedad Nacional emite un voto, al igual que cada Estado Parte en los Convenios de Ginebra. La Federaci&oacute;n Internacional y el CICR emiten un voto cada uno. En la primera vuelta, se elige a los candidatos por mayor&iacute;a absoluta. Se presentaron a la elecci&oacute;n trece candidatos; se distribuyeron 299 papeletas y se recogieron 289, todas ellas v&aacute;lidas. En la primera vuelta resultaron elegidos cuatro candidatos, a saber:<BR>

<P><B>	s.a.r.</B> la Princesa Margriet de los Pa&iacute;ses Bajos (Cruz Roja Neerlandesa), con 219 votos;<BR>
	la Sra. Christina Magnuson (Cruz Roja Sueca), con 173 votos;<BR>
	el Dr. Rueda Monta&ntilde;a (Cruz Roja Colombiana), con 162 votos; y<BR>
	el Sr. Tadateru Konoe (Cruz Roja Japonesa), con 161 votos.<BR>

<P>En la segunda vuelta se reeligi&oacute; al Dr. Byron Ruben Hove (Cruz Roja de Zimbabue), con 123 votos.<BR>

<P><B>Notas biogr&aacute;ficas</B><BR>

<P>A la edad de 23 a&ntilde;os, la <B>Princesa Margriet de los Pa&iacute;ses Bajos </B>entr&oacute; a formar parte de la Cruz Roja  y termin&oacute; los estudios de enfermera auxiliar.

<H4><B>Geurra civil en Lokaya</B></H4>
<P>
<P>La Cruz Roja Noruega ha concebido un programa inform&aacute;tico interactivo y de car&aacute;cter humanitario constituido por una base de datos, diversos pasatiempos y un juego de escenificaci&oacute;n. La idea consiste en representar el papel de un personaje que pertenece a un grupo &eacute;tnico minoritario y examinar diversas hip&oacute;tesis para intentar de resolver una crisis humanitaria.<BR>

<P>El h&eacute;roe de esta historia se llama Jakac, tiene 17 a&ntilde;os y vive en el pa&iacute;s imaginario de Lokaya, que se encuentra inmerso en enfrentamientos y conflictos internos entre varios grupos &eacute;tnicos. El muchacho decide partir en busca de su padre, de quien no tiene noticias desde su secuestro, y nos lleva con &eacute;l en sus innumerables peripecias. En una de las situaciones, por ejemplo, Jakac tropieza con la incomprensi&oacute;n de la polic&iacute;a y se ve obligado a arregl&aacute;rselas solo, sin ayuda de ninguna organizaci&oacute;n internacional.<BR>

<P>Este programa, que se titula Human Quest I, tiene gran inter&eacute;s did&aacute;ctico. El banco de datos asociado contiene todo tipo de informaci&oacute;n acerca de los derechos fundamentales de la persona y de las consecuencias de su transgresi&oacute;n. Tambi&eacute;n ofrece al usuario abundantes datos sobre las caracter&iacute;sticas de los pa&iacute;ses sumidos en conflictos internos. <BR>

<P>El programa viene con un manual de utilizaci&oacute;n y un folleto con numerosos art&iacute;culos y temas de debate. Se trata de un instrumento pedag&oacute;gico de suma utilidad para los profesores, ya que les permite sensibilizar a sus alumnos acerca del respeto de la dignidad humana. Tambi&eacute;n pueden usarlo las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja para la difusi&oacute;n del derecho internacional humanitario.<BR>

<P>En la entrada del Centro de Conferencias, cerca del rinc&oacute;n del lector, podr&aacute;n encontrar a una representante de la Cruz Roja Noruega que les presentar&aacute; con agrado todas las ventajas de este programa.<BR>

<P>Adem&aacute;s, la XXVI Conferencia Internacional est&aacute; conectada directamente al Foro CompuServe, en el que participan usuarios en todo el mundo. &Eacute;stos pueden formular preguntas a las que responden los expertos del Movimiento desde Ginebra, por medio de sus ordenadores.<BR>

<P><B>Este bolet&iacute;n solo tiene car&aacute;cter informativo y no constituye un documento oficial.</B>

<P>
<H2>Prosecution of suspected war criminals in Switzerland</H2>
<P><I>By J&uuml;rg van Wijnkoop</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>J&uuml;rg van Wijnkoop</I></B><I>, [3] Head of Military Justice of the Swiss Armed Forces</I><BR>

<P><I>Legal bases</I><BR>

<P>By ratifying the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Switzerland undertook to supplement its national legislation accordingly. Its subsequent revision of the Swiss military penal code [1] in 1950, though certainly prompt, was half-hearted. It was not until 1 March 1968, when a broader revision came into force, that national legislation was fully adapted to meet the requirements laid down in those Conventions: <BR>

<P>-	the scope of application of Swiss criminal law was extended to cover all armed conflicts within the meaning of international conventions;<BR>

<P>-	civilians who commit offences against international law in the event of armed conflict were explicitly made liable to military jurisdiction it is thereby clearly established that Switzerland, or more specifically the military justice authorities, must prosecute violations of international humanitarian law even if the offence is committed outside Switzerland by nationals (civilians or members of the armed forces) of another country.<BR>

<P>Although surrender to an international tribunal or extradition to another State takes precedence over prosecution at the national level, extradition is not admissible or possible in all cases. Moreover, in certain circumstances a State interested in prosecution may, for political reasons or because it does not have a functioning legal system, decide not to present an extradition request.<BR>

<P><I>Procedure</I><BR>

<P>The preliminary investigation and criminal proceedings are governed by the procedural provisions of military penal law. We thus have a modern judicial procedure that corresponds to the requirements of a constitutional State and is uniform throughout Switzerland.<BR>

<P>The elucidation of presumed war crimes is entrusted to specially trained and documented examining magistrates if necessary, teams consisting of several such magistrates are set up.<BR>

<P>For the preliminary investigation two courses may be taken: the <I>provisional gathering of evidence and the </I><BR>
<I>preliminary hearing.</I> The provisional gathering of evidence serves to establish the facts discreetly and without the knowledge of the person concerned, and is warranted, for instance, when the evidence is as yet inconclusive or the suspicion itself is largely unsubstantiated. The preliminary hearing is ordered when the suspicion is or has become firm enough for the suspect to be confronted outright with the evidence against him.<BR>

<P>In all cases of presumed war crimes it must be assumed that the suspect will attempt to flee. Every effort is therefore made to carry out the preliminary investigation without publicity so as to avoid making arrests which might subsequently prove unjustified. If, however, a suspicion becomes common knowledge prematurely, the arrest must be made even if the evidence is still inadequate, so that the investigating authority cannot be reproached for having simply let a presumed war criminal go free.<BR>

<P><I>Particular problems in practice </I><BR>

<P>Criminal prosecutions as we know them in Switzerland normally begin with the recording of facts by the police. Clues are secured, photographs taken, diagrams drawn, witnesses heard and all other appropriate measures adopted. The crime is known, and the hunt for the person who committed it begins.<BR>

<P>In the prosecution of presumed war crimes the starting point is completely different: in a nutshell, the perpetrator is known or believed to be known, and the attempt is made to prove that he did commit a crime.<BR>

<P>In such cases, most of the usual methods of investigation are not available. Instead the presentation of evidence must be confined almost entirely to the <I>examination of witnesses</I>. Even in normal circumstances testimony by witnesses is a problematic means of evidence. With regard to presumed war crimes dating back several years or more, it is all the more problematic, particularly since wartime events will have widely dispersed, or led to the death of, possible witnesses.<BR>

<P>The investigation of presumed war crimes is thus extremely difficult and time-consuming. <BR>

<P>For such investigations <I>international cooperation </I>is indispensable. Fortunately, it generally works smoothly. To avoid indirectly endangering relatives of witnesses or suspects, however, special care must be taken when requesting assistance in legal matters from warring States.<BR>

<P>Past experience has shown that the protection of witnesses is particularly important. Witnesses of war crimes are understandably afraid of exposing themselves or members of their families to reprisals if their willingness to testify becomes known. Legislation for the protection of witnesses is therefore being prepared, but for the time being recourse must be had to the means developed by the Swiss Federal Court of Justice and the European Court of Human Rights to protect police officers engaged in covert criminal investigations.<BR>

<P><I>Cooperation with the UN tribunals</I><BR>

<P>The legal basis for close cooperation by the Swiss justice authorities with the UN Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda was created in December 1995 by an urgent federal decree on cooperation with international courts of law to prosecute serious violations of international humanitarian law [2]. In particular, information and evidence can spontaneously be passed on to them. The tribunals, furthermore, now have the possibility of demanding that proceedings pending in Switzerland for violations of international humanitarian law be transferred to their jurisdiction.<BR>

<P>No difficulties whatsoever have arisen to date in the course of cooperation between the Swiss criminal prosecution authorities and the two UN tribunals.<BR>

<H2>Irak : des fonds pour l'eau</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>De plus en plus pr&eacute;occup&eacute; par les probl&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; publique en Irak, le CICR a lanc&eacute; un programme de 5,2 millions de francs suisses pour permettre de continuer &agrave; assurer un approvisionnement minimal en eau potable et d'&eacute;vacuer les eaux us&eacute;es en 1996. Ce programme, qui repose sur les r&eacute;sultats d'une &eacute;tude men&eacute;e en novembre et d&eacute;cembre 1995, est la prolongation d'un projet analogue que le CICR avait ex&eacute;cut&eacute; la m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e.<BR>

<P>Les ing&eacute;nieurs sanitaires du CICR ont choisi sur l'ensemble du pays plus de 60 installations auxquelles des pi&egrave;ces de rechange seront fournies et qui seront remises en service. Onze de ces installations se trouvent dans le nord de l'Irak, neuf &agrave; Bagdad et 42 dans les 13 autres provinces. Le programme de 1995 couvrait quelque 90 stations de traitement et de pompage des eaux. Il sera compl&eacute;t&eacute; dans le courant de 1996, en raison de la longueur des formalit&eacute;s concernant la livraison, l'exp&eacute;dition et les autorisations administratives.<BR>

<P>La participation du CICR aux activit&eacute;s li&eacute;es &agrave; l'eau et &agrave; l'assainissement en Irak ont d&eacute;but&eacute; en mars 1991, imm&eacute;diatement apr&egrave;s la fin des op&eacute;rations militaires. Sur la base d'une premi&egrave;re &eacute;valuation, r&eacute;alis&eacute;e alors que les hostilit&eacute;s &eacute;taient toujours en cours, le CICR a lanc&eacute; plusieurs programmes pour aider les services des eaux irakiens &agrave; r&eacute;tablir un approvisionnement minimal en eau potable. Au cours des six premiers mois de 1991, 7 millions de litres d'eau trait&eacute;e avaient &eacute;t&eacute; distribu&eacute;s dans des poches en plastique dans 70 h&ocirc;pitaux et 40 &eacute;coles o&ugrave; les ing&eacute;nieurs sanitaires du CICR avaient proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; la r&eacute;paration d'installations essentielles.

<H4><B>La Conferencia</B></H4>
<P>
<P>La XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, que se celebrar&aacute; en Ginebra del 3 al 7 de diciembre de 1995, contar&aacute; con la participaci&oacute;n de m&aacute;s de 160 Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, de la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, del Comit&eacute; Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de m&aacute;s de 180 Gobiernos Partes en los Convenios de Ginebra. Las Naciones Unidas, as&iacute; como muchas otras organizaciones gubernamentales y no gubernamentales, asistir&aacute;n a la Conferencia en calidad de observadores.<BR>

<P>Las deliberaciones en torno a los principales temas del momento se realizan en dos comisiones. Cada Comisi&oacute;n propone resoluciones que somete a la Conferencia para su aprobaci&oacute;n. Dichas resoluciones determinan la posici&oacute;n respectiva de los Estados y del Movimiento por lo que respecta a las cuestiones de &iacute;ndole humanitaria de actualidad y, a menudo, influyen en su respuesta a las crisis tanto presentes como futuras. La Comisi&oacute;n I estudiar&aacute; medidas espec&iacute;ficas para mejorar la situaci&oacute;n de las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra y el respeto del derecho internacional humanitario, como se expone a continuaci&oacute;n. La Comisi&oacute;n II se centrar&aacute; en el mejor modo de aplicar ciertos valores y principios universales en la labor cotidiana con el objeto de mejorar la respuesta de la comunidad humanitaria a las crisis (los temas que debatir&aacute; la Comisi&oacute;n II figuran en el folleto Valores humanitarios y reacci&oacute;n anticrisis).<BR>

<P><B>Comis&iacute;on I : las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra y el respecto del derecho internacional humanitario</B><BR>

<P>La Comisi&oacute;n I sobre <B>las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra y el respeto del derecho internacional humanitario</B> abordar&aacute; dos grandes temas.<BR>

<P>El primero, titulado <B>Derecho internacional humanitario: del derecho a la acci&oacute;n</B>, constituye el seguimiento de la Conferencia Internacional para la Protecci&oacute;n de las V&iacute;ctimas de la Guerra, celebrada por iniciativa del Gobierno suizo en 1993. La Conferencia dio lugar a un renovado compromiso de los Estados para rechazar la idea de que las graves y masivas violaciones del derecho humanitario son inevitables. En respuesta a una petici&oacute;n de la Conferencia, el Gobierno suizo estableci&oacute; un Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos que formul&oacute; una serie de recomendaciones pr&aacute;cticas para promover el total respeto del derecho internacional humanitario. La Comisi&oacute;n debatir&aacute; estas recomendaciones con miras a tomar medidas concretas que fortalezcan el cumplimiento del derecho.<BR>

<P>El segundo punto del orden del d&iacute;a, La protecci&oacute;n de la poblaci&oacute;n civil en la guerra, trata sobre las medidas para proteger a las mujeres y a los ni&ntilde;os de los efectos del conflicto; en este contexto, se deliberar&aacute; asimismo sobre las estrategias militares que utilizan la privaci&oacute;n de v&iacute;veres y agua. Entre otros temas, se estudiar&aacute;n tambi&eacute;n los resultados de la Conferencia de Examen de la Convenci&oacute;n de las Naciones Unidas de 1980 sobre Ciertas Armas Convencionales, y medidas adicionales para reducir el sufrimiento que causan las minas terrestres, as&iacute; como una campa&ntilde;a en favor de la prohibici&oacute;n del  empleo de las armas l&aacute;ser que causan ceguera. En cuanto al tema de la reuni&oacute;n de las familias, en la Conferencia se solicitar&aacute; a los Estados que hagan todo lo que est&eacute; en sus manos para resolver los problemas producidos por la ruptura de los lazos familiares y se les instar&aacute; a reconocer y facilitar la labor del Movimiento en la reuni&oacute;n de familias separadas por los conflictos armados, las luchas internas o las cat&aacute;strofes naturales. A fin de promover el derecho internacional humanitario en la guerra mar&iacute;tima, se alentar&aacute; a los Estados a que tengan totalmente en cuenta las disposiciones del Manual de San Remo sobre el derecho humanitario aplicable en los conflictos armados en el mar cuando den instrucciones a sus respectivas fuerzas navales.<BR>

<P>En este folleto se presentan los principales temas que abordar&aacute; la Comisi&oacute;n I, se describen someramente los problemas sobre el terreno y se resumen las propuestas que se someter&aacute;n a estudio en la Conferencia.<BR>

<P><B>La barbarie de nuestra &eacute;poca</B><BR>

<P>La norma jur&iacute;dica es el principio b&aacute;sico de nuestra civilizaci&oacute;n. En v&iacute;speras de un nuevo milenio, debemos tener presente el desarrollo relativamente lento de ciertas normas internacionales, pues no fue sino a finales del siglo XIX que, con la ayuda del Movimiento, se comenz&oacute; a prestar atenci&oacute;n,  a nivel mundial, al derecho internacional humanitario. <BR>

<P>La codificaci&oacute;n de las normas sobre la conducci&oacute;n de las hostilidades representa un rayo de esperanza en cuanto a un futuro m&aacute;s humano para nosotros mismos, nuestros descendientes,  nuestro mundo. La evoluci&oacute;n de este derecho es el fruto de a&ntilde;os de incansables esfuerzos. En la Conferencia Internacional para la Protecci&oacute;n de las V&iacute;ctimas de la Guerra, convocada en 1993 con el objeto de llamar la atenci&oacute;n sobre la necesidad de una mayor observancia del derecho internacional humanitario, los Estados renovaron su compromiso de respetar y hacer respetar este derecho. Ahora bien, este proceso no debe limitarse a las Conferencias y a la expresi&oacute;n de buenas intenciones.<BR>

<P>En estos &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os, el mundo ha visto con espanto como, en pocas semanas, se asesinaban a cientos de miles de hombres, mujeres y ni&ntilde;os en Ruanda. Los informes sobre violaciones de mujeres y limpieza &eacute;tnica sistem&aacute;ticas, en tanto que t&aacute;ctica premeditada y generalizada en esta peque&ntilde;a naci&oacute;n africana y en ex Yugoslavia, por citar dos ejemplos sobradamente conocidos, han estremecido la conciencia internacional. El mundo ha debido enfrentarse a una brutalidad inexplicable en los conflictos en pr&aacute;cticamente cada rinc&oacute;n del planeta. Aunque estos horrores no son precisamente nuevos en los anales de la crueldad humana, las pantallas de televisi&oacute;n nos los muestran casi a diario, produciendo en nosotros una gran preocupaci&oacute;n, ya que reflejan la barbarie de nuestra &eacute;poca. Tenemos la responsabilidad colectiva de ponerles fin.<BR>

<P>Estos horribles actos, lejos de servir de acusaci&oacute;n del derecho humanitario, pueden en realidad reivindicarlo. En general, las disposiciones de derecho bastar&iacute;an para erradicarlos. Es triste reconocer que lo que falta es el conocimiento del derecho y los medios para aplicarlo. El derecho internacional humanitario es vinculante para los Estados. Para que &eacute;ste sea m&aacute;s efectivo,  cada pa&iacute;s, a nivel individual, debe integrarlo en su legislaci&oacute;n nacional. Las leyes nacionales deben reflejar las principales disposiciones de los textos internacionales e introducir medidas represivas, que en la pr&aacute;ctica son todav&iacute;a muy limitadas, para impedir que se produzca un comportamiento inhumano durante el conflicto. Las campa&ntilde;as de difusi&oacute;n destinadas al p&uacute;blico, a los militares y a los funcionarios son igualmente importantes, ya que un derecho que no se conoce, no puede ser efectivo.<BR>

<P>La decisi&oacute;n de la comunidad internacional de constituir tribunales internacionales para que juzguen los cr&iacute;menes de guerra cometidos en Ruanda y en ex Yugoslavia es un claro signo de que este conjunto universal de normas es m&aacute;s actual y necesario que nunca. S&oacute;lo cabe esperar que estos tribunales sean la norma y no la excepci&oacute;n en un futuro pr&oacute;ximo, y que la aplicaci&oacute;n del derecho sea tan sistem&aacute;tica como las normas universales.<BR>

<P>A fin de reducir eficazmente el sufrimiento de las v&iacute;ctimas de los conflictos, el derecho ha de adaptarse constantemente a circunstancias cambiantes. Ello implica un buen control de las nuevas tecnolog&iacute;as. Hemos de hacer todo lo posible para que no se utilicen las armas especialmente crueles o indiscriminadas. Por esta raz&oacute;n, se invitar&aacute; a la Conferencia a adoptar una actitud firme contra el empleo de minas antipersonal y de armas l&aacute;ser que causan ceguera. Una prohibici&oacute;n categ&oacute;rica requerir&iacute;a la elaboraci&oacute;n de nuevos tratados; se espera que la Conferencia logre un importante avance en este sentido.<BR>

<P>El objetivo de garantizar la efectividad del derecho tiene una  crucial importancia en comparaci&oacute;n con otras cuestiones abordadas por la Comisi&oacute;n I: la dif&iacute;cil situaci&oacute;n de las mujeres y los ni&ntilde;os en la guerra, la protecci&oacute;n de las instalaciones de tratamiento del agua y la protecci&oacute;n de los civiles contra la hambruna. Los medios informativos han sacado a la luz recientemente algunas de estas cuestiones, incitados sea por la indignaci&oacute;n internacional ante ciertos actos censurables, sea por organizaciones humanitarias que trabajan sobre el terreno. Otros temas han sido totalmente ignorados, a pesar de la gran necesidad de acci&oacute;n. La Conferencia deber&iacute;a brindar a estas cuestiones toda la atenci&oacute;n que merecen.<BR>

<H4><B>Derecho internacional humanitario</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>Del derecho a la acci&oacute;n</B><BR>

<P>A pesar de los tratados internacionales los cuatro Convenios de Ginebra y sus Protocolos adicionales que constituyen el cuerpo del derecho internacional humanitario el mundo es testigo de un sinf&iacute;n de  atrocidades y horrores cometidos a diario precisamente contra las personas que estos tratados deben proteger. Estas violaciones no significan que las normas son inadecuadas, sino que los l&iacute;deres y los combatientes las desconocen o simplemente prescinden de ellas.  En enero de 1995, a solicitud de  la Conferencia Internacional para la Protecci&oacute;n de las V&iacute;ctimas de la Guerra, un Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos se reuni&oacute; para elaborar un conjunto de recomendaciones pr&aacute;cticas destinadas a promover el pleno respeto del DIH. Tras consultar a la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, el CICR  informar&aacute; acerca de c&oacute;mo ha empezado a poner en pr&aacute;ctica las recomendaciones que conciernen directamente a la Instituci&oacute;n y de c&oacute;mo puede el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja desempe&ntilde;ar su papel.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B><I>Las recomendaciones y su aplicaci&oacute;n</I></B></H4>
<P>
<P><B><I>Facilitar el acceso de los Estados a los instrumentos de derecho internacional humanitario</I></B><I> </I><BR>
<I>El CICR instar&aacute; a todos los Estados que a&uacute;n no lo hayan hecho  a que se adhieran  a los Convenios de Ginebra  y, en particular, a sus Protocolos adicionales. Esta medida se aplicar&aacute; en estrecha colaboraci&oacute;n con la Sociedad Nacional del pa&iacute;s de que se trate.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Determinar las normas consuetudinarias del DIH</I></B><BR>
<I>Recurriendo a distintas fuentes y consultando a expertos jur&iacute;dicos, el CICR determinar&aacute; qu&eacute; normas consuetudinarias pueden aplicarse a los conflictos armados no internacionales, en particular por lo que se refiere a la conducci&oacute;n de las hostilidades.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ofrecer servicios consultivos a los Estados para ayudarles a aplicar el DIH y a difundir sus normas y principios</I></B><BR>
<I>El CICR ya ha creado una estructura para ofrecer servicios consultivos en materia de DIH. El objetivo de estos servicios es prestar asistencia a  los Gobiernos, a fin de que incluyan el DIH en su legislaci&oacute;n nacional, as&iacute; como en los manuales de instrucci&oacute;n militar y difundan sus normas entre el p&uacute;blico en general.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Promover el DIH</I></B><BR>
<I>El CICR incrementar&aacute; su cooperaci&oacute;n con los organismos de las Naciones Unidas, las instituciones especializadas y las  organizaciones zonales para que el p&uacute;blico en general pueda estar mejor informado acerca de las normas fundamentales del DIH.</I><BR>

<P><I>En colaboraci&oacute;n con expertos zonales, el CICR preparar&aacute; un manual de instrucci&oacute;n modelo para  las fuerzas armadas con el fin de promover un comportamiento correcto durante las hostilidades. Esta tarea se llevar&aacute; a cabo en estrecha colaboraci&oacute;n con la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional y las Sociedades Nacionales.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Crear comisiones nacionales para promover la aplicaci&oacute;n y la difusi&oacute;n del DIH</I></B><BR>
<I>Con el apoyo de la Sociedad Nacional de cada pa&iacute;s, se alienta a que los Estados establezcan comisiones nacionales interministeriales destinadas a adoptar medidas y normas concretas para aplicar y difundir el DIH. Para promover el trabajo y la importancia de estas comisiones, el CICR organizar&aacute; una reuni&oacute;n durante la primera mitad de 1996 para los presidentes de las comisiones existentes, as&iacute; como para expertos y representantes de los Gobiernos.</I><BR>
<I>	</I><BR>
<B><I>Intercambio de informaci&oacute;n acerca de la aplicaci&oacute;n y difusi&oacute;n del DIH</I></B><BR>
<I>Se invita a los Estados a que faciliten al CICR informaciones relativas a la aplicaci&oacute;n y difusi&oacute;n  del DIH que puedan servir a otros Estados y que, por consiguiente, contribuyan al cumplimiento de las normas. Con este fin, el CICR est&aacute; creando un centro computarizado de documentaci&oacute;n acerca de los servicios de asesoramiento que est&aacute;n a disposici&oacute;n de todos los Estados, las Sociedades Nacionales y las instituciones especializadas.</I><BR>
<I>	</I><BR>
<B><I>Estudio y financiaci&oacute;n</I></B><BR>
<I>El CICR informar&aacute; con respecto a los &aacute;mbitos que   seg&uacute;n los expertos son motivo de mayor preocupaci&oacute;n, como las mujeres, los ni&ntilde;os y la proliferaci&oacute;n de armas. Se har&aacute; un llamamiento especial para financiar todas estas nuevas actividades de aplicaci&oacute;n.</I><BR>
<a name=3><BR>

<H4><B>Las mujeres</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Las mujeres suelen llevar la peor parte en los conflictos, aunque rara vez participan en ellos. Al igual que otras personas civiles arrastradas por el torbellino de la guerra, son v&iacute;ctimas de bombardeos, hambruna, epidemias, desplazamientos forzosos, detenciones, torturas y ejecuciones; pero las mujeres est&aacute;n sometidas tambi&eacute;n a un sufrimiento adicional, que soportan  con valent&iacute;a y dignidad.<BR>

<P><IMG src="30ee_1.gif">E.Bouvet/ICRC<BR>

<P>En muchos casos, cuando se desencadena un conflicto, las mujeres se convierten en el &uacute;nico sost&eacute;n y soporte de la familia, teniendo a su cargo no solo a los hijos, sino tambi&eacute;n a los padres ancianos. En repetidas ocasiones, arriesgan la vida cuando buscan agua y alimentos o recogen le&ntilde;a en &aacute;reas infestadas de minas o bajo bombardeo ininterrumpido. La unidad familiar depende a menudo de estas mujeres, que contribuyen much&iacute;simo a la supervivencia humana y social.<BR>

<P>Los Convenios de Ginebra de 1949 y sus Protocolos adicionales de 1977 reconocen que las mujeres se encuentran entre los miembros m&aacute;s vulnerables de la poblaci&oacute;n y, por ello, contienen expl&iacute;citamente medidas especiales para protegerlas durante los conflictos armados. Sin embargo, con demasiada frecuencia se producen violaciones flagrantes del derecho internacional humanitario, causando enormes sufrimientos, tanto f&iacute;sicos como psicol&oacute;gicos, a las mujeres.<BR>

<P>Las mujeres embarazadas y las que amamantan son especialmente vulnerables. La tasa de mortalidad de las mujeres encintas, de las que amamantan y de los reci&eacute;n nacidos suele aumentar de manera espectacular durante los conflictos. El derecho internacional humanitario reconoce sus necesidades particulares.<BR>
Sin duda, la violencia sexual es una de las m&aacute;s graves infracciones que se producen durante la guerra. Es dif&iacute;cil disponer de cifras, pero numerosas pruebas indican que un n&uacute;mero excesivamente elevado de mujeres y j&oacute;venes sufren este tipo de agresiones durante las hostilidades, sea que se encuentren en situaci&oacute;n de detenci&oacute;n o refugiadas. En recientes conflictos, se ha utilizado sistem&aacute;ticamente la violaci&oacute;n como un arma para atemorizar, humillar o destruir comunidades enteras. Las v&iacute;ctimas de agresi&oacute;n sexual padecen las secuelas a largo plazo, en particular, graves traumas, enfermedades de transmisi&oacute;n sexual y embarazos no deseados, as&iacute; como el rechazo por parte del marido, la familia y la comunidad en su conjunto. La suerte de los ni&ntilde;os nacidos como resultado de una violaci&oacute;n es tambi&eacute;n motivo de gran preocupaci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Los casos documentados de violaci&oacute;n o de violencia sexual en tiempo de guerra representan apenas la punta del iceberg. En la guerra, como en la paz, el estigma asociado a la violaci&oacute;n y la culpabilizaci&oacute;n de la v&iacute;ctima llevan a que no se denuncie la gran mayor&iacute;a de casos. La atenci&oacute;n comprensiva y el asesoramiento a las v&iacute;ctimas son fundamentales para que las mujeres recuperen su autoestima y dignidad, as&iacute; como para facilitar su reintegraci&oacute;n en la sociedad y en la vida familiar. A menos que haya un mayor reconocimiento del azote de la violencia sexual, as&iacute; como una condena p&uacute;blica y una aplicaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s estricta de las leyes existentes, tanto a nivel nacional como internacional, los autores de estos delitos pueden permanecer tranquilos a sabiendas de que no ser&aacute;n castigados.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B><I>Propuestas para la Conferencia</I></B></H4>
<P>
<P><I>En la Conferencia se solicitar&aacute; a los Estados y a las Sociedades Nacionales que:</I><BR>
<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>garanticen la protecci&oacute;n y la asistencia.</I></B><BR>
<I>La Conferencia deber&iacute;a instar a las autoridades y a los ej&eacute;rcitos concernidos a tomar las medidas necesarias para garantizar que todas las mujeres, y en particular las que se encuentran en poder del enemigo, reciban tanto la protecci&oacute;n como la asistencia material y moral a que tienen derecho;</I><BR>
<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>condenen la violencia sexual.</I></B><BR>
<I>La Conferencia deber&iacute;a condenar la violaci&oacute;n en tanto que transgresi&oacute;n grave del derecho humanitario. Deber&iacute;a poner de relieve que la violaci&oacute;n cometida por combatientes es un crimen de guerra, por lo que debe ser tratada con arreglo a ello tanto en los conflictos internacionales como en los no internacionales;</I><BR>

<P><B><I>asistan a las v&iacute;ctimas de violaci&oacute;n.</I></B><BR>
<I>La Conferencia deber&iacute;a alentar a los Estados y al Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja a que tracen programas de asistencia m&eacute;dica, psicol&oacute;gica y social para las v&iacute;ctimas de agresiones sexuales. Estos programas deber&iacute;an ser dirigidos por mujeres calificadas;</I><BR>
<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>den a conocer este problema.</I></B><BR>
<I>La Conferencia deber&iacute;a alentar a los Estados y al Movimiento a que informen a la poblaci&oacute;n civil y a las fuerzas armadas de las disposiciones jur&iacute;dicas que proporcionan una especial protecci&oacute;n a las mujeres;</I><BR>
<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>impulsen la participaci&oacute;n femenina.</I></B><BR>
<I>La Conferencia desear&iacute;a que las mujeres participen activamente en todos los aspectos relativos a su propia protecci&oacute;n.</I><BR>

<P>Me arrestaron en pleno d&iacute;a en presencia de mis dos hijos m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;os. Nunca olvidar&eacute; la escena: de repente, un jeep a toda velocidad se plant&oacute; delante de mi carreta. Seis hombres uniformados saltaron de &eacute;l dando gritos. Me arrastraron del brazo. Mis hijos comenzaron a chillar y se escondieron debajo de la carreta. Fue  la &uacute;ltima vez que los vi. Me metieron en el jeep a la fuerza y durante el viaje hasta la comisar&iacute;a me insultaron y acusaron de todo tipo de cosas. No sab&iacute;a qu&eacute; estaba pasando.<BR>
En la comisar&iacute;a, me preguntaron d&oacute;nde estaba mi marido. Hac&iacute;a cinco meses que no lo ve&iacute;a, desde los combates en el pueblo. Lo acusaron de atacar un dep&oacute;sito de municiones. No lo pod&iacute;a creer. Mi marido era un campesino, no ten&iacute;a nada que ver con la guerra. Entonces, empezaron a maltratarme. Me humillaron. Se divirtieron degrad&aacute;ndome por todos los medios posibles. Despu&eacute;s, me sent&iacute; muerta de verg&uuml;enza, sucia y usada.<BR>
Amenazaron con matar a mis hijos. Al d&iacute;a siguiente, o&iacute; que unos ni&ntilde;os gritaban en la habitaci&oacute;n contigua. Me dijeron que eran mis hijos. Cre&iacute; que me iba a volver loca. Les supliqu&eacute; que hicieran lo que quisieran conmigo, pero que no hicieran da&ntilde;o a mis hijos. M&aacute;s tarde descubr&iacute; que tan solo era una grabaci&oacute;n.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H4><B>Los ni&ntilde;os</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Los ni&ntilde;os son, sin lugar a dudas, el grupo m&aacute;s vulnerable de cualquier comunidad. Cuando el conflicto destruye la vida de las personas, los m&aacute;s j&oacute;venes se encuentran siempre entre los que sufren antes y con mayor profundidad los distintos efectos de la guerra. Se calcula que en los &uacute;ltimos diez a&ntilde;os ha muerto un mill&oacute;n y medio de ni&ntilde;os en los conflictos armados, y unos 9  millones se han quedado sin hogar. La tasa de mortalidad de los ni&ntilde;os que han buscado refugio en pa&iacute;ses vecinos es de cinco a doce veces superior a la existente en su lugar de origen. Durante la guerra, la malnutrici&oacute;n, el sarampi&oacute;n, las enfermedades diarreicas y las infecciones pulmonares pueden provocar la muerte de hasta el 50-95 % de los ni&ntilde;os menores de cinco a&ntilde;os. Adem&aacute;s, el da&ntilde;o psicol&oacute;gico causado por la guerra puede durar el resto de sus vidas.<BR>

<P>En la actualidad, existen m&aacute;s ni&ntilde;os armados que nunca. Seg&uacute;n las cifras publicadas por Save the Children Fund, unos 200.000 ni&ntilde;os han sido reclutados como soldados y han participado activamente en guerras. Pero si, como ocurre en la mayor&iacute;a de los pa&iacute;ses, se  considera que un joven no es lo suficientemente maduro para conducir un veh&iacute;culo hasta los 18 a&ntilde;os, puede considerarse que es capaz de manejar una pistola antes de esa edad?<BR>

<P>Los ni&ntilde;os que han perdido a su familia en el caos suelen ser reclutados como soldados. Comienzan con diversos servicios para los combatientes y terminan portando armas ellos mismos, cuando no son reclutados por la fuerza. A falta de orientaci&oacute;n por parte de los padres, no son capaces de discernir adecuadamente entre lo que est&aacute; bien y lo que est&aacute; mal. Esto ha sido ampliamente comprobado en Liberia y Sierra Leona, por ejemplo, donde se da armas a ni&ntilde;os de 9  a&ntilde;os adoctrinados a los que se incita a cometer actos atroces, a menudo bajo la influencia de las drogas y del alcohol. Estos peque&ntilde;os, cuya ni&ntilde;ez queda pervertida y arruinada, inspiran muchas veces m&aacute;s miedo que sus compa&ntilde;eros de armas adultos. Tal fue el caso, entre otros, en Camboya, durante el r&eacute;gimen de los jemeres rojos, per&iacute;odo en el que cometieron atrocidades a gran escala ni&ntilde;os soldados que, debido a su edad, no pod&iacute;an comprender la magnitud de esos actos y por lo tanto, eran f&aacute;cilmente manipulados.<BR>

<P>Los ni&ntilde;os soldados terminan con frecuencia en cautividad, como sus compa&ntilde;eros adultos. Estos y otros ni&ntilde;os pueden ser detenidos acusados de haber cometido un delito, ser capturados durante los acontecimientos o, simplemente, ser encarcelados con sus padres. Seg&uacute;n los datos del CICR, unos 300 ni&ntilde;os menores de 15 a&ntilde;os fueron detenidos en Ruanda el mes de mayo de 1995. Algunos acompa&ntilde;aban a sus padres en la prisi&oacute;n y otros, de hasta apenas 8  a&ntilde;os, fueron acusados de participar en el genocidio. Cualquiera que sea el motivo de su detenci&oacute;n, los ni&ntilde;os tiene derecho a un trato especial en virtud del derecho humanitario y deben recibir alojamiento en pabellones separados de los adultos, una alimentaci&oacute;n y atenci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica apropiadas, y una educaci&oacute;n continua.<BR>

<P>Las familias separadas son un fen&oacute;meno frecuente durante la guerra; los ni&ntilde;os no acompa&ntilde;ados son especialmente vulnerables. Sus padres pueden estar detenidos, o bien, haberlos abandonado en hospicios o confiado a amigos o parientes, esperando protegerlos de este modo. Muchas veces, los m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;os se pierden en el caos cuando sus padres huyen presa del p&aacute;nico ante un peligro inminente.	<BR>

<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>eleven la edad m&iacute;nima a la que los ni&ntilde;os pueden tomar parte en las hostilidades.</I></B><BR>

Sol&iacute;a combatir en las filas de una de las facciones, pero ahora participa en un programa de escolarizaci&oacute;n organizado por una ONG local. El sue&ntilde;o de la mayor&iacute;a de los ni&ntilde;os que he conocido en Liberia es volver a la escuela. Pero para John es dif&iacute;cil convertir su sue&ntilde;o en realidad. Consume droga por h&aacute;bito, pero tambi&eacute;n para borrar de su mente y de su boca el sabor de la sangre humana que, seg&uacute;n &eacute;l, bebi&oacute; durante uno de los rituales de la unidad a la que pertenec&iacute;a.<BR>
Sam aparenta 10 a&ntilde;os, a mi parecer, pero afirma con orgullo que tiene 13. Antes era un combatiente, y muy valiente, dice, despu&eacute;s de perder el miedo. Me cont&oacute; que antes de su primer ataque ten&iacute;a much&iacute;simo miedo. Entonces, tom&oacute; una pastilla y se sinti&oacute; bien y fuerte, y luch&oacute; bien. Antes de su segundo ataque, tom&oacute; otra pastilla, y de nuevo luch&oacute; bien. Despu&eacute;s del tercer  enfrentamiento, estaba convencido de que era un valiente luchador y ya no necesit&oacute; pastillas de nuevo.<BR>
Ahora le hace falta un tipo de valor distinto, as&iacute; como todo el apoyo que pueda recibir, para volver a la escuela y vivir en un orfanato.<BR>

<H4><B>La hambruna</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Desde la Conferencia Internacional sobre la Alimentaci&oacute;n en Roma (1974), la hambruna causada por la guerra ha provocado la muerte de cientos de miles de personas en m&aacute;s de 15 pa&iacute;ses. A pesar del enorme progreso en el desarrollo de cosechas, abonos y t&eacute;cnicas agr&iacute;colas m&aacute;s resistentes, todav&iacute;a no se han erradicado las crisis alimentarias y la hambruna. El hambre es rara vez consecuencia de las condiciones clim&aacute;ticas, sino, m&aacute;s bien, una cat&aacute;strofe provocada por el hombre, combinada a veces con desastres naturales. Se produce cuando los mecanismos tradicionales de una comunidad para hacer frente a las crisis son inutilizados por el conflicto. La hambruna y la muerte suelen encontrarse al final del camino, en particular si los individuos, debilitados, son incapaces de luchar contra las enfermedades u otras agresiones.<BR>

<P>Por otro lado, la malnutrici&oacute;n cr&oacute;nica generalizada, a menudo originada por el subdesarrollo y la desorganizaci&oacute;n socioecon&oacute;mica, afecta a los grupos m&aacute;s vulnerables, especialmente a los ni&ntilde;os, cuyo desarrollo f&iacute;sico e intelectual se ve de este modo alterado.<BR>

<P>Hay que luchar contra estos sufrimientos en cuatro frentes: la prevenci&oacute;n, la preparaci&oacute;n y la detecci&oacute;n, la ayuda de emergencia y de desarrollo combinada, y la posterior evaluaci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Se podr&iacute;a evitar la hambruna en gran medida fomentando el respeto del derecho humanitario, que proh&iacute;be la privaci&oacute;n de alimentos, y combinando el desarrollo sostenible con mecanismos de seguridad alimentaria eficaces.<BR>

<P>Se est&aacute;n tomando medidas de preparaci&oacute;n a las situaciones de emergencia, desarrollando los recursos humanos y constituyendo reservas de regulaci&oacute;n, a fin de hacer frente a las situaciones de emergencia. Otros elementos clave son los sistemas de alarma temprana y los mecanismos apropiados para una acci&oacute;n inmediata.<BR>
Deber&iacute;a aplicarse una estrategia adecuada tanto a la ayuda alimentaria como a la recuperaci&oacute;n socioecon&oacute;mica para posibilitar a las personas &quot;sobrevivir hoy y seguir vivos ma&ntilde;ana&quot;.<BR>

<P>Por &uacute;ltimo, la evaluaci&oacute;n de las estrategias para prevenir la hambruna y mitigar los desastres, as&iacute; como la creaci&oacute;n y la aplicaci&oacute;n de programas, ha de hacerse con esp&iacute;ritu cr&iacute;tico. La responsabilidad para con los donantes, y en particular para con las v&iacute;ctimas, requiere que se aumente la presi&oacute;n sobre todas las partes para que las lecciones del pasado ayuden a mejorar el futuro.<BR>

En particular, se proh&iacute;be hacer padecer hambre como m&eacute;todo de combate, atacar, destruir o trasladar los medios indispensables para la supervivencia de la poblaci&oacute;n, as&iacute; como desplazar a las personas civiles, a menos que sea necesario por motivos de seguridad o razones militares imperativas.

<H4><B>El agua</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Angola, Irak, Liberia, Ruanda, Yemen y Bosnia-Herzegovina son algunos de los pa&iacute;ses que se han visto m&aacute;s afectados por la escasez de agua potable producida por la guerra. La experiencia m&aacute;s reciente ha mostrado que los da&ntilde;os ocasionados a las instalaciones de agua durante las hostilidades tienen tr&aacute;gicas consecuencias para las personas civiles. El agua contaminada y la penuria de agua pueden resultar incluso m&aacute;s mort&iacute;feras que un armamento entero. Adem&aacute;s, la destrucci&oacute;n de las fuentes de agua obliga a los civiles a desplazarse, supone una amenaza para las cosechas y el ganado y aumenta enormemente el riesgo de epidemias y enfermedades.<BR>

<P><IMG src="30ee_2.gif">A.Feric/ICRC<BR>

<P>Las instalaciones de agua, en particular las m&aacute;s modernas, son especialmente vulnerables a los ataques en los conflictos. Algunas veces se utilizan deliberadamente como blancos, provocando la huida de las personas civiles. Otras veces experimentan indirectamente las repercusiones de los ataques en otras partes de la infraestructura que son consideradas objetivos militares y que ocasionan cortes de electricidad o penuria de combustible y de productos qu&iacute;micos. En ocasiones, el personal encargado de reparar las instalaciones de distribuci&oacute;n de agua se encuentra atrapado bajo el fuego del enemigo.<BR>

<P>Los refugiados y las personas desplazadas son especialmente propensos a padecer enfermedades transmitidas por el agua, ya que dependen de fuentes sin las condiciones higi&eacute;nicas debidas o en condiciones poco fiables.<BR>

<P>La imposici&oacute;n de sanciones durante largos periodos de tiempo ha hecho muy dif&iacute;cil, cuando no imposible, restituir un buen abastecimiento de agua potable en algunos pa&iacute;ses como Irak, por ejemplo.<BR>

<P>En 1991, los intensos bombardeos de las centrales el&eacute;ctricas y  los da&ntilde;os colaterales a los servicios de tratamiento de agua redujeron gran parte de la infraestructura irak&iacute; a escombros y, en apenas unas semanas, ocasionaron una situaci&oacute;n de emergencia sin precedentes: millones de personas se vieron privadas de agua potable.<BR>

<P>Pero los da&ntilde;os no terminaron ah&iacute;. El embargo, que ya dura m&aacute;s de cuatro a&ntilde;os, ha afectado seriamente las redes de distribuci&oacute;n de agua para uso civil, reduciendo tanto la producci&oacute;n como la vida &uacute;til esperada de las instalaciones potabilizadoras. Es imposible encontrar piezas de recambio, no hay personal calificado y las materias primas escasean enormemente. Es virtualmente imposible mantener y renovar el sistema. En estas circunstancias, casi todos los limitados recursos disponibles se han dedicado al suministro de agua potable, en detrimento del tratamiento de las aguas residuales. Ello tendr&aacute; terribles repercusiones a largo plazo sobre el medio ambiente y, desde luego, tambi&eacute;n complicar&aacute; el tratamiento futuro del agua.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B><I>Propuestas para la Conferencia</I></B></H4>

<P><I>En la Conferencia se solicitar&aacute; a los Estados y a las Sociedades Nacionales que:</I><BR>
<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>ampl&iacute;en la protecci&oacute;n jur&iacute;dica.</I></B><BR>
<I>La Conferencia deber&iacute;a hacer un llamamiento a todos los beligerantes para que se abstengan de atacar las centrales de tratamiento y las redes de distribuci&oacute;n de agua para uso civil, as&iacute; como al personal encargado de las reparaciones y del mantenimiento;</I><BR>
<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>limiten los da&ntilde;os resultantes de los embargos.</I></B><BR>
<I>El Movimiento deber&iacute;a llamar la atenci&oacute;n de la comunidad internacional sobre los efectos directos para las personas civiles de los embargos a gran escala impuestos durante largos periodos y deber&iacute;a solicitarle que tome estos efectos en consideraci&oacute;n al elaborar futuras pol&iacute;ticas;</I><BR>
<I> </I><BR>
<B><I>den a conocer el problema.</I></B><BR>
<I>La Conferencia deber&iacute;a mencionar espec&iacute;ficamente el deber que tienen todos los Estados de dar a conocer las disposiciones jur&iacute;dicas existentes para proteger los servicios de abastecimiento de agua potable y al personal que trabaja en ellos. El Movimiento deber&iacute;a emprender un gran programa para difundir el conocimiento de estas disposiciones y poner de relieve la importancia de que no se utilice el agua como un arma durante los conflictos.</I><BR>

<P>Ad&eacute;n, Yemen:<BR>
Durante la guerra, el ej&eacute;rcito ocasion&oacute; da&ntilde;os a las estaciones de bombeo de las afueras de Ad&eacute;n, de modo que no llegaba agua a la ciudad. La situaci&oacute;n lleg&oacute; pronto a un punto cr&iacute;tico.<BR>

<P>Un d&iacute;a, varios delegados del CICR vinieron a la mezquita. Estudiaron el problema e instalaron una bomba hidr&aacute;ulica, colocaron dos grandes dep&oacute;sitos de agua en el tejado y una red de tuber&iacute;as en la calle, en el exterior. Se bombe&oacute;, almacen&oacute; y distribuy&oacute; agua a las personas. Para que siguiera funcionando durante los cortes el&eacute;ctricos, instalaron tambi&eacute;n un generador y dejaron un barril de combustible.<BR>

<P>La gente comenz&oacute; a acudir en cuanto se pusieron los grifos. Ven&iacute;an de d&iacute;a y de noche, y esperaban durante horas. Asignamos m&aacute;s personal para la vigilancia de la bomba y para asegurarnos de que no disminu&iacute;a el nivel de agua de los dep&oacute;sitos. Tres equipos trabajaban en turnos de ocho horas para que el pozo funcionase ininterrumpidamente.<BR>

<H4><B>Las minas</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Durante los 5 d&iacute;as que durar&aacute; la reuni&oacute;n de delegados en la XXVI Conferencia Internacional, unas 500 personas fallecer&aacute;n o perder&aacute;n miembros como resultado de las minas antipersonal. En todo el mundo, unos 110 millones de minas est&aacute;n a la espera de que alguna v&iacute;ctima ya sea un soldado o una persona civil, amigo o enemigo, adulto o ni&ntilde;o las pise. Las minas son soldados perfectos: siempre en guardia, sin dormir, sin fallar, aunque las hostilidades hayan terminado mucho tiempo atr&aacute;s. Las minas tambi&eacute;n son perversas e ignoran plenamente el derecho internacional humanitario.<BR>

<P><IMG src="30ee_3.gif">A.-M.Grobet/ICRC<BR>

<P>La mitad de las v&iacute;ctimas de minas fallecen sobre el terreno en los minutos que siguen a la explosi&oacute;n. Apenas un peque&ntilde;o porcentaje consigue llegar hasta alg&uacute;n servicio m&eacute;dico. Los que sobreviven ven reducidas sus posibilidades de trabajar, casarse y tener hijos, y su aceptaci&oacute;n en la vida comunitaria comprometida. Las amputaciones, las pr&oacute;tesis y la rehabilitaci&oacute;n de las v&iacute;ctimas resultan costosas en t&eacute;rminos de tiempo, conocimientos y material. Pero a&uacute;n as&iacute;, la mejor pr&oacute;tesis del mundo nunca podr&aacute; reemplazar al miembro perdido. La labor ortop&eacute;dica del CICR y de otras organizaciones humanitarias nunca debe considerarse una soluci&oacute;n a la devastaci&oacute;n causada por minas. Tan solo se ocupan de los s&iacute;ntomas y no de las ra&iacute;ces.<BR>

<P>Las econom&iacute;as locales y nacionales soportan una pesada carga, ya que las carreteras quedan intransitables y miles de acres de tierra cultivable desatendidos durante a&ntilde;os porque los agricultores no pueden aventurarse en sus campos. Las minas antipersonal pueden causar el derrumbamiento de econom&iacute;as enteras y sumir a pa&iacute;ses pobres de por s&iacute; en una dependencia y pobreza mucho m&aacute;s profundas.<BR>

<P>En enero de 1995, un Grupo Gubernamental de Expertos propuso que se introduzcan enmiendas a la Convenci&oacute;n de las Naciones Unidas de 1980 sobre Ciertas Armas Convencionales durante la Conferencia de Examen, que se celebrar&aacute; el mes de septiembre de 1995, en Viena. El Grupo recomend&oacute; que las restricciones sobre el empleo de minas terrestres previstas en la Convenci&oacute;n se extiendan a los conflictos armados internos, que todas las minas antipersonal sean detectables, que las minas esparcidas a distancia, as&iacute; como todas las minas antipersonal sembradas fuera  de campos se&ntilde;alados, vigilados y vallados contengan un mecanismo de autodestrucci&oacute;n, y que las partes que utilizan minas se responsabilicen de su remoci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Aunque el CICR acoge estas medidas con satisfacci&oacute;n, teme que las restricciones propuestas sean demasiado complejas y poco en&eacute;rgicas. Las llamadas minas bobas, carentes de un mecanismo de autodestrucci&oacute;n, seguir&aacute;n disponibles y, probablemente, ser&aacute;n empleadas indiscriminadamente. Si se combinan con una falta de acuerdo sobre la comprobaci&oacute;n y aplicaci&oacute;n de las medidas, existe el peligro de que las medidas aprobadas por la Conferencia de Examen no consigan una reducci&oacute;n significativa del n&uacute;mero de v&iacute;ctimas civiles. As&iacute; pues, el CICR y la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional est&aacute;n convencidos de que la prohibici&oacute;n total de la producci&oacute;n, la posesi&oacute;n, el tr&aacute;fago y el empleo de minas antipersonal es el &uacute;nico modo eficaz de hacer frente a este desastre internacional.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3>
<P>
<P>The regional delegation for North Africa coordinated the ICRC's activities in the region. It maintained contact with the authorities and the National Societies of the countries covered in order to promote wider acceptance of the activities entrusted to the ICRC by the international community under the Geneva Conventions and the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. It promoted compliance with international humanitarian law by spreading knowledge of the law itself and of the history, principles, ideals and work of the Movement. Principal target groups included government authorities, the armed forces and academic circles. The delegation also urged governments and National Societies to take action at the national level to ensure implementation of the humanitarian treaties. <BR>

<P>The tracing agency in Tunis handled thousands of Red Cross messages in connection with the Western Sahara conflict, mainly for Moroccan prisoners held by the Polisario Front, and, up to early July, forwarded family messages for Bosnian children in a camp in Libya. <BR>

<P>The travelling exhibition of calligraphy from classical Arab literature used in the ICRC's 1994 calendar and produced by the delegation in Cairo was shown in Morocco and Tunisia. <BR>

<H3><B>ALGERIA</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Once again in 1994, the ICRC was seriously concerned about the events in Algeria. The civilian population continued to suffer the tragic effects of a widening spiral of violence. Tens of thousands of people were believed to have lost their lives since 1992, including intellectuals, civil servants, journalists and at least 70 foreigners, and in 1994 thousands of arrests were reported. <BR>

<P>The ICRC's visits to detainees had been suspended by the Algerian authorities in July 1992. Throughout 1994, the institution continued its efforts to regain access to detainees in the country. The Delegate General for the Middle East and North Africa met the Algerian Ambassador to the UN in Geneva on many occasions in connection with this matter. ICRC representatives at such meetings as the 91st Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Paris in March, the OAU conference in Tunis in June and the OIC Summit in Casablanca in December took the opportunity to talk to Algerian government contacts. During the year ICRC staff also met various personalities from the Algerian political world. <BR>

<P>In order to further the ICRC's objectives and discuss the development of dissemination activities in Algeria, the regional delegate went to Algiers in February and September. He followed up contacts with the National School of Administration, the National Observatory for Human Rights, the media and the Algerian Red Crescent (ARC). On 7 November the ICRC's President, Vice-President and Delegate General for the Middle East and North Africa received the President and Vice-President of the ARC in Geneva; the National Society leaders gave assurances that the ARC would remain available to facilitate the ICRC's work. <BR>

<P><A NAME="B"></A><BR>

<H3><B>LIBYA</B></H3>
<P>
<P>In Libya the regional delegation concentrated on building up contacts with the Libyan Red Crescent. Towards the end of March and again in October the regional delegate met National Society representatives in Benghazi to discuss the holding of dissemination seminars. In May an ICRC doctor attended a conference on medical science in Benghazi with about 800 participants, and gave a talk on the ICRC's medical approach in emergency situations.<BR>

<P>On the occasion of a national celebration, the regional delegate took the opportunity to meet government officials.<BR>

<P>As in 1993, the ICRC arranged for the exchange of Red Cross messages between some 800 Bosnian children and those accompanying them, who had arrived in Libya in December 1992, and their families near Zenica. The Libyan Red Crescent was very active in forwarding these messages, which numbered some 2,400 in 1994. The children returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina at the beginning of July. <BR>

<P><A NAME="C"></A><BR>

<H3><B>MAURITANIA</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Delegates carried out three missions to Mauritania during the year. They maintained contact with the authorities and the media and discussed the promotion of international humanitarian law, particularly among the armed forces and in academic circles. They also collected information on the situation in neighbouring Mali. <BR>

<P><A NAME="D"></A><BR>

<H3><B>MOROCCO/WESTERN SAHARA</B></H3>
<P>
<P>The plight of prisoners taken in connection with the Western Sahara conflict, many of whom had been in captivity for 19 years, remained a major concern for the ICRC. Under the UN settlement plan, the cease-fire in effect since September 1991 was to be followed by the registration of all those eligible to vote in a referendum on self-determination for the people of Western Sahara, but the referendum has repeatedly been delayed because of differences in opinion over who should be allowed to vote. The ICRC's view is that the release of all prisoners should be carried out in accordance with the rules of international humanitarian law, whether or not a political solution is found. In particular, the institution continued to negotiate with the Moroccan authorities the return home of a group of 198 Moroccan prisoners whose names had been put forward for repatriation in 1989 by the Polisario Front and a group of 25 Moroccans considered by the ICRC as serious medical cases.<BR>

<P>Throughout the year the ICRC continued its visits to combatants held by both parties to the conflict. Under the authorization to visit detained Sahrawis given by the King of Morocco in January 1993, ICRC delegates again visited 72 Sahrawis held by the Moroccan authorities in Agadir from 30 May to 4 June and from 6 to 9 December 1994.<BR>

<P>In early February the ICRC handed over a note addressed to the Secretary-General of the Polisario Front to the Front's representative in Algiers. The note summarized the humanitarian issues outstanding from the Western Sahara conflict, in particular ICRC access to all the remaining Moroccan prisoners who had not yet been registered. Following a meeting of the ICRC President with a member of the political secretariat of the Polisario Front and talks in May between the Delegate General for the Middle East and North Africa and the Front's Secretary-General, at the beginning of August a team of seven delegates, including two doctors, registered Moroccan prisoners being held by the Front in Tindouf in southern Algeria. The team saw 950 prisoners, 689 for the first time. During a further visit in November, delegates saw 307 prisoners, 292 of whom were registered for the first time.<BR>

<P>By the end of the year, the ICRC had carried out five visits since 1978 to Sahrawis held in Morocco, registering a total of 92. During ten visits between 1975 and the end of 1994, the institution had registered 2,156 Moroccans held by the Polisario Front.<BR>

<P>All Sahrawi and Moroccan prisoners were photographed during the visits; the photographs were then sent along with the Red Cross messages they had written to their families to give added reassurance. <BR>

<P><A NAME="E"></A><BR>

<H3><B>TUNISIA</B></H3>
<P>
<P>The ICRC's activities in Tunisia centred around dissemination and information projects.<BR>

<P>A manual in Arabic was produced by the Ministry of Defence on the basis of the ICRC's Code of Conduct for Combatants.<BR>

<P>Close contacts were maintained with the Arab Institute for Human Rights, and ICRC representatives spoke on several occasions at seminars and training sessions organized by the Institute.<BR>

<P>The regional delegation cooperated with the Tunisian Red Crescent in organizing a drawing competition for schoolchildren in celebration of 8May, and at the invitation of the National Society the ICRC gave three presentations on humanitarian law, the ICRC and the Movement for a group of young first-aiders on 21 and 22 July.<BR>

<P>Close contacts were maintained with the Tunisian press. A delegate took part in a seminar held by the Association of Tunisian Journalists, and several interviews with ICRC delegates were broadcast by Radio Sfax and Radio Tunis. In December Radio Sfax also broadcast a round table convened by the delegation with journalists on the theme of water and armed conflict, and the regional delegate attended a seminar on the media at the service of human rights organized by the Ministry for Human Rights.<BR>

<P>An ICRC team headed by the ICRC Vice-President attended the OAU conference held in Tunis from 6 to 15 June. Meetings were arranged with African heads of State, ministers and other government representatives, and interviews were given to the press. </P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/Separator_Line_ICRC.gif" BORDER=0><P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/ButtonBar.gif" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#ButtonBar"><BR>

<H2>Introduction Asia and the Pacific</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P> The continent of Asia remained a source of serious concern for the ICRC in 1994. For the population of the Afghan capital Kabul, the year was certainly the worst since the change of regime in 1992. The city was the scene of extremely violent fighting which took a heavy toll among the civilian population. Hundreds of thousands were displaced within Kabul itself, while many fled to other regions of Afghanistan. Elsewhere, especially in the north, there were violent clashes between warring factions. At the end of the year a lasting political solution was still not forthcoming.<BR>

<P> A new factor nevertheless emerged on the political and military scene in the shape of the Talibans, armed Islamic students who tried to impose an alternative to the forces who had been fighting for years. It remains unclear who is backing this movement and what direction it will take.<BR>

<P> For the ICRC, the year was marked by difficulties but also by a number of new developments. The medical and food assistance operation in Kabul was paralysed for many months because of the intransigence of the parties. It was resumed at the end of 1994, but under very precarious conditions. The ICRC proceeded as planned with its food aid programme for displaced people in Jalalabad and its medical and surgical assistance to the government hospital there. The institution's orthopaedic programmes were also pursued.<BR>

<P> The ICRC was able to resume its activities for prisoners held by the main factions. A major effort was made to give new impetus to the dissemination of the basic principles of international humanitarian law (IHL) among combatants, although conditions for this work were far from propitious.<BR>

<P> In Pakistan, the signing of a headquarters agreement with the government coincided with encouraging progress in the dissemination of the fundamental rules of IHL among the armed forces.<BR>

<P> In 1994 the ICRC continued its attempts to gain access to categories of detainees who in various political contexts fell within its sphere of interest. Negotiations to this end were pursued in connection with Kashmir, Myanmar and the People's Republic of China. In India, a first evaluation mission to the Kashmir valley conducted in April by the regional delegation in New Delhi led to a specific proposal for action by the ICRC. After long discussion, a preliminary agreement was reached on the principle of ICRC visits to detainees. Promising talks were under way at the end of the year.<BR>

<P> The position was similar in Myanmar, where in May the ICRC proposed a draft agreement on visits to detainees. Although the State Law and Order Restoration Council gave the impression that in general it was open to cooperation with the ICRC in this area, there had been no tangible confirmation of this attitude by the end of December. In China, thanks to two missions carried out in January and March, the ICRC began to gain a better understanding of the problems and difficulties lying in the way of possible visits to places of detention.<BR>

<P>Meanwhile, progress was made in regard to the dissemination of IHL among the armed forces in Myanmar and paramilitary forces in India.<BR>
In Sri Lanka, the main protagonists in the conflict seemed willing to make a fresh attempt in 1994 to put an end to the violence that had been ravaging the country for years. Here the ICRC's role as a neutral intermediary was vital during the initial phase of contacts between the two main parties involved (the government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam). The ICRC facilitated the exchange of messages and the practical arrangements for the first meeting between the negotiators. These preliminary steps towards a negotiated settlement were accompanied by a decline in military activity and in the number of arrests. The ICRC nevertheless pursued its activities for the civilian population and detainees, particularly in the northern and eastern regions of the island.<BR>

<P> In Cambodia, the spring was a season of unrest and military operations of all kinds. In the north-west, the capture of the town of Pailin first by government troops and then by fighters of Democratic Kampuchea (Khmer Rouge) caused a series of population movements. Anti-personnel mines continued to be a very grave problem in Cambodia, because of their sheer number and also because mines had again been laid in some places that had previously been cleared. These treacherous devices continued to claim many victims every day, most of them civilians, children in particular.<BR>

<P>Delegates continued their efforts to gain regular access to all persons captured or arrested by one party or another in connection with the situation prevailing in the country. This was not always possible. By the same token, the ICRC was not always able to reach civilian victims of the conflict and had no access at all to people under the control of the Khmer Rouge.<BR>

<P> With regard to East Timor, although the Indonesian authorities did afford the ICRC better working conditions during 1994 and despite the fact that activities on behalf of detainees proceeded normally, the underlying reasons for its presence unfortunately remained unchanged.<BR>

<P> The effort to spread knowledge of IHL and the principles and ideals of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement was stepped up and streamlined. The regional delegations in New Delhi, Bangkok, Jakarta, Hong Kong and Manila were closely involved in this long-term endeavour.<BR>

<P> Finally, the ICRC began to set up a network of media liaison offices, the aim being not only to make its activities and principles better known but also to strengthen cooperation with National Societies wishing to give the Movement a higher profile in the Asia-Pacific region. During the year offices were set up in New Delhi for South Asia and in Sydney for the Pacific.<BR>

<H2>Suisse : &quot;droits des gens en temps de guerre&quot;</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>&quot;Droit des gens en temps de guerre&quot;: tel est le titre d'un moyen d'instruction assist&eacute; par ordinateur, &eacute;labor&eacute; par l'arm&eacute;e suisse avec l'appui du CICR. Ce CD-ROM permettra d'instruire la troupe sur les r&egrave;gles essentielles &agrave; respecter en temps de guerre. Une premi&egrave;re partie concerne la conduite de la guerre (d&eacute;finition du combattant, m&eacute;thodes et moyens de combat permis ou prohib&eacute;s lors d'une attaque). La deuxi&egrave;me partie a trait au traitement des prisonniers de guerre et &agrave; la protection de la population civile. Les signes de protection internationaux (embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge et du croissant rouge, signe de protection des biens culturels, etc.) sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s, de m&ecirc;me que le mandat et les activit&eacute;s du CICR. <BR>

<P>Un test final permet &agrave; l'utilisateur de contr&ocirc;ler le niveau de connaissance acquis gr&acirc;ce &agrave; cette auto-instruction d'environ 90 minutes. Le CD-ROM existe en fran&ccedil;ais, allemand, italien et anglais. Il sera &eacute;galement mis &agrave; disposition d'autres forces arm&eacute;es.

<H2>The protection of water in times of armed conflict</H2>
<P><I>By Ameur Zemmali</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>Ameur Zemmali,</I></B><I> born in 1955, graduated from the Faculty of Law in Tunis and subsequently qualified there as a barrister. He also has a diploma of advanced law studies and a doctorate in law from the University of Geneva. A member of the Legal Division of the International Committee of the Red Cross, he has published several articles and research papers and has taken part in numerous studies of international humanitarian law; his article entitled Imam AlAwzai and his humanitarian ideas appeared in the </I>Review<I> (No. 275, March-April 1990, pp. 115).</I><BR>
	<BR>

<P><I>&quot;Water, thou hast no taste, no colour, no odour; canst not be defined, art relished while ever mysterious. Not necessary to life, but rather life itself (...) Of the riches that exist in the world, thou art the rarest and also the most delicate  thou so pure within the bowels of the earth!&quot;.</I>[1]<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Water, life-giving and bounteous, the symbol of fertility and purity, is also a source of fear, risk and danger, of covetousness and conflict. Serving many purposes, all equally necessary, it constitutes a vital resource of which man has always tried to regulate the use and management. But unlike peacetime legislation, reflected in the customs and practices of the most ancient societies as well as in the domestic and international legal instruments of modern times, the law of armed conflicts has devoted only few of its provisions expressly - and belatedly - to water.[2] This is not so much a criticism as an observation and may be explained by the fact that water is indispensable in all circumstances. Apart from the consequences of natural disasters, when water may be either threatening or threatened, some human activities can harm the environment and impair the population's means of survival, of which water is the most essential. The effects of pollution or armed conflict are a case in point. The experience of modern warfare has shown, alas, that the civilian population and civilian objects are exposed to military operations and that in some cases thirst can prove to be more deadly than weapons.[3] The only remedy lies in respect for the universally recognized rules, and in the following article attention will be drawn to the provisions of humanitarian law which apply to the protection of water in wartime (I). Leaving aside considerations pertaining to <I>jus ad bellum</I> (water as a source of conflict) or water-related conflict situations,[4] we shall then look at some practical aspects with particular reference to the role of the ICRC and the other components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (II), before concluding with a few general remarks (III).<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>I. The protection of water in international humanitarian law</B></H3>
<P>
<P>International humanitarian law is known to protect certain categories of persons and objects. It does not contain any specific rules regarding water, since the latter comes under peacetime law . Nevertheless, hostilities may also affect water and certain rules of humanitarian law, containing specific prohibitions, must be applied to it (A). There are further provisions explicitly stating that water is indispensable to the basic needs of protected persons (B). Lastly, due note must be taken of the role of civil defence organizations, as laid down in 1977 Protocol I (C).<BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>(A) Prohibitions relating to the conduct of hostilities</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Besides the general protection applicable to all civilian objects, water as an element indissociable from the environment is covered, albeit indirectly, by all the protective rules which apply to the latter.[5] Without dwelling on the environmental aspect, mention must be made of four basic prohibitions with a direct bearing on the present subject. They relate to the use of poison as a means of warfare (1), the destruction of enemy property (2), attacks on objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population (3) and attacks on installations containing dangerous forces (4).<BR>

<P><B><I>(1) Prohibition of the use of poison</I></B><BR>

<P>This customary rule is enshrined in the Hague Regulations, where Article 23 (<I>a</I>) stipulates that it is forbidden &quot;to employ poison or poisoned weapons&quot;. The earlier Lieber Code (1863), destined for the United States armed forces, had already stipulated that military necessity &quot;does not admit of the use of poison in any way, nor of the wanton devastation of a district&quot;.[6] The Brussels Declaration (1874) and the Oxford Manual, adopted by the Institute of International Law in 1980, both contain the same rule.[7] Even though the text does not refer directly to water, the prohibition extends to that vital substance, especially as it is general in scope and does not relate only to weapons.[8]<BR>

<P><B><I>(2) Prohibition of the destruction of enemy property</I></B><BR>

<P>Water may be part of either public or private property. Codifying a well established rule, the Hague Regulations, in Article 23 (<I>g</I>), state that it is forbidden &quot;to destroy or seize the enemy's property, unless such destruction or seizure be imperatively demanded by the necessities of war&quot;. The same principle reappears in the Charter of the International Military Tribunal of Nuremberg and in the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.[9] In the latter, the &quot;extensive destruction and appropriation of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly&quot; is qualified as a &quot;grave breach&quot;, and thus as a war crime.[10] This rule is endorsed by other provisions, such as the prohibition of the confiscation of private property[11] and the prohibition of pillage,[12] which applies to the territories of enemy powers and to occupied territories.<BR>
	<BR>
<B><I>(3) Prohibition of the destruction of objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population</I></B><BR>
	<BR>
The innovation introduced by the provisions adopted in 1977 is very significant. It is designed to protect objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, quoting as examples &quot;foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, <I>drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works&quot;</I>.[13] Only imperative military necessity entitles a warring party to destroy indispensable objects, with the proviso that they must be situated within territory under its own control.[14] The words used to designate acts likely to harm such objects are intended to cover all possibilities (&quot;it is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove or render useless&quot; such objects), including pollution, by chemical or other agents.[15] The same formula is used in Article 14 of Protocol II, which quotes as examples of indispensable objects &quot;drinking water installations and supplies and irrigation works&quot;. <BR>

<P>A derogation from the immunity of indispensable objects is allowed only if they serve as sustenance solely for the members of the armed forces or in direct support of military action. Even in those cases, belligerents have to abstain from any action which may be expected to reduce the civilian population to starvation or deprive it of vital water supplies.[16] Reprisals against indispensable objects are forbidden.[17] It is unfortunate that this prohibition does not appear in Protocol II.<BR>
	<BR>
<B><I>(4) Prohibition of attacks on works and installations containing dangerous forces</I></B><BR>
	<BR>
In view of the extremely dangerous effects which attacks against &quot;works and installations containing dangerous forces&quot; might have on the lives of the civilian population and their property, the 1977 Protocols prohibit such attacks, even in cases where the said objects are military objectives.[18] Three types of works or installations are specified: dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations. Past experience of armed conflicts has shown that these are considered priority targets, the destruction of which can decide the outcome of a battle or even a war. Aware of the dangers inherent in such destruction, which go far beyond the legitimate military objectives of attacks, the authors of Protocol I added further clauses to supplement this special protection as follows.<BR>
	<BR>
Even military objectives located at or in the vicinity of such installations may not be made the object of attack &quot;if such attack may cause the release of dangerous forces ... and consequent severe losses among the civilian population&quot;.[19] The special protection against attack provided for the two types of installations (dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations on the one hand, and military objectives located at or in the vicinity of such installations on the other) is waived only when any of these works is used &quot;in regular, significant and direct support of military operations&quot; and if such attack is &quot;the only feasible way to terminate such support&quot;.[20] Paragraph 3 of the same article calls upon belligerents to take precautionary measures to ensure that <I>the civilian population and individual civilians</I> receive the protection accorded them by international law. Nothing is said of the precautions that must be taken for <I>civilian property</I>, but it may legitimately be concluded that this is covered by the second sentence of the paragraph. Reprisals against such installations and military objectives are prohibited,[21] while the general prohibition on locating any military objectives in the vicinity of such works is tempered by permission to erect purely defensive installations to protect the said works.[22] The conclusion of special agreements to provide extra protection or for identification, using the sign indicated in Protocol I (Annex I, Article 17), is left to the initiative of the parties.[23] From the point of view of repression, &quot;launching an attack against works or installations containing dangerous forces in the knowledge that such attack will cause excessive loss of life, injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects, as defined in Article 57, paragraph 2 <I>(a)</I> (iii)&quot;[24] is regarded as a grave breach of the Conventions and Protocol. It should be noted that this provision covers civilians and civilian objects, which confirms our earlier remark regarding the omission in paragraph 3 of Article 56.<BR>
	<BR>
Observance of these rules governing the conduct of hostilities is sufficient to ensure effective protection of water resources and installations, which are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. Parties to conflict are also under further obligations with regard to the protection of victims. One of these is the provision of water.<BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>(B) Water as an indispensable resource for the survival of protected persons</B></H4>
<P>	<BR>
Humanitarian law seeks to ensure at least minimum normal living conditions for the persons it is intended to protect. Humane treatment constitutes the basis of such &quot;normality&quot;; it finds practical expression in the satisfaction of basic human needs, and basic needs mean water. Generally speaking, assistance and care for the wounded and sick is inconceivable without water. To be able to do their work, medical staff need water. The same applies to medical equipment and installations as well as to the hygiene and maintenance of any place where there are protected persons. This is so obvious that it has not been considered necessary to formulate specific rules. In some contexts, however, an explicit reference has to be made, as in some provisions of the Third and Fourth Conventions.[25] Article 20, paragraph 2, of the Third Convention stipulates that prisoners of war who are being evacuated must be supplied by the Detaining Power with sufficient food and potable water, and with the necessary clothing and medical attention. The same obligation is laid down in Article 46, paragraph 3, of the said Convention, for the transfer of prisoners of war, and in Article 127, paragraph 2, of the Fourth Convention, for the transfer of internees. Drinking water is also referred to in a separate paragraph of the article common to the two Conventions and concerning the daily food rations of prisoners of war and civilian internees.[26]<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>(C) Role of civil defence organizations</B></H4>
<P>
<P>It should be noted in particular that one of the humanitarian tasks of civil defence organizations, whose rights and duties are laid down in the new provisions of 1977 Protocol I, is the emergency repair of indispensable public utilities. Other explicitly mentioned tasks in aid of the civilian population include fire-fighting, provision of emergency supplies and the preservation of objects essential for survival. Even though civil defence personnel are active only within the national territory, whether it is occupied or not, these provisions strengthen the protection accorded to civilian objects and, if faithfully observed, can make a valuable contribution to the assistance provided to the civilian population. The role of civil defence organizations in protecting water storage and other supply systems must be stressed and respected.[27]<BR>
	<BR>
This brief reminder of the relevant rules is enough to show that the protection of water in times of armed conflict is an integral part of humanitarian law.[28] It also shows that this law, in its most recent codification, has taken account of the impact of modern warfare on water installations and reserves of drinking water, for indeed the damage caused to water as a result of hostilities could jeopardize the fauna and flora of a region, force entire populations to leave their homes and eliminate any sign of life. Humanitarian aid agencies have witnessed such effects in various situations and have important tasks to accomplish in this domain.<BR>
	<BR>

<H3><B>II. Role of the ICRC and the other components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</B></H3>
<P><B>	</B><BR>
In its humanitarian work to assist the victims of armed conflict the ICRC, in accordance with its mandate under the Geneva Conventions, gives priority to the immediate interests and benefit of protected persons. Any steps it takes to protect water or other civilian objects are essentially only a means of helping the victims. If water installations and civilian supply systems are spared by the belligerents, as required by humanitarian law, the ICRC must concentrate on other tasks, of which there are many in wartime. Conversely, if such installations and systems have been destroyed, then immediate action must be taken to repair them, since any delay or setback in doing so can have serious consequences for the population and its means of survival. Several recent or present conflicts have shown how acute problems caused by damage to water storage or supply systems can be. The magnitude of these problems is such that the ICRC may take both remedial (A) and preventive (B) action.<BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>(A) Remedial action</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Two aspects merit particular attention here: water distribution (1) and the repair of supply systems (2).<BR>
	<BR>
<B><I>(1) Water distribution</I></B><BR>

<P>To give only one example of this type of action, from the start of the 1990/91 Gulf War the ICRC supplied water, food and medicines to tens of thousands of foreign nationals who had fled Iraq and Kuwait. With the help of the Jordan National Red Crescent Society, the transit camps set up in Jordan were able to provide satisfactory conditions of hygiene.[29]  <BR>

<P>In Iraq itself, help was needed to restore drinking water supplies both for the population and for local public services. A special programme was set up to distribute purified water in one-litre plastic bags to meet the needs of hospitals and health centres. In some urban centres in the south and north of the country, tanker trucks were used to supply people in neighbourhoods deprived of drinking water.[30] This method of water distribution has the advantage in such circumstances of being quick and effective, but cannot replace the classic system of distribution through a network, which is more effective but often requires more lengthy repairs.<BR>

<P><B><I>(2) Repair of supply systems and purification of drinking water reserves</I></B><BR>
	<BR>
In situations of armed conflict, power plants are often put out of action. This can totally disrupt water supply and sewerage systems. Apart from the ensuing privations, the risk of epidemics increases and repair work takes longer, costs more and may even be impossible. In such circumstances the ICRC must take urgent action to ensure a minimum degree of protection for objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population and to preserve or guarantee minimum conditions of health and hygiene. For this, it calls in engineers and public health specialists whose main task is to repair damaged installations and draw up plans and programmes to deal with the emergency.[31]<BR>

<P>The relief operation in Iraq in March 1991 can again serve as an example. The ICRC organized a programme to restore drinking water supplies throughout the country, based not only on water distribution, as mentioned earlier, but also on the restoration of water-treatment and distribution systems. For this purpose the Iraqi water services were provided with maintenance equipment, spare parts and chemicals to treat water. Thanks to this programme, cholera, typhus and other epidemics threatening the population were successfully averted.[32] In 1994, the ICRC completed a programme to provide spare parts enabling the Iraqi water services to maintain or rehabilitate about 100 medium-sized water-treatment units (up to 50,000 m3/hour) and several medium-sized waterworks (around 100,000 m3/hour).[33]<BR>

<P>In Yemen, the big Bir Nassir pumping station, supplying Aden, was damaged after civil war broke out in Yemen in 1994. This would have had disastrous consequences for the population of Aden but for the water of the city's wells. With the help of the local authorities, teams of ICRC engineers improved the production of wells in public places and mosques to working order, installed generators and pumps, and repaired and replaced water pipes and storage tanks. After the conflict had ended, the ICRC set up a system to distribute water by tanker truck to the entire population, displaced people, detainees, people in hospital, but in particular Yemeni engineers, with logistical support from the ICRC, also repaired the pumping stations at Bir Nasser and Lahaj, and the Yemeni water services were provided with logistic support, equipment and technical assistance by the ICRC.[34]<BR>

<P>The effects of an armed conflict can extend beyond the cessation of active hostilities, as shown above, and the ICRC may have to continue its activities to facilitate access to drinking water. The needs and problems encountered are often so great that the ICRC supplements its own teams by calling in other qualified personnel, who may be seconded from National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Furthermore, the role of the components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement in protecting water supply systems[35] must not be confined to remedial action alone.<BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>(B) Preventive action</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Although preventive aspects were taken into account in the two examples mentioned above, as they are in other similar situations, particular emphasis should be placed on two points.<BR>
	<BR>
<B><I>(1) Approaches to parties to conflict</I></B><BR>

<P>In working for the &quot;faithful application&quot;[36] of international humanitarian law, the ICRC must engage wherever necessary in active diplomacy to urge respect for that law. Its approaches, though confidential in principle, may be made public under certain conditions;[37] this applies to violations affecting either protected persons or protected objects. Any deliberate attack on water installations or reserves of drinking water for civilian use must accordingly be followed by appropriate representations to ensure that such violations are stopped, that any recurrence is prevented and that all necessary action is taken against the offenders. Public appeals issued by the ICRC must where necessary draw attention to the applicable legal principles.<BR>

<P><B><I>(2) Action to mobilize and create awareness</I></B><BR>

<P>The action taken in times of armed conflict, as described above, does not exclude peacetime initiatives to explain the existing law and to alert public opinion and decision-makers to the effects of armed conflict on water resources and hence on the living conditions of the population. The experience gained n a variety of conflicts should, without giving rise to unnecessary alarm, help to guide humanitarian action and to resolve problems more effectively. This was in fact one of the conclusions reached by a symposium organized by the ICRC in Montreux in 1994[38] and attended by about fifty experts (including specialists from certain UN bodies and non-governmental organizations, lawyers, sanitary engineers, scientists belonging to National Societies and the Federation and specialized journalists). At the close of the symposium, the participants agreed to work towards a number of objectives, namely:<BR>
	<BR>
*	to provide better protection (material and legal) for water supply systems and for sanitary engineers;<BR>
	<BR>
*	to strengthen cooperation in this area between the ICRC, the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their Federation, United Nations agencies, NGOs and the private sector;<BR>
	<BR>
*	to improve coordination and cooperation in the exchange of appropriate information, knowledge and expertise;<BR>
	<BR>
*	to involve the private sector in helping to repair water supply systems affected by hostilities;<BR>
	<BR>
*	to take the necessary preventive measures in peacetime to avoid or limit the devastating effects of water shortages in wartime, and to broaden the scope of medical operations in wartime to include public health activities in emergency relief;<BR>
	<BR>
*	to make known as widely as possible the international rules protecting water supplies and installations by informing and educating all levels of society.<BR>
	<BR>
These objectives cannot be attained by a single organization and require concerted action, especially by all the Movement's components. While emergency action in times of armed conflict and natural disasters must be given priority, the Movement should also address other potentially dangerous situations. Whether in manmade or natural disasters, local populations and humanitarian organizations may well face the same type of problems. In both cases, attention must be given first and foremost to needs for water and to the requirements of public health facilities. Hence the need to go beyond emergency action alone by organizing suitable programmes and recruiting and training qualified personnel, since without drinking water those facilities will be paralysed, and without them even the most sophisticated arrangements to provide medical care will be doomed to failure. It may be added that, in dealing with the sort of difficulties referred to above, activities which are planned or implemented by components of the Movement, either separately or jointly, are in no way exclusive, and cooperation should extend equally to outside specialized agencies with a view to preparing joint action where appropriate. In such cooperation there should be at least a minimum of coherence and coordination.[39]<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>III. Final remarks</B></H3>
<P>
<P>1.	In armed conflict, water sometimes becomes a target or is even used as a means of warfare. In either case, so long as water is a civilian object and indispensable to the survival of the population, warfare <I>against</I> or <I>by means of </I>water is utterly incompatible with the principles and rules of humanitarian law specified above. The importance of the provisions concerned and the obligation to implement them effectively cannot be overemphasized.<BR>

<P>2.	Threats to water are the same as threats to the environment. The ICRC's mandate with regard to protection of the environment in times of armed conflict is recognized by the entire international community. This recognition should also benefit water, a vital resource in all circumstances, and emphasis should be placed on the need to protect water as such against the polluting and destructive effects of armed conflict.<BR>
	<BR>
3.	Most of the relevant provisions of humanitarian law relate to situations of international armed conflict. Those applying to internal conflict are even less developed, while other situations of internal armed violence lie outside the field of application of international humanitarian law. Yet water-related tensions and attacks on water resources and installations are sometimes more frequent in situations of internal conflict and disturbances.<BR>
	<BR>
4.	In the various situations of armed violence (conflict, tensions and disturbances), the ICRC has a mandate to fulfil (under the Geneva Conventions or its own Statutes, depending on circumstances), which enables it to be present, to act without delay and to take preventive action. It is on this basis that it conducts or takes part in sanitation programmes. The nature of present-day conflicts is inducing the ICRC to show greater initiative and, within the limits of its resources, to find appropriate solutions. To this effect it must help populations affected by armed violence and the services concerned to repair damaged water installations and, where necessary, must supply technical know-how, since the survival of such populations and the operation of their production systems depend on water.<BR>
	<BR>
5.	Whatever the objectives and priorities of action to protect water may be, any initiatives taken by the main parties concerned should be based on consultation, coordination and the exchange of information. These elements are in our opinion essential, whether for action plans in response to emergencies or for preventive measures. If emphasis has been placed here on the role of the ICRC and the Movement's other components, it is to highlight their respective tasks and the principles underlying their action. Other complementary efforts are, however, unquestionably needed to address the effects of armed conflict on water resources and their varied and complex implications.<BR>

	<BR>
2. There are few works dealing with the question, all the more credit being due to the <I>International Law </I><BR>
<I>Association</I>, which, at its 57th Conference in Madrid in 1976, adopted a resolution on the protection of water resources and water installations in times of armed conflict. See the text of the resoluton in: <I>International Law Association</I>, Report of the Fifty-seventh Conference held at Madrid (August 30th, 1976, to September 4th, 1976), 1978, p. xxxiv. In 1966, the Association had already adopted the Helsinki Rules on the uses of waters of international rivers, in which Article 20 was worded as follows: &quot;<I>In times of war, other armed conflict, or public emergency constituting a threat to the life of the State, a riparian State may take measures derogating from its obligations under this Chapter to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law. The riparian State shall in any case facilitate navigation for humanitarian purpose</I>&quot;.<BR>

<P>3. This issue will be on the agenda of the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent (Geneva, 3-7 December 1995) which will be concerned <I>inter alia</I> with the protection of the civilian population and of items indispensable for its survival.<BR>

<P>4. Recent works covering some aspects of the question include: Jacques Sironneau, &quot;L'eau ressource strat&eacute;gique&quot;, in <I>G&eacute;opolitique</I>, No. 43, autumn 1993, Christian Chesnot, <I>La bataille de l'eau au Proche-Orient</I>, Paris, l'Harmattan, 1993; Ali Ihsan Bagis (ed.), <I>Water as an Element of Cooperation and Development in the Middle East</I>, Ayna Publications, Istanbul, 1994; Stefan Kl&ouml;tzli, &quot;The Water and Soil Crisis in Central Asia - a Source of Future Conflicts?&quot;, <I>Center for Security Studies and Conflict Research</I>, ETH, Zurich, May 1994.<BR>
	<BR>
5. Both customary law and treaty law contain rules which apply to the protection of the environment in wartime. In addition to Articles 35, para. 3, and 55 of 1977 Protocol I and the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Uses of Environmental Modification Techniques, adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1976, there are some other rules and instruments which are worth mentioning. It is well established that belligerents do not have an unlimited right to adopt means of injuring the enemy (Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention No. IV of 1907, Article 22, and 1977 Protocol I, Article 35, para. 1). The same principle is reasserted in Resolution XXVIII of the 20th International Conference of the Red Cross (Vienna, 1965) and in the Preamble to the 1980 Convention on the use of conventional weapons, referred to below. There is also the rule prohibiting any destruction of enemy property unless demanded by the necessities of war (see below, section 2). Texts relating to the prohibition or limitation of the use of certain types of weapons include: the Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare (Geneva, 17 June 1925), the Convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction (London, Moscow, Washington, 10 April 1972), the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and its Protocols I, II and III (Geneva, 10 October 1980) and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and their Destruction (signed in Paris on 13 January 1993). <BR>

J. Schacht, Leiden, 1933, pp. 67). The Declaration adopted by the International Institute of Humanitarian Law of San Remo (1990) on the rules of international humanitarian law governing the conduct of hostilities in non-international armed conflicts extends to such conflicts the prohibition of <I>&quot;the use of poison as a means or</I> <I>method of warfare</I>&quot; (section B, paragraph 3).

Besides the important provisions in Articles 54 and 56 considered above, Protocol I mentions water in other articles which reflect a broad approach and which grant medical facilities and persons extensive protection <I>&quot;whether at sea or in other waters</I>&quot; (Protocol I, Articles 8 <I>(b)</I>; 23, para. 1; and 44, para. 8).

<H2>Friday 20th December declared day of mourning</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Revolted by the cold-blooded murder of its delegates, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) declared Friday 20th December 1996 a day of mourning and invited National Societies, the International Federation of  Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and other humanitarian organizations, both governmental and non-governmental, to observe it in the way they felt most appropriate (reduced activity, flags at half-mast, special ceremonies, public statements).<BR>

<P>In Geneva, to pay tribute to the selfless dedication of the six persons murdered in the course of their humanitarian duties, and to express abhorrence at the vile act that put an end to their lives, a religious ceremony was held at St-Pierre Cathedral at 11 a.m., in the presence, amongst others, of friends of the victims, of ICRC staff, representatives of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, of embassies accredited to the United Nations in Geneva and of other humanitarian organisations.<BR>

<P><B>Directives pour les manuels d'instruction militaire sur la protection de l'environnement en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute;</B><BR>

<P>Dans deux pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents num&eacute;ros de la <I>Revue</I>, Antoine Bouvier, juriste du CICR, a rendu compte des travaux effectu&eacute;s sur le plan international pour renforcer les moyens juridiques permettant de prot&eacute;ger l'environnement naturel en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute; [2]. Dans son second article, apr&egrave;s avoir mentionn&eacute; les r&eacute;sultats obtenus en 1992 par la 47e session de l'Assembl&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Nations Unies, l'auteur concluait que  le droit existant offre une protection suffisante pour autant qu'il soit correctement mis en oeuvre et respect&eacute; . La question essentielle porte donc sur une meilleure application des obligations internationales existantes. Selon lui,  c'est d&eacute;sormais sur la mise en oeuvre des moyens existants et la recherche de nouveaux m&eacute;canismes qu'il faudra porter l'accent  [3].<BR>
	<BR>
Depuis 1993, d'autres travaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s suivant les m&eacute;thodes propos&eacute;es par Antoine Bouvier; ils correspondent en fait &agrave; la position adopt&eacute;e par le CICR en diverses occasions. Notre propos n'est pas de dresser ici la liste d&eacute;taill&eacute;e des diff&eacute;rentes mesures prises pour renforcer la protection de l'environnement naturel en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute; [4]. Nous proposons simplement de pr&eacute;senter et discuter bri&egrave;vement une proposition pratique que le CICR, apr&egrave;s consultation d'un groupe d'experts internationaux, a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; aux Nations Unies en 1994 : les <I>directives pour les manuels d'instruction militaire sur la protection de l'environnement en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute;</I>. Sans les adopter officiellement, l'Assembl&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Nations Unies, lors de sa 49e session, a invit&eacute; tous les &Eacute;tats &agrave; h d&ucirc;ment envisager la possibilit&eacute; de les int&eacute;grer dans leurs manuels d'instruction militaire et autres instructions destin&eacute;es &agrave; leur personnel militaire [5].<BR>
	<BR>
Les directives sont con&ccedil;ues comme un outil destin&eacute; &agrave; faciliter l'instruction et la formation des forces arm&eacute;es dans un domaine souvent n&eacute;glig&eacute; du droit international humanitaire : la protection de l'environnement naturel. Elles forment ni plus ni moins un r&eacute;sum&eacute; des r&egrave;gles internationales actuellement applicables que les membres des forces arm&eacute;es doivent conna&icirc;tre et respecter. En d'autres termes, elles constituent un instrument de diffusion. <BR>

<P>Les directives &eacute;labor&eacute;es par le CICR ne doivent pas &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme le sch&eacute;ma d'une nouvelle codification. Leur seul objectif est de contribuer, de mani&egrave;re pratique et efficace, &agrave; mieux prendre conscience d'un pr&eacute;cieux atout qui m&eacute;rite d'&ecirc;tre respect&eacute; et prot&eacute;g&eacute;, m&ecirc;me - ou particuli&egrave;rement - en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute; : l'environnement naturel. Il incombe d&eacute;sormais aux &Eacute;tats et, en particulier, aux forces arm&eacute;es, de prendre les mesures ad&eacute;quates.<BR>

<P>
<P><B>I. Remarques pr&eacute;liminaires</B><BR>

<P>1) Les pr&eacute;sentes directives sont tir&eacute;es des dispositions juridiques internationales en vigueur et refl&egrave;tent les pratiques nationales concernant la protection de l'environnement contre les effets des conflits arm&eacute;s. Elles ont pour but de renforcer l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des forces arm&eacute;es de tous les &Eacute;tats pour la protection de l'environnement et leur pr&eacute;occupation &agrave; cet &eacute;gard.<BR>

<P>2) Les l&eacute;gislations des &Eacute;tats et les autres mesures prises au niveau national sont des moyens essentiels de faire en sorte que les instruments internationaux de protection de l'environnement en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute; soient effectivement mis en pratique.<BR>

<P>3) Dans la mesure o&ugrave; ces directives sont l'expression du droit coutumier international ou des instruments conventionnels liant un &Eacute;tat donn&eacute;, elles doivent &ecirc;tre incluses dans les manuels d'instruction militaire et les r&egrave;glements sur les lois de la guerre. Lorsqu'elles refl&egrave;tent la politique d'un pays, il est sugg&eacute;r&eacute; de les inclure dans ces textes.<BR>
		<BR>
<B>II. Principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux du droit international</B><BR>

<P>4) En plus des r&egrave;gles sp&eacute;cifiques indiqu&eacute;es ci-apr&egrave;s, les principes g&eacute;n&eacute;raux du droit international applicables en cas de conflit arm&eacute; - tels que le principe de la distinction et le principe de la proportionnalit&eacute; - s'appliquent &agrave; la protection de l'environnement. En particulier, seuls les objectifs militaires peuvent &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute;s et il est interdit d'employer des m&eacute;thodes ou moyens de guerre qui provoquent des dommages excessifs. Lors des op&eacute;rations militaires, les pr&eacute;cautions exig&eacute;es par le droit international doivent &ecirc;tre prises.<BR>
Protocole I, art. 35, 48, 52 et 57<BR>

<P> 5) &Agrave; moins d'&ecirc;tre incompatibles avec le droit applicable en cas de conflit arm&eacute;, les accords internationaux sur l'environnement et les r&egrave;gles pertinentes du droit coutumier continuent d'&ecirc;tre applicables en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute;. Les obligations relatives &agrave; la protection de l'environnement vis-&agrave;-vis des &Eacute;tats qui ne sont pas parties au conflit (par exemple les &Eacute;tats voisins) et pour ce qui est des zones situ&eacute;es au-del&agrave; des limites de la juridiction nationale (par exemple la haute mer) continuent de s'appliquer en cas de conflit arm&eacute;, dans la mesure o&ugrave; elles ne sont pas incompatibles avec le droit applicable en cas de conflit arm&eacute;.<BR>

<P>6) Les parties &agrave; un conflit non international sont invit&eacute;es &agrave; appliquer les m&ecirc;mes r&egrave;gles de protection de l'environnement naturel que celles qui r&eacute;gissent les conflits arm&eacute;s internationaux et, en cons&eacute;quence, les &Eacute;tats sont instamment pri&eacute;s d'incorporer ces r&egrave;gles dans leurs manuels d'instruction militaire et leurs r&egrave;glements sur les lois de la guerre sans &eacute;tablir de distinction entre les diff&eacute;rentes formes de conflit arm&eacute;.<BR>

<P>7) Dans les cas non pr&eacute;vus par les r&egrave;gles des accords internationaux, l'environnement reste sous la sauvegarde et sous l'empire des principes du droit international, tels qu'ils r&eacute;sultent des usages &eacute;tablis, des principes de l'humanit&eacute; et des exigences de la conscience publique.<BR>
Convention IV de La Haye, pr&eacute;ambule; Protocole I, art. 1 par. 2; Protocole II, pr&eacute;ambule<BR>

<P><B>III. R&egrave;gles sp&eacute;cifiques relatives &agrave; la protection de l'environnement naturel</B><BR>

<P>8) La destruction de l'environnement qui n'est pas justifi&eacute;e par les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s des op&eacute;rations militaires constitue une infraction au droit international humanitaire. Dans certaines circonstances, cette destruction peut faire l'objet de sanctions en tant que violation grave du droit international humanitaire.<BR>
R&egrave;glement de La Haye, art. 23, par. g); IVe Convention de Gen&egrave;ve, art. 53 et 147; Protocole I, art. 35, par. 3 et 55<BR>

<P>9) L'interdiction g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de d&eacute;truire des biens de caract&egrave;re civil, sauf dans les cas o&ugrave; une telle destruction est justifi&eacute;e par les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s des op&eacute;rations militaires, prot&egrave;ge aussi l'environnement.<BR>
R&egrave;glement de La Haye, art. 23, par. g); IVe Convention de Gen&egrave;ve, art. 53; Protocole I, art. 52; Protocole II, art. 14<BR>

Protocole I, art. 35, par. 3, et 55<BR>

<P>12) Il est interdit d'utiliser &agrave; des fins militaires ou toutes autres fins hostiles des techniques de modification de l'environnement ayant des effets &eacute;tendus, durables ou graves, en tant que moyen de causer des destructions, des dommages ou des pr&eacute;judices &agrave; tout autre &Eacute;tat partie. Les termes  techniques de modification de l'environnement  d&eacute;signent toute technique ayant pour objet de modifier - gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une manipulation d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;e de processus naturels - la dynamique, la composition ou la structure de la Terre, y compris ses biotes, sa lithosph&egrave;re, son hydrosph&egrave;re et son atmosph&egrave;re, ou l'espace extra-atmosph&eacute;rique.<BR>
ENMOD, art. I et II<BR>

<P>13) Les attaques contre l'environnement naturel &agrave; titre de repr&eacute;sailles sont interdites aux &Eacute;tats parties au Protocole I additionnel aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve.<BR>
Protocole I, art. 55, par. 2<BR>

<P>14) Les &Eacute;tats sont instamment invit&eacute;s &agrave; conclure entre eux d'autres accords pour assurer une protection suppl&eacute;mentaire de l'environnement en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute;.<BR>
Protocole I, art. 56, par. 6<BR>

<P>15) Les ouvrages d'art ou installations contenant des forces dangereuses et les biens culturels seront marqu&eacute;s et identifi&eacute;s, conform&eacute;ment aux r&egrave;gles internationales applicables. Les parties &agrave; un conflit arm&eacute; sont encourag&eacute;es &agrave; marquer et identifier &eacute;galement les ouvrages d'art ou les installations dans lesquelles sont effectu&eacute;es des activit&eacute;s pr&eacute;sentant des risques, ainsi que les sites qui sont indispensables &agrave; la sant&eacute; humaine ou &agrave; l'environnement.<BR>
Par exemple, Protocole I, art. 56, par. 7 et Convention de 1954, art. 6<BR>
	<BR>
<B>IV. Mise en oeuvre et diffusion</B><BR>

<P>16) Les &Eacute;tats respecteront et feront respecter les obligations qui leur incombent en vertu du droit international applicable en cas de conflit arm&eacute;, y compris les r&egrave;gles prot&eacute;geant l'environnement en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute;.<BR>

Protocole I, art. 36<BR>

<P>19) Dans le cas d'un conflit arm&eacute;, les parties &agrave; ce conflit sont encourag&eacute;es &agrave; faciliter et prot&eacute;ger l'action des organismes impartiaux contribuant &agrave; emp&ecirc;cher ou &agrave; r&eacute;parer les dommages caus&eacute;s &agrave; l'environnement, en vertu d'accords sp&eacute;ciaux entre les parties concern&eacute;es ou, selon le cas, de l'autorisation accord&eacute;e par l'une d'entre elles. L'accomplissement de ces t&acirc;ches devrait se faire en tenant d&ucirc;ment compte de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; des parties concern&eacute;es.<BR>

<H2>Central Tracing Agency</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>IN 1994 THE ICRC:</B></H4>
<P>	<I>- forwarded 7,721,650 Red Cross messages including 6,758,736 in connection with the conflict in the 		  former Yugoslavia; </I><BR>
<I>	- reunited 4,149 families; - traced 5,143 people; </I><BR>
<I>	- received 43,248 new tracing requests. </I><BR>

<P>
<P>The ICRC Central Tracing Agency (CTA) is the unit of the Operations Department which, on both technical and practical levels, pursues the objectives set by each delegation with respect to the restoration of family ties severed during situations of armed conflict or internal violence. In this capacity, it has helped from its very inception to provide moral and psychological support for the victims whom the ICRC assists: prisoners of war, security detainees, civilian internees, unaccompanied children, civilians stranded in a hostile environment, displaced persons, refugees and so forth. Family messages are the CTA's main tool in carrying out this task. <BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Family messages: a tradition </B></H3>
<P>
<P>Introduced in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, family messages are a rapid, simple and effective means of putting separated relatives back in touch with one another. The unique worldwide network constituted by the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies ensures the efficiency of the system.<BR>

<P> In 1994, over 100 National Societies took part in the collection and distribution of almost 7 million messages in connection with the ICRC's operation in the former Yugoslavia. The system is used when traditional means of communication have broken down, but it does much more than simply make up for the shortcomings of official postal services. Indeed, the delivery of family messages frequently involves painstaking efforts - sometimes door-to-door enquiries - to trace the addressees. Appeals are often broadcast on local or national radio stations to supplement these efforts in the field. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<H4><B>IN 1994 THE ICRC:</B></H4>
<P>
<P><I>- registered 37,000 unaccompanied Rwandan children; </I><BR>

<P><I>- restored contact between more than 1,300 Rwandan children and their families. This figure does not include      children registered by the ICRC who were reunited with their families through other channels. </I><BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Broadcasting and computer technology</B></H3>
<P>
<P> Radio broadcasting played a major role in 1994, when the conflict which ravaged Rwanda caused countless numbers of children to be separated from their parents. Every day the BBC and Radio Agatashya, run by Reporters sans fronti&egrave;res, broadcast the names of children registered by the ICRC and called on parents to submit tracing requests at ICRC offices and delegations. Under the large-scale programme set up in June in conjunction with UNHCR, UNICEF and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the names and whereabouts of 37,000 children were registered. Many other humanitarian organizations present in the field also took part in the effort. Although this operation was doubtless the largest of its kind ever to be carried out by the ICRC on behalf of children separated from their relatives, it was successfully managed thanks to the experience acquired during similar operations to reunite Mozambican, Liberian and Cambodian children - to mention but a few examples - with their families. Moreover, the operation would have been impossible without high-performance computer technology and the tireless efforts of hundreds of dedicated professionals and volunteers. <BR>

<P>When family ties cannot be restored by the means described above, the ICRC approaches the relevant authorities to try and find out what has become of a missing relative. Obviously, such a step is effective only insofar as the parties to a conflict are willing in practice to cooperate with the ICRC. In today's world, where war is increasingly accompanied by the collapse of government structures, this presents the ICRC with a growing challenge. <BR>

<P>Another essential aspect of the CTA's work is its indirect contribution to safeguarding protected persons - detainees, unaccompanied children, civilians, etc. - by following them up on an individual basis. In 1994, for example, the ICRC kept track of no fewer than 26,898 people detained by government authorities or by opposition movements. Today this particular task can be carried out with the help of the latest computer technology, which makes it possible for individual cases to be followed up with great efficiency by personnel trained for the job. <BR>

<P>By virtue of the ICRC's right of initiative, the CTA continues to issue certificates of captivity and death on the basis of information gathered during conflicts - even conflicts long past - and delivers them either to the victims themselves or to their close relatives. <BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Development of the tracing network </B></H3>
<P>
<P>In pursuance of the mandate entrusted to it by various resolutions of International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the CTA contributes to the development of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies that wish to set up their own tracing services. In this connection, the CTA took part in several training courses held in the Ukraine and the Russian Federation in 1994. </P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/Separator_Line_ICRC.gif" BORDER=0><P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/ButtonBar.gif" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#ButtonBar"><BR>

<H2>Activities for people deprived  of their freedom</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>IN 1994 THE ICRC:</B></H4>
<P><I>	- visited 99,020 detainees in 55 countries; </I><BR>
<I>	- provided detainees and their families with material and medical assistance worth approximately 		  2,800,000 Swiss   francs; </I><BR>
<I>	- provided detainees and their families with financial assistance equivalent to 1,375,000 Swiss francs. </I><BR>

<P>
<P> In 1994 the ICRC continued to act, on strictly humanitarian grounds, as a neutral intermediary between parties to conflict or between detaining authorities and the people they were holding. To this end the ICRC monitored every situation of armed conflict (whether international or internal) and internal violence (internal disturbances or crises liable to cause humanitarian problems). In most cases it considered it necessary to offer its services to the governments or parties concerned with a view to visiting all persons held in connection with the events. <BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Visits to people deprived of their freedom </B></H3>
<P>
<P>As in the past, the purpose of these visits was to examine the material and psychological conditions of detention and the treatment accorded to detainees following their arrest. The ICRC passed on its findings and recommendations to the authorities within the framework of a permanent and confidential dialogue, and periodically submitted written reports to the highest authorities of the countries concerned. These reports, which were also confidential, presented an overview of the problems observed and proposed various solutions. Over 200 delegates, doctors and nurses took part in such visits. <BR>

<P>Throughout the year under review the ICRC continued to visit people captured or detained in connection with the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Following the signing of a federation agreement between the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Croats in March, delegates took an active part in operations to release the detainees held by both sides. The ICRC also organized several operations in which prisoners held by the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian government were simultaneously released. Moreover, under an agreement reached with the authorities of Montenegro, the ICRC visited all the security detainees held in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. <BR>

<P>In the Commonwealth of Independent States, and in particular in connection with the conflict in Nagorny Karabakh, the problem of hostages held by individuals became less acute, although no solution was found. In 1994 women, children and elderly people were still being held in prisons run by the official authorities. The ICRC lent its support to several release operations by transporting the detainees back home. However, it obtained only very limited access to the people captured and detained in this conflict and experienced considerable difficulty in performing the tasks within its mandate. <BR>

<P>The situation in Liberia and in Sierra Leone remained in deadlock, with ever more tragic results for the civilian population. For security reasons the ICRC had to withdraw all its delegates from the field and only detainees held in Monrovia and Freetown continued to receive visits. <BR>

<P>In the aftermath of the conflict between Iraq and Iran, the ICRC made formal representations to the two belligerents (and also to several States party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions) on the basis of Article 1 common to the four Conventions. Six years after the cessation of hostilities, it called on the two parties to authorize delegates to resume their visits to prisoners of war with a view to having all prisoners repatriated in accordance with Article 118 of the Third Geneva Convention. <BR>

<P>The ICRC's presence continued to be necessary in Sri Lanka, Indonesia/East Timor, the Philippines, Bhutan, Israel, the occupied territories and the autonomous territories, South Africa, Peru and Columbia. As in the past, ICRC delegates visited prisoners coming within the institution's purview.<BR>

<P> After an amnesty was declared for all security detainees in Malawi, the ICRC closed its permanent office there, having made regular visits to the country's 27 prisons for two years. In several situations of armed conflict or internal violence, such as those in Algeria, Turkey and Senegal, the ICRC continued its efforts to obtain access to all victims. <BR>

<P>
<H3><B>New developments </B></H3>
<P>
<P>During the appalling upsurge of violence in Rwanda the ICRC remained on the spot, although its activities to protect the civilian population were necessarily limited in scope. As soon as a measure of peace was restored, however, ICRC delegates visited about 14,000 people detained by the government. The ICRC also rehabilitated the water supply and waste water disposal systems in the country's prisons and provided considerable medical assistance. Around the month of November a marked improvement in detention conditions was observed. <BR>
Following the international intervention in Haiti, from October on the ICRC visited more than 100 security detainees held by the United States forces in a permanent place of detention. The ICRC also began to visit all places where penal-law prisoners were being held by the Haitian authorities, in an effort to improve conditions of detention. In Cambodia, for the first time, the ICRC was able to visit two persons held by the Khmer Rouge. Both these detainees, along with 14 others, were freed in late March under the auspices of the ICRC, which took them back to the government-controlled zone. Following the agreement signed by Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in September 1993, the ICRC made major changes in its operation in the area and reoriented its activities in the autonomous Palestinian territories. On 13 July, the ICRC and the PLO signed a framework agreement which, among other things, authorized ICRC delegates to visit people detained by the Palestinian authorities in the autonomous territories. These visits began in August. In 1994 violent fighting broke out in Yemen, where the ICRC visited about 3,000 detainees held by the military, both in Aden and in Sana'a. After the coup which toppled the Gambian government in July the ICRC proposed its services to the new government, which authorized it to visit all persons arrested in connection with the events. Following two years of negotiations, the Chad government accepted the ICRC's offer of services relating to visits to people detained for security reasons. Visits began in April and were extended throughout the country. In Zaire, the sharp deterioration in material conditions of detention prompted the ICRC to set up an assistance programme focusing mainly on food aid. The programme was planned with the help of church and non-governmental organizations specialized in prison work. <BR>

<P>In Afghanistan, during the second half of the year the ICRC resumed its visits to people detained by the government and by various factions, including the Hezb-i-Islami of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. In Grenada, after a nine-year interruption, the ICRC was authorized to visit 17 security detainees held in connection with the American intervention in 1983. With regard to the Morocco/Western Sahara conflict, the ICRC achieved considerable progress in 1994 by making a first visit to 980 Moroccan prisoners held by the Polisario Front. Most of these men had been in captivity for over 15 years. The visit brought the number of Moroccan prisoners of the Polisario Front registered by the ICRC since 1975 to 2,140. ICRC delegates also visited 66 Sahrawi combatants detained  in Morocco.</P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/Separator_Line_ICRC.gif" BORDER=0><P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/ButtonBar.gif" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#ButtonBar"><BR>

<H2>Meeting of intergovernmental group of experts for the Protection of War Victims (Geneva, 23 - 27 January 1995)</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Follow-up to the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims, Geneva, 30 August - 1 September 1993</B></H4>
<P>
<P>	<BR>
In its Final Declaration, the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims (Geneva, 30 August - 1 September 1993) undertook to give practical effect to its refusal to accept grave violations of international humanitarian law in the following terms:<BR>

<P>	<I>&quot;With this Declaration in mind, we reaffirm the necessity to make the implementation of international humanitarian law more effective. In this sprit, we call upon the Swiss Government to convene an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts to study practical means of promoting full respect for and compliance with that law, and to prepare a report for submission to the States and to the next session of the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent</I>.&quot; [1]<BR>

<P>	In accordance with the Conference's decision, the Swiss Federal Council organized a meeting in Geneva from 23 to 27 January 1995, to which it invited representatives of the States party to the Geneva Conventions, and, as observers, a number of governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with humanitarian matters. Switzerland thus invited the same group of participants as for the 1993 Conference. Unlike that conference, however, the meeting took place at the technical level, with a view to devising practical means of promoting respect for humanitarian obligations in times of armed conflict.<BR>

<P>	The experts, representing 107 States and 28 governmental and non-governmental organizations, met for five days in Geneva. Ambassador A. Luzius Caflisch, legal adviser to the Department of Foreign Affairs (Switzerland), acted as Chairman and Ambassador Sedfrey A. Ordo&ntilde;ez (Philippines) as Vice-Chairman. The Working Party was chaired by Ambassador Philippe Kirsch (Canada), assisted by Ambassador Jorge Berguno (Chile) as Vice-Chairman.<BR>

<P>	The experts concentrated on the points which a preparatory meeting, held in Geneva from 26 to 28 September 1994, had recommended for further study. These recommendations were published in the International Review of the Red Cross. [2]<BR>

<P>	The experts were also provided with a working document prepared by Switzerland on the basis of the preparatory meeting's recommendations and in consultation with the States.[3] The ICRC submitted its own suggestions concerning the nine recommendations.[4]<BR>

<P>	After five days of intensive discussions and negotiations, the experts adopted by consensus a set of &quot;Recommendations&quot; which, in accordance with its mandate, the group will be submitting to the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.[5] In chapters I to VII, the text identifies many possible ways of ensuring that humanitarian law is better accepted, understood and respected, ranging from educating the population as a whole to punishing violations. The ICRC is encouraged to provide support services in that respect, while attention is drawn to the role played by the National Societies in their own countries. Several delegations were disappointed that the group had not gone a stage further, for instance by recommending the institution of a system of mandatory reports concerning the implementation of international humanitarian law, a proposal which in the end the meeting failed to adopt. In the VIIIth recommendation, on the other hand, the ICRC is asked to address some particularly difficult problems.<BR>

<P>	It may be remembered that in its Final Declaration the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims called on Switzerland to prepare a report for submission to the States and to the next session of the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. The Intergovernmental Group of Experts' recommendations undoubtedly provide a sound basis for the discussions of the 26th International Conference. It is now up to the delegates of the States and the representatives of the Movement meeting at that Conference in Geneva in December 1995 to take the necessary decisions, while bearing in mind the original goal, namely improved protection for war victims.<BR>

<H2>F&eacute;d&eacute;ration de Russie/Nord-Caucase : Grozny manque d'eau potable</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Les combats entre les forces f&eacute;d&eacute;rales russes et les combattants s&eacute;paratistes tch&eacute;tch&egrave;nes ont &eacute;t&eacute; d'une extr&ecirc;me violence au cours des 20 derniers mois, notamment &agrave; Grozny. La ville a subi d'importants d&eacute;g&acirc;ts &agrave; plusieurs reprises. Au mois d'ao&ucirc;t, ses infrastructures vitales ont une fois de plus &eacute;t&eacute; touch&eacute;es, privant ses habitants (actuellement estim&eacute;s &agrave; 80 000) d'eau potable, d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute; et de soins m&eacute;dicaux. En effet, tous les h&ocirc;pitaux ont &eacute;t&eacute;, soit d&eacute;truits, soit gravement endommag&eacute;s lors des affrontements.<BR>

<P>La distribution d'eau potable &agrave; Grozny reste l'une des priorit&eacute;s du CICR. D&egrave;s que la situation l'a permis (fin ao&ucirc;t) et que les ing&eacute;nieurs du CICR ont pu atteindre la seule station de pompage encore utilisable dans la ville, les distributions &agrave; la population ont recommenc&eacute;. Remise en &eacute;tat de fonctionner, la station que le CICR avait  install&eacute;e en f&eacute;vrier 1995 fournit aujourd'hui 400 000 litres d'eau chlor&eacute;e par jour. De ce total, 200 000 &agrave; 250 000 litres sont transport&eacute;s par des camions-citernes du CICR qui alimentent les r&eacute;servoirs de nombreux points de distribution. Ils fournissent ainsi, en moyenne, trois litres du pr&eacute;cieux liquide &agrave; chaque habitant.<BR>
 <BR>
D'ici la semaine prochaine, et dans la perspective d'un retour progressif des habitants &agrave; Grozny, le CICR pr&eacute;voit d'augmenter ses distributions d'eau &agrave; 500 000 litres par jour. Ce sera possible gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'arriv&eacute;e de trois camions suppl&eacute;mentaires, d'une capacit&eacute; de 20 000 litres chacun (l'un d'eux a &eacute;t&eacute; mis &agrave; disposition par la Croix-Rouge danoise).<BR>
 Par ailleurs, les programmes &quot;eau et assainissement&quot; du CICR se poursuivent dans la r&eacute;gion, comme &agrave; Goudermes, o&ugrave; 200 000 litres sont distribu&eacute;s chaque jour. Ou encore &agrave; Khasavyurt (Daghestan), o&ugrave; les ing&eacute;nieurs travaillent &agrave; la r&eacute;habilitation de la station de pompage principale de la ville.

<P><I>Le Manuel de San Remo sur le droit international applicable aux</I> <I>conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer </I>a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;labor&eacute;, de 1988 &agrave; 1994, par un groupe d'experts du droit international et d'experts navals qui ont particip&eacute;, &agrave; titre personnel, &agrave; une s&eacute;rie de tables rondes organis&eacute;es par l'Institut international de droit humanitaire.  Le but de cet ouvrage est de pr&eacute;senter une analyse du contenu du droit international actuel applicable aux conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer.  Si, parmi les dispositions figurant dans le Manuel, certaines peuvent appara&icirc;tre comme des d&eacute;veloppements du droit, la plupart sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme &eacute;non&ccedil;ant le droit actuellement en vigueur.  Les experts ayant particip&eacute; aux tables rondes voient dans ce Manuel, &agrave; bien des &eacute;gards, un &eacute;quivalent moderne de <I>l'Oxford Manual on the Laws of</I> <I>Naval War Governing the Relations between BelligerentsI </I>[1], adopt&eacute; en 1913 par l'Institut de droit international. Si l'&eacute;laboration d'un nouveau manuel a &eacute;t&eacute; jug&eacute;e n&eacute;cessaire, c'est en raison des d&eacute;veloppements qu'a connus le droit depuis 1913 et qui, pour la plupart, n'ont pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; incorpor&eacute;s dans le droit conventionnel r&eacute;cent, la IIe Convention de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949 &eacute;tant essentiellement limit&eacute;e &agrave; la protection des bless&eacute;s, des malades et des naufrag&eacute;s en mer.  Le droit des conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer, en particulier, n'a connu aucun d&eacute;veloppement comparable &agrave; celui du droit des conflits arm&eacute;s sur terre ayant abouti au Protocole I de 1977, additionnel aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949.  Certaines dispositions du Protocole I s'appliquent, il est vrai, aux op&eacute;rations navales.  C'est notamment le cas des dispositions qui renforcent la protection accord&eacute;e par la lIe<B> </B>Convention de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949 aux navires et aux a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires.  En revanche, le titre IV du Procotole I, concernant la protection des civils contre les effets des hostilit&eacute;s, n'est applicable qu'aux op&eacute;rations navales qui affectent les civils et les biens civils sur terre.<BR>

<P>Organis&eacute; par l'Institut international de droit humanitaire, en collaboration avec l'Institut de droit international de l'Universit&eacute; de Pise (Italie) et l'Universit&eacute; de Syracuse (Etats-Unis), une table ronde pr&eacute;liminaire sur le droit international humanitaire applicable aux conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer a entrepris un premier examen du droit existant.  La table ronde de Madrid, organis&eacute;e en 1988 par l'Institut international de droit humanitaire, a &eacute;labor&eacute; un plan d'action visant &agrave; pr&eacute;parer une analyse du contenu du droit actuel qui r&eacute;git les conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer.  Conform&eacute;ment &agrave; son mandat consistant &agrave; pr&eacute;parer le d&eacute;veloppement du droit international humanitaire, le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge a apport&eacute; un soutien constant &agrave; ce projet.  Pour assurer la mise en oeuvre du Plan d'action adopt&eacute; &agrave; Madrid, l'Institut a organis&eacute; des tables rondes annuelles: Bochum (1989), Toulon (1990), Bergen (1991), Ottawa (1992), Gen&egrave;ve (1993) et, enfin, Livourne (1994).  C'est sur la base de rapports tr&egrave;s complets &eacute;tablis pour chacune des r&eacute;unions par les rapporteurs, ainsi que des commentaires apport&eacute;s &agrave; ces rapports par les participants et des d&eacute;bats approfondis qui ont eu lieu lors des tables rondes, que le Manuel a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;dig&eacute; avant d'&ecirc;tre finalement adopt&eacute; &agrave; Livourne en juin 1994.<BR>

<P>Le commentaire d'accompagnement, intitul&eacute; <I>Explanation (Explication), </I>a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;labor&eacute; par un groupe restreint d'experts qui &eacute;taient aussi les rapporteurs d&eacute;sign&eacute;s pour les tables rondes.  Il convient de lire en parall&egrave;le ces deux ouvrages pour comprendre pleinement les dispositions du Manuel.<BR>

<H3><B>1re PARTIE</B><B><I> </I></B><B>: DISPOSITIONS G&Eacute;N&Eacute;RALES</B></H3>
<P>
<H4><B>SECTION I : CHAMP D'APPLICATION DU DROIT</B></H4>
<P>
<P>1. Les parties &agrave; un conflit arm&eacute; sur mer sont li&eacute;es par les r&egrave;gles et principes du droit international humanitaire &agrave; partir du moment o&ugrave; la force arm&eacute;e est utilis&eacute;e.<BR>

<P>2. Dans les cas non pr&eacute;vus par ce document ou par des accords internationaux, les personnes civiles et les combattants restent sous la sauvegarde et sous l'empire des principes du droit des gens, tels qu'ils r&eacute;sultent des usages &eacute;tablis, des principes de l'humanit&eacute; et des exigences de la conscience publique.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H4><B>SECTION II : CONFLITS ARM&Eacute;S ET DROIT DE L&Eacute;GITIME D&Eacute;FENSE</B></H4>
<P>
<P>3. L'exercice du droit de l&eacute;gitime d&eacute;fense individuelle ou collective reconnu &agrave; l'Article 51 de la Charte des Nations Unies est soumis aux conditions et aux limitations &eacute;tablies dans cette m&ecirc;me Charte et &eacute;manant du droit international g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, y inclus en particulier les principes de n&eacute;cessit&eacute; et de proportionnalit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>4. Les principes de n&eacute;cessit&eacute; et de proportionnalit&eacute; s'appliquent &eacute;galement aux conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer et requi&egrave;rent que l'emploi de la force par un Etat, lorsqu'il n'est pas interdit par le droit des conflits arm&eacute;s, ne d&eacute;passe pas, en intensit&eacute; et par les moyens employ&eacute;s, ce qui est indispensable pour repousser une attaque arm&eacute;e et pour r&eacute;tablir sa s&eacute;curit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>5. La limite des actions militaires que peut mener un Etat contre un ennemi d&eacute;pend de l'intensit&eacute; et de l'ampleur de l'attaque arm&eacute;e perp&eacute;tr&eacute;e par l'ennemi et de la gravit&eacute; de la menace qu'elle pr&eacute;sente.<BR>

<P>6. Les r&egrave;gles &eacute;nonc&eacute;es dans ce document et toute autre r&egrave;gle du droit international humanitaire s'appliquent de fa&ccedil;on &eacute;gale &agrave; toutes les parties au conflit.  L'application &eacute;gale de ces r&egrave;gles &agrave; toutes les parties au conflit n'est pas affect&eacute;e par la responsabilit&eacute; internationale de l'une d'entre elles pour avoir d&eacute;clench&eacute; le conflit.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H4><B>SECTION III : CONFLITS ARM&Eacute;S DANS LESQUELS LE CONSEIL DE S&Eacute;CURIT&Eacute; A ENTREPRIS DES ACTIONS</B></H4>
<P>
<P>7. Nonobstant toute r&egrave;gle contenue dans ce document ou dans le droit de la neutralit&eacute;, lorsque le Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, agissant conform&eacute;ment aux comp&eacute;tences que lui conf&egrave;re le Chapitre VII de la Charte des Nations Unies, a d&eacute;sign&eacute; une ou plusieurs parties &agrave; un conflit arm&eacute; comme responsables de l'emploi de la force en violation du droit international, les Etats neutres:<BR>

<P>a) sont tenus de ne pas pr&ecirc;ter &agrave; cet Etat une assistance autre qu'humanitaire; et<BR>

<P>b) peuvent pr&ecirc;ter assistance &agrave; tout Etat victime d'une rupture de la paix ou d'un acte d'agression commis par cet Etat.<BR>

<P>8. Quand, au cours d'un conflit arm&eacute; international, le Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; a pris des mesures pr&eacute;ventives ou coercitives impliquant la mise en oeuvre de mesures &eacute;conomiques en application du Chapitre VII de la Charte, les Etats Membres des Nations Unies ne peuvent pas invoquer le droit de la neutralit&eacute; pour justifier un comportement incompatible avec les obligations que leur imposent la Charte ou les d&eacute;cisions du Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>9. Conform&eacute;ment aux dispositions du paragraphe 7, lorsque le Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; prend la d&eacute;cision d'employer la force, ou d'en autoriser l'emploi par un ou plusieurs Etats, les r&egrave;gles &eacute;nonc&eacute;es dans ce document et toute autre r&egrave;gle du droit humanitaire international applicable aux conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer doivent s'appliquer &agrave; toutes les parties &agrave; un tel conflit.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION IV : ZONES DE LA GUERRE NAVALE</B></H4>
<P>
<P>10. Sous r&eacute;serve d'autres r&egrave;gles applicables du droit des conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer, qu'elles figurent ou non dans ce document, des actions hostiles peuvent &ecirc;tre men&eacute;es par les forces navales en surface, sous l'eau ou au-dessus:<BR>

<P>a)	de la mer territoriale et des eaux int&eacute;rieures, des territoires terrestres, de la zone &eacute;conomique exclusive et du plateau continental et, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, des eaux archip&eacute;lagiques des Etats bellig&eacute;rants;<BR>

<P>b)	de la haute mer; et<BR>

<P>c)	sous r&eacute;serve des dispositions pr&eacute;vues aux paragraphes 34 et 35, dans la zone &eacute;conomique exclusive et sur le plateau continental des Etats neutres.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION I : EAUX INT&Eacute;RIEURES, MER TERRITORIALE ET EAUX ARCHIP&Eacute;LAGIQUES</B></H4>
<P>
<P>14. Les eaux neutres comprennent les eaux int&eacute;rieures, la mer territoriale et, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, les eaux archip&eacute;lagiques des Etats neutres.  L'espace a&eacute;rien neutre comprend l'espace a&eacute;rien surjacent aux eaux neutres et au territoire terrestre d'Etats neutres.<BR>

<P>15. Les actions hostiles de forces bellig&eacute;rantes sont interdites dans les eaux neutres et au-dessus de celles-ci, y compris les eaux neutres d'un d&eacute;troit international et les eaux dans lesquelles peut s'exercer le droit de passage archip&eacute;lagique.  Conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la section Il de cette partie, un Etat neutre doit prendre des mesures, y compris des mesures de surveillance, en fonction des moyens &agrave; sa disposition, afin de pr&eacute;venir la violation de sa neutralit&eacute; par des forces bellig&eacute;rantes.<BR>

<P>16. Les actions hostiles au sens du paragraphe 15 comprennent, entre autres:<BR>

<P>a) l'attaque ou la capture de personnes ou biens dans ou au-dessus des eaux ou territoire neutres;<BR>

<P>b) l'utilisation comme une base d'op&eacute;rations, y compris l'attaque ou la capture de personnes ou de biens situ&eacute;s en dehors des eaux neutres pour autant que l'attaque ou la capture soient men&eacute;es par les forces bellig&eacute;rantes &agrave; la surface, sous ou au-dessus des eaux neutres;<BR>

<P>c) le mouillage de mines; ou<BR>

<P>d) la visite, la perquisition, le d&eacute;tournement ou la capture.<BR>

<P>17. Les forces bellig&eacute;rantes ne doivent pas se servir des eaux neutres comme refuge.<BR>

<P>18.	Les a&eacute;ronefs militaires et auxiliaires des bellig&eacute;rants ne doivent pas p&eacute;n&eacute;trer dans l'espace a&eacute;rien neutre.  S'ils le font, l'Etat neutre peut utiliser les moyens qui sont &agrave; sa disposition pour forcer les a&eacute;ronefs &agrave; atterrir sur son territoire, les mettre sous s&eacute;questre et interner leur &eacute;quipage pendant la dur&eacute;e du conflit arm&eacute;.  Si les a&eacute;ronefs refusent de suivre l'ordre d'atterrir, ils peuvent &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute;s, sous r&eacute;serve des r&egrave;gles sp&eacute;ciales concernant les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires telles que pr&eacute;cis&eacute;es aux paragraphes 181-183.<BR>

<P>19. Sous r&eacute;serve des paragraphes 29 et 33, un Etat neutre peut, sans faire de discrimination, soumettre &agrave; des conditions, restreindre ou interdire l'entr&eacute;e ou le passage dans ses eaux aux navires de guerre et navires auxiliaires bellig&eacute;rants.<BR>

<P>20. Compte tenu du devoir d'impartialit&eacute;, des paragraphes 21 et 23-33 et des r&egrave;gles qu'il pourra &eacute;tablir, un Etat neutre peut, sans mettre en cause sa neutralit&eacute;, autoriser les actes suivants dans ses eaux:<BR>

<P>a) le passage par sa mer territoriale et, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, ses eaux archip&eacute;lagiques, des navires de guerre, des navires auxiliaires et des prises des Etats bellig&eacute;rants; des navires de guerre, des navires auxiliaires et des prises peuvent utiliser les services de pilotes de l'Etat neutre pendant leur passage;<BR>

<P>b) le ravitaillement en nourriture, eau et combustibles par un bellig&eacute;rant de ses navires de guerre ou navires auxiliaires pour que ceux-ci puissent atteindre un port de son propre territoire, et<BR>

<P>c) les travaux de r&eacute;paration de navires de guerre ou de navires auxiliaires bellig&eacute;rants estim&eacute;s n&eacute;cessaires par l'Etat neutre pour les remettre en &eacute;tat de naviguer; de telles r&eacute;parations ne doivent pas r&eacute;tablir ou augmenter leurs capacit&eacute;s de combat.<BR>

<P>21. Un navire de guerre ou un navire auxiliaire bellig&eacute;rants ne doivent pas prolonger la dur&eacute;e de leur passage dans des eaux neutres, ou de leur s&eacute;jour dans ces eaux, pour ravitaillement ou r&eacute;paration, au-del&agrave; de vingt-quatre heures sauf si les dommages subis ou les mauvaises conditions atmosph&eacute;riques le rendent in&eacute;vitable. Cette r&egrave;gle ne s'applique pas aux d&eacute;troits internationaux et aux eaux dans lesquelles s'exerce le droit de passage archip&eacute;lagique.<BR>

<P>22. Si un Etat bellig&eacute;rant viole le r&eacute;gime des eaux neutres tel qu'&eacute;nonc&eacute; dans ce document, l'Etat neutre doit prendre les mesures n&eacute;cessaires pour faire cesser la violation. Si l'Etat neutre manque &agrave; son obligation de mettre fin &agrave; la violation de ses eaux par un bellig&eacute;rant, le bellig&eacute;rant adverse doit le notifier &agrave; l'Etat neutre et lui donner un d&eacute;lai raisonnable pour mettre fin &agrave; cette violation. Si la violation de la neutralit&eacute; de l'Etat par un bellig&eacute;rant constitue une menace s&eacute;rieuse et imm&eacute;diate &agrave; la s&eacute;curit&eacute; du bellig&eacute;rant adverse et si cette violation perdure, cet Etat bellig&eacute;rant peut, en l'absence d'une autre mesure r&eacute;alisable &agrave; temps, avoir recours &agrave; la force strictement n&eacute;cessaire pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; la menace que constitue cette violation.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION II : D&Eacute;TROITS INTERNATIONAUX ET VOIES DE CIRCULATION ARCHIP&Eacute;LAGIQUES</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B><I>R&egrave;gles g&eacute;n&eacute;rales</I></B><BR>

<P>23. Les navires de guerre, navires auxiliaires, a&eacute;ronefs militaires et auxiliaires bellig&eacute;rants peuvent exercer leur droit de passage par, sous ou au-dessus des d&eacute;troits internationaux neutres et des voies de circulation archip&eacute;lagiques reconnus par le droit international g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.<BR>

<P>24. La neutralit&eacute; de l'Etat riverain d'un d&eacute;troit international n'est pas remise en cause par le passage en transit de navires de guerre, navires auxiliaires, a&eacute;ronefs militaires et auxiliaires bellig&eacute;rants, ni du fait du passage inoffensif de navires de guerre ou auxiliaires bellig&eacute;rants par ce d&eacute;troit.<BR>

<P>25. La neutralit&eacute; d'un Etat archipel n'est pas remise en cause du fait de l'exercice du droit de passage archip&eacute;lagique par les navires de guerre, navires auxiliaires, a&eacute;ronefs militaires et auxiliaires bellig&eacute;rants.<BR>

<P>26. Les navires de guerre, navires auxiliaires, a&eacute;ronefs militaires et auxiliaires neutres peuvent exercer le droit de passage par, sous et au-dessus des d&eacute;troits internationaux et des eaux archip&eacute;lagiques des bellig&eacute;rants conform&eacute;ment au droit international g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.  Par mesure de pr&eacute;caution, l'Etat neutre doit informer l'Etat bellig&eacute;rant en temps voulu de l'exercice de son droit de passage.<BR>

<P><B><I>Passage en transit et passage archip&eacute;lagique</I></B><BR>

<P>27. Les droits de passage en transit et archip&eacute;lagique, qui s'exercent dans les d&eacute;troits internationaux et dans les eaux archip&eacute;lagiques en temps de paix persistent en p&eacute;riode de conflit arm&eacute;.  Les lois et r&egrave;glements des Etats riverains des d&eacute;troits et des Etats archipels concernant le passage en transit et le passage archip&eacute;lagique adopt&eacute;s conform&eacute;ment au droit international g&eacute;n&eacute;ral restent en vigueur.<BR>

<P>28. Les navires de surface, les sous-marins et les a&eacute;ronefs neutres ou bellig&eacute;rants jouissent du droit de passage en transit et archip&eacute;lagique par, sous et au-dessus de tous les d&eacute;troits et eaux archip&eacute;lagiques o&ugrave; ces droits s'appliquent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement.<BR>

<P>29. Les Etats neutres n'ont pas le droit de suspendre, entraver ou emp&ecirc;cher de toute autre fa&ccedil;on le passage en transit et archip&eacute;lagique.<BR>

<P>30. Un bellig&eacute;rant en passage en transit par, sous ou au-dessus d'un d&eacute;troit international ou en passage archip&eacute;lagique par, sous ou au-dessus des eaux archip&eacute;lagiques d'un Etat neutre, doit traverser sans retard, s'abstenir de recourir &agrave; la menace ou &agrave; l'emploi de la force contre l'int&eacute;grit&eacute; territoriale ou l'ind&eacute;pendance politique d'un Etat riverain ou d'un Etat archipel neutre, ou de toute autre mani&egrave;re contraire aux buts de la Charte des Nations Unies, et il ne doit en aucune mani&egrave;re engager d'actions hostiles ou des activit&eacute;s n'ayant aucun rapport avec le transit. Des bellig&eacute;rants passant par, sous ou au-dessus de d&eacute;troits ou d'eaux archip&eacute;lagiques neutres, sont autoris&eacute;s &agrave; prendre les mesures d&eacute;fensives requises pour leur s&eacute;curit&eacute;, comprenant le lancement et l'appontage d'a&eacute;ronefs, la navigation en formation et la surveillance &eacute;lectronique et acoustique.  Les bellig&eacute;rants en transit ou en passage archip&eacute;lagique n'ont pas le droit, cependant, de mener des op&eacute;rations offensives contre des forces ennemies, ni d'utiliser ces eaux neutres comme refuge ou base d'op&eacute;rations.<BR>

<P><B><I>Passage inoffensif</I></B><BR>

<P>31. En plus de l'exercice du droit de passage en transit et archip&eacute;lagique, les navires de guerre et les navires auxiliaires bellig&eacute;rants peuvent, sous r&eacute;serve des dispositions des paragraphes 19 et 21, exercer le droit de passage inoffensif par les d&eacute;troits internationaux et eaux archip&eacute;lagiques neutres conform&eacute;ment au droit international g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.<BR>

<P>32. De m&ecirc;me, les navires neutres peuvent exercer le droit de passage inoffensif par les d&eacute;troits internationaux et les eaux archip&eacute;lagiques des Etats bellig&eacute;rants.<BR>

<P>33. Le droit de passage inoffensif qui ne peut pas &ecirc;tre suspendu, dont le droit international dote certains d&eacute;troits internationaux, persiste &eacute;galement en temps de conflit arm&eacute;.<BR>

<P><B>SECTION III : ZONE &Eacute;CONOMIQUE EXCLUSIVE ET PLATEAU CONTINENTAL</B><BR>

<P>34. Si des actions hostiles sont men&eacute;es dans la zone &eacute;conomique exclusive ou sur le plateau continental d'un Etat neutre, les Etats bellig&eacute;rants doivent, non seulement se conformer aux autres r&egrave;gles en vigueur du droit des conflits arm&eacute;s sur mer, mais &eacute;galement prendre d&ucirc;ment en compte les droits et les devoirs de l'Etat c&ocirc;tier, entre autres, pour l'exploration et l'exploitation des ressources &eacute;conomiques de la zone &eacute;conomique exclusive et du plateau continental et pour la protection et la pr&eacute;servation de l'environnement marin.  Ils doivent en particulier tenir d&ucirc;ment compte des &icirc;les artificielles,<B> </B>des installations, des ouvrages et des zones de s&eacute;curit&eacute; &eacute;tablies par les Etats neutres dans la zone &eacute;conomique exclusive et sur le plateau continental.<BR>

<P>35. Si un bellig&eacute;rant consid&egrave;re qu'il est n&eacute;cessaire de mouiller des mines dans la zone &eacute;conomique exclusive ou sur le plateau continental d'un Etat neutre, il doit le notifier &agrave; cet Etat et s'assurer, entre autres, que la dimension du champ de mines et que le type de mines utilis&eacute; ne mettent pas en danger les &icirc;les artificielles, les installations et ouvrages, ni ne fassent obstacle &agrave; leur acc&egrave;s, et il doit &eacute;viter autant que possible d'interf&eacute;rer avec l'exploration ou l'exploitation de la zone par l'Etat neutre.  La protection et la pr&eacute;servation de l'environnement marin doivent &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre prises d&ucirc;ment en compte.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION IV : HAUTE MER ET FONDS MARINS AU-DEL&Agrave; DES LIMITES DE LA JURIDICTION NATIONALE</B></H4>
<P>
<P>36. Les actions hostiles en haute mer doivent &ecirc;tre conduites en tenant d&ucirc;ment compte de l'exercice par les Etats neutres de leur droit &agrave; l'exploration et l'exploitation des ressources naturelles des fonds marins et de leur sous-sol au-del&agrave; de la juridiction nationale.<BR>

<P>37. Les bellig&eacute;rants doivent veiller &agrave; &eacute;viter d'endommager les c&acirc;bles et les pipelines pos&eacute;s sur les fonds marins qui ne servent pas exclusivement aux bellig&eacute;rants.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION I : R&Egrave;GLES FONDAMENTALES</B></H4>
<P>
<P>38. Dans tout conflit arm&eacute;, le droit des parties au conflit de choisir des m&eacute;thodes ou moyens de guerre n'est pas illimit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>39. Les parties au conflit doivent en tout temps faire la distinction entre les civils ou autres personnes prot&eacute;g&eacute;es et les combattants ainsi qu'entre les biens de caract&egrave;re civil ou exempts d'attaque et les objectifs militaires.<BR>

<P>40. En ce qui concerne les biens, les objectifs militaires sont limit&eacute;s aux biens qui, par leur nature, leur emplacement, leur destination ou leur utilisation apportent une contribution effective &agrave; l'action militaire et dont la destruction totale ou partielle, la capture ou la neutralisation offrent en l'occurrence un avantage militaire pr&eacute;cis.<BR>

<P>41. Les attaques doivent &ecirc;tre strictement limit&eacute;es aux objectifs militaires.  Les navires de commerce et les a&eacute;ronefs civils sont des biens de caract&egrave;re civil &agrave; moins que les principes et r&egrave;gles &eacute;nonc&eacute;s dans ce document n'autorisent &agrave; les consid&eacute;rer comme des objectifs militaires.<BR>

<P>42. En sus des interdictions sp&eacute;cifiques incombant aux parties &agrave; un conflit, il est interdit d'employer des m&eacute;thodes ou moyens de guerre qui:<BR>

<P>a) sont de nature &agrave; causer des maux superflus; ou<BR>

<P>b) frappent indistinctement des objectifs militaires et des civils puisque:<BR>

<P>i) ils ne sont pas, ou ne peuvent pas, &ecirc;tre dirig&eacute;s contre un objectif militaire d&eacute;termin&eacute;; ou<BR>

<P>ii) leurs effets ne peuvent &ecirc;tre limit&eacute;s conform&eacute;ment aux exigences du droit international &eacute;nonc&eacute;es dans le pr&eacute;sent document.<BR>

<P>43. Il est interdit d'ordonner qu'il n'y ait pas de survivants, d'en menacer l'adversaire ou de conduire les hostilit&eacute;s en fonction de cette d&eacute;cision.<BR>

<P>44. Les m&eacute;thodes et moyens de guerre doivent &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;s en tenant d&ucirc;ment compte de l'environnement naturel aux vues des r&egrave;gles pertinentes du droit international.  Les dommages et les actes de destruction de l'environnement naturel que ne justifient pas les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s militaires et qui sont entrepris arbitrairement, sont prohib&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>45. Les navires de surface, les sous-marins et les a&eacute;ronefs sont li&eacute;s par les m&ecirc;mes r&egrave;gles et principes.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION II : PR&Eacute;CAUTIONS DANS L'ATTAQUE</B></H4>
<P>
<P>46. En ce qui concerne les attaques, les pr&eacute;cautions suivantes doivent &ecirc;tre prises:<BR>

<P>a) ceux qui planifient, d&eacute;cident ou ex&eacute;cutent une attaque doivent prendre toutes les mesures possibles pour recueillir les informations qui les aideront &agrave; d&eacute;terminer si des biens qui ne sont pas des objectifs militaires se trouvent ou non dans la zone de l'attaque;<BR>

<P>b) &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de l'information dont ils disposent, ceux qui planifient, d&eacute;cident ou ex&eacute;cutent une attaque doivent prendre toutes les mesures possibles pour s'assurer que les attaques sont limit&eacute;es aux objectifs militaires;<BR>

<P>c) ils doivent de plus prendre toutes les pr&eacute;cautions possibles dans le choix des m&eacute;thodes et moyens, afin d'&eacute;viter ou de minimiser des pertes ou des dommages incidents; et<BR>

<P>d) une attaque ne doit pas &ecirc;tre lanc&eacute;e si l'on s'attend &agrave; ce qu'elle cause des pertes ou des dommages incidents qui seraient excessifs par rapport &agrave; l'avantage militaire direct et concret que l'on pense en retirer; une attaque doit &ecirc;tre annul&eacute;e ou suspendue d&egrave;s qu'il appara&icirc;t que les pertes ou dommages incidents sont excessifs.<BR>

<P>La section VI de cette partie pr&eacute;voit des pr&eacute;cautions suppl&eacute;mentaires concernant les a&eacute;ronefs civils.<BR>

<P><I>Navires h&ocirc;pitaux</I><BR>

<P>49. L'exemption d'attaque d'un navire h&ocirc;pital ne peut cesser que si les conditions d'exemption du paragraphe 48 ne sont pas respect&eacute;es et, dans un tel cas, seulement apr&egrave;s sommation fixant, dans tous les cas opportuns, un d&eacute;lai raisonnable pour supprimer la cause qui met en danger cette exemption et lorsqu'une telle sommation sera demeur&eacute;e sans effet.<BR>

<P>50. Si apr&egrave;s une sommation en bonne et due forme, un navire h&ocirc;pital persiste &agrave; ne pas respecter les conditions de son exemption, il peut &ecirc;tre captur&eacute; ou faire l'objet de toute autre mesure n&eacute;cessaire destin&eacute;e &agrave; lui faire respecter les conditions de son exemption.<BR>

<P>51. En dernier ressort, un navire h&ocirc;pital ne peut &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute; que:<BR>

<P>a) si le d&eacute;tournement ou la capture du navire ne sont pas r&eacute;alisables;<BR>

<P>b) s'il n'y a pas d'autres m&eacute;thodes pour exercer un contr&ocirc;le militaire;<BR>

<P>c) si les circonstances dans lesquelles le navire h&ocirc;pital ne respecte pas les r&egrave;gles sont suffisamment graves pour qu'il devienne, ou que l'on puisse raisonnablement en faire, un objectif militaire; et<BR>

<P>d) si les pertes ou dommages incidents ne sont pas disproportionn&eacute;s par rapport &agrave; l'avantage militaire obtenu ou attendu.<BR>

<P><I>Toutes les autres cat&eacute;gories de navires exemptes d'attaque</I><BR>

<P>52. Si un navire de n'importe quelle autre cat&eacute;gorie de navires exempte d'attaque enfreint une des conditions de son exemption stipul&eacute;es au paragraphe 48, ce navire ne peut &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute; que:<BR>

<P>a) si le d&eacute;tournement du navire ou sa capture ne sont pas r&eacute;alisables;<BR>

<P>b) s'il n'y a pas d'autres m&eacute;thodes pour exercer un contr&ocirc;le militaire;<BR>

<P>71. Toute attaque sur ces a&eacute;ronefs doit &ecirc;tre conforme aux r&egrave;gles fondamentales &eacute;nonc&eacute;es aux paragraphes 38-46.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION VI : PR&Eacute;CAUTIONS CONCERNANT LES A&Eacute;RONEFS CIVILS</B></H4>
<P>
<P>72. Les a&eacute;ronefs civils devraient &eacute;viter les zones d'activit&eacute;s militaires potentiellement dangereuses.<BR>

<P>73. A proximit&eacute; imm&eacute;diate d'op&eacute;rations navales, les a&eacute;ronefs civils doivent se conformer aux instructions des bellig&eacute;rants relatives &agrave; leur cap et &agrave; leur altitude.<BR>

<P>74. Les Etats bellig&eacute;rants et neutres concern&eacute;s et les autorit&eacute;s assurant des services de la circulation a&eacute;rienne devraient &eacute;tablir des proc&eacute;dures par lesquelles les commandants de navires de guerre et d'a&eacute;ronefs militaires sont constamment inform&eacute;s des itin&eacute;raires prescrits ou des plans de vol des a&eacute;ronefs civils dans la zone des op&eacute;rations militaires, y compris les informations sur les fr&eacute;quences de transmissions, les modes et codes d'identification, les destinations, les passagers et le chargement.<BR>

<P>75. Les Etats bellig&eacute;rants et neutres devraient s'assurer de la publication d'un NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), donnant des informations sur les activit&eacute;s militaires dans les zones potentiellement dangereuses pour l'aviation civile, y compris l'&eacute;tablissement de zones dangereuses ou les restrictions temporaires applicables &agrave; l'espace a&eacute;rien.  Ce NOTAM devrait comprendre des informations sur:<BR>

<P>a) les fr&eacute;quences sur lesquelles les a&eacute;ronefs doivent maintenir une veille continue;<BR>

<P>b) une mise en oeuvre continue des radars m&eacute;t&eacute;o civils et des modes et des codes d'identification;<BR>

<P>c) les restrictions d'altitude, de cap et de vitesse;<BR>

<P>d) les proc&eacute;dures de r&eacute;ponse &agrave; un contact radio avec des forces militaires et pour &eacute;tablir des communications en duplex; et<BR>

<P>e) les mesures que pourraient prendre les forces militaires si le NOTAM n'est pas respect&eacute; et si les a&eacute;ronefs civils sont per&ccedil;us comme une menace par ces forces militaires.<BR>

<P>76. Les a&eacute;ronefs civils devraient remettre le plan de vol requis &agrave; l'Autorit&eacute; de contr&ocirc;le a&eacute;rien comp&eacute;tente en d&eacute;taillant les informations concernant l'enregistrement, la destination, les passagers, le chargement, les fr&eacute;quences de communication d'urgence, les modes et les codes d'identification, leur mise &agrave; jour en temps r&eacute;el et les certificats de transport concernant l'immatriculation, la navigabilit&eacute;, les passagers et le chargement.  Ils ne devraient pas s'&eacute;carter d'une route a&eacute;rienne ou d'un plan de vol d&eacute;sign&eacute;s sans l'accord du Contr&ocirc;le de la circulation a&eacute;rienne sauf conditions impr&eacute;vues, par exemple, s&eacute;curit&eacute; ou d&eacute;tresse, auxquels cas la notification appropri&eacute;e doit &ecirc;tre faite imm&eacute;diatement.<BR>

<P>77. Si un a&eacute;ronef civil entre dans une zone d'activit&eacute; militaire potentiellement dangereuse, il devrait se conformer aux NOTAMs pertinents.  Les forces militaires devraient utiliser tous les moyens disponibles pour identifier et avertir les a&eacute;ronefs civils en utilisant, entre autres, les modes et les codes secondaires de surveillance radar, les transmissions, la corr&eacute;lation avec les informations du plan de vol, l'interception par des a&eacute;ronefs militaires et, quand cela est possible, entrer en contact avec le service de Contr&ocirc;le de la circulation a&eacute;rienne comp&eacute;tent.<BR>

<H4><B>SECTION I : MOYENS DE GUERRE</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B><I>Missiles et autres projectiles</I></B><BR>

<P>78. Missiles et projectiles, y compris ceux &agrave; capacit&eacute; transhorizon, doivent &ecirc;tre employ&eacute;s conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la distinction entre personnes et objets prot&eacute;g&eacute;s et objectifs militaires &eacute;nonc&eacute;e aux paragraphes 38-46.<BR>

<P><B><I>Torpilles</I></B><BR>

<P>79. Il est interdit d'employer des torpilles qui ne coulent pas ou qui, de toute autre fa&ccedil;on, ne deviennent pas inoffensives apr&egrave;s avoir accompli leur course.<BR>

<P><B><I>Mines</I></B><BR>

<P>80. L'utilisation des mines est limit&eacute;e aux fins militaires l&eacute;gitimes, y compris celle qui consiste &agrave; emp&ecirc;cher l'ennemi d'acc&eacute;der &agrave; des zones maritimes.<BR>

<P>81. Sans pr&eacute;judice des r&egrave;gles &eacute;nonc&eacute;es au paragraphe 82, les parties au conflit ne doivent pas mouiller de mines, &agrave; moins que celles-ci ne soient effectivement neutralis&eacute;es lorsqu'elles se d&eacute;tachent ou que l'on en perde le contr&ocirc;le.<BR>

<P>82. Il est interdit d'utiliser des mines flottantes d&eacute;rivantes sauf si:<BR>

<P>a) elles sont dirig&eacute;es contre un objectif militaire; et<BR>

<P>b) deviennent inoffensives une heure apr&egrave;s que l'on en a perdu le contr&ocirc;le.<BR>

<P>83. Le mouillage de mines arm&eacute;es ou l'armement de mines pr&eacute;positionn&eacute;es doit &ecirc;tre signal&eacute;, sauf si les mines sont r&eacute;gl&eacute;es pour n'exploser qu'au contact de navires consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme &eacute;tant des objectifs militaires.<BR>

<P>84. Les bellig&eacute;rants doivent enregistrer les emplacements o&ugrave; ils ont mouill&eacute; des mines.<BR>

<P>85. Les op&eacute;rations de minage men&eacute;es dans les eaux int&eacute;rieures, la mer territoriale ou les eaux archip&eacute;lagiques d'un Etat bellig&eacute;rant doivent permettre, lors de la premi&egrave;re op&eacute;ration de mouillage, aux navires de commerce des Etats neutres de quitter librement ces eaux.<BR>

<P>86. Il est interdit aux bellig&eacute;rants de mouiller des mines dans des eaux neutres.<BR>

<P>87. Le minage ne doit pas avoir pour effet pratique d'emp&ecirc;cher le passage entre les eaux neutres et les eaux internationales.<BR>

<P>88. Les Etats qui mouillent des mines doivent d&ucirc;ment prendre en compte les utilisations l&eacute;gitimes de la haute mer, entre autres, en &eacute;tablissant des itin&eacute;raires de rechange s&ucirc;rs pour les navires de commerce des Etats neutres.<BR>

<P>89. Il est interdit d'emp&ecirc;cher le passage en transit par les d&eacute;troits internationaux et le passage archip&eacute;lagique, sauf si des itin&eacute;raires de rechange s&ucirc;rs et pratiques sont &eacute;tablis.<BR>

<P>90. A la fin des hostilit&eacute;s actives, les parties au conflit doivent faire tout leur possible pour enlever ou rendre inoffensives les mines qu'elles ont mouill&eacute;es, chaque partie enlevant ses propres mines.  En ce qui concerne les mines mouill&eacute;es dans la mer territoriale de l'ennemi, chaque partie doit en signaler la position et agir au plus vite, soit pour enlever les mines de sa mer territoriale, soit pour rendre celle-ci propre &agrave; la navigation.<BR>

<P>91. Outre leurs obligations &eacute;nonc&eacute;es au paragraphe 90, les parties au conflit s'efforceront de conclure un accord, tant entre elles que, s'il y a lieu, avec d'autres Etats et avec des organisations internationales, sur la communication des renseignements et l'octroi d'une assistance technique et mat&eacute;rielle, y compris, si les circonstances s'y pr&ecirc;tent, l'organisation d'op&eacute;rations conjointes, n&eacute;cessaires pour faire dispara&icirc;tre les champs de mines ou les rendre inoffensifs.<BR>

<P>92. Les Etats neutres n'attentent pas aux lois de la neutralit&eacute; en enlevant des mines qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; mouill&eacute;es en violation du droit international.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION II : M&Eacute;THODES DE GUERRE</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B><I>Blocus</I></B><BR>

<P>93. Un blocus doit &ecirc;tre d&eacute;clar&eacute; et notifi&eacute; &agrave; tous les bellig&eacute;rants et Etats neutres.<BR>

<P>94. La d&eacute;claration doit pr&eacute;ciser le d&eacute;but, la dur&eacute;e, le lieu et l'ampleur du blocus ainsi que la p&eacute;riode durant laquelle les navires des Etats neutres peuvent quitter la c&ocirc;te sur laquelle porte le blocus.<BR>

<P>95. Un blocus doit &ecirc;tre effectif.  La question de savoir si le blocus est effectif est une question de fait.<BR>

<P>96. La force charg&eacute;e de maintenir un blocus peut &ecirc;tre stationn&eacute;e &agrave; une distance d&eacute;termin&eacute;e par les besoins militaires.<BR>

<P>97. Un blocus peut &ecirc;tre impos&eacute; et maintenu par une combinaison de m&eacute;thodes et moyens de guerre l&eacute;gitimes, dans la mesure o&ugrave; cette combinaison ne conduit pas &agrave; des actes contraires aux r&egrave;gles &eacute;nonc&eacute;es dans ce document.<BR>

<P>98. Les navires de commerce dont on suppose raisonnablement qu'ils violent le blocus peuvent &ecirc;tre captur&eacute;s.  Les navires de commerce qui, apr&egrave;s sommation pr&eacute;alable, r&eacute;sistent manifestement &agrave; leur capture peuvent &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>99. Un blocus ne doit pas barrer l'acc&egrave;s aux ports et aux c&ocirc;tes des Etats neutres.<BR>

<P>100. Un blocus doit s'appliquer impartialement aux navires de tous les Etats.<BR>

<P>101. L'arr&ecirc;t, la lev&eacute;e temporaire, le r&eacute;tablissement, l'extension ou toute autre modification du blocus doivent &ecirc;tre d&eacute;clar&eacute;s et notifi&eacute;s conform&eacute;ment aux paragraphes 93 et 94.<BR>

<P>102. 	La d&eacute;claration ou la mise en place d'un blocus est interdite si:<BR>

<P>a) il a pour unique objectif d'affamer la population civile ou de lui interdire l'acc&egrave;s aux autres biens essentiels &agrave; sa sur-vie; ou<BR>

<P>b) si les dommages caus&eacute;s &agrave; la population civile sont, ou si on peut pr&eacute;voir qu'ils seront, excessifs par rapport &agrave; l'avantage militaire concret et direct attendu.<BR>

<P>103. Si la population civile du territoire soumis au blocus est insuffisamment approvisionn&eacute;e en nourriture et autres biens n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; sa survie, la partie imposant le blocus doit permettre le libre passage des vivres et autres fournitures essentielles, sous r&eacute;serve que:<BR>

<P>a) la partie imposant le blocus ait le droit de prescrire les conditions techniques de l'autorisation de passage, y compris la perquisition; et<BR>

<P>b) la distribution de ces approvisionnements soit plac&eacute;e sous le contr&ocirc;le local d'une Puissance protectrice ou d'une organisation humanitaire offrant des garanties d'impartialit&eacute;, telle que le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge.<BR>

<P>104. 	Le bellig&eacute;rant imposant le blocus doit permettre le passage de fournitures m&eacute;dicales pour la population civile et pour les militaires bless&eacute;s ou malades, sous r&eacute;serve de son droit de prescrire les conditions techniques de l'autorisation de passage, y compris la perquisition.<BR>

<P><B><I>Zones</I></B><BR>

<P>105. Un bellig&eacute;rant ne peut se soustraire aux devoirs que lui impose l international humanitaire en &eacute;tablissant des zones susceptibles de porter atteinte aux utilisations l&eacute;gitimes d'espaces maritimes pr&eacute;cis.<BR>

<P>106. Si	un bellig&eacute;rant, &agrave; titre exceptionnel, &eacute;tablit une telle zone:<BR>

<P>a)	le m&ecirc;me corpus juridique s'applique aussi bien dans cette zone qu'en dehors;<BR>

<P>b)	l'&eacute;tendue, le lieu et la dur&eacute;e d'activation de la zone et des mesures prises ne doivent pas exc&eacute;der les strictes n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s militaires et le principe de proportionnalit&eacute;;<BR>

<P>c)	le droit des Etats neutres aux utilisations l&eacute;gitimes de la mer doit &ecirc;tre pris d&ucirc;ment en compte;<BR>

<P>d)	une voie de passage &agrave; travers la zone doit &ecirc;tre assur&eacute;e aux navires et a&eacute;ronefs neutres:<BR>

<P>i) si l'&eacute;tendue g&eacute;ographique de cette zone emp&ecirc;che de mani&egrave;re significative un acc&egrave;s libre et s&ucirc;r aux ports et aux c&ocirc;tes des Etats neutres;<BR>

<P>ii) dans d'autres cas, si les itin&eacute;raires normaux de navigation sont affect&eacute;s, &agrave; moins que les imp&eacute;ratifs militaires ne permettent pas d'am&eacute;nager une telle voie; et<BR>

<P>e) l'entr&eacute;e en vigueur, la dur&eacute;e d'activation, le lieu et l'&eacute;tendue de la zone, ainsi que les restrictions impos&eacute;es, doivent &ecirc;tre annonc&eacute;s publiquement et notifi&eacute;s convenablement.<BR>

<P>107. Le respect des mesures prises par un bellig&eacute;rant dans la zone ainsi &eacute;tablie ne doit pas s'interpr&eacute;ter comme un acte hostile &agrave; l'&eacute;gard du bellig&eacute;rant adverse.<BR>

<P>108. Rien dans la pr&eacute;sente section ne doit &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme portant atteinte au droit coutumier des bellig&eacute;rants de contr&ocirc;ler les navires et a&eacute;ronefs neutres dans le voisinage imm&eacute;diat des op&eacute;rations navales.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>SECTION III : FEINTES, RUSES DE GUERRE ET PERFIDIE</B></H4>
<P>
<P>109. 	Il est interdit &agrave; tout moment aux a&eacute;ronefs militaires et auxiliaires de feindre d'avoir un statut civil, neutre ou d'&ecirc;tre exempt&eacute;s d'attaque ou de capture.<BR>

<P>110. 	Les ruses de guerre sont autoris&eacute;es. Cependant, il est interdit aux navires de guerre et auxiliaires de lancer une attaque en arborant un faux pavillon ou, &agrave; quelque moment que ce soit, de simuler intentionnellement le statut de:<BR>

<P>a) navires h&ocirc;pitaux, des embarcations de sauvetage c&ocirc;ti&egrave;res ou de transports sanitaires;<BR>

<P>b) navires en mission humanitaire;<BR>

<P>e) navires auxquels a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;livr&eacute; un sauf-conduit par accord pr&eacute;alable entre les parties, y compris les navires de cartel;<BR>

<P>f) navires autoris&eacute;s &agrave; arborer l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge; ou<BR>

<P>g) navires participant au transport de biens culturels sous protection sp&eacute;ciale.<BR>

<P>111. La perfidie est interdite. Les actes perfides sont ceux faisant appel, avec l'intention de la tromper, &agrave; la bonne foi d'un adversaire pour lui faire croire qu'il a le droit de recevoir ou l'obligation d'accorder la protection pr&eacute;vue par les r&egrave;gles du droit international applicable dans les conflits arm&eacute;s.  Les actes perfides comprennent le fait de lancer une attaque tout en feignant:<BR>

<P>a) d'avoir un statut civil, neutre ou d'&ecirc;tre exempt&eacute; d'attaque ou de capture, ou d'&ecirc;tre plac&eacute; sous la protection des Nations Unies;<BR>

<P>b) de se rendre ou d'&ecirc;tre en d&eacute;tresse en envoyant, par exemple, des signaux de d&eacute;tresse ou en faisant monter l'&eacute;quipage &agrave; bord de radeaux de survie.<BR>

<P>
<P>169.	Afin d'assurer un maximum de s&eacute;curit&eacute; aux navires h&ocirc;pitaux d&egrave;s le d&eacute;clenchement des hostilit&eacute;s, les Etats peuvent pr&eacute;alablement proc&eacute;der &agrave; une notification g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des caract&eacute;ristiques de leurs navires h&ocirc;pitaux, conform&eacute;ment &agrave; l'article 22 de la Deuxi&egrave;me Convention de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949.  Une telle notification devrait contenir toutes les informations disponibles permettant l'identification de ces navires.<BR>

<P>170. 	Les navires h&ocirc;pitaux peuvent &ecirc;tre &eacute;quip&eacute;s de syst&egrave;mes con&ccedil;us pour d&eacute;vier des missiles de leur but, tels que le chaff et les leurres infrarouges.  La pr&eacute;sence de tels &eacute;quipements devrait &ecirc;tre notifi&eacute;e.<BR>

<P>171. Afin d'accomplir leur mission humanitaire avec le maximum d'efficacit&eacute;, les navires h&ocirc;pitaux devraient &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute;s &agrave; utiliser un &eacute;quipement cryptographique.  En aucun cas cet &eacute;quipement ne doit servir &agrave; la transmission de renseignements ni &agrave; l'acquisition d'un avantage militaire quelconque.<BR>

<P>172. Les navires h&ocirc;pitaux, les embarcations de sauvetage c&ocirc;ti&egrave;res ainsi que les autres transports sanitaires sont encourag&eacute;s &agrave; utiliser les moyens d'identification &eacute;tablis &agrave; l'Annexe 1 du Protocole additionnel I de 1977.<BR>

<P>173. Ces moyens d'identification sont uniquement destin&eacute;s &agrave; faciliter l'identification et, en eux-m&ecirc;mes, ne conf&egrave;rent pas de statut prot&eacute;g&eacute;.<BR>

<H4><B>SECTION III : A&Eacute;RONEFS SANITAIRES</B></H4>
<P>
<P>174. Les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires doivent &ecirc;tre prot&eacute;g&eacute;s et respect&eacute;s conform&eacute;ment aux dispositions de ce document.<BR>

<P>175. Les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires doivent &ecirc;tre clairement signal&eacute;s par l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge et par leurs couleurs nationales, sur leurs surfaces inf&eacute;rieures, sup&eacute;rieures et lat&eacute;rales.  Les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires sont encourag&eacute;s &agrave; faire constamment usage des autres moyens d'identification &eacute;tablis &agrave; l'Annexe I du Protocole additionnel I de 1977.  Les a&eacute;ronefs affr&eacute;t&eacute;s par le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge peuvent utiliser les m&ecirc;mes moyens d'identification que les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires.  Les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires temporaires n'ayant pu, soit par manque de temps, soit en raison de leurs caract&eacute;ristiques, &ecirc;tre marqu&eacute;s par l'embl&egrave;me distinctif devraient utiliser des moyens d'identification disponibles les plus efficaces.<BR>

<P>176. Ces moyens d'identification sont uniquement destin&eacute;s &agrave; faciliter l'identification et, en eux-m&ecirc;mes, ne conf&egrave;rent pas de statut prot&eacute;g&eacute;.<BR>

<P>177. Les parties au conflit sont encourag&eacute;es &agrave; notifier les vols sanitaires et &agrave; conclure des accords &agrave; tout moment, en particulier dans les zones qu'aucune partie au conflit ne domine clairement.  A leur conclusion, de tels accords doivent sp&eacute;cifier l'altitude, les heures ainsi que les itin&eacute;raires de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, et devraient mentionner les moyens d'identification et de transmission utilis&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>178. Les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires ne doivent pas &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;s pour commettre des actes nuisibles &agrave; l'ennemi.  Ils ne doivent transporter aucun &eacute;quipement destin&eacute; &agrave; la recherche ou &agrave; la transmission de renseignements.  Ils ne doivent pas &ecirc;tre arm&eacute;s, &agrave; l'exception d'armes l&eacute;g&egrave;res d'autod&eacute;fense, et ne doivent transporter que du personnel et des &eacute;quipements sanitaires.<BR>

<P>179. Tout autre a&eacute;ronef, militaire ou civil, bellig&eacute;rant ou neutre, utilis&eacute; pour la recherche, le sauvetage et le transport des bless&eacute;s, des malades et des naufrag&eacute;s, agit &agrave; ses risques et p&eacute;rils, &agrave; moins qu'un accord n'ait &eacute;t&eacute; conclu au pr&eacute;alable entre les parties au conflit.<BR>

<P>180. Il peut &ecirc;tre ordonn&eacute; aux a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires survolant des zones domin&eacute;es en fait par le bellig&eacute;rant adverse, ou des zones qu'en fait aucune force ne domine clairement, de se poser aux fins d'inspection.  Les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires doivent ob&eacute;ir &agrave; tout ordre de ce type.<BR>

<P>181. Sauf accord pr&eacute;alable, les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires bellig&eacute;rants ne doivent pas p&eacute;n&eacute;trer l'espace a&eacute;rien neutre.  Quand ils s'y trouvent en vertu d'un accord, ils doivent se conformer aux termes de cet accord, lequel peut imposer &agrave; l'a&eacute;ronef de se poser sur un a&eacute;roport d&eacute;sign&eacute; sur le territoire de l'Etat neutre aux fins d'inspection.  Si tel est le cas, l'inspection et les actions subs&eacute;quentes doivent &ecirc;tre men&eacute;es conform&eacute;ment aux paragraphes 182-183.<BR>

<P>182. Si, en l'absence de tout accord pr&eacute;alable ou en s'&eacute;cartant des termes d'un accord, un a&eacute;ronef sanitaire p&eacute;n&egrave;tre l'espace a&eacute;rien neutre, soit &agrave; la suite d'une erreur de navigation, soit en raison d'une urgence touchant &agrave; la s&eacute;curit&eacute; du vol, il doit faire tout son possible pour signaler sa pr&eacute;sence et s'identifier.  Sit&ocirc;t reconnu par l'Etat neutre comme a&eacute;ronef sanitaire, il ne peut pas &ecirc;tre attaqu&eacute; mais peut &ecirc;tre contraint &agrave; se poser aux fins d'inspection. Une fois inspect&eacute;, et s'il est effectivement identifi&eacute; comme a&eacute;ronef sanitaire, il doit &ecirc;tre autoris&eacute; &agrave; reprendre son vol.<BR>

<P>183. Si l'inspection r&eacute;v&egrave;le qu'il ne s'agit pas d'un a&eacute;ronef sanitaire, celui-ci peut &ecirc;tre captur&eacute; et ses occupants doivent, &agrave; moins qu'il n'en soit convenu autrement entre l'Etat neutre et les parties au conflit, &ecirc;tre d&eacute;tenus par l'Etat neutre lorsque les r&egrave;gles du droit international applicables aux conflits arm&eacute;s l'exigent, de sorte qu'ils ne puissent prendre part &agrave; nouveau aux hostilit&eacute;s.<BR>

<H2>Books and reviews : &quot;Armed conflict in Georgia: A case study in humanitarian action and peacekeeping&quot;</H2>
<P><I>By Marion Harroff-Tavel</I>
<P>
<P>Neil MacFarlane, Larry Minear, Stephen Shenfield, <I>Armed conflict in Georgia: A case study in humanitarian action and peacekeeping</I>, The Thomas J. Watson Jr. Institute for International Studies, Providence, R.I., 1996, 126 pp.<BR>

<P><B><I>Marion Harroff-Tavel</I></B><I>, ICRC Deputy Delegate General, Eastern Europe and Central Asia</I><BR>

<P>
<P>This new book on Georgia is the latest in a series of studies on humanitarian action in armed conflict published in the United States by Brown University's Watson Institute. Previous studies having concentrated on Asia, Latin America, Africa and the former Yugoslavia, it is the first to deal with a country of the Commonwealth of Independent States. For several reasons it is an interesting study, for it describes humanitarian action in a context of widespread political, economic and social upheaval brought about by the break-up of the Soviet Union, focuses on three conflicts fought in rapid succession and involving different players and regions (South Ossetia, Abkhazia and Mingrelia) and highlights a new and particularly important theatre of action for the international community, not to mention the Russian Federation.<BR>

<P>For the purpose of this study, a team of researchers travelled to Georgia in August 1994 and March 1995 and conducted numerous interviews in Vienna, Moscow, Geneva, New York and Washington. The result of their investigations, which lasted one year and included a review of the relevant literature, is unusual in that it blends the standpoint of the humanitarian practitioner with that of the academic analyst. The authors do express regret, however, that they were unable to meet the local authorities during their visit to Abkhazia.<BR>

<P>The study covers the period from November 1989 (when open hostilities broke out in the South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast) 1 to April 1995; well structured, it is easy both to read and to consult. The three main chapters place the international action in its proper context and throw light on the specific nature of the Georgian problem, particularly its ethnic aspect; they also analyse the various dimensions of the humanitarian crisis, as well as the international response to it and the link between humanitarian action and the search for a peaceful solution of the conflict; finally, they discuss the role of the peace-keeping forces involved and their contribution towards solving humanitarian problems in the field. The work concludes with a number of recommendations for the future.<BR>

<P>While it is difficult to summarize the conclusions of so detailed an analysis, a few ideas  which, of course, commit no one but the authors  do stand out in sharp focus.<BR>

<P>First, the emergency humanitarian operation carried out in September and October 1993, when Abkhaz forces took control of Sukhumi and southern Abkhazia as far as the Inguri River (now a line of demarcation), was clearly a success: the humanitarian agencies dealt promptly with a sudden influx of about 250,000 displaced persons fleeing Abkhazia to seek refuge in western Georgia, and the worst was certainly avoided.<BR>

<P>Even so, those displaced were able to return only in very small numbers, chiefly owing to the Abkhaz authorities' reluctance to readmit Georgian civilians and to security hazards in Abkhazia itself  not least the presence of mines in the Gali region. The role played by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), which was present at the political negotiations and chaired the Quadripartite Commission on the return of displaced persons, is the subject of a lengthy analysis focusing on the relationship between politics and humanitarian action. While the political negotiators believed that everything should be done to promote the swift return of those displaced, given the circumstances a number of the humanitarian players had strong reservations on the subject. The authors thusraise a fundamental question: the humanitarian problem posed by displaced persons required a political solution, yet how could a political solution be found for the conflict without effectively addressing the humanitarian crisis?<BR>

<P>The authors also regret the low profile adopted by the international organizations in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and urge them to raise it. However, they do mention  all too briefly, of course, in this reviewer's opinion  the action taken by the ICRC in Abkhazia, which started in 1992 with the opening of two permanent offices, one in Gudauta and the other in Sukhumi. After witnessing the takeover of Sukhumi by Abkhaz forces, ICRC delegates maintained their presence on both sides of the front line throughout the conflict. Reminding both parties of the rules of international humanitarian law and the need to respect civilians, wounded combatants and prisoners was a constant factor of the action undertaken by the ICRC, which also provided emergency relief to displaced persons and others in especially vulnerable situations: the latter included elderly Georgians who, having remained at home in Abkhazia when the younger members of their households fled, were particularly exposed to persecution by uncontrolled elements. In a society caught up in violence, it required great perseverance to help these people and to remind the authorities of their obligation to protect them.<BR>

<P>The authors' analysis of the many obstacles encountered by the humanitarian organizations rings a bell for anyone who knows the southern Caucasus: safety concerns, logistic constraints, the difficulty of pinpointing the intended beneficiaries of relief operations, diversion of part of the aid to private markets, the absence of any local non-governmental sector and the lack of coordination between the humanitarian agencies themselves are but a few examples.<BR>

<P>Chapter four describes the action of the four peace-keeping forces in Georgia: the tripartite force in South Ossetia, made up of North Ossetians, Georgians and Russians, whose main task was to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire concluded in 1992; the mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which was not strictly speaking a peace-keeping force but had a far broader mandate (it is worth noting how tasks were shared between the United Nations, whose special envoy Ambassador Edouard Brunner strove to find political solutions for the Abkhaz conflict, and the OSCE, which was far more active in South Ossetia); the peace-keeping force of the Commonwealth of Independent States, which consisted in fact of Russian troops then deployed along the Inguri and was mainly responsible for upholding the cease-fire, supervising the implementation of the provisions of the agreement reached between the parties on 14 May 1994 on the joint creation of a security zone, and promoting the return of displaced persons, particularly to the Gali region; and lastly, the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia. The authors express satisfaction with those peace-keeping forces, which were entrusted with very different mandates, for the way in which they &quot;froze&quot; the Abkhaz and South Ossetian conflicts by ensuring that the cease-fire was by and large respected. They regret, however, that the Russian forces deployed in Abkhaziaand the United Nations Observer Mission, whose relations were reportedly difficult, did not do more to create conditions in which displaced persons could return in complete safety. With respect to the United Nations Mission, that criticism is tempered by the recognition that it was an observer force rather than a peace-keeping force in the strict sense of the term  an important difference in the world of politics but one which is very often lost on the local population.<BR>

<P>In the same chapter the authors also discuss Russian policy in Georgia, its objectives and development, in relation both to the policy pursued by the Georgian authorities and to the conflict in Chechnya. While some criticism is directed at the Russian peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia, which are sometimes seen as an instrument of national policy, it is pointed out that neither the United Nations nor the OSCE was keen to play a substantial peace-keeping role in the region. In spite of the problems raised, however, the study concludes that, on the whole, the deployment of Russian forces did much to meet the needs of the population. Without their presence there would have been a major risk of the conflict breaking out anew.<BR>

<P>In analysing the interactions between peace-keeping (in the broadest sense of the term) and humanitarian assistance, the study concludes that they were limited for several reasons: the existence of lasting cease-fires; the fact that operations by the humanitarian agencies were concentrated outside regions where the peace-keeping forces were active; and lastly, the desire of the agencies present in Abkhazia not to make humanitarian assistance a key factor in political negotiations, since it had to be completely independent if it was to meet the needs of the victims impartially. Some members of the peace-keeping forces who were interviewed suggested that humanitarian assistance was not their responsibility, since others were there for that purpose. In the authors' opinion, the situation was a missed opportunity for synergy.<BR>

<P>To my mind, the Georgian crisis raises the interesting problem of the relationship, alluded to earlier, between politics and humanitarian action in all present-day conflicts. Personally, I believe that peace-keeping forces, wherever deployed, should be expected to create conditions favourable for humanitarian action and should be familiar with and implement international humanitarian law as part of their duties. Yet humanitarian action must remain independent  or at least politicians should ensure that there is scope for impartial and neutral humanitarian action, even if such action is not necessarily intended to be a contribution to peace in a comprehensive approach to the problems involved. Some suffering must be relieved simply for reasons of humanity.<BR>

<P>Whether or not the reader agrees with the conclusions of this study, they will certainly provide stimulating food for thought.<BR>

<P>For the ICRC and other humanitarian agencies, the Commonwealth of Independent States has posed and continues to pose challenging problems. Having for the most part been present for only three or four years in countries with unfamiliar values, cultures, traditions and languages, they find themselves up against cyclical conflicts or conflicts which, though frozen by fragile cease-fires, remain without any political solution. These agencies have to respond to the usual emergencies, but also to adopt a long-term perspective involving rehabilitation and projects designed to make communities self-sufficient again. They are striving to be creative in situations where the future is uncertain. They need to reassess the conclusions drawn from their African experience, since these are not always applicable in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, where problems are less extensive but the suffering is just as acute. First and foremost, however, they must ensure that their action contributes towards restoring a climate of trust among divided communities. This implies responsible behaviour untainted by partisan considerations and, above all, listening to others while respecting their dignity and differences.<BR>

<H4><B>La Conferencia</B></H4>
<P>
<P>La XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, que se celebrar&aacute; en Ginebra del 3 al 7 de diciembre de 1995, congregar&aacute; a representantes de m&aacute;s de 160 Sociedades Nacionales reconocidas de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, el Comit&eacute; Internacional de la Cruz Roja y m&aacute;s de 180 Estados Partes en los Convenios de Ginebra. En calidad de observadores, asistir&aacute;n tambi&eacute;n delegaciones de las Naciones Unidas y de numerosas organizaciones gubernamentales y no gubernamentales.<BR>

<P>Los temas esenciales de actualidad se debatir&aacute;n en dos Comisiones. Cada Comisi&oacute;n podr&aacute; presentar resoluciones para la aprobaci&oacute;n de la Conferencia en pleno. Estas resoluciones determinan el enfoque de los Estados y del Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja frente a cuestiones humanitarias contempor&aacute;neas y con frecuencia influyen en la reacci&oacute;n a estas y a futuras crisis. La Comisi&oacute;n I se concentrar&aacute; en medidas espec&iacute;ficas encaminadas a aliviar el padecimiento de <A HREF="30ee.htm"><I>las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra</A></I> y a mejorar el respeto de las normas del derecho internacional humanitario (los temas que tratar&aacute; la Comisi&oacute;n I aparecen en el folleto: Las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra y el respeto del derecho internacional humanitario). La Comisi&oacute;n II centrar&aacute; su atenci&oacute;n en la incorporaci&oacute;n de valores y principios universales espec&iacute;ficos en la labor cotidiana de la comunidad humanitaria, el mejoramiento de la calidad de la asistencia humanitaria y de la protecci&oacute;n en casos de crisis, y en recalcar ante los gobiernos el papel fundamental de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja en la defensa de dichos valores as&iacute; como en el afianzamiento de su capacidad de intervenci&oacute;n (temas que se exponen en esta publicaci&oacute;n).<BR>

<P><B>Comisi&oacute;n II: Valores humanitarios y reacci&oacute;n ante crisis</B><BR>
 <BR>
La Comisi&oacute;n II sobre <B>valores humanitarios y reacci&oacute;n ante crisis</B> se ocupar&aacute; de dos temas principales. El primero, <B>principios e intervenci&oacute;n en la asistencia internacional humanitaria y en las actividades de protecci&oacute;n</B>, girar&aacute; en torno a los principios y valores centrales sobre los cuales reposa el Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja. Estos principios y valores, que incluyen la humanidad, la imparcialidad, la neutralidad y la independencia, influyen en su labor, tanto en tiempos de crisis como en el desempe&ntilde;o de sus tareas rutinarias. El Movimiento naci&oacute; animado por el prop&oacute;sito de aliviar el sufrimiento humano por doquiera, sin discriminaci&oacute;n, &uacute;nicamente en funci&oacute;n de la necesidad. Ha llevado adelante su fidelidad a estos valores y est&aacute; firmemente convencido de que pueden guiar a las organizaciones humanitarias, las comunidades y los gobiernos en el reajuste de sus sistemas sociales, econ&oacute;micos y pol&iacute;ticos para hacer frente a un mundo en transici&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>El segundo tema del orden del d&iacute;a, a saber, <B>el fortalecimiento de la capacidad para asistir y proteger a las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables</B>, versar&aacute; sobre el afianzamiento de la red mundial de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, cuya funci&oacute;n ha de comprenderse claramente y cuya integridad debe protegerse. Por a&ntilde;adidura, el desarrollo institucional y de recursos es un v&iacute;nculo esencial en el fomento de la capacidad de la red para asistir a las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables en el mundo.<BR>

<P>En este folleto se exponen los temas principales que considerar&aacute; la Comisi&oacute;n II; se describe brevemente la incidencia de dichas cuestiones en el trabajo cotidiano en el terreno y se esbozan las propuestas que se someter&aacute; a consideraci&oacute;n de la Conferencia.<BR>

<P><B>Aplicar los principios</B><BR>

<P>Ante las atrocidades y los problemas de la actualidad mundial, el Movimiento ha reconsiderado su enfoque. Esta autoevaluaci&oacute;n, llev&oacute; al Movimiento a su punto de partida, con una fe renovada, decidido a asegurar que sus valores y su visi&oacute;n se plasmen en la realidad. Los principios de la labor humanitaria conceden  equilibrio a un mundo desquiciado. Introducen un elemento de raz&oacute;n y equidad en el caos.<BR>

<P>Los Principios Fundamentales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja no son ideales esot&eacute;ricos. Son principios de trabajo - destinados a ejercerse continuamente. Resulta m&aacute;s f&aacute;cil entender estos principios si uno los ve en acci&oacute;n: trabajadores que buscan a familias enterradas por un terremoto, que escuchan a los refugiados mientras &eacute;stos esperan pacientemente poder regresar a sus hogares, o que exponen sus propias vidas para proteger a los civiles atrapados en el fuego cruzado. Estos principios deben impregnar la mente, el alma y la conciencia de los trabajadores humanitarios en su labor cotidiana.<BR>

<P>Estos principios pueden dejar profundas huellas tanto en personas lejanas como allegadas a uno. Pocos entienden, no obstante, su pleno significado. El proceso de concienciaci&oacute;n y la adopci&oacute;n de medidas nacionales que crean un contexto propicio para las operaciones humanitarias, fomentan el respeto por la labor humanitaria, incrementando as&iacute; la eficiencia y la efectividad de dicho trabajo. Ha llegado la hora de bajar los Principios Fundamentales del Movimiento de su pedestal, de concederles realidad, y dejarlos existir.<BR>

<P>Durante el decenio de 1990, el Movimiento se ha empe&ntilde;ado en mejorar la situaci&oacute;n de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables del mundo. Considera que la &uacute;nica manera de lograrlo es reanimando sus principios, consolidando el respeto por la dignidad humana y los valores humanitarios, mejorando la capacidad de las personas para hacer frente a las crisis, fortaleciendo las aptitudes de las personas vulnerables en todo el mundo y creando una red mundial que aproveche las capacidades, pericias y recursos de sus miembros.<BR>

<P>Por ende, alienta a los gobiernos a reconocer la capacidad de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja en su calidad de auxiliares de los poderes p&uacute;blicos, pero tambi&eacute;n a preservar la autonom&iacute;a de acci&oacute;n que les permita actuar siempre de acuerdo con su mandato, de conformidad con los principios y valores que las sustentan. Al tomar la iniciativa en la elaboraci&oacute;n de un c&oacute;digo de conducta para las organizaciones y organismos humanitarios, el Movimiento ha llevado a una etapa superior su compromiso con los valores humanitarios. Cree firmemente que la aplicaci&oacute;n de tales principios &eacute;ticos y normas profesionales ante los desaf&iacute;os humanitarios contempor&aacute;neos contribuir&aacute; a resolver algunos de los problemas del ma&ntilde;ana.<BR>

<P><B>Nuevos comienzos</B><BR>

<P>Es simb&oacute;licamente acertado que al finalizar el siglo, esta Conferencia Internacional, re&uacute;na a todos los miembros del Movimiento en Ginebra, cuna de la instituci&oacute;n y de los Convenios de Ginebra. Los participantes en la Conferencia no perder&aacute;n la oportunidad hist&oacute;rica de examinar la eficacia de los m&eacute;todos y pr&aacute;cticas de un mundo que tiene en sus manos el futuro de la humanidad. No es este el momento de descansar en los laureles del pasado, sino de intervenir para asegurar la supervivencia de inn&uacute;meras personas. Sin embargo, el pasado ha sido un gran maestro. Cuando el mundo se ha desviado de los principios humanitarios, ha padecido terribles sufrimientos. Ha llegado el momento de adaptar una &eacute;tica de larga tradici&oacute;n a un mundo moderno afligido, en el que la miseria clama compasi&oacute;n.<BR>
<a name=2><BR>

<H4><B>C&oacute;digo de conducta</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>De la visi&oacute;n a la acci&oacute;n</B><BR>

<P>Hace algunos decenios, muchos consideraban que la caridad era un proceso orientado en un solo sentido. Se brindaba ayuda, sin hacer preguntas. Afortunadamente, esa actitud ha cambiado. Las organizaciones humanitarias consideran a las personas necesitadas de ayuda como asociados en lugar de &quot;v&iacute;ctimas&quot;; consultan con ellas; aprenden de ellas.<BR>

<P>Al mismo tiempo, se engrosan las filas del sector humanitario. En Bangladesh m&aacute;s de 1.000 organizaciones no gubernamentales figuran registradas ante el gobierno. En Kigali, capital de Ruanda, m&aacute;s de 120 organizaciones no gubernamentales se inscribieron en 1994. Durante los dos &uacute;ltimos decenios ha aumentado con rapidez el n&uacute;mero de organizaciones internacionales humanitarias, mientras paralelamente tambi&eacute;n ha incrementado la cantidad de personas que necesitan su ayuda - cada a&ntilde;o, entre 250 y 300 millones de personas se ven afectadas por desastres. Sin embargo, se dispon&iacute;a de escasas orientaciones para el establecimiento de normas destinadas a las organizaciones humanitarias.<BR>

<P>A menudo, el car&aacute;cter apremiante y la creciente envergadura del socorro en casos de desastre, pueden llevar a las organizaciones humanitarias a efectuar una labor inapropiada y con miras muy estrechas. Un c&oacute;digo de conducta profesional resultaba indispensable a medida que se exig&iacute;a a las organizaciones m&aacute;s servicios con cada vez menos recursos.<BR>

<P>Con el prop&oacute;sito de establecer normas universales de profesionalidad y de pr&aacute;ctica, la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional, junto con un grupo de experimentadas organizaciones no gubernamentales, elabor&oacute;, en 1993, un C&oacute;digo de Conducta en diez puntos destinado a las organizaciones que prestan socorro en casos de desastre. En la actualidad, 52 de estas organizaciones en 19 pa&iacute;ses se ci&ntilde;en a dicho C&oacute;digo para evaluar y supervisar sus actividades de socorro.<BR>

<P>El C&oacute;digo se suscribe y aplica voluntariamente y puede adherirse a &eacute;l cualquier organizaci&oacute;n que proporcione ayuda durante crisis. Se espera que, mediante su observancia, las organizaciones adquieran una obligaci&oacute;n p&uacute;blica. Podr&iacute;an tambi&eacute;n emplearlo como instrumento de autocontrol. Los gobiernos y los organismos donantes podr&iacute;an utilizarlo para apreciar el desempe&ntilde;o de las organizaciones con las que colaboran. Las poblaciones tienen el derecho de esperar que quienes les brindan ayuda se conformen a dichas normas.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B><I>Propuestas para la Conferencia</I></B></H4>
<P>
<P><I>En el curso de la Conferencia, se pedir&aacute; a los gobiernos y a las Sociedades Nacionales que:</I><BR>

<P><B><I>aprueben la versi&oacute;n revisada de los Principios y Normas de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja para el Socorro en Casos de Desastre;</I></B><BR>
<I>estas normas promueven niveles &oacute;ptimos de coordinaci&oacute;n, profesionalidad y prestaci&oacute;n de la asistencia en todo el Movimiento;</I><BR>

<P><B><I>promuevan la adopci&oacute;n del C&oacute;digo por parte de otras organizaciones humanitarias;</I></B><BR>
<I>se invitar&aacute; a los gobiernos a alentar a las organizaciones humanitarias que tienen su sede, o realizan su labor, en su territorio, a actuar de conformidad con el esp&iacute;ritu y los principios del C&oacute;digo.</I><BR>

<P>Principios b&aacute;sicos<BR>

<P>1. Lo primero es el deber humanitario.<BR>
2. La ayuda prestada no est&aacute; condicionada por la raza, el credo o la nacionalidad de los beneficiarios ni ninguna otra distinci&oacute;n de &iacute;ndole adversa. El orden de prioridad de la asistencia se establece &uacute;nicamente en funci&oacute;n de las necesidades.<BR>
3. La ayuda no se utilizar&aacute; para favorecer una determinada opini&oacute;n pol&iacute;tica o religiosa.<BR>
4. Nos empe&ntilde;aremos en no actuar como instrumentos de pol&iacute;tica exterior gubernamental.<BR>
5. Respetaremos la cultura y las costumbres locales.<BR>
6. Trataremos de fomentar la capacidad para hacer frente a cat&aacute;strofes utilizando las aptitudes y los medios disponibles a nivel local.<BR>
7. Se buscar&aacute; la forma de hacer participar a los beneficiarios de programas en la administraci&oacute;n de la ayuda de socorro.<BR>
8. La ayuda de socorro tendr&aacute; por finalidad satisfacer las necesidades b&aacute;sicas y, adem&aacute;s, tratar de reducir en el futuro la vulnerabilidad ante los desastres.<BR>
9. Somos responsables ante quienes tratamos de ayudar y ante las personas o las instituciones de las que aceptamos recursos.<BR>
10. En nuestras actividades de informaci&oacute;n, publicidad y propaganda, reconoceremos a las v&iacute;ctimas de desastres como seres humanos dignos, y no como objetos que inspiran compasi&oacute;n.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H4><B>Seguridad del personal</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>En primer lugar, los beneficiarios</B><BR>

<P>El decenio de 1990 ha tra&iacute;do consigo un alud de cambios y desaf&iacute;os. En el continente africano y en la antigua Uni&oacute;n Sovi&eacute;tica existen combinaciones de conflictos declarados con inseguridad perniciosa, en un fluctuante mar de alianzas. Somalia ha soportado a&ntilde;os de guerras invalidantes y de hambre generalizada causada por conflictos. En Ruanda se presenci&oacute; la matanza de cerca de un mill&oacute;n de personas y el desplazamiento de la mitad de la poblaci&oacute;n, en cuya fuga muchas personas fallecieron de sed y/o de enfermedades. En Zaire la tragedia se abati&oacute; nuevamente con el brote del virus &eacute;bola, cuando se intentaba hacer frente a disturbios en los campamentos de Goma. Los bosnios tenazmente luchan contra circunstancias abrumadoras para sobrevivir. Los iraqu&iacute;es con frecuencia han de optar entre prescindir de alimentos o de medicinas, en medio de las sanciones impuestas.<BR>

<P>El Movimiento se ha visto apremiado a definir sus responsabilidades funcionales en situaciones de esta &iacute;ndole. Adem&aacute;s, se ha encontrado expuesto a constantes peligros, a medida que aumenta una falta de respeto a su emblema y a su misi&oacute;n. Apenas en el a&ntilde;o transcurrido, diversos colaboradores de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja perecieron en el cumplimiento de sus labores en Colombia, Ruanda, Turqu&iacute;a y Zaire.<BR>

<P>Si bien estos podr&iacute;an haber sido los primeros casos en los que el Movimiento tropezaba con una situaci&oacute;n que escapaba toda categorizaci&oacute;n, ciertamente no ser&aacute;n los &uacute;ltimos. Ese cambio en la naturaleza de estas tragedias humanitarias requiere una reacci&oacute;n constructiva de parte de las organizaciones humanitarias.<BR>

<P>C&oacute;mo podr&iacute;an trabajar de modo eficiente las organizaciones humanitarias en contextos totalmente imprevisibles? C&oacute;mo evitar el socavamiento de su integridad y de su car&aacute;cter humanitario? C&oacute;mo puede adaptarse el Movimiento a la naturaleza cambiante de los conflictos, los desastres y la inseguridad de hoy, manteniendo al mismo tiempo su neutralidad e independencia? Estas preguntas nada f&aacute;ciles exigen, no obstante, una respuesta. Hay vidas que dependen de las soluciones.<BR>

<P>El Movimiento insiste en la evaluaci&oacute;n constante de sus operaciones. Est&aacute; preparado para adaptarse con agilidad a nuevas circunstancias. Su trabajo contin&uacute;a hasta que se encuentre soluciones. Sin embargo necesita contar con el respeto humanitario y la aplicaci&oacute;n de medidas de seguridad para desempe&ntilde;ar su labor en forma eficaz.<BR>

<P>El Movimiento necesita que los gobiernos y las Naciones Unidas cooperen con &eacute;l, y que adopten las medidas oportunas para abordar las causas de las cat&aacute;strofes y para preservar el espacio estrictamente neutral e imparcial en el que debe desenvolverse la labor humanitaria.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B><I>Propuestas para la Conferencia</I></B></H4>
<P>
<P><I>En la Conferencia se pedir&aacute; a los gobiernos y a las Sociedades Nacionales que:</I><BR>

<P><I>	</I><B><I>defiendan la neutralidad e imparcialidad;</I></B><BR>
<I>el Movimiento necesita que los gobiernos y las Naciones Unidas adopten las oportunas medidas pol&iacute;ticas y de otra &iacute;ndole para preservar el espacio estrictamente neutral e imparcial en el cual debe desenvolverse la acci&oacute;n humanitaria;</I><BR>

<P><B><I>	reconozcan la independencia del Movimiento;</I></B><BR>
<I>se pedir&aacute; a la Conferencia Internacional que reconozcan el derecho del Movimiento a realizar una acci&oacute;n independiente de toda medida pol&iacute;tica, militar y econ&oacute;mica en las situaciones de emergencia humanitaria.</I><BR>

<P><B>Decisiones instant&aacute;neas</B><BR>

<P>Mediados de abril en Goma. El delegado de la Federaci&oacute;n abandona el tranquilo atardecer del recinto principal. De repente, surgen tres siluetas en el camino, gesticulando para que el veh&iacute;culo se detenga. Un individuo armado, borracho y vestido de militar necesita transporte fuera del pueblo. &quot;Solamente ac&eacute;rquenos&quot;, dice uno de ellos, mientras los otros intentan subirse al coche. Afortunadamente, una de las reglas b&aacute;sicas de seguridad del Movimiento se hab&iacute;a respetado. Todas las puertas estaban cerradas con llave. <BR>

<P>Estos tres hombres jam&aacute;s han o&iacute;do hablar de la Cruz Roja, ni conocen esa &quot;extra&ntilde;a&quot; regla que prohibe llevar a soldados, armados o no, en un veh&iacute;culo de la Federaci&oacute;n. &quot;No somos soldados; solamente una patrulla&quot;, insisten.<BR>

<P>Aunque sabe que, a fines de febrero, en una situaci&oacute;n similar, un delegado extranjero hab&iacute;a sido secuestrado por un grupo de hombres armados durante varias horas, el delegado permanece impasible. &quot;Desarma&quot; a los hombres cort&eacute;smente por medio de su aplomo, mientras informa por radio acerca de la situaci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>En cuanto responde un colega, asegur&aacute;ndole que dentro de poco llegar&aacute;n otros veh&iacute;culos, los tres borrachos piden disculpas y dejan pasar el coche. El delegado puede suspirar con alivio hasta ma&ntilde;ana, o el d&iacute;a siguiente.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H4><B>Sociedades Nacionales</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>Acci&oacute;n universal</B><BR>

<P>Las Sociedades Nacionales cimientan el Movimiento de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja. En sus programas se combinan los principios fundamentales que sustentan al Movimiento con la acci&oacute;n de los voluntarios a nivel local. Los programas de las Sociedades Nacionales var&iacute;an de acuerdo con las necesidades de la comunidad. Ofrecen servicios principalmente en las esferas del desarrollo comunitario, el bienestar social y la salud p&uacute;blica. Sus programas pueden abarcar desde los primeros auxilios a nivel comunitario y programas de educaci&oacute;n sanitaria sobre el SIDA, hasta programas de apoyo social y psicol&oacute;gico.<BR>

<P>Las Sociedades Nacionales son auxiliares de sus gobiernos en el &aacute;mbito humanitario y apoyan a las autoridades p&uacute;blicas seg&uacute;n las necesidades de la poblaci&oacute;n. Las Sociedades Nacionales colaboran tambi&eacute;n estrechamente con los gobiernos en la divulgaci&oacute;n del derecho internacional humanitario, el emblema y los principios fundamentales del Movimiento. Sin embargo, son tambi&eacute;n organizaciones nacionales aut&oacute;nomas y su papel auxiliar no limita su capacidad de iniciativa para emprender cualquier actividad humanitaria.<BR>

<P>Hace poco la Federaci&oacute;n formul&oacute; orientaciones de autoevaluaci&oacute;n para las Sociedades Nacionales. Si bien estas difieren enormemente en cuanto a dimensiones, recursos y cultura, todas deben presentar ciertas caracter&iacute;sticas b&aacute;sicas. El cometido de una Sociedad Nacional debe ser di&aacute;fano. Tiene que guiarse por ciertos principios fundamentales. Requiere estatutos y un liderazgo s&oacute;lidos. Necesita una base de miembros. Requiere recursos humanos y financieros adecuados. El desempe&ntilde;o de una Sociedad Nacional se aquilata en virtud de la pertinencia y la eficacia de sus actividades y de su &eacute;xito en mejorar la condici&oacute;n de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables en el mundo.<BR>

<P>Las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja son las m&aacute;s capaces de satisfacer las necesidades de sus propias comunidades. Puesto que las Sociedades Nacionales tienen aptitudes y carencias diferentes, la red de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja proporciona una oportunidad &uacute;nica para compartir ideas y recursos. Ello fortalece al Movimiento en su conjunto. A trav&eacute;s de la cooperaci&oacute;n, estos programas resultan efectivos y adaptados a los requisitos de sus comunidades. Se requiere mayor cooperaci&oacute;n internacional para intensificar esta colaboraci&oacute;n dentro de la red.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B><I>Propuestas para la Conferencia</I></B></H4>
<P>
<P><I>En la Conferencia, se pedir&aacute; a los gobiernos y las Sociedades Nacionales a que:</I><BR>

<P><B><I>	reconozcan la importancia del desarrollo de las Sociedades Nacionales y lo favorezcan;</I></B><BR>
<I>el desarrollo de la red de Sociedades Nacionales constituye una manera de atender al n&uacute;mero creciente de poblaciones en extremo vulnerables en el mundo;</I><BR>

<P><B><I>	reafirmen la funci&oacute;n de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja;</I></B><BR>
<I>se invitar&aacute; a la Conferencia Internacional a reafirmar el mandato de las Sociedades Nacionales en su funci&oacute;n auxiliar y como instituciones dedicadas a mejorar el respeto por la dignidad humana y los valores humanitarios;</I><BR>

<P><B>acci&oacute;n universal </B><BR>

<P>Las Sociedades Nacionales con frecuencia cooperan en empresas que, en el largo plazo, fomentan la capacidad del Movimiento en su conjunto. Un proyecto de esta &iacute;ndole tiene su centro en San Jos&eacute; (Costa Rica), aunque sus ra&iacute;ces se extienden por toda Am&eacute;rica y atraviesan el oc&eacute;ano hasta Europa.<BR>

<P>Este proyecto de preparaci&oacute;n para desastres nace de la necesidad de hacer frente a numerosos y repetidos desastres en la regi&oacute;n. El proyecto se inici&oacute; en 1993, cuando la Cruz Roja Canadiense, con apoyo gubernamental, patrocin&oacute; una propuesta de la Cruz Roja Costarricense para promover la preparaci&oacute;n comunitaria para hacer frente a los desastres. La Cruz Roja Canadiense financi&oacute; por su parte los servicios de un delegado especializado en la preparaci&oacute;n para desastres. En 1994, la Cruz Roja Costarricense imparti&oacute; 101 cursillos de preparaci&oacute;n para desastres.<BR>

<P>Luego, en el marco de un programa financiado por la Cruz Roja Sueca, para ayudar a la Cruz Roja Guatemalteca el mencionado delegado, con ayuda de la Cruz Roja Mexicana y de la Cruz Roja Colombiana, elabor&oacute; y puso en pr&aacute;ctica dos m&oacute;dulos de formaci&oacute;n destinados a mejorar la capacidad de reacci&oacute;n ante los desastres y a promover en las comunidades las t&eacute;cnicas de la Cruz Roja en materia de preparaci&oacute;n, prevenci&oacute;n y reacci&oacute;n ante los desastres.<BR>

<P>Sobre la base de la experiencia de esta fase inicial, se elabor&oacute; un programa regional mediante el cual se organizar&aacute;n dos sesiones de formaci&oacute;n para los directores y encargados del socorro en casos de desastre de las secciones de la Cruz Roja en Am&eacute;rica Latina. Se impartir&aacute; asimismo un cursillo de formaci&oacute;n para miembros de las secciones que actuar&aacute;n como enlaces con la comunidad en lo que se refiere a educaci&oacute;n en preparaci&oacute;n para desastres. <BR>

<P>El esquema de formaci&oacute;n obedece al enfoque de domin&oacute;. El personal y los miembros de la Sociedad Nacional reciben la formaci&oacute;n; luego a su vez, organizan la formaci&oacute;n a nivel comunitario.<BR>

<P>La preparaci&oacute;n para desastres continuar&aacute; durante 1995 en 50 comunidades de Guatemala, Panam&aacute;, la Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana y Argentina, con financiaci&oacute;n de la Uni&oacute;n Europea. <BR>

<P>En la Rep&uacute;blica Dominicana doce secciones beneficiar&aacute;n de formaci&oacute;n en el transcurso del presente a&ntilde;o y cada una de ellas deber&aacute; organizar cuatro cursillos comunitarios. Dos de &eacute;stos se celebraron en Chile, el segundo de ellos fue financiado por la Cruz Roja Americana. En repetidas ocasiones, la Cruz Roja Americana hab&iacute;a aportado recursos a la regi&oacute;n, ayud&aacute;ndola a adaptar su sistema de reacci&oacute;n ante desastres a las condiciones en Am&eacute;rica Latina.<BR>

<P>La formaci&oacute;n en la preparaci&oacute;n para desastres ofrece a los voluntarios un nuevo papel, atrae la atenci&oacute;n de la comunidad hacia la secci&oacute;n en cuesti&oacute;n y demuestra su validez a largo plazo en tiempos de desastre.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H4><B>Desarrollo</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>Detener el c&iacute;rculo vicioso</B><BR>

<P>El socorro comprende mucho m&aacute;s que el suministro de tiendas de campa&ntilde;a y frazadas. El Movimiento estima que se deber&iacute;a conceder a la prevenci&oacute;n y a la preparaci&oacute;n una importancia id&eacute;ntica a la del remedio. A no ser que se corrijan los problemas que han conducido a la vulnerabilidad de un pueblo o que exista una preparaci&oacute;n para superarlos, los desastres y otras crisis nunca ser&aacute;n casos aislados. Forman parte de un ciclo peri&oacute;dico y en evoluci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Ci&ntilde;&eacute;ndose a sus principios fundamentales, el Movimiento apoya actividades de desarrollo que promueven el respeto por todos los seres humanos y que previenen o alivian el sufrimiento. Para el Movimiento, el concepto de desarrollo supone el mejoramiento de la calidad de vida, la participaci&oacute;n plena de la comunidad, el uso mancomunado de recursos y la preservaci&oacute;n del medio ambiente.<BR>

<P>Se lograr&aacute;n cambios de talla mediante el fortalecimiento de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja. La educaci&oacute;n en materia de, entre otros, el derecho humanitario y la protecci&oacute;n del medio ambiente resulta fundamental y los miembros de la comunidad, incluido al personal de las Sociedades Nacionales, quienes est&aacute;n en condiciones id&oacute;neas para concebir planes de autoayuda. En calidad de auxiliares de los poderes p&uacute;blicos se exige a las Sociedades Nacionales que establezcan sus propios planes de desarrollo, con &eacute;nfasis en su ejecuci&oacute;n amplia y efectiva. Las Sociedades Nacionales que lo necesitan, solicitan ayuda a otras Sociedades miembros, proporcion&aacute;ndoles antecedentes completos de la situaci&oacute;n, las necesidades y las prioridades.<BR>

<P>En el plano internacional, incumbe a la Federaci&oacute;n la responsabilidad prioritaria en cuanto al fomento del desarrollo de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja. Sin embargo, en a&ntilde;os recientes, el CICR ha asignado una creciente cantidad de recursos con este prop&oacute;sito, en particular en esferas tales como la asistencia jur&iacute;dica y t&eacute;cnica, el apoyo a programas de difusi&oacute;n del derecho internacional humanitario y los principios fundamentales, la preparaci&oacute;n de las Sociedades Nacionales para ejecutar actividades en caso de conflicto y la formaci&oacute;n de dirigentes y colaboradores de las Sociedades Nacionales.<BR>
Con frecuencia, este enfoque desde la base tiene &eacute;xito. La ayuda que permite a las personas conservar su ganado, sus herramientas y semillas acrecentar&aacute; hoy un estado de &aacute;nimo positivo y la capacidad para superar dificultades ma&ntilde;ana. Tambi&eacute;n es esencial mantener intactas las estructuras sociales. Los programas que asocian a dirigentes del pueblo resultan vitales cuando cunde la adversidad.<BR>

<P>El mundo moderno puede preguntarse por qu&eacute; los desastres perjudican una y otra vez a los pobres, los enfermos y los maltratados. Deber&iacute;a indagar en s&iacute; mismo para hallar la respuesta. La comunidad mundial ha construido un sistema universal en el cual los pobres no tienen voz. La comunidad internacional debe brindarles los medios para superar ese silencio. Su voz puede ser precisamente la que permita resolver los crecientes problemas contempor&aacute;neos.<BR>

<H4><B><I>Propuestas a la Conferencia</I></B></H4>
<P>
<P><I>on motivo de la Conferencia, se invitar&aacute; a los gobiernos y a las Sociedades Nacionales a que:</I><BR>
<I>	</I><BR>
<B><I>reconozcan y apoyen activamente la capacidad de las Sociedades Nacionales;</I></B><BR>
<I>las Sociedades Nacionales deben contar con medios adecuados para atender a las necesidades de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables en sus comunidades respetando la dignidad humana y los valores humanitarios;</I><BR>
<I>	</I><BR>
<B><I>apoyen a la red mundial de Sociedades Nacionales;</I></B><BR>
<I>los gobiernos deber&iacute;an reconocer la importancia de la red mundial de Sociedades Nacionales y apoyar su desarrollo como medio para atender las necesidades del creciente n&uacute;mero de poblaciones en extremo vulnerables;</I><BR>
<I>	</I><BR>
<B><I>proporcionen recursos financieros y humanos;</I></B><BR>
<I>se invitar&aacute; a los gobiernos a apoyar el fortalecimiento de la capacidad de las Sociedades Nacionales mediante el respaldo directo y el fomento de un entorno propicio para el desarrollo institucional de las Sociedades Nacionales;</I><BR>
<I>	</I><BR>
<B><I>utilicen debidamente el potencial de las Sociedades Nacionales;</I></B><BR>
<I>reconoci&eacute;ndose el potencial de las Sociedades Nacionales como agentes de servicios sociales, atenci&oacute;n de salud y asistencia de emergencia en favor de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables, se instar&aacute; a los gobiernos a reconocer y a utilizar debidamente este potencial, sin olvidar la necesidad de establecer un sistema de respaldo financiero cuando las Sociedades Nacionales se encargan de esos servicios para complementar aqu&eacute;llos que prestan los poderes p&uacute;blicos.</I><BR>

<P><B>La reconstrucci&oacute;n</B><BR>

<P>La inquina de la guerra dej&oacute; a Lao entre los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s incapacitados del mundo. Su Sociedad Nacional, fundada en 1957, permaneci&oacute; incorporada al Ministerio de Salud y hasta 1991, cuando se form&oacute; una nueva Sociedad Nacional. Puesto que en Lao, se conoc&iacute;a poco al Movimiento de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, la Sociedad Nacional tuvo que darse a conocer tanto a nivel central como provincial. Al establecer sus secciones, la Sociedad Nacional tropez&oacute; con la diversidad &eacute;tnica y geogr&aacute;fica del pa&iacute;s.<BR>

<P>La Cruz Roja Lao sobrellev&oacute; estos desaf&iacute;os y ahora ofrece servicios a trav&eacute;s de cinco secciones oficiales. Su primera secci&oacute;n en Luang Prabang, 200 km al norte de la capital del pa&iacute;s, se form&oacute; en 1993. Entre sus prioridades se hallan la prevenci&oacute;n en materia de VIH y SIDA, los primeros auxilios, la juventud, las actividades de socorro y sociales, la atenci&oacute;n a la mujer y la recaudaci&oacute;n de fondos.<BR>

<P>El a&ntilde;o ha sido productivo para esta secci&oacute;n. Con la ayuda de una delegada de desarrollo de la Cruz Roja Suiza, comenz&oacute; por generar dinero para una oficina. Se acerc&oacute; al sector comercial, con resultados prometedores, recaud&aacute;ndose tambi&eacute;n fondos me-diante un concierto de baile y un ba&ntilde;o de vapor tradicional de Laos. Adem&aacute;s, se han colocado alcanc&iacute;as en todos los hoteles y restaurantes.<BR>

<P>Los fondos recaudados se han invertido inmediatamente en actividades comunitarias. Los principales beneficiarios son los damnificados por los numerosos incendios forestales que ocurren en la temporada seca. Otro grupo prioritario es el de las familias pobres, a quienes se entrega mantas, mosquiteros, utensilios de cocina, sal yodada, ropa y medicinas. En 1994, se distribuyeron suministros por un valor de 8 millones de kips (aproximadamente 10.400 d&oacute;lares US) a 3.500 personas desamparadas en diez aldeas. El dinero generados por el ba&ntilde;o de vapor tradicional sirve de ayuda a los pacientes empobrecidos de los hospitales en los distritos y las provincias, ya que muchos recorren largas distancias y no cuentan con familiares para atenderlos.<BR>

<P>Todo indica un &eacute;xito rotundo. As&iacute; como lo se&ntilde;al&oacute; la representante de la Federaci&oacute;n en Lao, Ello demuestra el resultado decisivo que puede tener el esfuerzo de un delegado experimentado en materia de desarrollo, con material b&aacute;sico, un presupuesto estable y el entusiasmo y la entrega del pueblo de una Sociedad Nacional.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H4><B>Asistencia a las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>En el sendero de la rehabilitaci&oacute;n</B><BR>

<P>La palabra vulnerable suscita reacciones interesantes. Algunos consideran que designa a quienes ya no son capaces de valerse por s&iacute; mismos, a quienes han visto su existencia hacerse a&ntilde;icos bajo el peso de los elementos, quedando desamparados. Se refieren por ejemplo, a las poblaciones que construyen viviendas endebles en las orillas de un r&iacute;o y las vuelven a reconstruir all&iacute; despu&eacute;s de inundadas. Sin embargo, hoy la mayor&iacute;a de las personas vulnerables se siente suficientemente motivada y fuerte para salir adelante por sus propios medios. Despu&eacute;s de todo, han soportado mucho y lo han sobrevivido todo. Necesitan apenas herramientas y capacitaci&oacute;n para garantizarse una vez m&aacute;s vidas seguras. Esas mismas personas que construyen a orillas del r&iacute;o, anhelan que cambie su suerte y que consigan un terreno m&aacute;s elevado para construir en &eacute;l.<BR>

<P>Vale la pena aliviar el sufrimiento de cualquier persona. Frente a alguien que sufre, ello resulta obvio. No obstante, puede resultar algo remoto para quien no lo ve en su quehacer cotidiano. Las operaciones de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja pueden parecer idealistas en un mundo en el que ya nadie cree en desenlaces felices.<BR>

<P>Empero existen. Hay refugiados que vuelven a sus hogares; padres que se re&uacute;nen con sus hijos desaparecidos; personas rescatadas de los campos de batalla. Numerosas son las vidas que se salvan merced a los cursillos de las Sociedades Nacionales sobre primeros auxilios y medidas preventivas contra el SIDA. En este momento, millones de personas en todo el mundo reciben alimentos, cobijo y atenci&oacute;n m&eacute;dica que les permite sobrevivir.<BR>

<P>En su Plan Estrat&eacute;gico de Trabajo para el Decenio de 1990, la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja hace hincapi&eacute; en el desaf&iacute;o de mejorar la condici&oacute;n de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables mediante un enfoque de desarrollo gradual, que se apoye en el fortalecimiento de la red mundial de comunidades con el objetivo de robustecer la capacidad de las personas para hacer frente a las crisis. Ha emprendido un camino que parte de soluciones halladas en la base. Se considera que al concentrar su atenci&oacute;n en las capacidades locales, empezando con las de un individuo, de una comunidad, de una regi&oacute;n, poco a poco podr&aacute; abarcar a millones de personas vulnerables y atender sus dificultades.<BR>

<P><I>En ocasi&oacute;n de la Conferencia, se invitar&aacute; a los gobiernos y a las Sociedades Nacionales a que:</I><BR>

<P><B>Superado lo peor</B><BR>

<P>Nada, una refugiada de Bosnia y Herzegovina, trabaja desde hace dos a&ntilde;os en un programa de ayuda social auspiciado por la Federaci&oacute;n y por la Cruz Roja de Croacia. Cuando reci&eacute;n lleg&oacute; a Zagreb de Bosnia, tem&iacute;a salir a la calle. Su hijo mayor tambi&eacute;n quedo afectado por la experiencia de su familia durante la guerra y tuvo que beneficiar de asistencia psicol&oacute;gica en la escuela. &quot;Al principio, nos result&oacute; a todos dif&iacute;cil adaptarnos. Tuvimos que empezar de cero&quot;, dice Nada.<BR>

<P>Esta nueva situaci&oacute;n y las necesidades de su familia llevaron a Nada a solicitar empleo con el programa de asistencia social. En su primera sesi&oacute;n de formaci&oacute;n, en la cual escuch&oacute; historias personales parecidas a la suya, se ech&oacute; a llorar. Sin embargo, paulatinamente, su labor de ayuda a otros refugiados y personas desplazadas le permiti&oacute; sobreponerse a sus propios pesares y ansiedades y conquistar una nueva fe en s&iacute;.<BR>

<P>Una cat&aacute;strofe produce dos tipos de sufrimiento: el inmediato durante el desastre y aquel posterior a &eacute;ste. La recuperaci&oacute;n precoz constituye un elemento vital en la vulnerabilidad futura de una v&iacute;ctima. Los programas de socorro en casos de desastre m&aacute;s acertados son aquellos que dejan detr&aacute;s a una poblaci&oacute;n capaz, autosuficiente y digna.<BR>

<P>Ahora, Nada conoce personalmente a los 157 residentes del centro comunitario donde trabaja. A menudo, les trae fruta fresca, cartas y mensajes de sus familias. Ha fundado un grupo de artesan&iacute;as, otro de bailes para ni&ntilde;os, adem&aacute;s de otras actividades sociales. Todas las actividades colectivas se realizan en locales prefabricados. Uno de &eacute;stos se dedica a actividades para los ni&ntilde;os, otro a grupos de hombres que fabrican artesan&iacute;as de mimbre. Los residentes se abastecen de hortalizas que suministran tambi&eacute;n a la cocina de la comunidad, aprovechando los lotes cercanos al centro que les fueron asignados.<BR>

<P>Nada se siente dichosa de poder ayudar a los dem&aacute;s porque hace poco se encontraba en una situaci&oacute;n parecida. La alegra ver ojos donde poco a poco cesa el llanto. Se refiere a una refugiada de veinte a&ntilde;os que se transform&oacute;; pas&oacute; de ser una mujer desconfiada y sollozante a protagonizar como una de las voluntarias estrella del centro. Al comienzo, la mayor&iacute;a llor&aacute;bamos dice, &quot;Ahora aprendemos unos de otros&quot;.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H4><B>Encarnar los principios</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Paul Lifetu est&aacute; acostumbrado a tomar decisiones nada f&aacute;ciles. En su carrera se refleja la historia de la independencia de Zaire y sus dificultades. A los 20 a&ntilde;os abandon&oacute; un empleo estable con las autoridades locales para convertirse en secretario provincial de la Cruz Roja de Zaire. Desde entonces colabora con la Sociedad Nacional. Algo en el esp&iacute;ritu de la Cruz Roja, su af&aacute;n de servicio, me atrajo, explica. A pesar de haber asumido algunos cargos en la oficina central de Kinshasa, sigue dedic&aacute;ndose al trabajo pr&aacute;ctico en el terreno.<BR>

<P>Otro decenio, otra guerra. Paul Lifetu regresa a Bukavu; trabaja con los voluntarios de la Cruz Roja de Zaire y los delegados de la Federaci&oacute;n en medio de la pat&eacute;tica huida de todo un pa&iacute;s. Recuerda su misi&oacute;n anterior. Puede se&ntilde;alar el lugar exacto donde se estrell&oacute; un avi&oacute;n en el Lago Kivu en 1967. Entonces, las poblaciones hu&iacute;an de Bukavu a Ruanda; hoy los ruandeses se refugian en Zaire.<BR>

<P>Cabe acaso rescatar algo de las ruinas de la guerra, del genocidio y del desmoronamiento social? De momento, el &uacute;nico recurso s&oacute;lido con el que puede contar la Cruz Roja de Zaire es su pueblo. Empero, no cabe la menor duda en lo que respecta al calibre de sus recursos humanos, producto de la historia de un pa&iacute;s con aut&eacute;nticas razones para necesitar el esp&iacute;ritu, los valores y los principios de la Cruz Roja y la Media Luna Roja. Este esp&iacute;ritu anima claramente a los voluntarios, a los veteranos que muestran con orgullo sus ajados certificados de primeros auxilios obtenidos 20 a&ntilde;os atr&aacute;s. Forma parte decididamente de la personalidad y la carrera de una persona como Paul Lifetu. Se trata de un esp&iacute;ritu que subsistir&aacute; mucho despu&eacute;s del fin de la guerra y del regreso de los refugiados a sus hogares.<BR>

<H2>Red Cross law</H2>
<P><I>By Fran&ccedil;ois Bugnion</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>Fran&ccedil;ois Bugnion,</I></B><I> Arts graduate and Doctor of Political Science, entered the service of the ICRC in 1970. He served the institution in Israel and the occupied territories (1970-1972), in Bangladesh (1973-1974) and more briefly in Turkey and Cyprus (1974), Chad (1978), Viet Nam and Cambodia (1979). Since 1989, he has been Deputy Director on the ICRC Department for Principles, Law and Relations with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. He is the author of: </I>Le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge et la protection des victimes de la guerre<I> (ICRC, Geneva, 1994).</I><BR>

<P>
<H4><B>1. Introduction</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The International Committee is a Red Cross institution. It takes part in the deliberations of the International Conferences and other statutory bodies of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement of which it is the founder; but it may also be subject to rules laid down by those statutory bodies.[1] <BR>

<P>What is the impact of the rules and resolutions adopted by the Movement's statutory bodies vis-&agrave;-vis the ICRC, the National Societies and their Federation on the one hand, and the States party to the Geneva Conventions on the other? In any study of the formal sources of the rules applicable to the International Committee in current humanitaian law, these questions must be examined.<BR>

<P>As the Red Cross issued from a private initiative, one might see &quot;Red Cross law&quot; - meaning all the rules drawn up by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement - as an autonomous legal system having no relevance to international law. But this would be quite wrong.<BR>

<P>Indeed, despite the essentially private origins of the Movement's constituent parts - the National Societies, the ICRC and the Federation - there can be no denying that the deliberations and actions of the International Red Cross are of concern to public international law. Three points should be made:<BR>

<P>(a)	The States party to the Geneva Conventions take part in the Movement's International Conferences; they are represented by delegates with sufficient powers for them to participate in the debates and to vote in accordance with the instructions of their governments; these delegates therefore legitimately represent the States whose official position they put forward; the participation of government delegates gives the International Conferences an element of public authority which cannot be disregarded by international law;[2]<BR>

<P>(b)	the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions are subject to rules of public international law and carry out activities that are governed by the law of nations; because of this, it may be argued that they possess some measure of international legal personality;<BR>

<P>(c)	the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions themselves contribute to the formation of international humanitarian law, both by their activities and by the drafting of legal instruments which are then submitted to diplomatic conferences.<BR>

<P>It can therefore be concluded that, although the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions are governed essentially by private law, by virtue of their composition and their statutes, their actions, and in particular the proceedings of the International Conferences, have a certain relevance to public international law. Consequently, it must be determined what impact the actions of the Movement have on its members on the one hand and on the States party to the Geneva Conventions on the other.<BR>

<P>Before considering these questions, a reminder of the composition and attributions of the statutory bodies of the International Red Cross is in order.<BR>

<P><B>2. The statutory bodies of the International Red Cross  and Red Crescent Movement</B><BR>

<P>From the outset, the Red Cross differed from other charitable organizations that flourished during the second half of the nineteenth century in two basic respects: the permanent nature and the international aspirations of the institutions set up on the basis of the resolutions adopted at the Geneva Conference of October 1863 which gave birth to the Red Cross.<BR>

<P>In order to preserve the bonds of solidarity that united them across national borders, the Red Cross Societies were to meet regularly, as laid down by Article 9 of the 1863 resolutions:<BR>
	<BR>
&quot;<I>The Committees and Sections of different countries may meet in international assemblies to communicate the results of their experience and to agree on measures to be taken in the interest of the work</I>&quot;.[3]<BR>

<P>The International Committee, as promoter of the Red Cross and guardian of its Fundamental Princples, has always played an active part in such assemblies; the League, as the federation of the National Societies, took part from 1921.<BR>

<P>Moreover, from the very start the Red Cross has placed its work in the context of international relations and the law of nations.<BR>

<P>To achieve its aims, therefore, the Red Cross needed to associate the States with its activities. This was done at two levels: nationally, each central committee was expected &quot;to get in touch with the Government of its country, so that its services may be accepted should the occasion arise&quot;;[4] while at the international level the States party to the Geneva Convention were invited to take part in the International Conferences of the Red Cross and did so from the very first, which was held in Paris in 1867.<BR>

<P>All these factors led to the present composition of the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Under the Statutes adopted by the Thirteenth Conference (The Hague, 1928), revised by the Eighteenth (Toronto, 1952) and again by the Twentyfifth (Geneva, 1986),[5] the International Conference is made up of the following:<BR>
- delegations from duly recognized National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies;<BR>
- delegations from the International Committee of the Red Cross and from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies;<BR>
- delegations from the States party to the Geneva Conventions.<BR>

<P>The International Conference is the Movement's supreme deliberative body; as a rule, it meets every four years.<BR>
	<BR>
The delegations from the National Societies, the ICRC, the Federation and the States party to the Geneva Conventions are all entitled to play a full part in the proceedings and the voting; each delegation has one vote.[6]<BR>

<P>From the time of the Second International Conference of the Red Cross (which met in Berlin in 1869) onwards, National Society delegates were asked to come with precise instructions and sufficient authority to be able to exercise their right to vote.[7] Likewise, it has always been acknowledged that the government delegates are not acting in a personal capacity, but on behalf of the States whose official position they express through their statements and ballots.[8]<BR>

<P>While the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement is essentially a nongovernmental international association, the participation of government representatives at the International Conference gives the meeting a mixed status, both private and public. The composition of the Conference also reflects upon the impact of its resolutions:<BR>
	<BR>
&quot;<I>The votes of government representatives transform what was originally a private matter into a semiprivate legal act, of a mixed nature: Conference resolutions thus impinge on the sphere of public international law because of the status of those who drafted and approved them, and any obligations they may contain may be binding on States, to an extent to be determined later&quot;.</I><BR>

<P>The Movement's other statutory bodies are the Council of Delegates and the Standing Commission.<BR>

<P>The Council of Delegates is made up of representatives of the National Societies, the ICRC and the Federation; it must meet at the time of every International Conference and may also meet between Conferences.[10] As it comprises only representatives of Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions, the Council is the forum in which questions directly concerning the Movement can be discussed. Moreover, several particularly important matters have been given their first airing at the Council of Delegates before being submitted to the Conference.[11]<BR>

<P>The Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent consists of nine members, five elected in a personal capacity by the International Conference, two representatives of the ICRC and two of the Federation; as a rule it meets twice a year. Its duties are essentially of a procedural nature.[12]<BR>

<P>In examining the formal sources of the rules applicable to the International Committee in current humanitarian law, consideration must be given first and foremost to resolutions of the International Conferences. However, before seeking to gauge the legal impact of these resolutions, close attention must be paid to two instruments which, because of their constitutive and fundamental nature, occupy a special place: the Movement's Statutes and its Fundamental Principles.<BR>

<P><B>3. The Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</B>[13]<BR>

<P><B>Origins</B><BR>

<P>Up until the end of the First World War, the legal structure of the Red Cross was relatively slender, consisting of the resolutions of the founding Conference of October 1863, which the ICRC and the National Societies considered binding, a few resolutions of a regulatory nature adopted by International Conferences of the Red Cross, and by a number of tacit rules imposed by the nature and aims of its work. Each International Conference adopted its own rules of procedure, using previous ones as a guide. Thus at the statutory level the International Red Cross was governed by rules that were to a large extent customary.<BR>

<P>With the founding of the League of Red Cross Societies arose the question of the Movement's organization at the international level. During lengthy negotiations, not always very cordial, vain attempts were made to merge the ICRC and the League. Nothing came of this. The ICRC was adamant in preserving its independence, which it believed was essential for its work, while several National Societies insisted on maintaining a federative body which they had a hand in running. Despite its drawbacks, the &quot;two-headed&quot; structure was maintained.<BR>

<P>This coexistence of two bodies at the international level necessitated a rational sharing of tasks and responsibilities, as well as a clear demarcation between the position of the ICRC and that of the League within the Movement. The Red Cross as a whole had to adopt a statutory structure designed to safeguard the unity of the Movement and harmonize the activities of the National Societies, the ICRC and the League.<BR>

<P>A set of draft statutes, drawn up by Professor Max Huber, then a member of the Committee, and by Colonel Draudt, VicePresident of the League, was adopted by the Thirteenth International Conference of the Red Cross at The Hague in October 1928.[14] These statutes were revised by the Eighteenth International Conference (Toronto, July-August 1952), but their basic tenor remained unchanged.[15]<BR>

<P>Although for the most part the statutes of the International Red Cross did no more than confirm the <I>status quo</I>, the delegates meeting in The Hague firmly believed that they had laid the foundations of a veritable international organization by giving the Red Cross statutory bodies having defined powers.<BR>

<P>Indeed, those statutes stood the test of time, and for more than half a century they provided the framework for the Movement's development.<BR>

<P>However, in April 1982 the League's Executive Council set up a working group which was asked to &quot;undertake a detailed study with a view to revising the Statutes of the International Red Cross&quot;.[16] Although the ICRC was quite satisfied with the statutes then in force, it agreed to take part in this enterprise.<BR>

<P>The draft statutes drawn up by the joint ICRC/League working group drew largely on the Toronto revision.[17]<BR>
The balance between the Movement's components was not altered, but the powers and tasks of the various bodies were more clearly defined; the price of this was that the statutes became more wordy, as not even the Red Cross was immune from the rampant verbosity endemic among international organizations. <BR>

<P>The new Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement were adopted by consensus at the Twentyfifth International Conference of the Red Cross, meeting in Geneva in October 1986.[18]<BR>

<P><B>Content</B><BR>

<P>The preamble, which we shall come back to later, recalls the mission and Fundamental Principles of the Movement.<BR>

<P>Article 1 gives various definitions; Article 2 is addressed to governments and reminds the States party to the Geneva Conventions that they have undertaken to cooperate with the components of the Movement.<BR>

<P>Article 3 defines the role of the National Societies, and the conditions for their recognition are given in Article 4.<BR>

<P>Article 5 defines the role of the International Committee, Article 6 that of the Federation. Cooperation between them, and within the Movement, is dealt with in Article 7.<BR>

<P>Articles 8 to 11 lay down the definition, composition, functions and procedure of the International Conference; Articles 12 to 15 do the same for the Council of Delegates, and Articles 16 to 19 for the Standing Commission.<BR>

<P>Article 20 sets conditions for amending the Statutes; their entry into force (8 November 1986) is given in Article 21.[19]<BR>

<P>Article 5 is of direct concern to this study; its wording is as follows:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>1. The International Committee, founded in Geneva in 1863 and formally recognized in the Geneva Conventions and by International Conferences of the Red Cross, is an independent humanitarian organization having a status of its own. It coopts its members from among Swiss citizens.</I><BR>

<P><I>2. The role of the International Committee, in accordance with its Statutes, is in particular:</I><BR>

<P><I>a) 	to maintain and disseminate the Fundamental Principles of the Movement, namely humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity and universality; </I><BR>

<P><I>b) 	to recognize any newly established or reconstituted National Society, which fulfils the condition for recognition set out in Article 4, and to notify other National Societies of such recognition;</I><BR>

<P><I>c)	to undertake the tasks incumbent upon it under the Geneva Conventions, to work for the faithful application of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and to take cognizance of any complaints based on alleged breaches of that law;</I><BR>

<P><I>d) 	to endeavour at all times  as a neutral institution whose humanitarian work is carried out particularly in time of international and other armed conflicts or internal strife $ to ensure the protection of and assistance to military and civilian victims of such events and of their direct results;</I><BR>

<P><I>e) 	to ensure the operation of the Central Tracing Agency as provided in the Geneva Conventions;</I><BR>

<P><I>f) 	to contribute, in anticipation of armed conflicts, to the training of medical personnel and the preparation of medical equipmet, in cooperation with the National Societies, the military and civilian medical services and other competent authorities; </I><BR>

<P><I>g) 	to work for the understanding and dissemination of knowledge of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts and to prepare any development thereof; </I><BR>

<P><I>h) 	to carry out mandates entrusted to it by the International Conference.</I><BR>
<I>	</I><BR>
<I>3. The International Committee may take any humanitarian initiative which comes within its role as a specifically neutral and independent institution and intermediary, and may consider any question requiring examination by such an institution. </I><BR>

<P><I>4.a) It shall maintain close contact with National Societies. In agreement with them, it shall cooperate in matters of common concern, such as their preparation for action in times of armed conflict, respect for and development and ratification of the Geneva Conventions, and the dissemination of the Fundamental Principles and international humanitarian law. </I><BR>

<P><I>b) In situations foreseen in paragraph 2 d) of this Article and requiring coordinated assistance from National Societies of other countries, the International Committee, in cooperation with the National Society of the country or countries concerned, shall coordinate such assistance in accordance with the agreements concluded with the League.</I><BR>

<P><I>5. Within the framework of the present Statutes and subject to the provisions of Articles 3, 6 and 7, the International Committee shall maintain close contact with the League and cooperate with it in matters of common concern.</I><BR>

<P><I>6. It shall also maintain relations with governmental authorities and any national or international institution whose assistance it considers useful&quot;.[20]</I><BR>

<P>It will be seen that the Movement's new Statutes do not give the International Committee any powers that it did not exercise previously. Article 5 can therefore be considered as codifying wellestablished practice.<BR>

<P><B>Legal effects</B><BR>

<P>The constitutive instrument of an organization always has two aspects: <I>a contractual aspect, </I>since it is an agreement between the parties concerned, and <I>a constitutional aspect</I>, since it provides the framework that enables the organization to function. The obligatory force of these rules arises directly from the constitutive aspect of the instrument in question: if the rules were not binding on the parties, the organization could not exist:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>The constitutive instrument states in a mandatory fashion the rights and obligations of the members and determines the powers of the statutory bodies; its obligatory nature necessarily stems from its constitutive status since, by the will of the parties, it creates an association&quot;.[21]</I><BR>

<P>In the case of the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, however, the diverse nature of the bodies bound by the rules must be taken into account. The legal implications of the Statutes must be examined separately in relation to the Movement's members on the one hand, and in relation to the States party to the Geneva Conventions on the other.<BR>

<P>The ICRC, the National Societies and their Federation all stem from private initiative. There are no particular conditions for an association between organizations of this kind; all that is required is their agreement.[22] A relief organization that refused to adhere to the Movement's Statutes could not be recognized as a Red Cross or Red Crescent institution and could in no circumstances become a member of the Movement.[23] Nor could the members of the Movement demand of a new National Society that it abide by conditions that they themselves were not bound to observe.[24] The Statuts are binding in all respects on every member of the Movement.<BR>

<P>The question becomes more complex in regard to the States party to the Geneva Conventions. The Statutes were not adopted in the usual manner laid down in the law of treaties, but as a resolution - or decision - of an International Conference of the Red Cross. They therefore do not have the status of an international treaty, but this does not detract from their obligatory nature; States, after all, are free to give their assent in any way they see fit. By voting for the Statutes, they contributed to the adoption of a legal instrument enshrining the existence of the International Red Cross and establishing the statutory basis of a Movement with which they are closely linked:<BR>

<P><I>&quot;The fact that the Statutes were not adopted as a treaty does not mean that States are not bound by them: governments are free to give their consent in any way they choose. Although the Statutes were not adopted in the form of an international treaty, they nevertheless constitute an international instrument which, by its nature, binds the States&quot;.[25]</I><BR>

<P>Moreover, it would be absurd for States to take part in the establishment of statutory rules imposing obligations on members of the Movement - the ICRC, the Federation and the National Societies - without admitting that the rules are binding on them as well.<BR>

<P>In any event, whether or not they were party to the adoption of the Statutes, States that take part in the International Conference recognize the obligatory nature of the statutory rules of the Movement, of which the Conference is an organ; otherwise their attendance would be about as logical as the presence at a sporting event of a competitor who refused to accept the rules of the competition. They are therefore precluded from challenging the  obligatory nature of the Statutes therefore also arises from debarment.<BR>

<P>These conclusions are confirmed by practice. The fact is that government delegations have never claimed, either in 1928 or later, that States were not bound by the Statutes.[26] Quite the contrary: in accepting the Movement's new Statutes, the States party to the Geneva Conventions explicitly undertook to cooperate with the Movement's components in accordance with the Conventions, the Statutes and the resolutions of the International Conference.[27]<BR>

<P>We can therefore conclude, along with Richard Perruchoud, that:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>By their vote, the States recognized the existence of the International Red Cross (...). Consequently, the Statutes apply to them in their entirety, both the provisions defining the authority of the Movement's statutory bodies and those specifying the attributions of the ICRC or the League&quot;.</I>[28]<BR>

<P>The International Committee is thus entitled to insist on the recognition by the States party to the Geneva Conventions of the powers it has been granted by the Movement's Statutes.<BR>

<P><B>4. The Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent</B>[29]<BR>

<P><B>Origins</B><BR>

<P>From the very start, the Red Cross was aware of following a number of basic principles dictated by the institution's aims and by the nature of the activities it proposed to carry out.<BR>

<P>To a large extent these principles were expressed in the Resolutions and Recommendations of the 1863 Conference, and in Article 6 of the Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864, which stated:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>Wounded or sick combatants, to whatever nation they may belong, shall be collected and cared for&quot;.</I><BR>

<P>From then on there were countless references to the funamental principles of the Red Cross: in 1869, the Berlin Conference asked the International Committee to ensure the principles were upheld and disseminated.[30] New National Societies, in order to be accepted as members of the Movement, had to adhere to the fundamental principles of the Red Cross.[31] The existence of these principles was accepted and their authority recognized.<BR>

<P>On the other hand, for almost a century little effort was made to establish a coherent and universally accepted definition of the principles.<BR>

<P>A first attempt was made in 1874, by Gustave Moynier. Noting that the Red Cross Societies were linked by &quot;the pledge they had made to conduct themselves according to certain common rules&quot;, Moynier distinguished four main principles:<BR>
	<BR>
-	<I>centralization</I>, meaning that there could be only one Society in each country; it had to extend its work throughout the national territory;<BR>
-	<I>preparedness</I>, which required each Society to take all necessary measures to be ready to work in the event of war;<BR>
-	<I>mutuality</I>, whereby each Society pledged to help all wounded and sick with equal urgency, whatever their nationality;<BR>
-	<I>solidarity</I>, whereby the Societies undertook to help each other.[32]<BR>

<P>When revising its own statutes after the First World War, the ICRC made the mention of four &quot;fundamental and uniform principles which are at the basis of the Red Cross institution, namely: impartiality, political, religious and economic independence, the universality of the Red Cross and the equality of its members.&quot;[33]<BR>

<P>These principles are mentioned, in almost identical wording, in Article 10 of the &quot;Conditions for the recognition of National Red Cross Societies&quot; approved by the Seventeenth International Conference of the Red Cross (Stockholm, 1948),[34] and in Article VI, para. 2, of the Statutes of the International Red Cross, revised by the Toronto Conference in 1952.[35]<BR>

<P>This statement of principles could not, however, be considered exhaustive. So even though the existence and compulsory nature of the fundamental principles was universally accepted, they remained largely undefined. The Red Cross unceasingly claimed to adhere to fundamental norms but appeared unwilling - or unable - to specify their content.<BR>

<P>The League's Board of Governors took up the question after the Second World War. To the four existing principles they added thirteen others, in which the aims of the Red Cross, its fundamental principles and some rules of procedure were jumbled together.[36]<BR>

<P>The Toronto Conference endorsed this new statement of principles, while stressing that the four original principles remained the cornerstone of the Red Cross - a remark that only added to the confusion.[37]<BR>

<P>Since the process of formulating the fundamental principles of the Red Cross had been started, universally acceptable wording had to be found. The Standing Commission decided to set up a joint ICRC-League commission for the purpose. On the basis of the resolutions of past Conferences and the outstanding contribution made by Max Huber and Jean Pictet, the joint commission prepared a draft of seven articles which was sent to all National Societies and approved unanimously by the Council of Delegates, meeting in Prague in 1961.[38] The draft was then submitted to the Twentieth International Conferenc (Vienna, 1965), where it was adopted unanimously under the title &quot;Proclamation of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross&quot;.[39]<BR>

<P>Since then, the Fundamental Principles - which are solemnly read out at the opening ceremony of each International Conference - have been recognized as the Movement's basic charter. Their authority has never been questioned.<BR>

<P>These principles - whose wording has remained unaltered, save for the replacement of <I>&quot;Red Cross</I>&quot; by <I>&quot;International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement</I>&quot; - are now incorporated in the Movement's new Statutes.[40] Their position in the preamble underscores both their authority and their preeminence in what may be called &quot;Red Cross law&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>Content</B><BR>

<P>The Fundamental Principles should be quoted in their entirety:<BR>
	<BR>
&quot;<I>HUMANITY</I><BR>
<I>The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, born of a desire to bring assistance without discrimination to the wounded on the battlefield, endeavours, in its international and national capacity, to prevent and alleviate human suffering wherever it may be found. Its purpose is to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being. It promotes mutual understanding, friendship, co-operation and lasting peace amongst all peoples.</I><BR>

<P><I>IMPARTIALITY</I><BR>
<I>It makes no discrimination as to nationality, race, religious beliefs, class or political opinions. It endeavours to relieve the suffering of individuals, being guided solely by their needs, and to give priority to the most urgent cases of distress.</I><BR>

<P><I>NEUTRALITY</I><BR>
<I>In order to continue to enjoy the confidence of all, the Movement may not take sides in hostilities or engage at any time in controversies of a political, racial, religious or ideological nature.</I><BR>

<P><I>INDEPENDENCE</I><BR>
<I>The Movement is independent. The National Societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their governments and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the Movement.</I><BR>

<P><I>VOLUNTARY SERVICE</I><BR>
<I>It is a voluntary relief movement not prompted in any manner by desire for gain.</I><BR>

<P><I>UNITY</I><BR>
<I>There can only be one Red Cross or one Red Crescent Society in any one country. It must be open to all. It must carry on its humanitarian work throughout its territory.</I><BR>

<P><I>UNIVERSALITY</I><BR>
<I>The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, in which all Societies have equal status and share equal responsibilities and duties in helping each other, is worldwide.[41]</I><BR>

<P><B>Legal effects</B><BR>

<P>Consideration must now be given to the legal effects of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.<BR>

<P>The moral authority of the principles is unquestionabl, but this does not exempt them from being examined from the legal viewpoint. In looking into the formal sources of the rules governing the ICRC, it is crucial to determine their legal effects.<BR>

<P>Once again, a distinction must be made between the position of the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions on the one hand, and that of the States party to the Geneva Conventions on the other.<BR>

<P>The binding force of the principles for the Movement stems from their fundamental character, from their unanimous acceptance as mandatory rules for the Movement's members and from their place in the set of rules making up &quot;Red Cross law&quot;.<BR>

<P>Just like the Statutes, the Fundamental Principles form part of the constitutive rules of the Red Cross. At the regulatory level, they perform the same function as the Statutes do at the institutional level: they provide the cement without which the edifice of the Movement would fall apart. Even more than the statutory rules, the principles stand for belief in certain basic ideals which transcend not only national borders but also political, economic, religious, ideological and racial differences; they preserve the bond of solidarity without which the Movement would lose its meaning.<BR>

<P>The principles' obligatory force is also rooted in tradition. Although their wording is relatively recent, there is no doubt that their proclamation in 1965 was the expression of a conviction going back to the very beginnings of the Movement.<BR>

<P>Last but not least, the principles are binding on the Red Cross and Red Crescent because they flow quite naturally from the Movement's essential purpose: take away the principle of humanity, and the Red Cross loses its <I>raison d'&ecirc;tre</I>; take away the other principles, and its work is paralysed.<BR>

<P>There is no difficulty in proving that the Fundamental Principles are indeed mandatory. The tenth condition for the recognition of new National Societies states that an aspiring Society must &quot;respect the Fundamental Principles of the Movement...&quot;.[42] It would be contrary to those very principles, and in particular to that of the equality of National Societies, to impose rules on new Societies that were not binding on existing ones. As for the Federation, it could hardly exempt itself from rules that were binding on all its members. The International Committee, as guardian of the principles, obviously has to abide by them.<BR>

<P>There is no doubt, therefore, that the Fundamental Principles proclaimed by the Twentieth International Conference, and reaffirmed by the Twentyfifth, are mandatory in their entirety for all Red Cross and Red Crescent bodies. They form a set of obligatory rules which the Movement could not renounce without dissolving itself.<BR>

<P>The same does not hold true, however, for the States party to the Geneva Conventions. The wording of the 1965 proclamation and that of the preamble to the Statutes makes it quite clear that these are rules directed towards the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions.<BR>

<P>Nevertheless, this does not mean that States are totally unaffected by rules which they themselves approved unanimously.<BR>

<P>Indeed, as the Fundamental Principles are referred to in treaty law, they may create obligations for States party to the Geneva Conventions. Article 44, para. 2, of the First Convention allows National Societies to use the red cross emblem in peacetime when carrying out activities that conform to the principles laid down by International Conferences of the Red Cross. Article 63 of the Fourth Convention states that an occupying power must, save for temporary and exceptional security measures, allow recognized National Societies to pursue their activities in accordance with Red Cross Principles, as defined by the International Red Cross Conferences. Similarly, Article 81 of Protocol I refers to the Fundamental Principles to define the facilities which parties to a conflict must grant to National Societies and the League;[43] during the drafting of the Protocol, it was made clear that this referred to the principles contained in the 1965 proclamation.[44]<BR>

<P>But the States' obligations go beyond those set out in treaty law. It has to be accepted that they are bound in a more general sense; it would be inconceivable that States should take part in the adoption of rules binding on the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions without acknowledging that those institutions have to obey the rules in question.<BR>

<P>Is it possible to define the scope of this obligation? Any legal obligation can take one of the following three forms: an obligation to act, an obligation to refrain from acting, or an obligation to permit action. In the case of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, the governments' obligation is of the third kind. Given the mandatory force of the principles for members of the Movement and their place in &quot;Red Cross law&quot; on the one hand, and the participation of governments in the adoption of the principles on the other, it is obvious that, quite apart from any treaty obligation, the States are bound to allow Red Cross and Red Crescent bodies to act in accordance with the principles and to insist on this right being respected. If this were not the case, government support for the adoption of the principles would be meaningless.<BR>

<P>So while the States themselves are not bound to adhere to the Fundamental Principles, they are obliged to allow Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations to do so. The principles may therefore be invoked against States party to the Geneva Conventions, and the Movement's organizations are within their rights to insist on respecting them.<BR>

<P>This conclusion is supported by Article 2, para. 4, of the Movement's Statutes, which states:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>The States shall at all times respect the adherence by all the components of the Movement to the Fundamental Principles&quot;.[45]</I><BR>

<P>A recent example serves to illustrate the point.<BR>

<P>Between 1970 and 1979 Cambodia, then called Kampuchea, was ravaged by a ferocious civil war, followed by a reign of terror imposed by fanatical revolutionaries; this regime was toppled in January 1979, leaving the country in an indescribable state of devastation. In the summer of 1979 the ICRC and UNICEF sent two delegates to Kampuchea to meet the new authorities and to lay the groundwork for a relief operation to save the Khmer people from imminent famine. Negotiations with the government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea had almost been completed when hundreds of thousands of Cambodian refugees fled towards Thailand. The ICRC and UNICEF decided to assist them, by distributing relief supplies not only to those who had crossed into Thailand but also to those who had gathered at the border, in areas that the Phnom Penh government did not control. The latter considered this to be unacceptable interference in the country's internal affairs and threatened to expel the joint ICRC/UNICEF mission unless it stopped the border operation immediately.[46] The two organizations were faced with a dilemma: either they ignored the pressing need to help people at the border, or they accepted the risk of a breakdown in relations with the Phnom Penh authorities, who exercised <I>de facto</I> control over most of the country and most of the population.<BR>

<P>The International Committee assessed the problem primarily from the point of view of the Red Cross principles. On the basis of the principles of humanity and impartiality, it came to the following conclusions:<BR>

<P>(a)	it had not only the right but also the duty to bring protection and assistance to all victims of the conflict;<BR>

<P>(b)	the principle of impartiality obliged it to offer its services to every authority which exercised <I>de facto </I>control over the victims;<BR>

<P>(c)	no overnment was entitled to demand that the ICRC violate the Fundamental Red Cross Principles.<BR>
The Executive Director of UNICEF, having regard essentially to the principle of nondiscrimination, came to the same conclusions.<BR>

<P>Delegates of the joint mission were instructed to explain this position to the Kampuchean authorities. While maintaining its opposition to the relief operations carried out from Thai territory, the Phnom Penh government agreed to pursue its cooperation with the ICRC and UNICEF, thereby implicitly acknowledging the ICRC's right to continue an operation consistent with the Red Cross principles.[47] Once this political obstacle had been overcome, the two organizations began what was to become one of the largest relief operations since the end of the Second World War.[48]<BR>

<P>This example is a good illustration of the legal weight of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent: the principles are obligatory for the Movement; they have to be respected by States party to the Geneva Conventions in that these States must agree to the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions' observance of them.<BR>

<P>In its judgment of 27 June 1986 in the case of military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, the International Court of Justice acknowledged without any ambiguity that the Red Cross Fundamental Principles had to be respected by States. Examining the lawfulness of the &quot;humanitarian assistance&quot; supplied by the United States government to the counterrevolutionary forces (<I>contras</I>) opposing the government of Nicaragua, with reference to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a State, the Court unhesitatingly observed that the provision of strictly humanitarian assistance to persons or forces in another country could in no way be considered illicit, provided that such assistance conformed to the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross, in particular those of humanity and impartiality:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>An essential feature of truly humanitarian aid is that it is given without discrimination' of any kind. In the view of the Court, if the provision of humanitarian assistance' is to escape condemnation as an intervention in the internal affairs of Nicarauga, not only must it be limited to the purposes hallowed in the practice of the Red Cross, namely to prevent and alleviate human suffering', and to protect life and health and to ensure respect for the human being'; it must also, and above all, be given without discrimination to all in need...&quot;.</I>[49]<BR>

<P>The International Court of Justice thus clearly recognized the obligatory force of the Fundamental Red Cross Principles; not only do they oblige States to allow Red Cross and Red Crescent bodies to abide by them, but they are also a source of obligations for States themselves, if the latter claim to be engaged in humanitarian activity.<BR>

<P>Finally, government delegations attending International Conferences of the Red Cross must respect the Movement's Fundamental Principles in the same way as all the other delegations. Article 11, para. 4, of the Movement's Statutes states:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>All participants in the International Conference shall respect the Fundamental Principles and all documents presented shall conform with these Principles&quot;.</I>[50]<BR>

<P><B>5. The resolutions of International Conferences of the Red Cross</B>[51]<BR>

<P>We can now return to the question which was put at the beginning of ths chapter: what are the legal effects of resolutions of International Conferences of the Red Cross, for the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions on the one hand, and for States party to the Geneva Conventions on the other?<BR>

<P>Few questions have so divided legal opinion since the end of the Second World War as that of the legal impact of resolutions passed by international organizations. Some schools of thought have endeavoured to prove the mandatory nature of such resolutions, and others the absence of any legal effects.<BR>

<P>In these terms, the question seems poorly phrased. Instead of asking whether or not the resolutions have any obligatory force, it would appear preferable to look at the matter from another angle and break it down into two aspects:<BR>
	<BR>
(a)	what are the conditions to be met for a resolution to be binding on the members of an organization?<BR>
(b)	if a resolution is not binding, can it still have any legal effects, and, if so, which?<BR>

<P>The theory of international organizations provides an answer to the first question: two conditions must be met for a resolution to be obligatory. First, the body adopting it must be competent to lay down rules that are binding on those whom they address; secondly, that body must intend to lay down such rules.<BR>

<P>Generally speaking, the intentions of the body adopting the resolution are sufficiently clear from the wording of the text; in case of doubt, the prepara-tory work will make its authors' wishes clear. This is a matter of interpretation. <BR>

<P>With regard to the competence of such bodies, two factors must be taken into account. In the first place, an organization may adopt resolutions that are binding on its members insofar as it is competent to do so; the limits of such competence vary according to the aims of the organization, its structure and the degree of integration desired by the members; as a rule, examination of the organization's founding charter will reveal the scope of its powers, in particular its power to take decisions binding on its members. The fact that the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement were adopted as a resolution rather than as a treaty does not alter the legal situation, once it has been established that the Statutes have obligatory force for both members of the Movement and for States party to the Geneva Conventions.<BR>

<P>Apart from the powers which are explicitly assigned to an organization by its founding charter, it is generally accepted that every organization enjoys other powers necessary for the achievement of its aims. These are implicit powers not specifically mentioned in its charter; in each case, it must be proved that such implicit powers are necessary for the pursuit of the organization's objectives.[52]<BR>

<P>The theory of implicit powers serves as a guide in the interpretation of an organization's founding charter. In case of doubt, treaty obligations are generally given a restrictive reading, while the founding charter can be interpreted more broadly; the principle of efficiency prevails over other rules of interpretation.[53]<BR>

<P>This theory also applies to the internal rules of an organization. No organization could achieve its aims if it did not have the power to lay down rules necessary for it to function, in areas such as the admission of new members, the election of decision-making bodies, the procedure for ensuring that those bodies express the wishes of the membership as a whole, and the establihment of subsidiary bodies. In every aspect of its internal regulation, any organization is empowered to supplement the rules laid down in its founding charter. The binding force of those rules on the membership stems from their status as internal regulations, from their relationship to the constitutive rules which are thereby supplemented and clarified, and from the need to ensure that the organization can function properly so as to achieve its aims.[54]<BR>
	<BR>
These considerations apply to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement as well as to any other organization. To determine the binding force of the resolutions of International Conferences, therefore, we must examine both the powers given to the Conference by the Movement's Statutes and those which may be regarded as implicit.<BR>

<P>It has to be said, however, that the Statutes are not entirely clear about the powers of the International Conference.<BR>

<P>Under the terms of Article 10, para. 5, &quot;...the International Conference shall adopt its decisions, recommendations or declarations in the form of resolutions&quot;. The Conference alone has the authority to amend the Movement's Statutes and Rules of Procedure, to give a final ruling on any difference of opinion over the interpretation and application of the Statutes and Rules, and to settle any question referred to it by the International Committee or the Federation in the event of disagreement. The Conference contributes to the unity of the Movement and to the pursuit of its mission in full compliance with the Fundamental Principles; it contributes to respect for and development of international humanitarian law; it may assign mandates to the International Committee or the Federation, within the limits of their respective statutes and those of the Movement; but it has no power to amend their statutes or to take any decision that runs counter to them.[55]<BR>

<P>The preparatory work offers few clues. Indeed, while it was agreed that the Conference might have to take decisions that were binding on members of the International Red Cross, it was also stressed that the adoption of the Movement's Statutes would in no way jeopardize the independence enjoyed by the Red Cross institutions.[56]<BR>
	<BR>
Although they are not absolutely clear, the Statutes still allow certain conclusions to be drawn, particularly when they are analysed with reference to the theory of international organizations.<BR>
	<BR>
Among the texts which must be considered as mandatory are resolutions concerning internal regulations, such as the Rules of Procedure of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, resolutions concerning the establishment of subsidiary bodies and the rules governing the various Funds and Medals.[57]<BR>
	<BR>
It must also be accepted that the Conference is empowered to lay down binding rules that are essential to maintaining &quot;the unity of the Movement and the achievement of its mission in full compliance with the Fundamental Principles&quot;. These would include, for example, the Principles and Rules governing disaster relief operations.[58] <BR>
	<BR>
Furthermore, Article 10, para. 6, of the Statutes allows the Conference to assign mandates to the International Committee and to the Federation; Article 5, para. 2(h), states that the ICRC shall carry out mandates entrusted to it by the International Conference. Therefore it must be assumed that the resolutions whereby the Conference assigns mandates to the ICRC are binding on the Committee. However, Article 5, para. 1, of the Statutes defines the ICRC as an independent organization; is there not, then, a risk that in assigning mandates to the ICRC the Conference might be violating the Committee's independence? There is no such risk: a mandate is a contractual arrangement whereby the agent undertakes to act on behalf of the principal. For the mandate to be valid, the Committee has to give its consent, either by proposing the mandate itself, by agreeing to it in the course of discussions or by voting for it. When these conditions are met, the mandate is then binding on the ICRC.[59]<BR>
	<BR>
It thus appears that the Intrnational Conference's power to lay down binding rules depends on the body directly addressed by those rules: the power is greater with regard to the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions than to States; and it is greater with regard to the ICRC and the Federation than to the National Societies.<BR>
	<BR>
However, it should be pointed out that a resolution that is binding only on certain entities may create indirect obligations for others. For example, it would be inconceivable for the Conference to assign a mandate to the ICRC or the Federation without States and National Societies (who took part in the decision to assign that mandate) being obliged, at the very least, not to obstruct its execution. A resolution binding on certain members of the Conference is thus likely to create concomitant obligations - of a different sort - for other members.<BR>
	<BR>
The competence of the International Conference to adopt resolutions binding on its members is, nonetheless, very restricted. The vast majority of resolutions do not lay down mandatory rules, but recommend a certain course of action for members of the Movement or for States. The resolutions may deal with any matter of concern to the Movement, such as health and social welfare, disaster relief, protection and assistance in the event of armed conflict, the development of humanitarian law, and Red Cross action for peace.<BR>

<P>These resolutions are essentially recommendations or exhortations. But it would be quite wrong, as a consequence, to see them as having no legal significance. <BR>
	<BR>
Any resolution by an international body is the expression of a certain convergence of opinion or common will. It may also reflect a legal conviction, whose authority must be judged in each case on its merits, taking account of the text itself and the degree of unanimity in its adoption.<BR>
	<BR>
Moreover, a resolution which is not in itself binding may still have a certain legal impact if it is linked to another source of law. Thus, a resolution referring to a constant and consistent practice may, although not having legal force itself, provide evidence of a legal conviction which in turn suggests the existence of a customary rule. Similarly, a resolution of an International Conference of the Red Cross may help in interpreting a treaty provision, notably a provision of the Geneva Conventions or their Additional Protocols.<BR>
	<BR>
It must also be accepted, in a more general sense, that a resolution adopted by an international body always carries an element of compulsion in respect of the members of that body. Judge Lauterpacht has stated that a resolution of the UN General Assembly, recommending a certain course of action to Member States,&quot;creates <I>some </I>legal obligation which, however rudimentary, elastic and imperfect, is nevertheless a legal obligation and constitutes a measure of supervision. The State in question, while not bound to accept the recommendation, is bound to give it due consideration in good faith&quot;.[60] Government participation in the adoption of resolutions of International Conferences of the Red Cross has a lesser impact than in the adoption of United Nations resolutions because, for the former, the governments are not alone in voting. However, this does not fundamentally alter the conclusion: there is here a question of good faith, of a threshold below which the participation of States at the International Conference would have no meaning.<BR>

<P>Among the resolutions urging belligerents to adopt a certain line of conduct, particular mention should be made of those that apply to noninternational armed conflicts.<BR>

<P>Because of the rudimentary nature of the legal rules applicable to internal conflicts, it is hardly surprising that the Red Cross should try to supplement them, either by resolutions dealing specifically with internal strife, or by resolutions that apply equally to international and internal conflicts.[61]<BR>

<P>There then arises the question of the binding force of these resolutions on the parties to a conflict, and in particular on an insurgent movement. It cannot be claimed <I>a priori </I>that they are fully binding on insurgents who took no part in their adoption. But, if adopted unanimously, such resolutions should be taken as the expression of a legal conviction held by the international community and the Red Cross. As such, they carry an element of compulsion which an insurgent movement seeking some form of international recognition could hardly ignore. At the very least, such a group would be expected to consider the resolutions in good faith.<BR>

<P>Whether they are intended to impose mandatory rules on those to whom they are addressed, or are essentially in the nature of recommendations, the resolutions of International Conferences of the Red Cross have an undeniable impact on international law; the weight of that impact has to be measured in each case. It must be accepted that Red Cross law, while retaining its separate identity, is too closely linked to the law of nations for it to be without any relevance to the latter.<BR>

<P>These conclusions are supported by the practice of the International Committee and by that of States in their relations with it. Throughout its history the ICRC has relied on resolutions of International Conferences for support, in particular those which have granted it mandates or acknowledged its authority in particular fields.62 <BR>

<P>1. To conform to current usage, the expressions &quot;constituent parts&quot;, &quot;component&quot; and &quot;constituent members&quot; are used to denote the member institutions of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, which are the National Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies, the ICRC and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies; the term &quot;statutory bodies&quot; is used for the Movement's collective bodies, i.e. the International Conference, the Council of Delegates and the Standing Commission of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. Although the States party to the Geneva Conventions also take part in International Conferences, they are not members of the Movement, as is made clear in Article 2 of the Movement's Statutes (see <I>International Review of the Red Cross - IRRC</I>, No. 256, January-February 1987, p. 29). In accordance with a century-old custom, the term &quot;International Red Cross&quot; - or, more simply, &quot;Red Cros&quot; - is used to mean the entire Movement where such use creates no confusion.<BR>

<H2>The International Committee of the Red Cross and  humanitarian  assistance - A policy analysis<BR>
</H2>
<P><I>By David P. Forsythe</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>David P. Forsythe</I></B><I> is Professor and Chair of the Political Science Department at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA. He is the author of </I>Humanitarian Politics: The International Committee of the Red Cross,<I> Johns Hopkins, 1977, and shorter analyses of the ICRC and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. </I><BR>

<P>
<P>In today's armed conflicts and complex emergencies more civilians suffer than combatants [1,2]. After the Cold War one could identify a zone of turmoil in which civilian suffering was acute. But one could also identify a zone of stability from which operated a complicated system of humanitarian assistance designed to respond to civilian suffering. Media coverage emphasized the suffering, but never before in world history had such a kaleidoscope of humanitarian actors tried to provide emergency relief during armed conflicts and complex emergencies. Inevitably calls were heard for better organization and coordination, and in 1991-92 the United Nations created a Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA).<BR>

<P>The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement has concerned itself with suffering in armed conflicts from its origins in the middle of the 19th century. While the early focus of what is now called the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was on wounded combatants, attention was subsequently extended to civilians. Since the Nigerian armed conflict (1967-1970), the ICRC has been providing significant humanitarian assistance in the midst of hostilities, and not just in pacified occupied territory, although its action in the general area of assistance has a much longer history. By the early 1990s the ICRC was providing more assistance than at any other time since its inception in 1863. The Movement, with the ICRC serving as a humanitarian intermediary in armed conflicts, emphasizes seven principles among which are impartiality, independence, and neutrality. The ICRC, whose governing Assembly is made up of Swiss nationals, wishes to be neither the UN's humanitarian arm nor a humanitarian showcase for the Swiss State, with which it has a special relationship [3].<BR>

<P>What then is the current role of the ICRC and the Movement in international humanitarian assistance and what does the future hold for them? Will they continue to carve out a unique and useful role? Or will they be marginalized by such developments as improved UN coordination and/or greater effectiveness by other relief agencies?<BR>

<P>Some would look to international law to find answers to such questions, and much attention has been paid to the subject of intervention on humanitarian grounds and the right to humanitarian assistance. This is an important subject. A different point, however, deserves emphasis. Whatever the law on the books might say about who can deliver assistance in what situation, and who is entitled to receive it, many warring parties in the post-Cold-War world have never heard of the Geneva Conventions, are not familiar with the ICRC and the Red Cross/Red Crescent symbol, or regard civilian death and suffering as weapons for attaining their personal and political objectives. As was said of Somalia in 1992, &quot;Virtually no one with a weapon had heard of the Geneva Conventions....&quot; [4] <BR>

<P>The ICRC and other actors face illiterate child soldiers on drugs, brutal warlords interested primarily in personal power, and military commanders who order attacks on civilians and relief workers. ICRC personnel, along with other relief workers, have been killed, including three ICRC delegates in Burundi in 1996. Other ICRC delegates have witnessed such horrors in places like Liberia that they require psychiatric counselling.<BR>

<P>Particularly large-scale relief requires the cooperation of those with the guns on the ground, whatever the law might say about a right to humanitarian assistance. The only alternative to negotiated cooperation is to overwhelm with military force. This is not a viable option in most situations owing to a lack of political will on the part of the international community. There is also opposition on moral grounds to &quot;humanitarian war&quot; [5]. Even in Somalia during 1992-1993, international military force was not initially directed against various political leaders but against bandits and thugs. Somali clan leaders had quietly agreed to the military deployment.<BR>

<P>Given that international humanitarian law and international human rights law are frequently passive background factors, a policy evaluation of the ICRC as a relief agency requires attention to five tasks: 1) negotiating access to civilians in need; 2) assessing humanitarian needs; 3) mobilizing resources; 4) delivering assistance; 5) evaluating performance and planning for the future [6].<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>I. Negotiating access</B></H4>
<P>
<P>In Geneva during 1995 the ICRC had a staff of 645 monitoring the plight of civilians in wars and complex emergencies, among other tasks. That same year it had another 1,029 persons in the field, including 185 seconded from National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, organized into regional and sub-regional delegations. During 1995 it carried out over 20 sizeable assistance programmes costing about 360 million US dollars in a number of trouble spots around the world [7]. It is fair to say that many National Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies in the poorer States are too weak to provide much operational support to the ICRC. But sometimes the local affiliate is in a good position to provide information about a given situation, or has useful contacts with a warring party. In more recent years the ICRC has made a greater effort to stay in touch with national affiliates, not always with the support of their association, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which has a separate headquarters in Geneva. The ICRC has observer status at the UN and is also in direct touch with governments through other channels. The head of the ICRC's New York office meets monthly with the President of the UN Security Council. The ICRC participates in two consultative groupings of non-governmental organizations involved in relief, in New York and Geneva. In 1995 the ICRC opened an office in Washington. Non-governmental organizations working for human rights and the transnational communications media maintain contacts with its headquarters in Geneva. The ICRC thus seems reasonably informed about where it should seek access to civilians in need.<BR>

<P>The ICRC's maximum objective is to reach explicit agreement to engage in both relief action and visits to prisoners on all sides. With regard to relief the ICRC normally asks for: freedom of movement to make assessments, the right to monitor relief so as to ensure impartiality, administrative control over the delivery system, and the right to make follow-up enquiries about the impact of relief [8]. But given the evident lack of humanitarian commitment by various warring parties, plus the presence of other relief actors to which the parties can turn, achieving access on these terms is a diplomatic art form.<BR>

<P>There is a rather widespread belief that in negotiations for access the ICRC is rigid and unbending, emphasizing the rules of humanitarian law and also Red Cross principles. The President of the International Council of <I>M&eacute;decins sans fronti&egrave;res </I>(MSF  Doctors Without Borders) believes that the ICRC never tries to deliver humanitarian assistance without consent because of its links to international law [9]. MSF came into being partly because of a belief that adequate relief had not reached Biafra during the Nigerian civil war, in their view because the ICRC was too concerned about agreement from the federal side. One relief expert sees the ICRC's commitment to Red Cross principles as &quot;inviolate&quot; [10]. A superficial examination of some events would seem to support this view.<BR>

<P>In some situations the ICRC will suspend its operations or withdraw from an area rather than violate existing standards. In the Nigerian civil war of 1967-1970, after the federal air force shot down a plane trying to deliver Red Cross relief to the Biafran enclave without permission from Lagos, the ICRC suspended its operations [11]. Article 23 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949, intended for international armed conflict, stipulates that a belligerent State can satisfy itself that material assistance is neutral.<BR>

<P>In old greater Ethiopia in 1988, the ICRC withdrew from an assistance role because it believed the relief plans of the central government were both harsh and unacceptably political. The Mengistu government was using international relief to lure civilians into relocation projects, so as to remove them from areas of rebellion. In the process some families were divided. Other relief agencies were willing to participate in this scheme. But after a long and complicated involvement, during which, among other things, it failed to obtain authorization to visit prisoners held by the central government, the ICRC finally withdrew. Much to the ICRC's private consternation, the International Federation then stepped in to fill the assistance role on government terms which it had just rejected.<BR>

<P>During the early 1990s in the former Yugoslavia, where the ICRC managed a relief operation second in size and importance only to that of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), some observers found the ICRC more principled than UNHCR [12]. In their view, the ICRC was more likely to suspend relief deliveries, even if it meant civilian hardship, because of considerations of impartiality and neutrality. By comparison, UNHCR seemed more tolerant of political diversions and objectives than the ICRC, although both agencies acted primarily on behalf of civilians. In Bosnia-Herzegovina the ICRC and UNHCR, alike in many ways, sometimes differed on what constituted adequate room for humanitarian agencies to operate in the midst of war.<BR>

<P>Likewise in Sudan over many years, the ICRC would not agree to relief schemes for the south of that troubled country unless assurances could be given that there would be no diversions by military parties. While this meant that at times relief was not provided to any civilians, it was also true that certain satisfactory agreements were struck for limited times and effects [13].<BR>

<P>ICRC officials themselves help create the image of great attention to rules and principles, saying that the ICRC cannot ignore international humanitarian law, with its attention to State consent, since the ICRC helped develop that law [14]. No doubt ICRC lawyers would argue that everything the ICRC does is based on the principles of the Red Cross and the spirit of international humanitarian law, including a right ofinitiative for the ICRC.<BR>

<P>The ICRC, however, not only acted in a fairly &quot;revolutionary&quot; way for a time in the Nigerian civil war, delivering relief in a manner that contributed to some Biafran political objectives while offending various parties on the federal side, but it also knowingly contravened the wishes of the Ethiopian central government. From 1976, the ICRC participated in a &quot;cross-border&quot; relief operation from Sudan, delivering assistance to Tigray and Eritrea, then in rebellion. It was also seeking Tigrayan permission to visit Ethiopian fighters detained by the rebel movement. In this context the ICRC even removed the Red Cross emblem from its trucks, the better to avoid Ethiopian air attacks on relief convoys. In May 1987 the ICRC withdrew from the cross-border effort, saying that emergency civilian need in Tigray had abated. It was also a fact that its attempted visits to prisoners never took place. While international humanitarian law may not be very clear when applied to this type of situation, there is no doubt but that the ICRC &quot;gatecrashed&quot; in Tigray, from the Ethiopian point of view [15].<BR>

<P>In a number of cases the ICRC apparently informed a government that it was delivering relief in a situation of war or complex emergency, but it presumably did not ask permission. This type of action seems to have obtained in Afghanistan during the 1980s, with the ICRC operating from Pakistan. A rather remarkable version of this behaviour occurred in Cambodia after the Vietnamese invasion of 1979. Finding civilians in need in the hinterland, the ICRC and UNICEF engaged in a cross-border operation from Thailand. When the government in Phnom Phen objected, the ICRC and UNICEF continued, asserting a duty to help civilians in need, but no doubt aware that the Cambodian government lacked the means to back up its objections. Eventually the government accepted the realities of international relief [16].<BR>

<P>The ICRC had already engaged in cross-border assistance on a small scale to Iraqi Kurds, operating from Iran before the fall of the Shah. While in the same context the ICRC has recently shown some reticence, it is unlikely that notification was given to Saddam Hussein of help provided to his ethnic, domestic enemies [17]. In places like Liberia, without effective central government, requesting consent was out of the question. The ICRC, like other relief agencies, did what it could, trying to secure the cooperation of local paramilitary forces.<BR>

<P>In Somalia during the early 1990s, the ICRC continued relief distributions even when other agencies pulled out, despite the loss of some 5% (1993) to 20% (1992) of the supplies to political and other disruptions. The ICRC decided to hire its own local protection force made up of armed individuals, and paid them in rice, in order to get some relief to starving civilians who numbered in the hundreds of thousands. After the UN authorization of military force to guarantee the security of humanitarian assistance, the ICRC agreed to cooperate with that sizeable military presence, working, with the Somali Red Crescent, at the end of a logistics system that was dominated by the US armed forces. From one point of view, this was a militarized relief system which was nevertheless intended to be impartial in that it was supposed to benefit civilians without regard to political orientation, gender, ethnicity, clan, or other identification. Later the ICRC argued that the military should stay out of assistance, leaving it to the impartial, non-governmental agencies. But in Somalia the ICRC cooperated with military forces, and with local armed groups, in order to save civilian lives [18].<BR>

<P>What do these examples tell us about the ICRC and negotiating access for humanitarian assistance? Independence, impartiality, neutrality, and other norms of interest to the ICRC go by the board in wars and complex emergencies. The proliferation of relief agencies makes it difficult for the ICRC to insist successfully on its values, or to focus attention on whatever right to humanitarian assistance might be read into humanitarian law. The ICRC is interested in both principled action and doing practical good for civilians in need (and prisoners, for that matter). It also has a tradition, at least for small-scale operations, of giving its delegates in the field considerable room for manoeuver. All of these factors hamper perfect consistency.<BR>

<P>Thus there is not one, dominant pattern of ICRC access to civilians in need. The agency clearly prefers a negotiated arrangement with all parties, consistent with legal and Red Cross norms. But when that optimum situation cannot be achieved, it has acted in different ways indifferent situations, with a strong element of pragmatism. The ICRC is not so legalistic as some have believed, but at the same time it is not just another private relief agency. Like its spokespersons, it works on both sides of the fence. It emphasizes public international law and Red Cross principles (which are approved by Red Cross conferences at which States are represented), but it has acted against the wishes of some public authorities on occasion for the welfare of civilians in dire straits. It has also acted in grey areas where doubt exists as to whether consent has been obtained or not.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>II. Assessment of need</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The same disjointed system that operates to identify civilians in need operates to assess that need. From 1992 the UN appointed an Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, who doubled as its Emergency Relief Coordinator, and who was connected to an embryonic UN early-warning system with some assessment capacity. Even State intelligence agencies, with their satellite resources, could be put at the service of assessment.<BR>

<P>In most conflict situations there is no single, coordinated assessment of humanitarian need. If the conflict attracts enough attention there is likely to be a variety of assessments  from UNHCR concerning refugees and those in a refugee-like situation, from UNICEF concerning mothers and children, from WHO concerning health, perhaps from the UN resident representative in countries hosting projects run by the UN Development Programme (UNDP), etc. In Somalia in February of 1992, Africa Watch, then a sub-division of Human Rights Watch, which normally emphasizes civil and political rights, sent a survey team along with Physicians for Human Rights to assess need for assistance in that failed State [19]. The ICRC was already reporting assessment from Somalia, as was a special representative of the UN Secretary-General, as was USAID, as were others. Likewise in the former Yugoslavia during the early 1990s, there were many assessments of civilian need, including from the local offices of the Yugoslav Red Cross [20]. &quot;The ICRC does not accept reports or requests at face value by outside sources.&quot;21 During the spring of 1991 the US and certain Western States intervened forcibly in northern Iraq, ostensibly to protect and assist Iraqi Kurds. Some National Red Cross Societies, such as the American Red Cross, followed their governments into that situation. The ICRC, already in Baghdad for about a decade, carried out its own surveys of civilian needs in northern Iraq. The ICRC did not act on the basis of reports from intervening governments and their Red Cross Societies.<BR>

<P>But self-assessment is not an ironclad principle, for the ICRC will act on the basis of a report from &quot;a partner of its choice&quot; [22]. In Iraq during the mid-1990s the ICRC used an assessment of civilian needs by WHO as part of its appeal for funds to carry out a relief operation [23]. WHO's broad survey fit with the ICRC's own data concerning more limited segments of the population. The ICRC then lobbied the UN to pay more attention to the plight of the overall Iraqi population, whose hardship was directly linked to economic sanctions imposed under UN authorization.<BR>

<P>The ICRC has a number of persons who specialize in assessing civilian needs concerning health, nutrition, shelter, potable water, etc. In a large regional ICRC delegation, as found in Nairobi, Kenya, for example, several such specialists are already in the field. Others can be sent from Geneva on short notice. Obviously if the ICRC is excluded from a country, as in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge or in Sudan for much of the 1990s, proper assessment cannot be made.<BR>

<P>In general, the problem is not accurate assessment but mobilization of adequate response. Somalia is a good case in point. A number of agencies recognized the prospect of massive starvation by late 1991 and early 1992. The ICRC, Save the Children Federation (British division), and perhaps others projected the problem accurately enough. The UN appointed a special representative in May of 1992, but it was not until July that wheels began to turn for a greater international effort. And it was not until October that the UN devised a coordinated international plan for dealing with starvation in Somalia. Finally, in December of 1992, military force was authorized and dispatched to secure the delivery of humanitarian assistance [24].<BR>

<P><B>III. Mobilization of resources</B><BR>

<P>The ICRC is well positioned to mobilize resources for relief, being part of a widely respected international movement, having a legally recognized role in armed conflict, and being well known to the major donors such as USAID and the European Union's Humanitarian Office (ECHO). But the scale of disasters can exceed ICRC capability, the agency has not always mobilized certain types of relief, and it has not always proven adept at raising concern.<BR>

<P>Over about a decade from the mid-1980s the ICRC quadrupled its spending for relief to more than US$ 350 million. The agency also found the necessary personnel to administer its relief programmes, in part by drawing more on non-Swiss. Those who wanted the ICRC to concentrate on detention matters, and those who wanted the agency to limit itself to very small relief operations, have clearly been passed over by events. But it is not so clear just what the ceiling is on ICRC relief capacity.<BR>

<P>The exodus of several million people from Rwanda during 1994, or the projected starvation of hundreds of thousands of Somalis during 1992 and 1993, was clearly beyond the capacity of the ICRC to handle alone. As far back as 1971 and events in eastern Pakistan, soon to be Bangladesh, the magnitude of the humanitarian needs necessitated UN action [25]. The view is widely held that some relief problems are so massive that only governments, particularly their militaries, can respond adequately [26]. But ICRC relief operations were not small in Somalia up through the end of 1991, and in both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Jordan during the early 1990s the ICRC coordinated sizeable relief undertakings.<BR>

<P>It is possible that improved coordination of relief appeals via the United Nations and its Department of Humanitarian Affairs will pre-empt the ICRC's role as mobilizer of significant Red Cross relief. This is not likely to happen anytime soon, however. Major donors like USAID and ECHO are not insisting on such a coordinated system of mobilization, in part because they regard the ICRC as highly reliable and also well positioned in some conflicts. Some UN attempts at coordinated appeals have proven disappointing [27].<BR>

<P>Surprisingly enough for an agency that traces its origins to medical assistance for the battlefield wounded in 1859, the ICRC did not try to play a major role in mobilizing medical relief until the 1970s. Such relief was left mostly to the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. From 1977 the ICRC included a medical division, and not just a medical coordinator, in its Geneva structure. Partly because of competition from Doctors Without Borders and other medical groups, by the mid-1990s the ICRC had expanded its medical work to the point where about 20% of its emergency budget, and some 10% of its regular budget, were going to medical field activities. Some at the Geneva headquarters thought this activity was duplicating or undercutting efforts at the national level. In any event the ICRC was slow to recognize the need for international medical relief, a need that was filled in part by other organizations that generally had a wider mandate and sometimes a different approach than the ICRC [28]. Some of the rougher edges of the competition were moderating by the mid-1990s [29]. In places like Rwanda during 1994, MSF personnel worked under ICRC aegis  and under ICRC rules of engagement.<BR>

<P>As to whether the ICRC mobilizes the right type of relief, there is some debate. Most in the ICRC relief division do not regard the matter as a major and persistent problem. There are clear guidelines for donations in kind [30]. But donors do not always follow these guidelines, and stories abound about a Red Cross/Red Crescent Society, or a government, that insisted on providing something inappropriate or unnecessary. Few are the allegations that the ICRC itself called for inappropriate relief, although some believe the ICRC should have used sorghum rather than rice in Somalia in the early 1990sso as to lessen attempted diversions of the much-valued rice.<BR>

<P>Finally, a word should be said about mobilizing concern as well as material and personnel resources. In the 1970s the ICRC was criticized by an international review team for being deficient in openness and public relations [31]. The review team believed that the ICRC had unnecessarily and dysfunctionally emphasized discretion beyond its prison visits, so that Geneva had not maximized its support in various circles. ICRC &quot;distance&quot; from National Societies was a case in point. Since that report, forwhatever reason, the ICRC has greatly expanded its media and public relations activities. In Somalia during 1992 the ICRC organized a tour and briefing for some 730 journalists who were brought from Kenya to better understand the situation [32]. Top ICRC officials have sought to use the weapon of public protest or public statement much more frequently than in the past [33], and without jeopardizing the victims the agency seeks to help. The core issue is not public protest <I>per se</I>, but effective openness at times and in ways that better mobilize moral and material support for humanitarian assistance (and detention matters).<BR>

<P>It was only in 1995, however, that the ICRC opened an office in Washington. Given the importance of the US, especially its Congress, in all aspects of international relations after the Cold War, and given that other agencies like UNHCR had long had a Washington office to advance their concerns, the ICRC move was tardy. In other ways too the ICRC was still advancing slowly in mobilizing concern about victims of war and complex emergencies [34]. Some at the Geneva headquarters would cooperate with scholars and journalists, but others would refuse to on the flimsiest of excuses. One scholar referred to the &quot;polite stonewalling&quot; of the ICRC in his requests for cooperation [35]. Not infrequently other relief officials found the ICRC difficult to work with, or &quot;prickly&quot; about its position in relief activity. In the diplomatic phraseology of two authors, the ICRC was not &quot;an organization to take its special status lightly&quot; [36].<BR>

<P>Overall, the ICRC record on mobilization of resources and concern for victims of war and conflict seems mixed. The ICRC has helped bring important relief to places like Somalia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Jordan, although to specify its exact role by comparison with USAID, etc, is sometimes difficult. It was slow, however, to fulfill the need for international medical relief, slow to see the importance of a Washington office, and slow to recognize the need for broad support and cooperation. Because of its emphasis on discreet work inside countries, it has rarely been the key agency in attracting public attention to a major humanitarian problem, although some quiet diplomacy may not be documented.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>IV. Delivery</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The ICRC provided small-scale relief in the Middle East after World War II, but it was only at the time of the Nigerian civil war that it began to deliver food aid during ongoing armed conflict in a sustained and significant way [37].<BR>

<P>Despite the creation by the UN of the DHA, it is still true that in most armed conflicts and complex emergencies it is &quot;pluralism run riot&quot; [38]. In the former Yugoslavia during the early 1990s there were some 125 NGOs active in relief, not counting intergovernmental, governmental, and intra-national or local groups [39]. Insofar as central generalizations can be drawn from this complexity, it can be said that technical or logistical cooperation among various relief actors is often good, but that coordination of strategy is a different matter.<BR>

<P>The ICRC not infrequently arrives at a division of labour with other major relief agencies such as UNHCR, UNICEF, the World Food Programme (WFP), etc. This division of labour pertains to food, water, shelter, and medical services. In the former Yugoslavia, UNHCR ran the largest relief programme; the ICRC had the second largest with very little overlap or confusion between the two. Both were headquartered in Geneva, both aspired to similar objectives, and each respected the other. In Sudan for much of the 1980s, UNICEF was the lead UN agency; the ICRC and UNICEF reached agreement on who was to do what, where. In Rwanda during 1994, the ICRC worked inside the country with other groups such as MSF, while UNHCR and others focused on some two million civilians in need in Zaire and elsewhere. In Sri Lanka in the 1980s and 1990s, the ICRC &quot;neutralized&quot; government-supplied relief going into the Jaffna peninsula where a rebel/secessionist movement was entrenched much of the time. Other agencies such as UNHCR, Oxfam, Save the Children, MSF, and local groups all took on other tasks with little overlap. In Liberia, the ICRC reached agreement both with UNICEF (which took over an ICRC emergency programme for abandoned children), and the World Food Programme (which supplied food for an ICRC relief operation to help certain civilians cut off by the fighting). We have already referred to ICRC-UNICEF cooperation in Cambodia, and have made passing reference to ICRC-UN cooperation in what became Bangladesh. According to one informed view, &quot;[t]he last twenty years have seen considerable improvement in the speed and efficiency of the humanitarian response to...crises, showing just how much progress has been made on the technical side&quot; [40].<BR>

<P>It is well and good to say that &quot;[w]hen it comes to humanitarian emergencies there is no room for rivalries and turf fights&quot; [41]. But competition does occur, and we have already referred to the ICRC and Joint Church Aid in Nigeria, the ICRC and the International Federation in Ethiopia, and the ICRC and medical groups such as MSF. Private relief groups compete for &quot;market share&quot;, and want to establish independent credit if only for purposes of future fund-raising. The various UN agencies also seek to build independent reputations, in part because they depend on voluntary contributions from donors like the US. The leading policy-makers of relief agencies may seek independence in a quest for personal recognition. Some actors are more solicitous than others of international norms, whether legal or otherwise. Some rely more on public protest about wrongdoing. Some believe they should use their presence to contribute to criminal prosecutions; the ICRC disagrees. The complexity of situations, as in Ethiopia in the 1970s and 1980s, or Zaire in the 1990s, guarantees a variety of viewpoints among relief agencies about the wisdom of any one policy [42].<BR>

<P>Because the ICRC has a mandate that includes detention matters, and because the ICRC will sometimes take on special tasks, its decisions about assistance may be affected. It is highly likely that its decisions about relief in greater Ethiopia were affected to some degree by its endeavour to visit detained fighters. It is reasonably clear that the ICRC has sometimes used assistance as a &quot;bait&quot; or &quot;carrot&quot; to gain access to detainees. In Mexico in the 1990s, ICRC decisions to provide relief in the province of Chiapas seemed to be linked to broader concerns regarding prisoners and other matters requiring a neutral intermediary [43].<BR>

<P>The ICRC makes independent decisions about when security situations require the suspension of its activities. It stayed in Somalia long after most UN personnel had been withdrawn. But elsewhere it has suspended relief for security reasons, as in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Liberia in the early 1990s. Between 1988 and early 1994, 18 persons working in ICRC delegations were held hostage for varying lengths of time, and another eight were killed in various ways [44].<BR>

<P>The ICRC tries to provide basic or emergency relief only, with some transition to more development or emergency rehabilitation relief. On occasion it provides seed, farming tools, fishing equipment, etc., so that people can provide for themselves after the emergency phase has passed. The ICRC has also carried out cattle vaccination programmes because of its concern for both self-sufficiency and self-respect. The agency seeks to avoid prolonged dependency on its relief. But there is debate in Geneva about emphasis on emergency relief with little development assistance  a situation that can lead to recurring crises.<BR>

<P>The agency complies with UN stipulations regarding embargoes, even when it believes the UN is in error. Thus when the Security Council imposed comprehensive sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s, the ICRC did not try to break sanctions even when it thought the policy too harsh on vulnerable groups of the Iraqi civilian population.<BR>

<P>Overall, the ICRC has earned a reputation for delivering rapid and effective relief, particularly on a small to medium scale. It can act in a timely manner, being much smaller and more flexible than UN agencies, and having personnel already on the spot in many regions of the world. It is particularly well known for logistical efficiency and for the discipline and commitment of its personnel [45].<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>V. Evaluation and planning</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The ICRC, seeing itself as the guardian of international humanitarian law, tries systematically to translate its practical experience into principles of humanitarian action. Thus it now reviews its own policies, proposes resolutions for the International Conferences of the Red Cross and Red Crescent to adopt, and helps draft international legal standards for State consent.<BR>

<P>Before the Nigerian civil war, however, the ICRC was not altogether given to careful evaluation and planning. During World War II top ICRC policy-makers met in Geneva spasmodically in a non-rigourous and not fully systematic process. They did not have the sources of information needed for sharp decisions about assistance and detention visits. Some key players were ultra cautious and legalistic. They were pressured by Swiss government authorities not to be too tough vis-a-vis Nazi Germany, in the interests of the neutrality and independence of the Swiss State [46]. The record was such that there was an effort to internationalize the all-SwissICRC [47].<BR>

<P>Immediately after the Nigerian civil war, when former high ICRC officials hammered home the point about lack of carefully planned policies [48], important changes occurred in Geneva [49]. The agency put more day-to-day policy in the hands of professional staff, improved the training of delegates, reconsidered the role of the volunteer Assembly, and in general became a more reflective and professional humanitarian institution. Unlike some agencies that spring up overnight for particular crises, or that launch into action with an abundance of moral fervour but without careful reflection, the ICRC increasingly tried to bring its institutional memory to bear on current and future issues pertaining to humanitarian assistance.<BR>

<P>The ICRC was part of an effort throughout the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement to produce &quot;national vulnerability assessments&quot; by National Societies in anticipation of problems. It interacted with others to help produce codes of conduct for humanitarian agencies and drafts of a clarified right to humanitarian assistance [50]. In various ways the ICRC has proven a key player as the international community stumbles toward planning for an improved relief system for wars and similar events on the eve of the twenty-first century.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>VI. Conclusions</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The ICRC is not the one and only relief actor for international humanitarian assistance in armed conflicts and civil strife. The global challenge is too great; the ICRC is too small. There is increased demand for sound public management in the area of humanitarian assistance. The ICRC remains a private Swiss agency, although recognized under public international law. Just as the ICRC has failed to dominate the evolution of the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement, with symbols and entities coming into existence that weakened the Movement's unity, so has the ICRC failed to dominate relief in armed conflicts and complex emergencies. Whether it could have been otherwise I leave to the historians.<BR>

<P>Changes occurred after the Nigerian civil war that made the ICRC one of the more respected and effective providers of assistance in conflict situations. Mohamed Sahnoun, an Algerian diplomat who was the representative of the UN Secretary-General in Somalia, and who was not hesitant to criticize malfeasance, identified the ICRC as one of two agencies (UNICEF was the other) which had made a &quot;sterling contribution&quot; in the extremely difficult circumstances of that failed State during the 1990s [51]. Larry Minear, who took part in a major study of humanitarian assistance conducted via Brown University, concluded that &quot;[t]he ICRC has the most consistent record of functioning well under duress&quot; in conflict situations [52]. The late Fred Cuny, a widely respected expert on disaster assistance, also praised the ICRC, although he thought the agency's penchant for secrecy would keep it from playing a wide role in most conflict situations [53]. James Ingram, with long experience in international food efforts, commented that &quot;[t]he bravery and competence of ICRC staff are beyond reproach and have aroused great admiration&quot; [54].<BR>

<P>One can conceive of certain scenarios that would reduce the ICRC's role as coordinator of Red Cross relief in conflict situations. The DHA might be given real authority to coordinate the relief action of UN agencies, although this seems unlikely at the time of writing. Conversely, the DHA might be dissolved, and an improved UN disaster agency created, perhaps on the back of the UN Development Program.This also seems unlikely. A third possibility is that the major donors, USAID and the ECHO, might themselves insist that a more effective system be adopted by existing agencies, just on the strength of their donations and related logistics capability. Since the ICRC resists this type of vertical coordination by public/political bodies, it might be left mostly on the sidelines with only the roles of advance warning and small-scale temporary relief.<BR>

<P>But to the extent that the current system of international humanitarian assistance continues, the ICRC is likely to remain one of the more important aid providers. It has performed the various tasks inherent in assistance reasonably well. It endorses horizontal or voluntary coordination among relief agencies, and the current system performs better than one might expect from an initial look at its complexity.<BR>

<P>The ICRC has not been marginalized in the provision of humanitarian assistance by the proliferation of other agencies. It has found various important roles for itself, with donor support, that vary from case to case. The ICRC, like other relief actors, has been marginalized in some conflicts at certain times by the warring parties themselves. That the ICRC was kept from providing the assistance it wanted in places like Liberia or Sudan was not the fault of the agency, but of the inhumane values of the combatants.<BR>

<P>Could the ICRC ever assume the role played by the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1984 when it triggered massive assistance for Ethiopia through its dramatic coverage of starvation? Probably not, given the ICRC's penchant for discreet action in-country. But times change, and one can dream. <BR>

<P>  <B>Notes :</B><BR>

<P>1. The author would like to thank various ICRC officials who provided information for, or commented on, earlier drafts of this essay. These drafts were also read by William De Mars, Martha Finnemore, and Thomas G. Weiss. The author would moreover like to thank the editor of the <I>International Review of the Red Cross (IRRC) </I>for his helpful comments. The responsibility for all statements rests with the author.<BR>

<P>2. According to Red Cross sources, civilians made up 15% of victims in World War I and 65% in World War II; in armed conflicts today they account for 90% (&quot;World Campaign for the Protection of Victims of War&quot;, <I>IRRC</I>, No. 282, May-June 1991, p. 308). See also International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (eds), <I>World Disasters</I> <I>Report</I>, Geneva, 1994, p. 34.  &quot;Complex emergencies&quot; is an amorphous term used by the UN to bypass argument over the dividing line between armed conflicts and other situations. It implies, at a minimum, the breakdown of national order, human suffering, and lack of control by any one authority.<BR>

<P>3. From a vast literature on the Movement, see especially two recent publications: Fran&ccedil;ois Bugnion,<I> Le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge et la protection des victimes de la guerre</I>, ICRC, Geneva, 1994; and John Hutchinson, <I>Champions of charity: War and the rise of the Red Cross</I><B>,</B> Westview Press, Boulder, 1996.<BR>

A particularly well informed account is given by Thierry Hentsch in <I>Face au Blocus: La Croix-Rouge internationale dans le Nig&eacute;ria en guerre (1967-1970), </I>Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, 1973. The ICRC had obtained &quot;fly at your own risk&quot; permission from Lagos. After that permission was revoked, the ICRC continued to participate in &quot;night&quot; flights, in which Red Cross planes mixed in with planes carrying armaments to Biafran forces. This airlift was thus not a purely neutral operation. But the ICRC was concerned about civilians in the Biafran enclave, and was competing with Joint Church Aid (JCA), a coalition of relief agencies not much interested in the niceties of State consent or neutrality. Had the ICRC withdrawn earlier, it would have left assistance in war to JCA and would have lost much support among public opinion in Europe and North America, which was pro-Biafran.<BR>

<P>28. Doctors Without Borders did not orient itself to armed conflict and was not initially much interested in matters of State consent. Physicians for Human Rights was especially interested in forensic medicine, whereas the ICRC refused to cooperate in penal proceedings in order to facilitate its action inside countries. The ICRC, whatever its quiet diplomacy, also did not seek to mobilize opposition to abuse of medical ethics in relation to detainees.

Both books were published first in French. The former was also published in English: <I>Crimes without punishment, </I>Pluto Press, London, 1995. But the latter was not published in English after a diplomatic protest. Yet there is little in Girod's French text to justify non-publication in English, in this author's opinion. One interviewee in Geneva told me: &quot;A diplomatic protest is not to be taken lightly&quot;. It is rather doubtful that many other relief agencies, which emphasize independent concern for civilians, would curtail circulation of a historical account because of a State's unhappiness with its contents.<BR>

<P>
<P>At the end of February the regional delegate in charge of ICRC activities in the Baltic States, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova, who is based in Geneva, took part in a meeting organized by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Latvia. Other participants included the National Societies of the Baltic States, Canada, Finland, Germany, Norway and Sweden. They discussed problems currently facing the Baltic National Societies and possibilities of development and cooperation with the sister Societies in the West.<BR>

<P>The regional delegate also had meetings with a senior official of the Latvian government, with whom he discussed plans for a seminar on international humanitarian law for the Latvian armed forces, and with leaders of the various Red Cross Societies present regarding training in tracing methods for the National Societies of the three countries. The seminar for the armed forces of Latvia, the first of its kind to be organized in the Baltic States, took place in March. In May, members of the three Baltic National Societies took part in a tracing course organized by the ICRC in Moscow <A HREF="2f62.htm">(see Russian Federation, Tracing activities)</A>.<BR>

<P>In August, the chief surgeon of the American forces in Europe organized a training course in war surgery for 24 surgeons of the armed forces of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania at a US military base in Germany. An ICRC delegate gave a presentation on international humanitarian law and distributed dissemination material, including the Baltic language versions of the Code of Conduct for Combatants. <BR>

<P>
<P>In May the ICRC held its first course on international humanitarian law for the armed forces of Moldova. More than 30 officers took part.<BR>

<P>In March the ICRC regional delegate travelled to the self-proclaimed &quot;Dniestr Republic&quot; to negotiate renewed access to five detainees of the &quot;Ilascu group&quot;, last seen by the ICRC in October 1993. However, access was not granted. During a mission in October the Delegate General for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, together with the regional delegate, made representations to the highest authorities in Tiraspol regarding the resumption of visits to these detainees, again to no avail. They also discussed dissemination projects with the officer in charge of military instruction for the 14th Russian Army stationed in the region.<BR>

<P>In the Moldovan capital Chisinau the delegates met a representative of the Ministry of Defence and the Vice-Minister of the Interior, with whom they discussed plans for dissemination courses to be held in 1995, and made contact with the National Society with a view to organizing a joint ICRC/Federation seminar for the country's Red Cross leadership. <BR>

<P>At the end of February the regional delegate and an ICRC dissemination specialist organized a first seminar on the law of war for more than 30 high-ranking officers of the Ukrainian armed forces in Kiev. The regional delegate also discussed cooperation projects with the Red Cross Society of Ukraine and contacted officials of the Ministries of Education and of Foreign Affairs. Together with the representative of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in Kiev, he prepared a joint seminar on the Movement for young leaders of the National Society. The seminar took place at the end of September and in early October and was attended by some 50 regional Red Cross leaders, university students and the ICRC Delegate General for Eastern Europe and Central Asia, who was carrying out a mission in the region. The Delegate General also had talks with representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Justice and Defence with a view to opening an ICRC regional delegation in Kiev. Accompanied by the regional delegate, he then visited the Crimea, where they met the Vice-President of parliament for an exchange of views and had contacts with the Red Cross.<BR>

<P>As part of its tracing cooperation programme, the regional delegation in Moscow helped organize a seminar on tracing methods, which took place in Kiev in May <A HREF="2f62.htm">(see Moscow regional delegation, Tracing activities)</A>.</P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/Separator_Line_ICRC.gif" BORDER=0><P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/ButtonBar.gif" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#ButtonBar"><BR>

<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3>
<P>
<P>After the political power struggles that culminated in violent confrontation between government and parliament in Moscow in October 1993, the Russian Federation entered a phase of relative stabilization in 1994. However, with some ten million people unemployed and an estimated 20 million living below the poverty line, the country continued to pay a high price for the transition to a free market economy. The return of more than one million Russians from countries of the former Soviet Union put further pressure on the decaying social and economic fabric.<BR>

<P>The northern Caucasus remained the Russian Federation's most troubled region. The state of emergency in North Ossetia and Ingushetia was again extended. Some 120,000 displaced Ingush people from North Ossetia and Ossetians from Georgia were still not able to return home. In December, long-simmering tensions between the breakaway republic of Chechnya and the government of the Russian Federation flared up into open warfare.<BR>

<P>As before, the Moscow regional delegation, opened in 1992, covered the Russian Federation while running specialized services for all the countries in the region. Thus it was responsible for dissemination programmes for the armed forces and information and training in ICRC tracing methods for Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in the entire former Soviet Union. The delegation continued to develop contacts with the Federal authorities which proved essential on several occasions when it was called upon to support the ICRC's action in connection with the conflicts in the Caucasus, Tajikistan and in the former Yugoslavia. When the Chechen crisis came to a head, the delegation shifted into emergency gear and played a vital role in coordinating and facilitating the ICRC's operation in that region.<BR>

<P>In March the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation was received by the ICRC President at Geneva headquarters, where they discussed the follow-up to the 1993 Conference for the Protection of War Victims.<BR>

<P>In May a member of the Committee, the ICRC's governing body, together with an ICRC legal specialist, carried out a mission to strengthen the dialogue with the Russian Red Cross and some of its branches. In the northern Caucasus and in Moscow they met leaders of the regional and local branches and the National Society's Central Committee, with whom they discussed possibilities for cooperation in the fields of tracing and disaster preparedness, as well as topics related to the Fundamental Red Cross and Red Crescent Principles and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement.<BR>

<P>At the end of September a medical coordinator from Geneva headquarters took part in a seminar in Moscow on the consequences of torture and organized violence. Some 50 doctors and psychologists from 14 republics of the former Soviet Union, many of whom were treating patients from conflict zones on the periphery of the Russian Federation, attended the seminar.<BR>

<P>In December the ICRC Vice-President received the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation at Geneva headquarters. Their discussions centred on the situation in Chechnya. <BR>

<H3><B>Activities for detainees</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Following an amnesty in February 1994 for the people detained in connection with the events of October 1993 and the cessation of legal procedures against the participants in the 1991 coup attempt, the need for ICRC visits to detainees in the Russian Federation was greatly reduced. The ICRC submitted to the Federal authorities reports on visits conducted the previous year to places of detention in Moscow, North Ossetia and Ingushetia. In March the Chairman of the Presidential Human Rights Committee had talks with the ICRC President at the institution's headquarters in Geneva on possibilities for improving conditions of detention. <BR>

<P><A NAME="C"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Tracing activities</B></H3>
<P>
<P>After the dissolution of the Alliance of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of the former USSR, the National Societies of the newly independent States had to set up their own tracing services. Beginning in 1993, the ICRC launched a cooperation programme aimed at providing support for these services, according to their specific needs and levels of development. This involved furnishing substantial material and financial assistance for the National Society tracing services of the Russian Federation, Ukraine and Belarus and material support and training for the others. As part of the programme, the ICRC systematically organized seminars providing the new tracing services with information about the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and giving technical assistance. In May the Moscow regional delegation organized a seminar on tracing methods for members of the National Societies of Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus, which took place in Kiev. Another seminar, held in Moscow in June, was attended by leaders of the same National Societies, participants from the Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Russian Red Cross Societies and representatives of the International Tracing Service in Arolsen. The seminar focused on issues of common interest.<BR>

<P>At the ICRC's initiative, a number of National Societies interested in strengthening ties with sister Societies of the countries of the former Soviet Union met in Geneva in February to discuss current and future cooperation on tracing programmes and to decide on ways of ensuring the exchange of information. <BR>

<P><A NAME="D"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Dissemination</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Dissemination remained the regional delegation's key activity within the Russian Federation, targeting mainly the military and the National Society and its branches.<BR>

<P>In July the ICRC based a delegate in Moscow to develop special programmes for the armed forces throughout Eastern Europe and Central Asia, focusing on training military instructors in the teaching of international humanitarian law and spreading awareness of the law of war. The Federal Ministry of Defence gave its agreement for such activities to be carried out among troops stationed outside Russia. In September in Moscow, the ICRC held a seminar for military instructors of the Ministry of the Interior. At the end of October delegates organized the first seminar on humanitarian law at the Frunze academy, the leading military training establishment of the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, for more than 30 senior officers from the main military academies in Moscow. A training course for future military instructors was also held. In all, 14 seminars were given for over 700 high-ranking officers under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Defence and of the Interior.<BR>

<P>ICRC delegates gave presentations and training courses for representatives of Russian Red Cross branches throughout the Russian Federation and for the National Societies of the countries of the former Soviet Union. At the end of the year they completed a series of eight seminars held to familiarize leaders of nearly all Red Cross branches with the structure of the Movement, the Fundamental Red Cross and Red Crescent Principles, humanitarian law, the use of the emblem and dissemination activities. The seminars were designed to prepare the ground for further cooperation programmes.<BR>

<P>The regional delegation also organized presentations on humanitarian law, and particularly the rules providing protection for the civilian population, for university circles and maintained contacts with officials, representatives of governmental and non-governmental organizations and the media. At the end of the year the ICRC sent two additional delegates to Moscow to set up special dissemination programmes, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education, for schoolchildren and teachers and for students at the main universities in the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union.<BR>

<P>In addition, it continued its extensive Russian-language publications programme. At the end of the year the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols were published in Russian translation. <BR>

<P><A NAME="E"></A><BR>

<H4><B>NORTHERN CAUCASUS</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The ICRC had been present in the northern Caucasus since July 1993, when it opened a sub-delegation in Nalchik (Kabardino-Balkaria) to conduct activities for people who had been displaced or detained in connection with the outbreak of violence between the Ossetians and the Ingush people, with the Tbilisi delegation serving as logistics base. The move also facilitated closer monitoring of developments in Chechnya.<BR>

<P>In February 1994 the Deputy Delegate General for Eastern Europe and Central Asia conducted a mission to the northern Caucasus, during which she discussed cooperation prospects with leaders of Russian Red Cross branches in the various republics.<BR>

<P>In Chechnya the ICRC kept up negotiations regarding access to people detained by the authorities in connection with the conflict or for security reasons, and to those held by opposition groups. In February, the Deputy Delegate General held discussions with the Chechen authorities on the ICRC's detention-related activities, and more particularly on the question of access to security detainees held in the republic. No tangible progress resulted.<BR>

<P>The events in the republic that marked the second half of 1994 are dealt with separately under the heading Chechnya.<BR>

<P>As part of its dissemination activities, the ICRC started working on a project involving a study to be carried out by local intellectuals. The aim of the study was to limit violence by formulating general principles related to the traditions and cultures of the northern Caucasus and acceptable to all the area's communities.<BR>

<H4><B>INGUSHETIA AND NORTH OSSETIA </B></H4>
<P><A NAME="F1"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Activities for the civilian population</B></H3>
<P>
<P>The ICRC continued to keep a close watch on the situation of isolated population groups, in particular Ingush communities in areas controlled by North Ossetia, and where necessary urged the local and central authorities to ensure their protection. The institution provided medical assistance and relief supplies in the northern Caucasus, where the scarcity of resources made it increasingly difficult for local authorities to meet the needs of displaced people and vulnerable groups on a regular basis. The ICRC also pursued its goal of promoting the development of local Red Cross and Red Crescent branches by associating some of them with its relief work. In cooperation with these branches and aid committees, delegates completed distributions of food and other assistance to displaced civilians and vulnerable people in Ingushetia and North Ossetia, begun in November 1993.<BR>

<P>In July, delegates assessed the situation of some 50,000 refugees from South Ossetia (Georgia) and 70,000 people displaced in connection with the Ossetian-Ingush conflict. On the basis of their findings they prepared a winter assistance programme aimed at providing supplementary food and other assistance for destitute and particularly vulnerable groups. Beginning in November, ICRC delegates, in cooperation with local committees of the Russian Red Cross, distributed blankets and family parcels to displaced people sheltering in public buildings and to other vulnerable groups of displaced people in Ingushetia and North Ossetia. <BR>

<P><A NAME="F2"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Medical activities</B></H3>
<P>
<P>An ICRC evaluation mission conducted in the four republics of the northern Caucasus in July/August revealed a severe shortage of basic medicines and surgical supplies. To increase the capacity of medical establishments to respond to emergencies, the ICRC distributed surgical assistance to hospitals in Ingushetia, where needs were most urgent, and to medical facilities in North Ossetia, including dispensaries in isolated Ingush villages. The ICRC also provided financial support for the running of first-aid courses by local Red Cross branches in the northern Caucasus. <BR>

<P><A NAME="F3"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Activities for detainees</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Delegates continued to visit people arrested in connection with the armed conflict between Ossetians and Ingush and held in places of detention in the northern Caucasus. The ICRC paid the travel expenses of families wishing to visit their relatives in detention. <BR>

<P><A NAME="G"></A><BR>

<H4><B>CHECHNYA</B></H4>
<P>
<P>In view of the growing rift between the Chechen authorities and opposition groups, the ICRC had for some time been planning to open an office in Grozny. However, when the crisis came to a head in September, the need for emergency action overrode all other concerns. The ICRC not only increased its staff numbers and brought in urgently needed medical aid for the war-wounded, but also endeavoured to take preventive action in case all-out combat should erupt. These measures included giving out video clips on the rules of behaviour in combat, which were televised by both the government and the opposition in October. On 28 November the ICRC launched a formal appeal to the warring parties to respect the basic rules of international humanitarian law. In particular, it urged them to spare civilians and their property, to ensure humane treatment of those who surrendered, captured combatants and civilians arrested in connection with the conflict, to refrain from taking hostages, and to respect the sick and wounded, medical personnel, establishments and vehicles and the red cross and red crescent emblems protecting them.<BR>

<P>The involvement of Federal forces as of December prompted the ICRC to issue a memorandum reminding the Federal government and the Chechen authorities of their obligation to respect the provisions of international humanitarian law. The advance of Federal forces on Grozny met with fierce resistance from Chechen fighters, resulting in many casualties among combatants and civilians. Heavy fighting and aerial bombardments forced a large part of the population to flee from the capital and rendered access to the city and some of the neighbouring areas extremely hazardous. However, at the end of the year, ICRC delegates were working throughout Chechnya, with the exception of the embattled centre of Grozny. They carried out their activities from logistics bases in Nalchik, Nazran (Ingushetia) and Khasavyurt (Daghestan); this enabled them not only to operate within Chechnya but also to assist displaced people who had sought refuge in the neighbouring republics and the wounded who had been evacuated there.<BR>

<P>While still striving to meet emergency-related needs, the ICRC began to draw up a plan of action outlining its humanitarian priorities for the next few months. Its objectives focused on gaining access to all detainees, both in Chechnya and elsewhere, who had been arrested in connection with the violence in Chechnya, and developing protection and tracing activities for civilians in order to help them restore contact with their families. In addition, the institution planned to rehabilitate medical facilities and to provide emergency relief for civilians affected by the crisis and assistance for displaced people on their return. The evident lack of awareness of the basic humanitarian rules governing the conduct of hostilities confirmed the need for dissemination activities, particularly among those taking part in the fighting.<BR>

<P>ICRC delegates at headquarters and in the field made every effort to obtain respect for the rules of international humanitarian law. Greatly concerned to ensure protection for civilians and captured combatants, the institution reported violations of the law to the authorities of both sides, urging them to take preventive action. At the same time the ICRC consistently requested access to all people held on either side. <BR>

<P><A NAME="G1"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Activities for detainees</B></H3>
<P>
<P>At the end of November, after the outbreak of fighting in Grozny, delegates visited 74 prisoners held by the Chechen authorities. The visits were carried out in accordance with standard ICRC procedures. In the early days of January 1995, delegates visited and registered three captured Russian servicemen in Grozny and one in the hospital in Staryi Atagi. The prisoners were also given the opportunity to send Red Cross messages to their families. In late 1994 the ICRC was still pursuing its efforts to gain access to all prisoners held in connection with the armed conflict. <BR>

<P><A NAME="G2"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Activities for the civilian population</B></H3>
<P>
<P>At the end of the year the numbers of people displaced in connection with the hostilities were estimated at about 200,000 within Chechnya, 80,000 in Ingushetia, 30,000 in Daghestan and 15,000 elsewhere. Most of them had been taken in by friends and relatives, as is customary in the region. However, the ICRC remained concerned that those offering shelter would themselves run short of food and basic necessities, should the situation persist throughout the winter months. On 31 December three ICRC trucks crossed from Azerbaijan into Daghestan, bringing family parcels and blankets for the most destitute displaced people in the Khasavyurt area and in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia. <BR>

<P><A NAME="G3"></A><BR>

<H3><B>Medical activities</B></H3>
<P>
<P>The ICRC's medical involvement began as early as June, when an ICRC delegate based in Nalchik conducted an evaluation mission to Grozny and provided some limited assistance to hospitals treating people who had been wounded in armed clashes between forces loyal to the Chechen authorities and opposition groups. In August an ICRC team visited Grozny, as part of a survey of medical facilities in the northern Caucasus, and provided seven hospitals with basic supplies. When renewed fighting broke out in September the ICRC again distributed first-aid materials to five hospitals in Chechnya. Beginning in October, against a backdrop of steadily escalating armed confrontation, an ICRC medical team stepped up assistance to hospitals treating the wounded throughout Chechnya, in both government-controlled areas and opposition strongholds. When fighting intensified in December after the arrival of Federal troops, lack of security severely restricted the ICRC's access to Grozny and seriously affected areas nearby. Delegates nonetheless managed to deliver medical supplies regularly to ten facilities treating the wounded, including two hospitals in Grozny, and provided ad hoc assistance to four other medical establishments in Chechnya. In all, 17 hospitals received ICRC assistance on a regular basis, including two centres in Ingushetia and five in Daghestan treating casualties evacuated from Chechnya. <BR>

<H2>R&egrave;glement sur l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge par les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P><I>adopt&eacute; par la XXe Conf&eacute;rence internationale (Vienne, 1965) et r&eacute;vis&eacute; par le Conseil des D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s (Budapest, 1991)</I><BR>

<P>
<P><B>PR&Eacute;AMBULE</B><BR>

<P><I>Le R&egrave;glement sur l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant</I> <I>rouge par les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, adopt&eacute; par la XXe Conf&eacute;rence internationale qui s'est tenue &agrave; Vienne en 1965, a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;vis&eacute; par le Conseil des D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s &agrave; Budapest en novembre 1991.  </I>A <I>la suite du renvoi de la XXVIe Conf&eacute;rence internationale, le CICR a soumis le texte du pr&eacute;sent R&egrave;glement &agrave; l'ensemble des Etats parties aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve en les invitant &agrave; lui faire</I> <I>conna&icirc;tre leurs &eacute;ventuelles objections dans un d&eacute;lai de six mois.  Aucune</I> <I>demande d'amendement ne lui &eacute;tant parvenue dans ce d&eacute;lai, le R&egrave;glement est</I> <I>entr&eacute; en vigueur.</I><BR>

<P><I>Les principales r&egrave;gles en mati&egrave;re d'usage de l'embl&egrave;me figurent dans les</I> <I>Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve du 12 ao&ucirc;t 1949 et ont &eacute;t&eacute; reprises par de nombreux</I> <I>pays dans leur l&eacute;gislation nationale, afin notamment de pouvoir sanctionner les abus.  Le R&egrave;glement est venu pr&eacute;ciser les diverses modalit&eacute;s de l'emploi du</I> <I>signe par les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et leurs membres.</I><BR>

<P><I>Une des raisons d'&ecirc;tre de la r&eacute;vision du R&egrave;glement en 1991 a &eacute;t&eacute; le souci</I> <I>de permettre aux Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de diversifier et d'&eacute;largir leurs</I> <I>ressources financi&egrave;res, tout en gardant intact le respect d&ucirc; &agrave; l'embl&egrave;me et,</I> <I>avec lui, au nom de la croix rouge nu du croissant rouge.</I><BR>

<P><I>Le CICR a insist&eacute; sur la conformit&eacute; du R&egrave;glement au droit.  A cet &eacute;gard, il</I> <I>estime que la r&eacute;vision est &agrave; la limite de ce qui est envisageable dans le cadre</I> <I>des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve.  L'interpr&eacute;tation extensive qui est faite des</I> <I>Conventions lui para&icirc;t n&eacute;anmoins acceptable.  Rien ne s'oppose, d'ailleurs, &agrave;</I> <I>ce que les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales se fixent des limites plus strictes</I><BR>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><BR>

<P><B>1.	But du R&egrave;glement</B><BR>

<P>Le pr&eacute;sent R&egrave;glement (ci-apr&egrave;s: le R&egrave;glement) pr&eacute;cise les diverses modalit&eacute;s de l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge sur fond blanc par les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re des stipulations du droit international humanitaire et des Principes fondamentaux du Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge (ci-apr&egrave;s: le Mouvement).<BR>

<P><B>2.	Bases juridiques</B><BR>

<P>Le R&egrave;glement est fond&eacute; sur les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve du 12 ao&ucirc;t 1949, notamment sur la ler Convention pour l'am&eacute;lioration du sort des bless&eacute;s et des malades dans les forces arm&eacute;es en campagne, ainsi que, pour certaines dispositions, sur le Protocole I du 8 juin 1977, additionnel aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve, relatif &agrave; la protection des victimes des conflits arm&eacute;s internationaux.<BR>

<P>La ler Convention de Gen&egrave;ve fait la distinction, dans son article 44, entre deux usages de l'embl&egrave;me: l'usage protecteur et l'usage indicatif.  Cet article fixe, dans leurs grandes lignes, les r&egrave;gles r&eacute;gissant ces usages.<BR>

<P>Le Protocole I &eacute;largit l'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me en ouvrant &agrave; l'autorit&eacute; comp&eacute;tente de l'Etat (ci-apr&egrave;s: l'Autorit&eacute;) la possibilit&eacute; de l'attribuer &agrave; des cat&eacute;gories de personnes et de biens non vis&eacute;es par les Conventions de 1949.  Il introduit, en outre, la possibilit&eacute; d'utiliser des signaux distinctifs visuels, acoustiques ou &eacute;lectroniques.<BR>

<P><B>3.	Champ d'application</B><BR>

<P>Le R&egrave;glement s'applique &agrave; toute Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge.  Il d&eacute;veloppe l'article 44 de la Ile Convention, qui impose aux Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales des obligations en mati&egrave;re d'embl&egrave;me: si les limites qu'il fixe aux usages licites de l'embl&egrave;me doivent donc &ecirc;tre respect&eacute;es, rien n'emp&ecirc;che cependant les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de pr&eacute;voir des r&egrave;gles plus rigoureuses.<BR>

<P>En cas d'applicabilit&eacute; du Protocole I, certaines dispositions du R&egrave;glement prennent un sens plus large, qui concerne la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de l'Etat o&ugrave; le Protocole I est en vigueur; il ne concerne pas la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de l'Etat non partie au Protocole I, sauf si l'Autorit&eacute; y consent.<BR>

<P><B>4.	Contenu du R&egrave;glement</B><BR>

<P>Le R&egrave;glement contient un chapitre consacr&eacute; &agrave; l'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me et un chapitre consacr&eacute; &agrave; son usage indicatif.  Ces chapitres sont pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute;s par des r&egrave;gles g&eacute;n&eacute;rales, qui doivent permettre de r&eacute;soudre les cas<BR>
qui n'auraient pas &eacute;t&eacute; express&eacute;ment mentionn&eacute;s dans l'un ou l'autre de ces chapitres.<BR>

<P>Les articles du R&egrave;glement sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement suivis, en italique, d'un commentaire explicatif qui renvoie, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, aux dispositions pertinentes des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve et du Protocole I.<BR>

<P><a name=2><BR>

<H3><B>CHAPITRE I : R&Egrave;GLES G&Eacute;N&Eacute;RALES</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>Article 1  Buts de l'embl&egrave;me</B><BR>

<P>L'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me est destin&eacute; &agrave; signaliser le personnel et les biens sanitaires et religieux qui doivent &ecirc;tre respect&eacute;s et prot&eacute;g&eacute;s lors des conflits arm&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>L'usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me sert &agrave; indiquer que des personnes ou des biens ont un lien avec le Mouvement.<BR>

<P><I>Il s'agit donc d'un seul et m&ecirc;me embl&egrave;me, dont on peut faire deux usages diff&eacute;rents: dans son sens premier, l'embl&egrave;me constitue la manifestation visible de la protection conf&eacute;r&eacute;e par le droit international humanitaire &agrave; certaines personnes et &agrave; certains biens, soit, en particulier, &agrave; ceux qui appartiennent au Service de sant&eacute; de l'arm&eacute;e ou qui sont mis &agrave; disposition de ce Service, du personnel sanitaire des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge, ou d'organismes de protection civile (Ier Convention, articles 38, 44; Protocole I, article 8 c).  Dans sa seconde acception, l'embl&egrave;me ne fait qu'indiquer un lien avec le Mouvement</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 2 Comp&eacute;tence de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne peut utiliser l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur qu'avec l'accord de l'Autorit&eacute; et conform&eacute;ment aux modalit&eacute;s fix&eacute;es par cette Autorit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut utiliser l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre indicatif, en temps de paix et en temps de conflit arm&eacute;, dans les limites fix&eacute;es par la l&eacute;gislation nationale, le pr&eacute;sent R&egrave;glement et ses statuts.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 1: </I></B><I>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale n'a donc pas le droit, en tant que telle, d'utiliser l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur.  Il appartient aux Etats de prendre les dispositions n&eacute;cessaires pour permettre l'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me et en assurer le contr&ocirc;le.  Afin d'&eacute;viter que la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne soit prise de court au d&eacute;but d'un conflit arm&eacute;, il est souhaitable que sa fonction d'auxiliaire du Service de sant&eacute; de l'arm&eacute;e et sa facult&eacute; d'utiliser l'embl&egrave;me pour son personnel et ses biens sanitaires soient d&eacute;j&agrave; d&eacute;termin&eacute;es avec l'Autorit&eacute; en temps de paix.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 3 Prestige et respect de l'embl&egrave;me</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne peut utiliser l'embl&egrave;me que pour couvrir des activit&eacute;s conformes aux principes formul&eacute;s par les Conf&eacute;rences internationales la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge.  Elle veillera en toutes circonstances &agrave; ce que rien ne vienne ternir son prestige, ni affaiblir le respect qui lui est d&ucirc;.<BR>

<P><I>Les principes dont il est fait mention, au premier rang desquels les Principes fondamentaux, sont ceux qui donnent ses objectifs au Mouvement et sont &agrave; la base de son action sp&eacute;cifique: l'assistance b&eacute;n&eacute;vole aux personnes souffrantes, aux victimes, directes ou indirectes, des conflits et des calamit&eacute;s naturelles et sociales.  La raison d'&ecirc;tre de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge est rappel&eacute;e dans le pr&eacute;ambule des Statuts du Mouvement.</I><BR>

<P><I>Les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales s'abstiendront donc d'arborer l'embl&egrave;me lorsqu'elles exercent des activit&eacute;s qui n'ont plus qu'un rapport lointain avec leur mission essentielle.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 4 Distinction entre les deux usages</B><BR>

<P>Toute confusion entre l'usage protecteur et l'usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me doit &ecirc;tre &eacute;vit&eacute;e.  En cas de conflit arm&eacute;, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale qui continue d'exercer ses activit&eacute;s du temps de paix prendra toutes les mesures n&eacute;cessaires pour que l'embl&egrave;me figurant &agrave; titre indicatif sur des personnes ou sur des biens soit per&ccedil;u uniquement comme indiquant le lien avec la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et non comme conf&eacute;rant la protection particuli&egrave;re du droit international humanitaire; en particulier, l'embl&egrave;me sera de dimensions relativement petites et ne sera pas appos&eacute; sur un brassard ou une toiture.  La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale tiendra d&eacute;j&agrave; compte de la r&egrave;gle pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente en temps de paix, afin d'&eacute;viter, d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but d'un conflit, toute confusion avec l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur.<BR>

<P><I>Le risque de confusion ne d&eacute;pend pas tant du graphisme de l'embl&egrave;me que des circonstances entourant son utilisation, c'est donc surtout dans les situations o&ugrave; l'embl&egrave;me est aussi utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur, &agrave; savoir lors de conflits arm&eacute;s, qu'intervient la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'&eacute;viter toute confusion.  Pour pallier ce risque, il est recommand&eacute; aux Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales d'utiliser un embl&egrave;me de dimensions relativement petites en temps de paix d&eacute;j&agrave;, lorsqu'elles font un usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me.  Toujours en temps de paix et pour la m&ecirc;me raison, il leur est aussi recommand&eacute; de ne pas apposer l'embl&egrave;me sur un brassard, une toiture ou m&ecirc;me des drapeaux.  On ne doit cependant pas exclure l'utilisation d'un embl&egrave;me de grandes dimensions dans certains cas, notamment lors d'&eacute;v&eacute;nements o&ugrave; il est important que les secouristes soient vite identifi&eacute;s.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 5 Graphisme de l'embl&egrave;me</B><BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur conservera toujours la forme pure, c'est-&agrave;-dire qu'il ne comportera aucune adjonction ni sur la croix ou le croissant, ni sur le fond blanc.  On utilisera une croix form&eacute;e de deux traverses, l'une verticale et l'autre horizontale, se coupant en leur milieu.  La forme et l'orientation du croissant sont libres.  Ni la croix, ni le croissant ne toucheront les bords du drapeau ou de l'&eacute;cusson.  La nuance du rouge n'est pas fix&eacute;e.  Le fond sera toujours blanc.<BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre indicatif sera accompagn&eacute; du nom ou des initiales de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.  Aucun dessin ou inscription ne figurera sur la croix ou le croissant qui sera, par ailleurs, toujours l'&eacute;l&eacute;ment dominant de l'embl&egrave;me.  Le fond sera toujours blanc.<BR>

<P>L'utilisation de l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; des fins d&eacute;coratives est autoris&eacute;e, dans les limites de l'article 3, lors de manifestations publiques ou sur du mat&eacute;riel visant &agrave; promouvoir la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et le Mouvement comme des publications, des films, des m&eacute;dailles ou autres t&eacute;moignages de reconnaissance.  Un graphisme plus souple de l'embl&egrave;me est alors tol&eacute;r&eacute;, pour autant que la l&eacute;gislation nationale ne s'y oppose pas. En outre, et dans la mesure du possible, un usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me devra accompagner son usage d&eacute;coratif.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 1: </I></B><I>Un graphisme clair de l'embl&egrave;me est essentiel pour que les personnes et biens ayant droit &agrave; son usage soient facilement identifi&eacute;s et donc efficacement prot&eacute;g&eacute;s. La protection ne d&eacute;pend cependant pas de l'embl&egrave;me et une personne prot&eacute;g&eacute;e non signalis&eacute;e ou mal signalis&eacute;e ne perd &eacute;videmment pas de ce seul fait son droit &agrave; la protection.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;as 2 et 3: </I></B><I>Il faut ici distinguer l'utilisation de l'embl&egrave;me pour indiquer qu'une personne ou un bien est rattach&eacute; &agrave; la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;, utilisation pour laquelle la rigueur du graphisme s'impose, et l'utilisation &agrave; titre de promotion de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et du Mouvement, o&ugrave; une certaine souplesse est tol&eacute;rable si elle ne porte pas atteinte au prestige de l'embl&egrave;me.  Dans ce dernier cas, c'est &agrave; la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de juger, en fonction de la l&eacute;gislation nationale et de son contexte national, s'il est possible et opportun d'autoriser un tel usage.  La souplesse du graphisme pourra consister par exemple en une croix rouge sertie d'or, un croissant dont la nuance du rouge contient des gradations, une croix d&eacute;coup&eacute;e, un embl&egrave;me recouvert d'un motif. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; n'usera pas d'un tel graphisme sur les b&acirc;timents qu'elle utilise, ni sur son papier &agrave; lettres, puisqu'il s'agit l&agrave; &agrave; l'&eacute;vidence de cas d'usage indicatif.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 6 Visibilit&eacute; de l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur</B><BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur doit &ecirc;tre identifiable d'aussi loin que possible.  Il sera aussi grand que le justifient les circonstances.  De nuit ou par visibilit&eacute; r&eacute;duite, il pourra &ecirc;tre &eacute;clair&eacute; ou illumin&eacute;.  Il sera, dans la mesure du possible, fait de mat&eacute;riaux le rendant reconnaissable par des moyens techniques de d&eacute;tection et appos&eacute; sur des drapeaux ou sur une surface plane visible de toutes les directions possibles, y compris de l'espace a&eacute;rien.<BR>

<P><B>Article 7 R&eacute;glementation interne de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale fixera les conditions d'usage de l'embl&egrave;me dans un r&egrave;glement ou dans des directives internes.<BR>

<P><I>Le r&egrave;glement ou les directives pourront notamment contenir:</I><BR>

<P><B><I>A. A propos de l'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me:</I></B><BR>

<P><I>- la r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &agrave; la l&eacute;gislation nationale en la mati&egrave;re et au R&egrave;glement;</I><BR>

<P><I>- l'indication des autorit&eacute;s comp&eacute;tentes pour autoriser l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me;</I><BR>
<I>- la liste des mesures &agrave; prendre au d&eacute;but d'un conflit pour &eacute;viter toute confusion avec l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre indicatif;</I><BR>

<P><I>- les conditions relatives &agrave; l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me pour</I> <I>les personnes et les biens de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.</I><BR>

<P><I>- les dimensions et proportions de l'embl&egrave;me;</I><BR>

<P><I>- des pr&eacute;cisions sur l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; des fins de recherche de fonds, de diffusion et sur des m&eacute;dailles ou autres t&eacute;moignages de reconnaissance;</I><BR>

<H3><B>CHAPITRE Il : USAGE PROTECTEUR DE L'EMBL&Egrave;ME</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>SECTION 1 PRINCIPE</B><BR>

<P><B>Article 8 Accord de l'Autorit&eacute; et modalit&eacute;s d'utilisation</B><BR>

<P>Avant d'utiliser l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale doit obtenir l'accord de l'Autorit&eacute; et r&eacute;gler avec elle les modalit&eacute;s de son utilisation.  La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale prendra les mesures propres &agrave; faire respecter ces modalit&eacute;s de ses membres et &agrave; &eacute;viter toute confusion avec l'usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me.<BR>

<P><I>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale cherchera &agrave; r&eacute;gler avec l'Autorit&eacute;, d&egrave;s le temps de paix, les modalit&eacute;s de l'utilisation de l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur, en cas de conflit arm&eacute;, sur son personnel et ses biens sanitaires.  Sur le risque de confusion, voir l'article 4.</I><BR>

<P><I>En cas d'impossibilit&eacute; pratique de l'Autorit&eacute; de donner l'autorisation (par exemple, en raison d'une situation de troubles graves), et en pr&eacute;sence de besoins humanitaires &eacute;vidents et urgents, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut pr&eacute;sumer d'une telle autorisation.  D'une part, en effet, le principe d'humanit&eacute; la pousse &agrave; agir ainsi et, d'autre part, elle n'a pas &agrave; craindre une sanction du droit international: l'essence du droit international est d'&ecirc;tre au service des hommes et, devant une flagrante n&eacute;cessit&eacute; humanitaire, un obstacle formel ne saurait bloquer des initiatives correspondant aussi &eacute;videmment &agrave; l'esprit du droit.  Ces consid&eacute;rations concernent les articles 8 &agrave; 10 du pr&eacute;sent R&egrave;glement.</I><BR>

<P>Le personnel sanitaire de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale qui est autoris&eacute; &agrave; arborer l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur portera l'embl&egrave;me, pendant l'exercice de ses fonctions, de mani&egrave;re &agrave; en assurer une visibilit&eacute; optimale.<BR>

<P>Ce personnel sera porteur de la carte d'identit&eacute; d&eacute;livr&eacute;e par l'Autorit&eacute; pour attester son statut.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 1: </I></B><I>Le statut de personnel sanitaire est accord&eacute; au personnel d'une Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale lorsqu'il est mis &agrave; disposition du Service de sant&eacute; de l'arm&eacute;e (article 26, Ire Convention) et, pendant l'exercice de ses fonctions, lorsqu'il est r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement et uniquement affect&eacute; au fonctionnement ou &agrave; l'administration des h&ocirc;pitaux civils (article 20, IVe Convention).</I><BR>

<P><I>Le Protocole I donne &agrave; l'Autorit&eacute; la possibilit&eacute; d'accorder le droit &agrave; l'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; l'ensemble du personnel sanitaire civil, qui peut donc comprendre du personnel sanitaire d'une Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale non vis&eacute; par les Conventions de 1949.  Pour la d&eacute;finition du personnel sanitaire selon le Protocole I, on se reportera &agrave; son article 8, alin&eacute;a c).</I><BR>

<P><I>L'accent sur la visibilit&eacute; de l'embl&egrave;me doit surtout &ecirc;tre mis quand il port&eacute; dans des territoires occup&eacute;s et dans des zones o&ugrave; des combats se d&eacute;roulent ou semblent devoir se d&eacute;rouler.  Voir aussi l'article 6 du R&egrave;glement.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 2: </I></B><I>Voir les articles 40 et 41 et l'Annexe Il de la Ier Convention ainsi que l'article 18, paragraphe 3, du Protocole I et les articles 1 et 2 de l'Annexe I du Protocole I. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale rappellera &agrave; l'Autorit&eacute;, si n&eacute;cessaire, son devoir de d&eacute;livrer ces cartes d'identit&eacute; au personnel sanitaire de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.</I><BR>

<P><B>SECTION 3 LES BIENS</B><BR>

<P><B>Article 10 Les unit&eacute;s sanitaires et les moyens de transport sanitaire de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>Les unit&eacute;s sanitaires et les moyens de transport sanitaire de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale autoris&eacute;s par l'Autorit&eacute; &agrave; arborer l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur seront marqu&eacute;s de l'embl&egrave;me de mani&egrave;re &agrave; en assurer une visibilit&eacute; optimale.<BR>

<P><I>Dans les Conventions, les unit&eacute;s sanitaires et les moyens de transport sanitaire s'entendent des formations et des &eacute;tablissements sanitaires, des b&acirc;timents, du mat&eacute;riel et des transports sanitaires (voir les chapitres III, V et VI de la Je Convention).  En ce qui concerne la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, il s'agit notamment des h&ocirc;pitaux, ambulances, navires-h&ocirc;pitaux, a&eacute;ronefs et d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts de mat&eacute;riel sanitaire, lorsqu'ils sont mis &agrave; disposition du Service de sant&eacute; de l'arm&eacute;e; mais aussi des h&ocirc;pital civils lui appartenant, lorsqu'ils sont reconnus comme tels et autoris&eacute;s par l'Autorit&eacute; &agrave; arborer l'embl&egrave;me (voir article 18 de la IV, Convention).</I><BR>

<P><I>Le Protocole I donne &agrave; l'Autorit&eacute; la possibilit&eacute; d'accorder le droit &agrave; l'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; l'ensemble des unit&eacute;s sanitaires civiles et des moyens de transport sanitaire civils, qui peut donc comprendre des unit&eacute;s sanitaires et des moyens de transport sanitaire d'une Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale non vis&eacute;s par les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949.  Une d&eacute;finition des unit&eacute;s sanitaires, du transport sanitaire et des moyens de transport sanitaire est donn&eacute;e au Protocole I, &agrave; l'article 8, alin&eacute;as e), f) et g).</I><BR>

<P><I>Des pr&eacute;cisions sur la visibilit&eacute; de l'embl&egrave;me se trouvent &agrave; l'article 42 de la Ire Convention et au chapitre Il de l'Annexe I du Protocole I. Voir aussi l'article 6 du R&egrave;glement.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 11 R&egrave;gles sp&eacute;cifiques de signalisation</B><BR>

<P>Les navires-h&ocirc;pitaux et les embarcations de sauvetage c&ocirc;ti&egrave;res de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale seront signalis&eacute;s au moyen de l'embl&egrave;me de la mani&egrave;re pr&eacute;vue &agrave; l'article 43 de la IIe Convention de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949.<BR>

<P>Les a&eacute;ronefs sanitaires de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale seront signalis&eacute;s conform&eacute;ment &agrave; l'article 36 de la Ire Convention.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 1:</I></B><I> Les navires-h&ocirc;pitaux et les embarcations de sauvetage c&ocirc;ti&egrave;res - qu'on appelle plut&ocirc;t, de nos jours, bateaux de sauvetage, du fait de l'importance du tonnage et du rayon d'action de certaines de ces embarcations - doivent &ecirc;tre porteurs d'un document de l'Autorit&eacute; d&eacute;clarant qu'ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis &agrave; son contr&ocirc;le pendant leur armement (au sens naval du terme) et &agrave; leur d&eacute;part.  Leurs noms et caract&eacute;ristiques doivent &ecirc;tre communiqu&eacute;s &agrave; toutes les Parties au conflit.  Ces navires-h&ocirc;pitaux et bateaux de sauvetage sont exempts de capture.  Des r&egrave;gles d&eacute;taill&eacute;es en mati&egrave;re de signalisation se trouvent &agrave; l'article 43 de la IIe Convention.  Voir aussi les articles 22 &agrave; 35 de la IIe Convention et les articles 3 &agrave; 11 de l'Annexe I du Protocole I.</I><BR>

<P><I>En outre, selon l'article 23 du Protocole I, les autres navires et embarcations de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, utilis&eacute;s temporairement ou en permanence &agrave; des fins sanitaires, seront signalis&eacute;s conform&eacute;ment &agrave; l'article 43, alin&eacute;a 2 de la IIe Convention.  Ces navires et embarcations ne sont pas exempts de capture.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 2: </I></B><I>Les articles pertinents sont les articles 36 de la Ire Convention, 39 de la IIe Convention, 22 de la IVe Convention; les articles 24 &agrave; 31 du Protocole I et 5 &agrave; 13 de l'Annexe I du Protocole I.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 12  Signaux distinctifs facultatifs</B><BR>

<P>Avec le consentement de l'Autorit&eacute;, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale pourra signaliser ses unit&eacute;s sanitaires et ses moyens de transport sanitaire en utilisant, outre l'embl&egrave;me, les signaux distinctifs facultatifs reconnus, &agrave; savoir le signal lumineux bleu, le signal radio et les moyens &eacute;lectroniques d'identification.<BR>

<P><I>La r&eacute;glementation sur les signaux distinctifs se trouve:</I><BR>

<P><I>- dans l'Annexe I du Protocole I, aux articles 5 &agrave; 8;</I><BR>
<I>- dans le document 9051 du Manuel technique de l'Organisation de l'Aviation Civile Internationale (OACI) (feux bleus);</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 13 Signalisation d&egrave;s le temps de paix</B><BR>

<P>Avec le consentement de l'Autorit&eacute;, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut, d&egrave;s le temps de paix, signaliser au moyen de l'embl&egrave;me et des signaux distinctifs facultatifs les unit&eacute;s et les moyens de transport dont l'affectation sanitaire en cas de conflit arm&eacute; est d&eacute;j&agrave; d&eacute;termin&eacute;e.<BR>

<P><B>Article 14 Utilisation simultan&eacute;e de l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur et &agrave; titre indicatif</B><BR>

<P>Sauf avis contraire de l'Autorit&eacute;, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut autoriser ses membres &agrave; porter l'embl&egrave;me avec son nom &agrave; titre indicatif en m&ecirc;me temps que l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur.<BR>

<P>Dans les m&ecirc;mes conditions, les biens mis &agrave; disposition de l'Autorit&eacute; peuvent porter l'embl&egrave;me avec le nom de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Dans ces cas, l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre indicatif et le nom de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale doivent &ecirc;tre de petites dimensions.<BR>

<P><B>Article 15 Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale d'un Etat neutre ou d'un autre Etat non partie au conflit</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale d'un Etat neutre ou d'un Etat non partie au conflit qui d&eacute;sire mettre du personnel ou des biens sanitaires &agrave; disposition d'une Partie &agrave; un conflit arm&eacute; doit au pr&eacute;alable obtenir l'accord de ladite Partie et des autorit&eacute;s de son Etat d'origine.  Les modalit&eacute;s de l'usage protecteur de l'embl&egrave;me doivent &ecirc;tre fix&eacute;es avec ladite Partie au conflit.  Ces personnes et ces biens pourront arborer l'embl&egrave;me d&egrave;s leur d&eacute;part en mission.<BR>

<H3><B>CHAPITRE III : USAGE INDICATIF DE L'EMBL&Egrave;ME</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>SECTION 1 LES PERSONNES</B><BR>

<P><B>Article 16 Membres et employ&eacute;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>Les membres et les employ&eacute;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peuvent porter l'embl&egrave;me, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement de petites dimensions, pendant qu'ils exercent une activit&eacute; &agrave; son service.<BR>

<P>En dehors de cette activit&eacute;, les membres ne peuvent porter qu'un embl&egrave;me de tr&egrave;s petites dimensions, par exemple sous forme de broche ou d'insigne.<BR>

<P>Sauf situations exceptionnelles, l'embl&egrave;me sera accompagn&eacute; du nom ou des initiales de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 1: </I></B><I>Habituellement de petites dimensions, l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre indicatif pourra cependant parfois &ecirc;tre de grandes dimensions, notamment lorsqu'il s'agit de permettre une rapide identification des secouristes (voir l'article 4 et son commentaire).</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 2: </I></B><I>C'est parce qu'il est arbor&eacute; ici en dehors de toute activit&eacute; concr&egrave;te au service de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; que l'embl&egrave;me doit &ecirc;tre de tr&egrave;s petites dimensions.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 3: </I></B><I>Il est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement opportun que les volontaires soient identifi&eacute;s comme membres de leur Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.  Dans certains cas, il est toutefois pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable de leur permettre de ne pas faire usage du nom ou des initiales de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; de l'embl&egrave;me, par exemple lors de troubles int&eacute;rieurs au cours desquels leurs activit&eacute;s pourraient &ecirc;tre entrav&eacute;es en raison de cette inscription.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 17 Membres de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge de la Jeunesse</B><BR>

<P>Les r&egrave;gles de l'article 16 sont applicables.  L'embl&egrave;me sera accompagn&eacute; des mots Croix-Rouge de la Jeunesse ou Croissant-Rouge de la Jeunesse, ou des initiales CRJ.<BR>

<P><B>Article 18 Autres personnes autoris&eacute;es par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut autoriser, aux conditions fix&eacute;es par sa r&eacute;glementation interne, les personnes qui ne sont pas membres de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;, mais qui ont suivi ses cours ou r&eacute;ussi ses examens, &agrave; porter un embl&egrave;me qui sera de tr&egrave;s petites dimensions et accompagn&eacute; du nom ou des initiales de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;, par exemple sous forme de broche ou d'insigne.<BR>

<P><I>Il s'agira le plus souvent de secouristes ou d'infirmiers, ainsi d&eacute;sign&eacute;s l'attention du public.</I><BR>

<P><B>SECTION 2 LES BIENS</B><BR>

<P><B>Article 19 B&acirc;timents et locaux utilis&eacute;s par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me accompagn&eacute; du nom de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut figurer sur les b&acirc;timents et les locaux utilis&eacute;s par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;, qu'ils lui appartiennent ou non.<BR>

<P>Dans le cas o&ugrave; le b&acirc;timent n'est que partiellement utilis&eacute; par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, l'embl&egrave;me ne pourra figurer que sur les locaux qu'elle utilise.<BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me sera de dimensions relativement petites et ne sera pas appos&eacute; sur la toiture afin d'&eacute;viter, en temps de conflit arm&eacute;, toute confusion avec l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 2: </I></B><I>Lorsque la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale partage un b&acirc;timent avec d'autres personnes ou soci&eacute;t&eacute;s, elle veillera &agrave; ce que les activit&eacute;s de ses voisins ne puissent indirectement porter pr&eacute;judice au prestige de l'embl&egrave;me.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 3: </I></B><I>Sur le risque de confusion, voir l'article 4.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 20 B&acirc;timents et locaux appartenant &agrave; la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, non occup&eacute;s par elle</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale n'apposera pas l'embl&egrave;me sur des b&acirc;timents ou des locaux qui sont sa propri&eacute;t&eacute;, mais qu'elle n'occupe pas et qu'elle loue ou pr&ecirc;te &agrave; des tiers.<BR>

<P><B>Article 21 H&ocirc;pitaux, postes de secours </B>[1]<B> et moyens de transport de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me accompagn&eacute; du nom de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut figurer sur les h&ocirc;pitaux et les postes de secours dirig&eacute;s par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et sur les moyens de transport, en particulier les ambulances, utilis&eacute;s par ses membres et ses employ&eacute;s.  Sous r&eacute;serve de l'article 13, l'embl&egrave;me ainsi utilis&eacute; sera de dimensions relativement petites afin d'&eacute;viter, en temps de conflit arm&eacute;, toute confusion avec l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur.<BR>

<P><I>En ce qui concerne les h&ocirc;pitaux, on notera que l'usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me est exclusivement r&eacute;serv&eacute; aux h&ocirc;pitaux de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.  Mais on se souviendra que les h&ocirc;pitaux que l'Autorit&eacute; entend autoriser &agrave; arborer l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; titre protecteur en temps de conflit peuvent, avec son consentement, d&eacute;j&agrave; &ecirc;tre marqu&eacute;s en cons&eacute;quence en temps de paix (voir les articles 10 et 13).</I><BR>

<P><I>Afin d'&eacute;viter des abus, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale veillera, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, &agrave; faire dispara&icirc;tre l'embl&egrave;me et son nom si elle pr&ecirc;te un moyen de transport &agrave; d'autres organisations.</I><BR>

<P><I>Sur le risque de confusion, voir l'article 4.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 22 Postes de secours </B>[2] <B>et ambulances dirig&eacute;s ou utilis&eacute;s par des tiers</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut autoriser des tiers &agrave; faire usage de L'embl&egrave;me, en temps de paix et conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la l&eacute;gislation nationale, pour signaliser des postes de secours exclusivement r&eacute;serv&eacute;s aux soins gratuits, ainsi que des ambulances.<BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne donnera cette autorisation qu'en &eacute;change du droit de contr&ocirc;ler r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement l'usage qui est fait de l'embl&egrave;me.  Elle se r&eacute;servera en outre le droit de retirer l'autorisation en tout temps, avec effets imm&eacute;diats.<BR>

<P><I>L'article 44, alin&eacute;a 4, de la Ier Convention permet la signalisation, outre des ambulances, des postes de secours exclusivement r&eacute;serv&eacute;s aux soins gratuits.  L'exp&eacute;rience montre que cette r&egrave;gle de la gratuit&eacute; est souvent interpr&eacute;t&eacute;e avec une certaine souplesse: une telle pratique n'est tol&eacute;rable, pour rester en conformit&eacute; avec l'esprit de la Convention, que dans la mesure o&ugrave; la perception d'une finance n'est en aucun cas une condition &agrave; l'obtention du soin et o&ugrave; est maintenue l'id&eacute;e de service b&eacute;n&eacute;vole li&eacute;e au Mouvement.</I><BR>

<P><B>SECTION 3 DIFFUSION ET RECHERCHE DE FONDS</B><BR>

<P><B>Article 23 Campagnes et manifestations de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut utiliser l'embl&egrave;me dans les campagnes ou les manifestations destin&eacute;es &agrave; faire conna&icirc;tre son action, &agrave; diffuser le droit international humanitaire et les Principes fondamentaux du Mouvement ou &agrave; rechercher des fonds, dans les limites des articles 2 &agrave; 5 du R&egrave;glement.<BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me figurant sur les imprim&eacute;s, objets ou autres supports de ces campagnes sera accompagn&eacute;, pour autant que cela soit possible dans la pratique, du nom de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;, voire d'un texte ou d'un dessin de propagande.  Les objets ne devront pas sugg&eacute;rer la protection du droit international humanitaire ou l'appartenance au Mouvement, ni pouvoir servir ult&eacute;rieurement &agrave; des usages abusifs.  Ils seront de dimensions r&eacute;duites ou, sinon, fabriqu&eacute;s dans du mat&eacute;riel rapidement p&eacute;rissable.<BR>

<P>Lorsque, dans un but de recherche de fonds ou de diffusion, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale s'assure le concours d'entreprises commerciales ou celui d'autres organisations, elle peut apposer la marque, le logo ou la raison sociale de ces entreprises sur le mat&eacute;riel qu'elle utilise, sur des imprim&eacute;s publicitaires ou sur des objets qu'elle met en vente, pour autant que les conditions suivantes soient r&eacute;unies:<BR>

<P>a)	il ne peut r&eacute;sulter aucune confusion dans l'esprit du public entre les activit&eacute;s ou la qualit&eacute; des produits de l'entreprise contractante, d'une part, l'embl&egrave;me ou la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, d'autre part,<BR>

<P>b)  la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale exerce un contr&ocirc;le sur l'ensemble de la campagne, en particulier sur le choix des objets ou des emplacements o&ugrave; seront appos&eacute;s la marque, le logo ou la raison sociale de cette entreprise, et que la forme et les dimensions de ces appositions;<BR>

<P>c) la campagne est li&eacute;e &agrave; une action particuli&egrave;re et, en r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, est limit&eacute;e dans la dur&eacute;e et dans l'espace;<BR>

<P>d) l'entreprise contractante n'exerce en aucun cas des activit&eacute;s en contradiction avec les objectifs et Principes du Mouvement, ou qui pourraient pr&ecirc;ter &agrave; controverse dans l'opinion publique;<BR>

<P>e) la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale se r&eacute;serve le droit d'annuler en tout temps le contrat la liant &agrave; l'entreprise, et ce dans un d&eacute;lai tr&egrave;s court, au cas o&ugrave; des activit&eacute;s de l'entreprise porteraient atteinte au respect et au prestige dus &agrave; l'embl&egrave;me;<BR>

<P>f) le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice mat&eacute;riel ou financier que la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale doit tirer de la campagne est substantiel, sans qu'il ne mette toutefois en danger l'ind&eacute;pendance de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;;<BR>

<P>g) le contrat entre la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et son partenaire est pass&eacute; en la forme &eacute;crite.<BR>

<P>h) ce contrat est approuv&eacute; par les organes dirigeants de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.<BR>

<P>Une Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut autoriser une entreprise commerciale ou une autre organisation &agrave; faire mention d'un don ou d'une action effectu&eacute;e en sa faveur dans son mat&eacute;riel publicitaire ou sur des objets qu'elle met en vente totalement ou partiellement &agrave; son profit.  Une telle autorisation est toutefois li&eacute;e au strict respect des conditions &eacute;num&eacute;r&eacute;es &agrave; l'alin&eacute;a pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent, lettres a), c), d), e), f), g) et h).  Dans une campagne promotionnelle, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale se r&eacute;servera un droit de regard sur la comptabilit&eacute; de son partenaire &eacute;conomique aff&eacute;rente &agrave; la campagne en question.  De plus, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale contr&ocirc;lera avec soin la mani&egrave;re dont seront mentionn&eacute;es les prestations fournies dans le mat&eacute;riel publicitaire ou sur les objets pr&eacute;cit&eacute;s.  Elle fera de m&ecirc;me, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, pour toute photo ou autre moyen visuel utilis&eacute; au cours de la campagne.  Elle ne pourra pas autoriser l'apposition de son embl&egrave;me sur des articles destin&eacute;s &agrave; la vente et ne pourra en autoriser l'apposition sur du mat&eacute;riel publicitaire qu'avec la plus grande circonspection et pour autant qu'il soit de petites dimensions et accompagn&eacute; d'une explication claire quant &agrave; la prestation accord&eacute;e &agrave; la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.  La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale veillera enfin &agrave; ce que le contrat pass&eacute; avec son partenaire &eacute;conomique stipule que les conditions concernant l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me en constituent un &eacute;l&eacute;ment essentiel, dont la violation d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;e entra&icirc;ne en faveur de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; un droit de r&eacute;siliation avec effets imm&eacute;diats, et ce sans aucune obligation de d&eacute;dommagement.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 1: </I></B><I>Du renvoi &agrave; l'article 3, on conclura que, si l'usage du nom et de l'embl&egrave;me &agrave; des fins de recherche de fonds peut &ecirc;tre admis lorsqu'il y a vente d'un objet ou d'une prestation momentan&eacute;e, tel n'est pas le cas, par exemple, pour la vente d'un service durable ou &agrave; long terme, surtout s'il s'agit d'une prestation sans rapport avec les activit&eacute;s traditionnelles du Mouvement ou si cette prestation entre en concurrence avec des services similaires fournis sur une base commerciale.  Le tout est d'&eacute;viter que les ventes d'objets et de services de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ou les manifestations qu'elle organise ne deviennent plus repr&eacute;sentatives de son action que ne le sont ses activit&eacute;s humanitaires et sociales.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 2: </I></B><I>Ces supports, vendus ou distribu&eacute;s au public, peuvent &ecirc;tre des imprim&eacute;s et des objets de toute sorte: tracts, publications, affiches, souvenirs philat&eacute;liques, films, crayons, etc.  Sur les v&ecirc;tements, drapeaux ou fanions, il est primordial, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; le risque de confusion que ces objets pourraient cr&eacute;er, en temps de conflit arm&eacute;, avec l'embl&egrave;me utilis&eacute; &agrave; titre protecteur, de ne pas oublier d'accompagner l'embl&egrave;me du nom de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, voire d'un texte ou d'un dessin de propagande.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 3: </I></B><I>Les conditions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales indiqu&eacute;es dans les deux premiers alin&eacute;as s'appliquent &eacute;videmment aussi aux situations particuli&egrave;res examin&eacute;es dans ce troisi&egrave;me alin&eacute;a.  L'emploi de l'embl&egrave;me ou du nom de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge par des particuliers, soci&eacute;t&eacute;s ou maisons de commerce tant publiques que priv&eacute;es est interdit par le droit international humanitaire (article 53, Ire Convention de Gen&egrave;ve).  Il est en revanche admissible qu'une Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale fasse mention d'une prestation qu'elle a re&ccedil;ue de la part d'entreprises commerciales ou d'autres organisations.  On ne peut exiger en effet que ces prestations restent anonymes, sous peine de se priver d'importantes sources de financement ou d'autres appuis.  Toutefois, il est important que la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale soit tr&egrave;s attentive &agrave; la mani&egrave;re dont ces prestations sont mentionn&eacute;es pour &eacute;viter tout abus et toute confusion dans l'esprit du public.  Les conditions pr&eacute;vues &agrave; l'alin&eacute;a 3 permettent pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment de d&eacute;finir le cadre admissible.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Lettres a) et b)</I></B><BR>

<P><I>Il convient en premier lieu d'&eacute;viter toute confusion dans l'esprit du public entre des entreprises commerciales et l'embl&egrave;me ou la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale. Ainsi, quand une Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale fait savoir qu'elle est soutenue par une entreprise commerciale dans une campagne (notamment production d'imprim&eacute;s ou d'objets), elle doit veiller &agrave; ce que le r&ocirc;le jou&eacute; par l'entreprise soit express&eacute;ment pr&eacute;cis&eacute; et &agrave; ce que l'embl&egrave;me n'apparaisse en aucun cas comme conf&eacute;rant un label de qualit&eacute; &agrave; des produits.  Elle s'assurera en outre que la mention de la marque, du logo ou de la raison sociale de cette entreprise demeure dans des proportions raisonnables par rapport aux autres &eacute;l&eacute;ments visibles.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Lettre c)</I></B><BR>

<P><I>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne peut associer une entreprise commerciale &agrave; l'ensemble de ses activit&eacute;s, mais seulement &agrave; une action particuli&egrave;re.  La dur&eacute;e de ce lien sera d&eacute;termin&eacute;e &agrave; l'avance et ne devrait pas exc&eacute;der trois ans.  En outre, il doit &ecirc;tre circonscrit au territoire national, &agrave; moins d'un accord avec la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale (ou les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales) de tout autre Etat sur le territoire duquel la campagne pourrait &eacute;galement s'exercer.</I><BR>

<P><I>Certaines entreprises exercent des activit&eacute;s dont le but est en lui-m&ecirc;me directement contraire aux objectifs du Mouvement (par exemple vente ou fabrication d'armes, d'alcool, de tabac ou de produits clairement identifi&eacute;s comme &eacute;tant nuisibles sur le plan &eacute;cologique).  L'association du nom ou du signe de ces entreprises avec ceux d'une Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale doit donc &ecirc;tre &eacute;vit&eacute;e.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Lettre e)</I></B><BR>

<P><I>Une association avec une entreprise commerciale dont le but n'est pas contraire aux objectifs du Mouvement pourrait devenir g&ecirc;nante en raison de circonstances inconnues au moment de la conclusion de l'accord entre la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et l'entreprise en question (grave pollution par la firme incrimin&eacute;e, par exemple), Il est donc essentiel que la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ait la possibilit&eacute; de mettre fin &agrave; toute collaboration avec son partenaire &eacute;conomique dans un d&eacute;lai tr&egrave;s rapide</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Lettre f)</I></B><BR>

<P><I>Le sponsoring est un acte important et grave.  Il doit donc porter sur des contrats d'une certaine ampleur et doit permettre &agrave; la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale d'en retirer des avantages substantiels.  La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale veillera cependant &agrave; ce que l'avantage obtenu ne la mette pas en position de d&eacute;pendance par rapport &agrave; l'entreprise concern&eacute;e.  S'agissant notamment d'une prestation financi&egrave;re, il conviendrait que celle-ci ne d&eacute;passe pas un certain pourcentage de ses ressources totales (environ 20% au maximum).</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Lettre g)</I></B><BR>

<P><I>Il est &eacute;galement indispensable que toutes les modalit&eacute;s de l'accord entre la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et l'entreprise ou l'organisation contractante fassent l'objet d'un contrat &eacute;crit.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Lettre h)</I></B><BR>

<P><I>La conclusion de l'accord entre la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et l'entreprise ou l'organisation contractante doit &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;alablement discut&eacute;e au sein de l'organe normalement comp&eacute;tent pour prendre les d&eacute;cisions relatives &agrave; l'administration de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 4: </I></B><I>Afin que la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne soit pas priv&eacute;e d'importantes sources de financement, on peut admettre qu'elle autorise des entreprises commerciales ou d'autres organisations &agrave; faire mention d'une prestation fournie &agrave; la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale dans leur mat&eacute;riel publicitaire ou sur des objets vendus enti&egrave;rement ou partiellement au b&eacute;n&eacute;fice de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.  Les risques d'abus sont cependant particuli&egrave;rement grands et les conditions &eacute;nonc&eacute;es &agrave; l'alin&eacute;a 3, lettres a), c), d), e), f), g) et h) doivent &ecirc;tre rigoureusement observ&eacute;es.</I><BR>

<P><I>En outre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale veillera &agrave; ce que cette mention reste discr&egrave;te et ne pr&ecirc;te &agrave; aucune confusion.  L'embl&egrave;me peut &ecirc;tre reproduit dans le mat&eacute;riel publicitaire de ses partenaires.  En revanche, son apposition est interdite sur les produits ou objets mis en vente, du fait qu'ils sont souvent con&ccedil;us pour durer longtemps et que la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale n'a pas le contr&ocirc;le de leur utilisation.</I><BR>

<P><I>Dans le cas o&ugrave; sa reproduction sur le mat&eacute;riel publicitaire est autoris&eacute;e, l'embl&egrave;me devra &ecirc;tre de petites dimensions et il devra &ecirc;tre accompagn&eacute; d'une explication permettant au public de clairement comprendre la relation entre la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et l'entreprise ou l'organisation contractante.</I><BR>

<P><I>Par ailleurs, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale se r&eacute;servera le droit d'examiner la comptabilit&eacute; de son partenaire concernant les op&eacute;rations relatives &agrave; la campagne promotionnelle.  Le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, elle exercera ce droit soit directement elle-m&ecirc;me, soit par l'interm&eacute;diaire d'une institution sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e, fiduciaire ou autre.</I><BR>

<P><I>Enfin, outre le droit de r&eacute;siliation pr&eacute;vu &agrave; l'article 23, 3e alin&eacute;a, lettre e), la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale se r&eacute;servera la possibilit&eacute; de r&eacute;silier le contrat avec effets imm&eacute;diats et sans obligation de d&eacute;dommagement en cas de violation d&eacute;lib&eacute;r&eacute;e des conditions relatives &agrave; l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me par l'entreprise ou l'organisation contractante.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 24 Demandes de tiers d'utiliser l'embl&egrave;me</B><BR>

<P>En dehors des cas vis&eacute;s aux articles 18, 22 et 23, et des exceptions pr&eacute;vues au pr&eacute;sent article dans un but de promotion des activit&eacute;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et du Mouvement, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne peut pas autoriser des tiers &agrave; utiliser l'embl&egrave;me.<BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale pourra r&eacute;pondre favorablement &agrave; une demande d'apposer l'embl&egrave;me sur des objets &agrave; mettre en vente sur le march&eacute; s'ils repr&eacute;sentent des personnages ou objets qui peuvent porter l'embl&egrave;me dans la r&eacute;alit&eacute;, conform&eacute;ment aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve, &agrave; titre protecteur ou &agrave; titre indicatif, et si l'embl&egrave;me n'y est pas juxtapos&eacute; &agrave; la marque de l'entreprise requ&eacute;rante.  L'autorisation sera limit&eacute;e quant au temps ou au nombre d'objets.  Elle pourra &ecirc;tre subordonn&eacute;e au paiement d'une somme d'argent, mais son but principal devra demeurer la diffusion du droit international humanitaire ou des activit&eacute;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et du Mouvement.<BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale pourra autoriser l'utilisation de l'embl&egrave;me par des institutions dont l'objet, non commercial, est uniquement de faire conna&icirc;tre ou de promouvoir les activit&eacute;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et du Mouvement.<BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale exigera du tiers toutes les facilit&eacute;s n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; un contr&ocirc;le de l'usage de l'embl&egrave;me en tout temps et se r&eacute;servera le droit de retirer son autorisation avec effets imm&eacute;diats.<BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 1:</I></B><I> Il est ainsi clair que, en dehors des cas cit&eacute;s, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ne peut pas autoriser des tiers &agrave; utiliser l'embl&egrave;me.  Une telle autorisation exige en effet un contr&ocirc;le tr&egrave;s strict de la part de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, et doit de ce fait demeurer exceptionnelle.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 2: </I></B><I>Ces personnages ou objets seront par exemple des ambulances militaires miniatures, des figurines repr&eacute;sentant des membres du Service de sant&eacute; de l'arm&eacute;e ou de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.  L'autorisation sera limit&eacute;e au pays de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale qui l'octroie, sauf en cas d'accord avec la ou les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales d'un ou plusieurs autres pays.  De plus, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale veillera, si elle est amen&eacute;e &agrave; d&eacute;livrer une autorisation, &agrave; respecter les r&egrave;gles de la bonne foi et &agrave; ne pas favoriser ind&ucirc;ment une entreprise au d&eacute;triment d'une autre.  M&ecirc;me si l'autorisation d'utiliser l'embl&egrave;me n'est pas subordonn&eacute;e &agrave; une prestation financi&egrave;re, les r&egrave;gles &eacute;nonc&eacute;es &agrave; l'article 23 sur le respect d&ucirc; &agrave; l'embl&egrave;me s'appliquent dans les cas pr&eacute;vus &agrave; cet article.  De m&ecirc;me, les entreprises qui d&eacute;sireraient faire usage de l'embl&egrave;me, m&ecirc;me sans but lucratif, doivent demander l'autorisation de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, aux conditions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales indiqu&eacute;es &agrave; l'article 23.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Ad alin&eacute;a 3: </I></B><I>Sont ici autoris&eacute;es par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale &agrave; faire usage de l'embl&egrave;me des institutions comme des associations ou des fondations, dont le but est de promouvoir la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et le Mouvement, mais qui, pour des raisons d'opportunit&eacute; ou des raisons juridiques (fiscales par exemple), sont des entit&eacute;s juridiques ind&eacute;pendantes de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale.  A noter que ces institutions n'ont droit &agrave; l'embl&egrave;me que dans la mesure o&ugrave; elles l'utilisent pour faire conna&icirc;tre ou promouvoir les activit&eacute;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; et du Mouvement et non pour leurs membres en tant que tels.  Il est donc important que cet usage de l'embl&egrave;me soit strictement contr&ocirc;l&eacute; par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale (voir alin&eacute;a 4).</I><BR>

<P><B>SECTION 4  R&Egrave;GLES PARTICULI&Egrave;RES</B><BR>

<P><B>Article 25 Collaboration avec d'autres organisations</B><BR>

<P>Outre les cas pr&eacute;vus aux articles 23 et 24, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale pourra exceptionnellement utiliser l'embl&egrave;me conjointement avec celui d'une autre organisation &agrave; but humanitaire, dans le cas d'une action sp&eacute;cifique et &agrave; condition que cette utilisation soit discr&egrave;te et ne cr&eacute;e pas une confusion entre la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et cette organisation.<BR>

<P><I>En principe, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale n'utilisera pas son embl&egrave;me conjointement avec celui d'autres organisations.  Elle s'efforcera notamment de trouver une solution lui permettant d'&eacute;viter un tel proc&eacute;d&eacute;, et n'aura recours &agrave; cette utilisation conjointe qu'exceptionnellement, dans le cadre d'actions humanitaires ou de diffusion (publication commune, par exemple).  Ces &eacute;ventuels cas d'application ne concerneront toutefois que l'usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me.</I><BR>

<P><B>Article 26  M&eacute;dailles et autres t&eacute;moignages de reconnaissance</B><BR>

<P>L'embl&egrave;me peut figurer sur les m&eacute;dailles et autres t&eacute;moignages de reconnaissance de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale, &agrave; condition d'&ecirc;tre accompagn&eacute; de son nom et, si possible, de quelques mots qui indiquent la signification de la m&eacute;daille ou pr&eacute;cisent le t&eacute;moignage rendu.  Il pourra avoir un graphisme d&eacute;coratif aux conditions pr&eacute;vues &agrave; l'article 5, alin&eacute;a 3 du R&egrave;glement.<BR>

<P><B>Article 27 Envois de secours</B><BR>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale peut utiliser l'embl&egrave;me, accompagn&eacute; de son nom ou de ses initiales, pour marquer les secours achemin&eacute;s par rail, route, eau ou air et destin&eacute;s aux victimes de conflits arm&eacute;s ou de catastrophes naturelles.  La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale veillera &agrave; emp&ecirc;cher tout abus.<BR>

<P><I>Il est important de noter que ce droit ne s'applique qu'aux secours eux-m&ecirc;mes, pour permettre d'identifier leur provenance, et non aux moyens de transport utilis&eacute;s.</I><BR>

<P>
<P><B>Notes :</B><BR>

<P>1. La Convention des Nations Unies sur la signalisation routi&egrave;re, adopt&eacute;e &agrave; Vienne le 8 novembre 1968, de m&ecirc;me que l'Accord europ&eacute;en la compl&eacute;tant, adopt&eacute; &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve le ler mai 1971, pr&eacute;voient deux signaux routiers sur lesquels figure l'embl&egrave;me:<BR>

<P>a)	le signal poste de secours (F, 1a), constitu&eacute; de la croix rouge ou du croissant rouge sur fond blanc, le tout encadr&eacute; de bleu: comme il s'agit d'un usage indicatif de l'embl&egrave;me, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale doit demander aux autorit&eacute;s de n'utiliser ce signal que pour signaler des postes de secours dirig&eacute;s ou autoris&eacute;s par elle;<BR>

<P>b)	le signal h&ocirc;pital (E, 12b), constitu&eacute; d'une croix rouge ou d'un croissant rouge sur fond bleu ainsi que d'un lit blanc.  Cet usage de l'embl&egrave;me &eacute;tant abusif, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale doit demander aux autorit&eacute;s de n'utiliser que l'autre signal h&ocirc;pital (E, 12a), &eacute;galement pr&eacute;vu par ces trait&eacute;s, constitu&eacute; de la lettre H blanche sur fond bleu.<BR>

<H2>Peace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina : provisions concerning the ICRC</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P><I>The Peace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina was concluded on 21 November 1995 in Dayton (United States) and signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by the Presidents of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Croatia. The Agreement brought the hostilities on the territory of the former Yugoslavia to an end. </I><BR>

<P><I>The Peace Agreement consists of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and a number of annexes. This voluminous accord contains some articles which are directly relevant for the activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross in the former Yugoslavia. The text of these provisions is reproduced below.</I><BR>

<P><I>The Review</I><BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Peace Agreement for Bosnia and Herzegovina </B>[1]</H4>
<P>
<P><B>Annex 1A:	Agreement on the Military Aspects of the Peace Settlement</B><BR>

<P>Article IX: <I>Prisoner Exchanges</I><BR>

<P>1. The Parties shall release and transfer without delay all combatants and civilians held in relation to the conflict (hereinafter &quot;prisoners&quot;), in conformity with international humanitarian law and the provisions of this Article.<BR>

<P>(a) The Parties shall be bound by and implement such plan for release and transfer of all prisoners as may be developed by the ICRC, after consultation with the Parties.<BR>

<P>(b) The Parties shall cooperate fully with the ICRC and facilitate its work in implementing and monitoring the plan for release and transfer of prisoners.<BR>

<P>(c) No later than thirty (30) days after the Transfer of Authority, the Parties shall release and transfer all prisoners held by them.<BR>

<P>(d) In order to expedite this process, no later than twenty-one (21) days after this Annex enters into force, the Parties shall draw up comprehensive lists of prisoners and shall provide such lists to the ICRC, to the other Parties, and to the Joint Military Commission and the High Representative. These lists shall identify prisoners by nationality, name, rank (if any) and any internment or military serial number, to the extent applicable.<BR>

<P>(e) The Parties shall ensure that the ICRC enjoys full and unimpeded access to all places where prisoners are kept and to all prisoners. The Parties shall permit the ICRC to privately interview each prisoner at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to his or her release for the purpose of implementing and monitoring the plan, including determination of the onward destination of each prisoner.<BR>

<P>(f) The Parties shall take no reprisals against any prisoner or his/her family in the event that a prisoner refuses to be transferred.<BR>

<P>(g) Notwithstanding the above provisions, each Party shall comply with any order or request of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia for the arrest, detention, surrender of or access to persons who would otherwise be released and transferred under this Article, but who are accused of violations within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Each Party must detain persons reasonably suspected of such violations for a period of time sufficient to permit appropriate consultation with Tribunal authorities.<BR>

<P>2. In those cases where places of burial, whether individual or mass, are known as a matter of record, and graves are actually found to exist, each Party shall permit graves registration personnel of the other Parties to enter, within a mutually agreed period of time, for the limited purpose of proceeding to such graves, to recover and evacuate the bodies of deceased military and civilian personnel of that side, including deceased prisoners.<BR>

<P><B><I>Annex 7: </I></B><B>Agreement on Refugees and Displaced Persons</B><BR>

<P>Article III, para. 2:<I> Cooperation with International Organizations and International Monitoring</I><BR>

<P>2. The Parties shall give full and unrestricted access by UNHCR, the International Committee of the Red Cross (&quot;ICRC&quot;), the United Nations Development Programme (&quot;UNDP&quot;), and other relevant international, domestic and non-governmental organizations to all refugees and displaced persons, with a view to facilitating the work of those organizations in tracing persons, the provision of medical assistance, food distribution, reintegration assistance, the provision of temporary and permanent housing, and other activities vital to the discharge of their mandates and operational responsibilities without administrative impediments. These activities shall include traditional protection functions and the monitoring of basic human rights and humanitarian conditions, as well as the implementation of the provisions of this Chapter.<BR>

<P>Article V: <I>Persons Unaccounted For</I><BR>

<P>The Parties shall provide information through the tracing mechanisms of the ICRC on all persons unaccounted for. The Parties shall also cooperate fully with the ICRC in its efforts to determine the identities, whereabouts and fate of the unaccounted for.<BR>

<H2>XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja:  bolet&iacute;n diario n 1</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>Domingo, 3 de diciembre de 1995:  ceremonia de apertura de la XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja </B></H4>
<P>
<P>La Conferencia se inaugur&oacute; el 3 de diciembre, en Ginebra, en presencia de unos mil delegados, que representaban a m&aacute;s de 100 Estados Partes en los Convenios de Ginebra y a m&aacute;s de 140 Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja.<BR>

<P>El Pr&iacute;ncipe Botho de Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein, Presidente de la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, hizo un llamamiento a todos los gobiernos, para que apoyen la labor del Movimiento y sus esfuerzos por realzar la eficacia de la ayuda humanitaria.<BR>

<P>El Presidente del Comit&eacute; Internacional de la Cruz Roja, Sr. Cornelio Sommaruga, destac&oacute; la necesidad de contener el desencadenamiento de la violencia, para prevenir y mitigar el sufrimiento de las v&iacute;ctimas de los conflictos armados y de las cat&aacute;strofes naturales. El Presidente del CICR estim&oacute; que la &uacute;nica forma de conseguir este objetivo es mediante el restablecimiento de un respeto m&aacute;s riguroso de los derechos humanos y del derecho internacional humanitario.<BR>

<P>El Sr. Mario Villarroel Lander, Presidente de la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, declar&oacute; que la XXVI Conferencia Internacional representaba una ocasi&oacute;n &uacute;nica para revalorizar los Principios Fundamentales del Movimiento, infundirles un nuevo impulso y acrecentar el respeto por la dignidad humana. El orador rindi&oacute; homenaje a los 130 millones de voluntarios que, a trav&eacute;s del mundo, trabajan sin tregua para aplicar los ideales de Henry Dunant, es decir, prevenir y aliviar en cualquier circunstancia, el sufrimiento de cualquier ser humano, y proteger la vida y la salud en tiempos de guerra y en otras situaciones de emergencia.<BR>

<P>El Sr. Kaspar Villiger, Presidente de la Confederaci&oacute;n Suiza, en nombre del pa&iacute;s anfitri&oacute;n, di&oacute; la bienvenida a todos los participantes. Exhort&oacute; a los gobiernos a que movilizaran todos sus recursos a fin de mejorar la condici&oacute;n de las v&iacute;ctimas en todo el mundo e intensificaran su apoyo a las organizaciones humanitarias.<BR>

<P>El Sr. Olivier Vodoz, Presidente del Consejo de Estado de la Rep&uacute;blica y del cant&oacute;n de Ginebra, agradeci&oacute; a los delegados su compromiso inquebrantable, su coraje y su determinaci&oacute;n en el combate que libran por el respeto de los principios universales en todo el mundo.<BR>

<P>En la ceremonia de apertura se present&oacute; un espect&aacute;culo audiovisual en el que se mostraron im&aacute;genes desgarradoras que ilustraban las principales causas del sufrimiento humano: la guerra, el cautiverio, las cat&aacute;strofes naturales, las epidemias, la exclusi&oacute;n social, todos padecimientos indecibles que las organizaciones humanitarias procuran aliviar.<BR>

<P>A continuaci&oacute;n de esas im&aacute;genes se hizo una lectura solemne de los Principios Fundamentales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja y se presentaron testimonios conmovedores sobre la condici&oacute;n de las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra.<BR>

<P>Un grupo de j&oacute;venes discapacitados noruegos, reunidos en el grupo Dissimilis, ofrecieron su m&uacute;sica y sus canciones a los delegados, demostrando de esta forma la dignidad fundamental de todo ser humano, mientras que la orquesta y los coros de distintas escuelas secundarias de Ginebra realzaron la ceremonia con fragmentos de Prokofiev y Haendel.<BR>

<P><B>Este bolet&iacute;n s&oacute;lo tiene car&aacute;cter informativo y no constituye un documento oficial.</B><BR>

<H4><B>Segunda reuni&oacute;n de asesores jur&iacute;dicos de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja,</B><B><I> </I></B><B>Ginebra, 6-7 de marzo de 1995</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Organizada conjuntamente por el CICR y por la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional de Sociedades de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, tuvo lugar, en Ginebra, los d&iacute;as 6 y 7 de marzo de 1995, una segunda reuni&oacute;n de asesores jur&iacute;dicos de las Sociedades Nacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja.[1]<BR>

<P>Los asesores de unas 20 Sociedades Nacionales y los encargados de los asuntos relativos a la XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja examinaron, el primer d&iacute;a de la reuni&oacute;n, las recomendaciones del Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos para la Protecci&oacute;n de las V&iacute;ctimas de la Guerra, congregado del 23 al 27 de enero de 1995.[2]<BR>

<P>En la reuni&oacute;n, presidida por el se&ntilde;or Yves Sandoz, director de Doctrina, Derecho y Relaciones con el Movimiento, los participantes se congratularon de que se haya reafirmado el cometido del Movimiento como promotor y defensor del derecho internacional humanitario (DIH) y como asesor en cuestiones relativas a la aplicaci&oacute;n del derecho.  Comprobaron, asimismo, que en las 8 recomendaciones del Grupo de Expertos hay un amplio margen de maniobra para los componentes del Movimiento, que habr&aacute;n de inducir a los Estados a que contin&uacute;en haciendo lo posible por mejorar la aplicaci&oacute;n del derecho.  Adem&aacute;s, los participantes indicaron que la acci&oacute;n del Movimiento no se limita &uacute;nicamente a las recomendaciones de los expertos, y que &eacute;ste pod&iacute;a emprender actividades en &aacute;mbitos que requirieran mayor estudio, como el sistema de informes obligatorios, por parte de los Estados, sobre la aplicaci&oacute;n del DIH o la difusi&oacute;n del mismo.<BR>

<P>Gracias al debate sobre las recomendaciones del Grupo de Expertos pudieron clarificarse los siguientes puntos esenciales:<BR>

<P>- Las Sociedades Nacionales est&aacute;n llamadas a desempe&ntilde;ar un importante cometido por  lo que respecta a la adhesi&oacute;n universal a los instrumentos del DIH; pueden perfectamente asesorar al respectivo Gobierno acerca de la misi&oacute;n y de la competencia de la Comisi&oacute;n Internacional de Encuesta.<BR>

<P>- El CICR, asistido por las Sociedades Nacionales y por la Federaci&oacute;n, as&iacute; como por entidades acad&eacute;micas, ha de potenciar su capacidad para prestar servicios consultivos a los Estados en sus esfuerzos por aplicar y difundir el DIH. Se prestar&aacute;n dichos servicios previo asenso del destinatario.<BR>

<P>- En el &aacute;mbito de la difusi&oacute;n, los expertos de las Sociedades Nacionales dijeron que el CICR podr&iacute;a desarrollar directamente los conocimientos de DIH de las organizaciones internacionales y de las instituciones y de los organismos especializados o incitarles a desarrollar los conocimientos que ya tengan.  En cualquier caso, es necesario hacer un gran esfuerzo por lo que ata&ntilde;e a la formaci&oacute;n de las fuerzas de mantenimiento de la paz.<BR>

<P>Las Sociedades Nacionales son los relevos naturales del CICR, y ha de coordinarse con el CICR el apoyo que reciben de la Federaci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>Por lo que respecta al cometido de la difusi&oacute;n en la prevenci&oacute;n de los conflictos, el Movimiento habr&aacute; de examinar las modalidades de una estrategia que se centre en los valores humanitarios en los que se basa el DIH, y estudiar los medios y los m&eacute;todos de transmitir tales valores en diversas partes del mundo, habida cuenta de los contextos culturales.<BR>

<P>- Los expertos de las Sociedades Nacionales reafirmaron la importancia de las Comisiones Nacionales encargadas de facilitar y de coordinar tanto la aplicaci&oacute;n como la difusi&oacute;n del DIH. Sin embargo, conviene procurar que la participaci&oacute;n de organizaciones no gubernamentales cuyos principios de acci&oacute;n pueden diferir de los del Movimiento no induzca a error a los Gobiernos y no origine confusiones.<BR>

<P>El Gobierno suizo, como depositario de los Convenios de Ginebra, organizar&aacute;, peri&oacute;dicamente, reuniones de los Estados Partes para examinar los problemas generales que plantea la aplicaci&oacute;n del DIH. Se prev&eacute; alternar tales reuniones con las de las Conferencias internacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, y que en ellas se aborde exclusivamente la aplicaci&oacute;n del derecho. Los expertos de las Sociedades Nacionales insistieron en la necesidad de coordinar la organizaci&oacute;n de todas esas reuniones.<BR>

<P>El segundo d&iacute;a, se trataron los asuntos relativos a la preparaci&oacute;n de la XXVI Conferencia, especialmente las propuestas de acciones que<B> </B>habr&aacute;n<B> </B>de emprender los componentes del Movimiento para garantizar el &eacute;xito.  Asimismo, los participantes revisaron los puntos del orden del d&iacute;a provisional de la Conferencia y examinaron c&oacute;mo pueden cooperar las Sociedades Nacionales en la preparaci&oacute;n de la Conferencia movilizando a sus miembros y realizando gestiones ante el respectivo Gobierno.<BR>

<P>En el orden del d&iacute;a provisional de la Conferencia, presentado por el CICR y la Federaci&oacute;n, figuraban los siguientes puntos principales:<BR>

<P><I>1) Comisi&oacute;n I</I><BR>

<P>- Informe del Gobierno suizo acerca de las recomendaciones del Grupo de Expertos para la protecci&oacute;n de las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra.<BR>

<P>- Protecci&oacute;n de la poblaci&oacute;n civil durante los conflictos armados y otras cuestiones de actualidad.<BR>

<P><I>2) Comisi&oacute;n II</I><BR>

<P>- Principios e intervenci&oacute;n en la asistencia internacional y en la protecci&oacute;n humanitaria.<BR>

<P>- Potenciaci&oacute;n de la aptitud para ayudar y proteger a los m&aacute;s vulnerables.<BR>

<P>Los expertos hicieron propuestas puntuales acerca de este orden d&iacute;a, para el que se han de tener en cuenta tanto las prioridades humanitarias como los intereses de los Estados. Se&ntilde;alaron, particularmente, que es fundamental que el Movimiento se presente como un frente unido, para demostrar que est&aacute; en condiciones de contribuir significativamente a solucionar los problemas de &iacute;ndole humanitaria,<BR>

<P>El presidente de la reuni&oacute;n recogi&oacute; estos prop&oacute;sitos en sus conclusiones, invitando a las Sociedades Nacionales a abordar la Conferencia positiva y constructivamente, evitando dar a los Estados la impresi&oacute;n de que el Movimiento considera la Conferencia como una ocasi&oacute;n para el enfrentamiento.  Es esencial que la Conferencia siga siendo un gran foro humanitario donde todos los participantes demuestren que est&aacute;n dispuestos a ayudarse mutuamente para defender la causa de las v&iacute;ctimas.<BR>

<P><I>La Revista </I>volver&aacute; a informar, en uno de los pr&oacute;ximos n&uacute;meros, sobre la preparaci&oacute;n de la Conferencia Internacional y, particularmente, sobre el orden del d&iacute;a que, en principio, preparar&aacute; la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja en la reuni&oacute;n que celebrar&aacute; los d&iacute;as 1 y 2 de mayo de 1995<BR>

<H2>Introduction Latin America</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Once again in 1994, the ICRC placed preventive measures aimed at limiting the suffering of conflict victims high on its agenda in Latin America. One way of doing this is to increase the emergency preparedness of National Societies. During the year the ICRC worked closely with two National Societies facing new conflict-related challenges. The Mexican Red Cross was active from the very beginning of the insurrection in Chiapas, working hand in hand with the ICRC throughout the year to ensure the neutrality of protected areas, to provide medical care for people in the affected region and to distribute relief assistance to needy displaced people. In Haiti too the ICRC worked closely with the National Society, ensuring that its ambulance service and staff were prepared to act in case of need.<BR>

<P>The protection of civilians and detainees affected by the internal violence in Colombia and Peru remained the major thrust of the ICRC's two largest operations in the region. With conflict-related needs in Peru changing in 1994, the ICRC shifted the focus of its activities to the growing number of detainees. In Colombia, the efforts of past years began to show results as the ICRC gained the confidence of a greater proportion of conflict victims. The delegation in Colombia was thus able to extend its activities in 1994, opening an office in the Uraba region and another east of Bucaramanga.<BR>

<P>As in the past, spreading knowledge of humanitarian law was an important aspect of the ICRC's work. In March the ICRC's dissemination delegate in Colombia, with the help of the delegate for dissemination to the armed forces and the regional delegate based in Buenos Aires, organized a course for 20 military instructors from nine countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela) at the military club in Bogot&aacute;. In addition, major dissemination efforts continued in Colombia and Peru, where the ICRC had its largest operations, and the regional delegations in Buenos Aires, Brasilia and Guatemala City continued to disseminate and promote humanitarian law throughout the continent.<BR>

<H2>The contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the development of the humanitarian ideal in warfare </H2>
<P><I>By the late Professor Emeritus Colonel G.I.A.D. Draper, OBE</I>
<P>
<P>
<P><I>Gerald Draper (1914-1989) was the foremost specialist in humanitarian law of his generation in the United Kingdom, and was well-respected in the law of war community worldwide. He was a Military Prosecutor in the war crimes trials in Germany after the Second World War, and following his retirement from the Army Legal Staff became a distinguished academic, finishing as Professor of Law at the University of Sussex. Draper was a delegate to many International Conferences of the Red Cross as well as to the Diplomatic Conference which drafted the Additional Protocols of 1977.</I><BR>

<P><I>Professor Colonel Draper had a special interest in the development of the law of war, and in inter-faith dialogue. His interest in Emperor Asoka perhaps reflected his own belief in universal humanitarian principles transcending different traditions. Asoka's specific relevance to contemporary international humanitarian law may be seen in his concern for conquered &quot;border peoples&quot; living under what might now be termed &quot;occupation&quot;; the impartiality of humanitarian provision extending to all peoples, including those of other religions and cultures; and the recognition of the need for personnel to monitor and supervise the implementation of the publicized norms. Asoka, like Draper, was concerned both with moral values and with the pragmatic exigencies of human life and misfortune.</I><BR>

<P>An edited collection of selected works of Gerald Draper on the law of war, entitled <B>Reflections on Law and Armed Conflict</B>, is being prepared for publication.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>A. The Maurya Empire: significance</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The Maurya Empire forms part of India's past and marks a unique phase in its brilliance and splendour. It lasted for over a century (321-185 BC) and is to be regarded as one of the great civilizations of all time. Apart from its magnificence, and despite the controversy and uncertainty surrounding many of the actions and achievements of its rulers, this empire and, in particular, one of its rulers, are historically significant in their remarkable moral and humanitarian legacy to mankind.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>B. Emergence and establishment</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The Maurya Dynasty (321-185 BC) emerged following the withdrawal of Alexander the Great from India in 325 BC, when the dynasty's founder, Emperor Chandragupta, seized the throne of the Nanda Dynasty at Magadha (South Bihar), the leading kingdom of Upper India at the time. After Alexander's withdrawal from India, Chandragupta defeated Alexander's General, Seleucus Nicator, and a vast area of the territory originally conquered by Alexander in India was ceded to Chandragupta by the General in return for five hundred elephants. The cession was followed by the conclusion of a treaty of alliance and friendship, and eventually the General and the Emperor cemented their friendship by intermarriage between their families.<BR>

<P>One outcome of this treaty of alliance and friendship was the sending of a Greek ambassador, Megasthenes, by Nicator to Chandragupta's court. During his residence, Megasthenes wrote detailed reports of life at the court and of the organization of the Maurya Empire. Unfortunately his reports are lost, but fragments of them are repeated in other Greek writings which have survived. Through them, some precious details of the Maurya Dynasty, the Royal Court, the capital city and the remarkable system of government of the empire are known.[1]<BR>

<P>Chandragupta reigned for twenty-four years (321-297 BC) before abdicating his throne in favour of his son, Bundusara. His system of government continued under Bundusara, who left no noticeable mark upon the empire. Bundusara was succeeded by his son, Asoka, in 273 BC, although, as was usual, Asoka was not consecrated as Emperor until 265 BC.<BR>

<P>The system of government founded by Chandragupta lasted for about ninety years (322-231 BC). It was an absolute monarchy - a case of pure despotism - with the seat of government in Patiliputra (modern Patna), which, according to Megasthenes, was a city of dazzling magnificence. The Maurya Empire was roughly commensurate with that of British India of the early 20th century, but excluding the territory below Madras and excluding what is now Sri Lanka. The standing army was enormous: in Asoka's time, it consisted of 600,000 infantry, 130,000 cavalry, and 9,000 elephants attended by 36,000 men, together with many thousands of chariots and charioteers, all strictly controlled by six different boards of government. The size of this force must be remembered when considering the scale of the warfare of the day, and the casualties and losses that could result. With an army of this size at his disposal, Asoka's power was absolute.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>C. Emperor Asoka's conquest of the Kalingas and subsequent remorse</B></H4>
<P>
<P>With the capability for waging war that he inherited and augmented, Asoka defeated the three Kalinga kingdoms (modern Orissa) in about 256 BC - the sixteenth year of his reign and the eighth after his consecration. Historical evidence - consisting of little other than the surviving thirty-four edicts[2]- does not reveal why he went to war with the Kalingas. However, one of his edicts - the famous Thirteenth Edict or &quot;Rock Edict&quot;, also known as the &quot;Conquest Edict&quot;, of 257 BC -, declared that the victory was overwhelming and losses among the defeated peoples were particularly devastating: his army took 150,000 people captive and slew 100,000, and many times that number died in the conquest.[3]<BR>

<P><I>&quot; . . . one hundred and fifty thousand persons were . . . carried away captive, one hundred thousand were . . . slain, and many times that number died . . . [I]f the hundredth part or the thousandth part were now to suffer the same fate, it would be a matter of regret. ...&quot;</I><BR>
From Edict XIII, circa 257 BC.<BR>

<P>Asoka was at pains to declaim in this edict that the casualties, privations and suffering of the defeated Kalingas caused him &quot;profound sorrow&quot; and &quot;regret&quot;, &quot;because&quot;, he said, &quot;the conquest of a country previously unconquered involves the slaughter, death and carrying away captive of the people. That is a matter of profound sorrow and regret to His Sacred Majesty&quot;.[4] No note of elation can be detected in the edict, and no attempt was made to vindicate his military action or the resulting carnage: the silent moral premise was that all destruction of life, human and animal, and all suffering and privation - no matter how small the scale - are regrettable and to be avoided.[5]<BR>

<P>There was, however, another reason for Asoka's feeling of &quot;still more regret&quot;, he said, &quot;inasmuch as the Brahmins and ascetics, or men of other denominations, or householders who dwell there, and among whom these duties are practised, to wit:- harkening to superiors, harkening to father and mother, harkening to teachers and elders, and proper treatment of (or courtesy to) friends, acquaintances, comrades, relatives, slaves and servants, with steadfastness of devotion - to these befall violence (or injury) or slaughter or separation from their loved ones. Or violence happens to the friends, acquaintances, comrades, and relatives of those who are themselves well protected, while their affection (for those injured) continues undiminished. Thus for them also that is a mode of violence and the share of this [violence] distributed among all men is a matter of regret to His Sacred Majesty, because it never is the case that faith in some one denomination or another does not exist&quot;.[6]<BR>

<P>In this edict, Asoka discloses a truly remarkable degree of religious tolerance and of heightened sensitivity to the suffering - even indirect suffering - of all, especially of the righteous, regardless of their religion or denomination.[7] For a mighty Emperor who had only recently won a major victory in war, these are very noble and enlightened sentiments; although, realistically, such sentiments would be of little avail if he did not have absolute power over his peoples.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>D. Conversion to Buddhism and the inculcation of the Law of Piety</B></H4>
<P>
<P>From the time of his victory over the Kalingas in 256 BC, and the consequent remorse, until the end of his reign in 232 BC, Asoka never waged another war. Indeed, in the years following his victory, he spent time piously retracing the steps of the Buddha and raising stupas inscribed with moral injunctions and imperatives at holy places of pilgrimage; and for some two years he became a member of a Buddhist order without relinquishing his role as Emperor.<BR>

<P>His conversion to Buddhism, effected with the help of his own teacher, Upragupta, was gradual. Even though he did little to change the system of government he inherited, he introduced a novel and powerful moral idealism - a moral rule or &quot;way of life&quot; in the Buddhist sense as he understood it - which he called the &quot;Law of Piety&quot;. This law, though following the tenets of the Buddha, was distinct from them and peculiar to Asoka. It was to become one of the great turning points of the civilization of the East, having profound effects throughout the neighbouring kingdoms, not least in India itself and in Sri Lanka, and reaching China and Greece.<BR>

<P>The Law of Piety consisted in moral imperatives requiring that reverence be paid to all to whom it was due, especially to one's superiors, parents, teachers, elders and relations. The imperatives of the Law of Piety required that respect be shown for the sanctity of all animate life, human and animal; they also required humane and just treatment of all, including backward and uncivilized peoples both inside and outside the empire. There were injunctions and prohibitions against vices such as envy, indolence and injustice in relation to and affecting the administration of the empire. In short, the imperatives and prohibitions of the Law of Piety formed a network of righteous relationships between all sentient and animate beings, affecting public, social and familial relationships, and affecting relationships between peoples of different levels of development and between humans and animals. No one was outside its ambit, not even Asoka or the Empress: censors were appointed to ensure that the Law of Piety was observed even in the latter's apartments in the Palace. The Law of Piety was a moral law, an imperial law, a law governing foreign relations and a way of life. At the epicentre of the network was Emperor Asoka himself, who assumed the burden of ensuring the publication and enforcement of this Law.[8]<BR>

<P>The Law of Piety disseminated by Asoka throughout his empire and beyond was not a reasoned moral system; it lacked coherence and the intellectual order normally expected of such a system. In this regard, Asoka cannot be compared with the philosophers of classical Greece. No developed dogma or cogent philosophy can be found in his edicts, neither can any theology, except the implicit acceptance of a world other than that of the material, as revealed in the statement, <I>inter alia</I>, that he regards as bearing much fruit only that which concerns the other world;[9] and the implicit acceptance of the Law of Piety as possessing transcendental validity, as revealed in his statement that, after he had annexed the kingdoms of the Kalingas, he began his &quot;zealous <I>protection</I> of the Law of Piety, his love of that Law and his inculcation of that Law&quot;.[10]<BR>

<P>Asoka drew a comparison between conquest by force of arms and the conquest of the Law of Piety: he called the latter - the conquest of man's heart by the Law of Piety - &quot;the true conquest&quot;, quite unlike military conquests. &quot;Delight&quot;, he said, &quot;is won in the conquest of the Law . . . for this purpose has the scripture of the Law been recorded, in order that my sons and grandsons, who may be, may not think it their duty to make a new conquest. If, perchance, a conquest should please them they should take heed only of patience and gentleness, and regard as a conquest only that which is effected by the Law of Piety. That avails both for this world and the next...&quot;.[11]<BR>

<P><I>&quot;Delight is won in the conquest of the Law [of Piety] . . . [F]or this purpose has the scripture of the Law been recorded, in order that my sons and grandsons . . . may not think it their duty to conquer [militarily] . . . If, perchance, a conquest should please them they should take heed only of patience and gentleness, and regard as a conquest only that which is effected by the Law of Piety.&quot;</I><BR>
From Edict XIII, circa 257 BC.<BR>

<P>His officials were strongly urged to see that justice was done in the administration of the law, so the humanitarianism of the Law of Piety undoubtedly had a salutary effect on State practices. However, the improvement was relative. The severe criminal law, for example, was not amended, except for the provision that a person condemned to death had three days between sentence and execution for pious meditation and for charitable works by friends. Torture remained normal practice, though Asoka cautioned that sentences must be passed for just causes only: &quot;[If] it happens that some individual incurs imprisonment or torture and when the result is his imprisonment without due cause, many other people are deeply grieved. In such a case you must desire to do justice . . . For this purpose has the scripture been here inscribed in order that the administrators of the town may strive without ceasing that the restraint or torture of the townsmen may not take place without due cause&quot;.[12] Taxation also remained high, at one-quarter of produce and sales.<BR>

<P>The dissemination and inculcation of this Law were carried out by edicts, which were inscribed in beautiful Pali calligraphy upon rock surfaces and pillars of polished sandstone. Thirty-four of them have survived. These edicts stood by the great highways of Asoka's empire so that all who journeyed through his lands could be edified by their message. Their evident repetition was not an oversight, but a reflection of his resolve to inculcate these inflexible principles and to ensure that they were deeply imprinted in the hearts of all who read them.<BR>

<P>It is apparent from the texts of the edicts that Asoka was determined to use to the full the resources at his disposal and the powers of an absolute monarch and despot to proclaim and enforce the Law of Piety. The very despotism that enabled him to lead his army to victory also enabled him to establish a new moral order in his empire and to see to its observance. There is no reasoning, no premise, no invocation of any gods in the edicts: it was sufficient that the calamity suffered by the defeated Kalingas inspired &quot;profound sorrow and regret&quot; in Asoka and led him to introduce a new moral order - one that he had no need of explaining or defending to the reader of the edicts. While he indubitably thought on a universal scale and propounded moral values of great nobility, the system rested upon pure despotism: his imperatives and injunctions were both the law and the complete way of life for his people and the special charge of his officials, on whom there were tremendous despotic pressures to pursue the course he prescribed.<BR>

<P>Public officials adminisering the towns were exhorted by Asoka to carry out his principles assiduously on pain of incurring his displeasure. He pointed out the nexus between bad government and officials who fell short in their observation of the Law of Piety; and he made it clear that he would brook no idleness or injustice, let alone any obstruction of his endeavours. The tenor of the edicts indicates that there were some officials who did not fully heed his moral instructions, and that there were others who defaulted owing to &quot;certain natural dispositions [which] make success . . . impossible, to wit, envy, lack of perseverance, laziness, indolence&quot;. There is evidence, too, that the moral principles expressed in Asoka's Law of Piety met with some opposition in his empire.[13] Evidently the aspirations were too high and the manifold changes expected of human conduct were too abrupt.<BR>

<P>Asoka also exhorted his officials with promises of reward and threats of sanctions, both in this world and in the next, to administer with justice and patience those beyond the pale - those recently brought under his rule by the annexation of the three Kalinga kingdoms and the &quot;unsubdued border-dwellers&quot;. Such officials&quot;, he said, &quot;are in a position to make these people trust [him] and to ensure their prosperity both in this world and in the next ...&quot;. The aim was compassionate administration and to have them, too, observe the Law of Piety:<BR>

<P>&quot;All men are my children'; and, just as I desire for my children that they may enjoy every kind of prosperity and happiness both in this world and in the next, so also I desire the same for all men.<BR>

<P>&quot;In regard to the unsubdued borderers . . . the King desires that they . . . should not be afraid of [him], that they should trust [him] . . . the King will bear patiently with [them] and that for [the King's] sake they should follow the Law of Piety and so gain both this world and the next.<BR>

<P>&quot;By instructing and intimating my will, my inflexible resolve and promise, I [the King] shall be provided with (trained) local officials for this business, because you are in a position to make these people trust me and to ensure their prosperity both in this world and in the next, and by so doing, you may win heaven and also effect my release from debt.<BR>

<P>&quot;And for this purpose has this scripture of the Law of Piety been written here, in order that the High Officers may strive without ceasing, both to ensure the confidence of these borderers and to set them moving on the path of piety ...&quot;.[14]<BR>

<P>Even those well and truly beyond the pale - the &quot;forest folk&quot; - were not excluded from just and humane treatment and the benefits of the Law of Piety. Upon &quot;the forest folk in his dominions&quot;, Asoka said, he &quot;looks kindly, and he seeks to make them think (aright) for (otherwise) repentance would come upon His Sacred Majesty. They are bidden to turn from their (evil) ways that they be not chastised. Because His Sacred Majesty desires for all animate beings security, control, peace of mind and joyousness&quot;.[15]<BR>

<P>In these edicts, relating to the duties of officials in regard to the border tribes and forest folk, Asoka can be seen as, at once, a despot, a moral reformer, a missionary and a teacher of a way of life; the edicts reveal a sense of universality of affection for all people - an early form of humanitarianism which is not limited to war.<BR>

<P>It is also clear from the edicts that he sent large numbers of missionaries to places as far afield as Greece and China, &quot;among all his neighbours as far as six hundred leagues, where the king of the Greeks named Antiochos dwells, and to the north of that Antiochos (where dwell) the four kings named severally Ptolemy, Antigonos, Megas, and Alexander (likewise) in the south, the Cholos and Pandyos as far as the Tamraparni river - and here, too, in the King's dominions - among the Greeks, Kambojas, the Nabhapantis of Nabhaka; among the Bojas, Pitinikas; Andhras and Pulindas - everywhere they follow the instruction of His Sacred Majety in the Law of Piety. Even where the envoys of His Sacred Majesty do not penetrate, these people, too, hearing His Sacred Majesty's ordinance based upon the Law of Piety and his instruction in that Law, practise, and will practise the Law&quot;.[16] As well as all the neighbouring States and the remainder of India not governed by him, Asoka's missionaries brought Sri Lanka into the Buddhist fold.<BR>

<P>One of the most radical of Asoka's reforms was the almost total prohibition on hunting and slaying of animals for food. He abolished the tradition in the royal kitchen of slaughtering one peacock each day. Even the famous Royal hunting parties, during which the complete Royal Court, the harem, the officials and servants went to hunt for several weeks, were curbed. For these hunts, large areas of the forest were marked off with coloured ribbons for the royal progress; all strangers found within the limits of the royal route were liable to the death penalty, probably, as was ordinary criminal practice, preceded by mutilation. Asoka stopped these and all other hunting expeditions because animal life, like human life, was sacred. He went so far as to provide for the establishment of hospitals on the highways of his empire for the care of sick and injured people <I>and</I> of their beasts of burden. In typical Asoka fashion, edictal orders were issued for his officials to enforce the hunting prohibitions at the same time as they were instructed to observe, and to monitor the observance of, other aspects of his Law of Piety. This prohibition of animal slaughter corresponded to Asoka's moral revulsion for human slaughter in warfare and his subsequent abhorrence of any killing and suffering.<BR>

<P>The intensity of Asoka's moral fervour in these edicts is as evident as his officials' failure in implementing them. Such lofty moral instructions could not have been easily carried out. Asoka continued to uphold and ensure the implementation of his Law of Piety until the end of his reign; his undistinguished descendants, however, were unable to sustain his moral mission and the Law of Piety lost its vigour. After his death in 231 BC the empire was divided, its power declined and the Law of Piety passed into history.<BR>

<P>The Maurya Dynasty under Emperor Asoka's idealism underwent a profound moral transformation at court, in official life, and in the basis of all relationships throughout his extensive dominions and beyond. It witnessed the elevation of Buddhism from a sect in India to one of the great religions of the world, affecting and becoming part of the course of history of Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Japan, Tibet and, to a lesser extent, China. In unfolding humanitarian principles Emperor Asoka's pioneering and precocious ideals and his lofty moral legacy, transcending place and time, rank him among the foremost moral teachers and among the greatest civilizing influences in human history.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>E. Emperor Asoka: fact and legend</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Historical evidence relating to Emperor Asoka's life and words consists of legends and the texts of the thirty-four edicts, inscribed on rock surfaces, which have survived. There is little else.<BR>

<P>Of Asoka's early career it is known, for example, that before he became Emperor, during the lifetime of his father, Bundusara, he held the important office of Viceroy of Vyjirin, the main provincial capital. This was the normal practice of the Maurya Dynasty - one to be expected in an absolute and despotic monarchy - whereby the prince was groomed and given an apprenticeship by his father.<BR>

<P>Knowledge of Asoka's later career is derived principally from the thirty-four edicts. While they do not disclose the reason for war with the Kalingas, the &quot;Conquest Edict&quot; does announce his victory over them and his subsequent remorse and protection of the Law of Piety. Other edicts issue instructions for implementation and enforcement of this Law and record his dispatch of missionaries and his pious retracing of the footsteps of the Buddha. Beyond this, there is litte historical information.<BR>

<P>Not enough evidence has survived to allow the development of the Law of Piety and its contents to be traced. It is clear that Buddhist ideas must have played a major part in the moral order which Asoka chose to govern his way of life and that of his empire, but as the Law of Piety is obviously not a crib from Buddhism, the question - the unanswerable question - arises regarding the extent to which his experience of the conquest of the Kalingas determined the nature and content of his moral ideas, as contradistinguished from the main canon of Buddhism.<BR>

<P>Some legends surrounding Asoka's life and works are inconsistent with other historical evidence. In Sri Lanka, for example, unsubstantiated legends depict him as an evil man who secured the death of his brothers. While fables of an evil early life could be true, as they would not be inconsistent with his gradual and undramatic adoption of Buddhism and the slow movement towards the Law of Piety which is seen in his edicts, doubts remain about the verity of these legends owing to the lack of corroborating historical evidence. However, it is also thought that stories of fratricide and other legends were fabricated to impress upon his subjects the power he held over them as a despot, as well as to impress upon them the innate goodness which made him susceptible to feelings of horror, followed by remorse and regret, when he witnessed the bloodshed of war, rather than feeling joyful at the victory of his army. His moral stature was elevated by his evident transcendence of evil and his transformation into an Emperor of lofty principles after the defeat of the Kalingas. In themselves, these legends probably grew out of the desire to enhance and exaggerate which was common to the legend-history of the era.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>F. Conclusion</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Emperor Asoka was one of the great moral reformers in the history of civilization and a precocious pioneer of humanitarian values. The impetus for his humanitarian work was derived from his gradual conversion to Buddhism following his witnessing of the carnage and suffering in a war in which his army was victorious. A bold and original reformer who thought on a universal scale and propounded moral values of great nobility, he never claimed to be the inventor of those moral principles; indeed, he took them to be self-evident truths of transcendental validity that stood without need of religious or metaphysical support. They were derived from Buddhism but were distinct from it, and unique to him. The Law of Piety prescribed essentially but not exclusively reverence for superiors; compassion for the ignorant, the suffering, the backward and all living creatures; and acceptance of the goodness of those belonging to other faiths and religions. In short, the Law prescribes righteous relationships between all, including a righteous relationship between the Emperor himself (and his Empress) and others.<BR>

<P>Asoka was primarily concerned with the pragmatic and daily affairs of mankind, holding that those same principles that guide righteous conduct in the affairs of this world will bring forth benefit in the next. His edicts made no reference to nirvana or &quot;karma&quot;, yet it is clear that the other world was as important as, if not more important than, this one.<BR>

<P>Defects in his moral ardour are apparent: the Law of Piety was both the morality and the law - the complete way of life - for all, and was enforced using all the despotic means at Asoka's disposal throughout his empire. He brooked no resistance; and any lack of enthusiasm in observing the Law incurred his displeasure. Humanity in the administration of the criminal law was not apparent, although in relation to previous regimes there was less brutality.<BR>

<P>Comparison with other notable converts reveals Asoka's true stature. Unlike Pharaoh Akhenaton of the 18th Dynasty (14th century BC), Asoka was not a mere believer: he was active and relentlessly pursued the effective dissemination and observance of his Law of Piety. Some writers have compared Aska with Constantine the Great and with St. Paul in that he was a combination of an Emperor convert and the foremost missionary of his special form of Buddhism. However, Asoka never underwent a dramatic, traumatic experience or conversion such as that of St. Paul on the road to Damascus. The analogy with Constantine the Great is false. Constantine did not cease to wage wars after the Edict of Milan of 313 AD, nor was he the author of Christianity; in fact he was a late and hesitant convert to Christianity. There were already many Christians in the Roman Empire before Constantine promulgated the Edict. Constantine, in a word, came late and slowly to the Christian faith. By contrast, Asoka boldly established his own Law of Piety, and used his position as an absolute monarch to impose it upon his subjects. A similarity exists between the two Emperors in that both of them made their religious and moral beliefs the official religion and morality of their respective empires. There was nothing of the missionary or pioneering moral teacher in Constantine, but such were the attributes for which Asoka will be remembered. The comparison of Asoka with Constantine the Great is by way of contrast: Asoka stands out in history as a mighty missionary Emperor and a moral teacher of a stature greater than was ever achieved by Constantine the Great.<BR>

<P>More significant, in the present context, than his legacy of a just and more humane administration of a very large empire, his assiduous dissemination of lofty moral values and Buddhism, and his vigorous cultivation of heightened moral sensitivity among his subjects and officials, is his legacy to the humanitarian ideal in warfare; for the ultimate humanitarian ideal in warfare is that it should not happen. After witnessing the sufferings of the defeated Kalingas, Asoka found he could not reconcile the Buddhist tenet of the sanctity of all animate life with recourse to war, so much so that he even terminated the tradition of the Royal Hunt and, indeed, banned the killing of animals. He never again engaged in a military campaign and he sought, through edicts permanently inscribed on rock surfaces, to deter his sons and grandsons from so doing and urged them to &quot;take heed only of patience and gentleness, and regard as a conquest only that which is effected by the Law of Piety&quot;.[17]  Respect for all living creatures was not peculiar to Asoka, but its nexus with warfare was a novel moral teaching. Conquest in war was replaced by the conquest effected by the Law of Piety; and the ultimate good towards which all must strive was decreed to be the conquest of this Law. This startling thought, transcending time and place, was nothing less than a precocious realization of humanitarian values in the Indian subcontinent in the middle of the third century before Christ. The distinguishing features of the Law ofPiety - that war should be abhorred; that heightened sensitivity to the suffering of others, including animals, should be cultivated; that lofty and religiously neutral but universal moral values which transcend different religions should be diligently pursued and realized - give Asoka a valid claim to being a precocious, pioneering and dedicated advocate of the humanitarian principles which today characterize the regimes of human rights and the humanitarian law of war.<BR>

<P>
<P>* Collated and edited with some revision by Michael A. Meyer, Charles Henn and Hilaire McCoubrey from Professor Draper's notes for a lecture on &quot;The Contribution of the Emperor Asoka Maurya to the Early Development of the Humanitarian Approach to Warfare&quot;, which he delivered on 29 November 1982 at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand; and from his notes for a lecture on &quot;The Emperor Asoka Maurya and the Establishment of the Law of Piety&quot;, which he delivered on 1 December 1982 at the Siam Society in Bangkok.<BR>

<P>1. It is known, for example, that Chandragupta relied much upon his trusted adviser, a Brahmin Minister of State - one Chanaky - who had been a perfume seller. The latter rendered the Emperor considerable assistance and skill in devising the Maurya system of government.<BR>

<P>5.  &quot; . . . One hundred and fifty thousand persons were . . . carried away captive, one hundred thousand were slain, and many times that number died [in the conquest of the Kalingas] . . . So that of all the people that were then slain, done to death . . . if the hundredth part or the thousandth part were now to suffer the same fate, it would be a matter of regret to His Sacred Majesty&quot;. - From Edict XIII, circa 257 BC.<BR>

<P>7.  This is a combination of two Buddhist ideas: first, it is a greater sin to kill or inflict suffering upon a holy or a good person than it is to kill or inflict suffering upon an evil person; secondly, all religions teach people to be good, so there must be no religious persecution [eds.].<BR>

<P>13. &quot;Whatsoever my views are I desire them to be acted on in practice and carried into effect by certain means. And in my opinion the chief means for this purpose are my instructions to you, because you have been set over many thousands of living beings that you may gain the affection of good men . . . You, however, do not grasp this truth to its full extent. Some individual, perchance, pays heed, but to a part only, not the whole. See then to this, for the principle of government is well established . . . it happens that some individual incurs imprisonment or torture and when the result is his imprisonment without due cause, many other people are deeply grieved. In such a case you must desire to do justice. However, with certain natural dispositions success is impossible, to wit, envy, lack of perseverance, laziness, indolence. You [the officials] must desire that such dispositions be not yours. The root of the whole matter lies in perseverance ad patience in applying this principle of government. The indolent man cannot rouse himself to move, yet one must needs move . . . In the same way you must see to your duty, and be told to remember: - See to my commands; such and such are the instructions of His Sacred Majesty.' Fulfilment of these bears great fruit, non-fulfilment brings great calamity. By those who fail neither heaven nor the Royal Favour can be won. Ill performance of this duty can never gain my regard, whereas in fulfilling my instructions you will gain heaven and also pay your debt to me . . . For this purpose has the scripture been here inscribed in order that the administrators of the town may strive without ceasing that the restraint or torture of the townsmen may not take place without due cause. And for this purpose . . . I shall send forth in rotation every five years such persons as are of mild and temperate disposition, and regardful of the sanctity of life, who knowing that this is my purpose will comply with my instructions...&quot; From Edict II, &quot;The Provincial's Edict: The Duties of Officials to the Provincials&quot;, circa 256-255 BC.<BR>

<H4><B>Ouverture de la 26&egrave;me Conf&eacute;rence internationale</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Dans son allocution d'ouverture, le prince Botho zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein a exhort&eacute; les repr&eacute;sentants du Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et des 117 Etats pr&eacute;sents, ainsi que les membres des 50 organisations participant en qualit&eacute; d'observateurs &agrave; la Conf&eacute;rence internationale,  &agrave; faire passer les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts des victimes des conflits et des catastrophes naturelles avant toute autre consid&eacute;ration dans le cadre de leurs discussions des jours &agrave; venir. Concluant sur une note optimiste, le Pr&eacute;sident de la Commission permanente a affirm&eacute; qu'un avenir meilleur &eacute;tait possible, en d&eacute;pit de toutes les difficult&eacute;s &agrave; surmonter.<BR>

<P>L'assembl&eacute;e a ensuite &eacute;lu par acclamation les repr&eacute;sentants officiels de la Conf&eacute;rence, dont les noms &eacute;taient propos&eacute;s par le Pr&eacute;sident du Conseil des D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s sur la base des recommandations formul&eacute;es par la Commission permanente.

<B>Secr&eacute;taires g&eacute;n&eacute;raux adjoints</B> :<BR>
Mme Yolande Camporini, chef du Service de soutien aux organes statutaires, F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge.<BR>
M. Olivier D&uuml;rr, chef de la Division  Doctrine et Relations avec le Mouvement, CICR;<BR>

<P>La Pr&eacute;sidente Astrid Heiberg a rappel&eacute; aux participants que le succ&egrave;s de cette r&eacute;union d&eacute;pendait de chacun d'entre eux et que tous &eacute;taient solidairement responsables de ses r&eacute;sultats. <BR>

<P>MM. Mario Villarroel Lander et Cornelio Sommaruga, Pr&eacute;sidents de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et, respectivement, du Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge, ont ensuite pris la parole pour &eacute;voquer les d&eacute;fis humanitaires au seuil du 21e si&egrave;cle.<BR>

<P>M. Villarroel a invit&eacute; l'assembl&eacute;e &agrave; pr&eacute;parer un monde dans lequel les catastrophes naturelles et celles provoqu&eacute;es par l'homme feraient moins de victimes. Actuellement, a-t-il not&eacute;, leur nombre augmente de 10 millions chaque ann&eacute;e. Comment faire pour r&eacute;duire ces souffrances? D'une part, &agrave; travers une pr&eacute;paration plus efficace aux situations de crise,  d'autre part, &agrave; travers la promotion d'un d&eacute;veloppement durable, autrement dit, en renfor&ccedil;ant la capacit&eacute; des collectivit&eacute;s &agrave; venir en aide aux plus vuln&eacute;rables.<BR>

<P>Un autre &eacute;l&eacute;ment de r&eacute;ponse, a encore not&eacute; le Pr&eacute;sident de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration, r&eacute;side dans l'encouragement du volontariat. Le co&ucirc;t des op&eacute;rations d'assistance est moins &eacute;lev&eacute; et leur efficacit&eacute; est plus grande lorsque l'on peut s'appuyer sur les services de volontaires d&ucirc;ment form&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>Le Mouvement de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge peut jouer un r&ocirc;le de premier plan dans la r&eacute;flexion sur les probl&egrave;mes et enjeux humanitaires, comme les effets des affrontements interethniques, des catastrophes naturelles et des sanctions &eacute;conomiques, qui, trop souvent, frappent des personnes innocentes. Il devrait pouvoir s'exprimer au nom des habitants les plus vuln&eacute;rables de la plan&egrave;te et sa voix devrait &ecirc;tre &eacute;cout&eacute;e par tous les Etats.<BR>

<P>Estimant que la Conf&eacute;rence internationale se r&eacute;unit trop rarement et que le dialogue entre la Croix-Rouge et le Croissant-Rouge et les gouvernements n'est pas suffisant, M. Villarroel a propos&eacute; d'&eacute;tablir un groupe de travail qui se r&eacute;unirait entre les Conf&eacute;rences. Ce groupe serait compos&eacute; de repr&eacute;sentants des Etats et du Mouvement et aurait pour mission de formuler des propositions en vue de la session suivante.<BR>

<P>S'agissant de la question des sanctions et des op&eacute;rations de r&eacute;tablissement de la paix, il n'appartient pas au Mouvement de juger si ces actions sont justifi&eacute;es ou non, mais c'est en revanche son droit et son devoir d'en examiner les cons&eacute;quences humaines. A cet &eacute;gard, le Pr&eacute;sident de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration a sugg&eacute;r&eacute; que soit formul&eacute; un code de conduite universel pour traiter des cons&eacute;quences des situations de catastrophes, &agrave; l'image de celui qui a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;labor&eacute; par la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration en coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres organisations humanitaires. <BR>

<P>Il a ensuite pos&eacute; la question de savoir si le monde a besoin de toutes les organisations internationales qui se consacrent aujourd'hui &agrave; l'action humanitaire et dont les efforts, dans certains cas, font double emploi. Selon M. Villarroel, le CICR, la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration et les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, en restant &eacute;troitement unis, ont la capacit&eacute; d'apporter les solutions requises dans ce domaine et de poser aux Etats les questions pertinentes.<BR>

<P>Le Pr&eacute;sident de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration a insist&eacute; sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de red&eacute;couvrir les valeurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et de nous assurer que l'esprit de compassion est toujours vivant au sein de la communaut&eacute; des hommes, ainsi que de promouvoir sans faille l'application des Principes du Mouvement. Il a conclu en appelant au renforcement des capacit&eacute;s des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et en invitant les Etats &agrave; s'unir avec la Croix-Rouge et le Croissant-Rouge au sein d'un puissant r&eacute;seau mondial, afin de rechercher des solutions aux conflits et de combattre la mis&egrave;re et la vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Prenant ensuite la parole, le Pr&eacute;sident du Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge, M. Cornelio Sommaruga a constat&eacute; que le monde &eacute;tait malade de ses victimes. C'est au nom de ces victimes - et en particulier des victimes de la guerre - qu'il s'est adress&eacute; aux repr&eacute;sentants des Etats et &agrave; ceux du Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge. Ce Mouvement, qui doit agir dans des situations de plus en plus complexes, puise sa force dans sa solidarit&eacute; avec les victimes, qui s'exprime dans les actions compl&eacute;mentaires de ses diverses composantes: Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale, CICR. L'engagement des Gouvernements aux c&ocirc;t&eacute;s du Mouvement est plus que jamais n&eacute;cessaire. Principal forum du d&eacute;bat humanitaire, cette conf&eacute;rence rev&ecirc;t une importance exceptionnelle, et les participants ne doivent pas trahir l'espoir plac&eacute; en eux par les victimes, a encore soulign&eacute; M. Sommaruga.<BR>

<P>Le Pr&eacute;sident du CICR a rappel&eacute; que la distinction traditionnelle entre combattants et non-combattants - sur laquelle repose l'essentiel du droit humanitaire - est insuffisamment respect&eacute;e et que l'adh&eacute;sion &agrave; des normes  &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires d'humanit&eacute; fait souvent d&eacute;faut. Face &agrave; cette violence, le droit humanitaire a &eacute;t&eacute; mis &agrave; l'&eacute;preuve du feu et des passions, notamment lors des drames du Rwanda, de l'ex-Yougoslavie, de l'Afghanistan, du Sri Lanka, de la Somalie, du Soudan, de la Sierra Leone, ainsi que lors des &eacute;v&eacute;nements qui ont suivi l'&eacute;clatement de l'URSS. Pour M. Sommaruga, il faut reconstruire les syst&egrave;mes de valeurs qui sont &agrave; la base de l'id&eacute;e de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge: droit des victimes, droit &agrave; l'assistance, respect de l'action humanitaire.<BR>

<P>Pour que l'action humanitaire soit universellement reconnue et respect&eacute;e, le Pr&eacute;sident du CICR propose un nouveau contrat d'humanit&eacute; , aux termes duquel les Etats et la communaut&eacute; internationale s'engagent &agrave; appuyer sans r&eacute;serve les efforts d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s pour appliquer le droit international humanitaire. Ceci implique notamment:<BR>

<P>*de h&acirc;ter le processus de ratification des instruments existants de droit humanitaire;<BR>

<P>*d'intensifier la diffusion de ce droit:<BR>

<P>*de r&eacute;affirmer qu'il n'est pas admissible que les r&egrave;gles applicables dans les conflits arm&eacute;s internationaux ne le soient pas sur le plan interne et, par l&agrave;-m&ecirc;me, d'appliquer et de faire appliquer l'article 3 des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve;<BR>

<P>*de tout mettre en oeuvre, en cas de violation du droit humanitaire, pour rem&eacute;dier &agrave; de telles situations et pour punir les responsables des infractions graves, comme pr&eacute;vu par les Conventions.<BR>

<P>Enfin, a conclu M. Sommaruga, il faut sauvegarder un espace humanitaire ind&eacute;pendant au sein des conflits arm&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Commission I: victimes de la guerre et respect du</B> <B>droit international humanitaire</B></H4>
<P>
<P>En ouvrant les travaux de la Commission I, le Pr&eacute;sident  a appel&eacute; les d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s &agrave; se concentrer sur la mani&egrave;re de mieux prot&eacute;ger les populations civiles dans les conflits arm&eacute;s et de mieux assurer le respect du droit international humanitaire. &quot;C'est une t&acirc;che gigantesque, qui demande un engagement total&quot;, a soulign&eacute; l'ambassadeur Hisashi Owada.<BR>

<P>Puis il a donn&eacute; la parole au pr&eacute;sident du groupe d'experts intergouvernemental pour la protection des victimes de la guerre. Celui-ci a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; son rapport sur les moyens de promouvoir le plein respect du droit international humanitaire et l'application de ses r&egrave;gles, comme il en avait re&ccedil;u le mandat de la Conf&eacute;rence internationale pour la protection des victimes de la guerre, qui s'est d&eacute;roul&eacute;e &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve en 1993.<BR>

<P>Les experts ont &eacute;labor&eacute; huit recommandations, en insistant sur le caract&egrave;re pragmatique de ces derni&egrave;res. Ils recommandent d'&eacute;tendre le champ d'application du droit international et encouragent le CICR &agrave; poursuivre son dialogue avec les Etats, afin d'obtenir une adh&eacute;sion encore plus grande aux instruments du droit international, notamment aux deux Protocoles additionnels de 1977. Ils souhaitent &eacute;galement une promotion plus intense en faveur de la Commission internationale humanitaire d'&eacute;tablissement des faits, pr&eacute;vue &agrave; l'article 90 du Protocole I additionnel aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949.<BR>

<P>De nos jours, une grande partie des souffrances dont sont victimes les populations civiles est provoqu&eacute;e par des conflits non internationaux. Il convient d'&eacute;tendre l'application du droit international &agrave; ce genre de conflits. Dans cette perspective,  les experts invitent le CICR &agrave; pr&eacute;parer un rapport sur les r&egrave;gles coutumi&egrave;res du droit international applicables aux conflits arm&eacute;s internationaux et non internationaux.<BR>

<P>Le CICR est invit&eacute; &agrave; renforcer les services consultatifs qu'il peut mettre &agrave; la disposition des Etats pour mettre en oeuvre et diffuser le droit international humanitaire, en collaboration avec les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale.<BR>

<P>Les experts encouragent le CICR &agrave; pr&eacute;parer un mod&egrave;le de manuel sur le droit des conflits arm&eacute;s internationaux et non internationaux, afin d'am&eacute;liorer la connaissance du droit international par les forces arm&eacute;es.Quant aux Etats, ils sont invit&eacute;s &agrave; cr&eacute;er des commissions nationales pour aider et conseiller les gouvernements dans la mise en oeuvre et la diffusion du droit international.<BR>

<P>Le pr&eacute;sident du groupe d'experts pr&eacute;cise que la recommandation no. 6 a fait l'objet d'un vif d&eacute;bat. Elle porte sur les rapports p&eacute;riodiques que les gouvernements devraient fournir concernant l'application du droit international dans leur pays. Finalement, les experts sont arriv&eacute;s &agrave; la conclusion qu'il faut favoriser au maximum l'&eacute;change d'informations dans ce domaine.<BR>

<P>Dans leur rapport, les experts rappellent que les Etats ont l'obligation de respecter et de faire respecter le droit international humanitaire en toutes circonstances. Il soulignent que les Etats peuvent agir, conjointement ou s&eacute;par&eacute;ment, en collaboration avec les Nations Unies et conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la Charte des Nations Unies, dans les situations de violations graves du droit international. Les experts encouragent les Etats &agrave; participer activement aux discussions sur la cr&eacute;ation d'un tribunal p&eacute;nal international permanent et d'assurer le fonctionnement des tribunaux ad hoc pour le Rwanda et l'ex-Yougoslavie.<BR>

<P>Enfin, les experts invitent le CICR &agrave; proposer des mesures concr&egrave;tes pour assurer le plein respect du droit international humanitaire et renforcer la protection des groupes les plus vuln&eacute;rables dans les conflits arm&eacute;s: les femmes, les enfants, les r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s et les personnes d&eacute;plac&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>Le repr&eacute;sentant du CICR a lui aussi pr&eacute;sent&eacute; son rapport sur le suivi de la Conf&eacute;rence sur la protection des victimes de la guerre. Il a d&eacute;nonc&eacute; l'escalade de la violence, de l'horreur et de la barbarie dans les conflits arm&eacute;s. Il a rappel&eacute; les ravages terrifiants que provoquent les mines antipersonnel parmi la population civile et a soulign&eacute; que le CICR entend poursuivre sa campagne mondiale de sensibilisation en vue d'une interdiction totale de ces armes.<BR>

<P>Il a soulign&eacute; que les th&egrave;mes inscrits &agrave; l'ordre du jour de cette 26&egrave;me Conf&eacute;rence internationale &eacute;taient d'une actualit&eacute; br&ucirc;lante et qu'il &eacute;tait temps de r&eacute;affirmer avec force la protection due aux victimes de la guerre. Il a demand&eacute; aux d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s de prendre des mesures drastiques pour restaurer l'unit&eacute; des familles s&eacute;par&eacute;es par les hostilit&eacute;s. Et il  a d&eacute;nonc&eacute; la destruction syst&eacute;matique de l'environnement ou les attaques contre les sources d'approvisionnement en eau et en vivres comme &eacute;tant des m&eacute;thodes de guerre redoutables.<BR>

<P>Il a conclu son rapport en d&eacute;clarant que le CICR &eacute;tait pr&ecirc;t &agrave; suivre les recommandations des experts afin de renforcer la protection des victimes de la guerre et d'assurer une meilleure application des principes fondamentaux du droit international humanitaire.<BR>

<P>Pour sa part, le repr&eacute;sentant de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale a soulign&eacute; qu'il &eacute;tait temps de passer &agrave; l'action. Pour all&eacute;ger les souffrances des victimes, il n'est pas  n&eacute;cessaire de modifier le droit existant, il suffit de le faire appliquer, a-t-il fait remarquer, en ajoutant que trop de pays n'appliquaient pas les r&egrave;gles qu'ils &eacute;taient pourtant tenus de respecter en vertu des trait&eacute;s internationaux.<BR>

<P>Il a rappel&eacute; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de d&eacute;fendre avec vigueur les principes de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et a demand&eacute; aux Etats de soutenir de mani&egrave;re inconditionnelle les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales dans leurs efforts pour assurer le respect de la dignit&eacute; humaine en toutes circonstances.<BR>

<P>Les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations dans leur ensemble ont soutenu les recommandations faites par les experts et les propositions du CICR et de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale pour am&eacute;liorer le sort des victimes de la guerre, regrettant parfois que ces propositions ne soient pas plus audacieuses. Plusieurs d&eacute;l&eacute;gations soutiennent la cr&eacute;ation d'une cour p&eacute;nale internationale permanente, pour juger les auteurs de violations du droit international. La plupart ont pr&eacute;conis&eacute; un effort plus grand dans le domaine de la pr&eacute;vention des violations du droit international, en faisant mieux conna&icirc;tre ses r&egrave;gles aupr&egrave;s des forces arm&eacute;es et de la population dans son ensemble. Enfin, la majorit&eacute; des intervenants s'est prononc&eacute;e en faveur de l'interdiction de l'utilisation des mines antipersonnel.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>S&eacute;ance d'ouverture de la Commission II</B></H4>
<P>
<P>La session de la Commission II, consacr&eacute;e aux valeurs humanitaires et &agrave; la r&eacute;ponse aux crises, a d&eacute;but&eacute; par deux allocutions d'ouverture prononc&eacute;es par les repr&eacute;sentants de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration et du CICR. Lady Limerick, Vice-Pr&eacute;sident de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration, a &eacute;voqu&eacute; les millions de r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s et de personnes d&eacute;plac&eacute;es dans le monde et soulign&eacute; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'un &quot;&eacute;quilibre de la coop&eacute;ration&quot; entre les Etats et le Mouvement. Actuellement, un habitant de la plan&egrave;te sur 130 a d&ucirc; fuir son foyer pour une raison ou une autre. L'action humanitaire en faveur de ces populations doit &ecirc;tre guid&eacute;e par des valeurs morales similaires &agrave; celles qui sont contenues dans le Code de conduite, r&eacute;dig&eacute; par la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration en coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres organisations, lequel sera port&eacute; &agrave; l'attention de la Conf&eacute;rence. La neutralit&eacute; et l'impartialit&eacute; de l'action humanitaire doivent &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;serv&eacute;es en toutes circonstances.<BR>
S'agissant de la question des sanctions, Lady Limerick a r&eacute;it&eacute;r&eacute; l'inqui&eacute;tude du Mouvement de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge vis-&agrave;-vis des effets qu'elles comportent pour les plus vuln&eacute;rables. Les Etats peuvent s'attaquer aux causes des conflits, et le Mouvement doit demeurer fort et ind&eacute;pendant, a-t-elle soulign&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Lady Limerick a ensuite relev&eacute; que les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ne sont pas simplement des organisations d'aide ext&eacute;rieure: institutions locales, ce sont des auxiliaires officiellement reconnus des pouvoirs publics de leurs pays respectifs, ce qui les autorise &agrave; mobiliser des ressources aupr&egrave;s de la communaut&eacute; et leur permet d'apporter &agrave; cette derni&egrave;re des services efficaces, &agrave; un co&ucirc;t tr&egrave;s raisonnable. Pour cette raison, il est essentiel qu'elles b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient partout du soutien ferme et constant de leur gouvernement.<BR>

<P>Repr&eacute;sentant le CICR, M. Eric Roethlisberger a soulign&eacute; pour sa part la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de renforcer l'action humanitaire, non seulement au sein du Mouvement, mais aussi parmi les autres organisations. La prolif&eacute;ration des &quot;acteurs&quot; humanitaires rend plus urgente que jamais la professionnalisation de l'assistance. Les Principes et le seul int&eacute;r&ecirc;t des victimes doivent guider le Mouvement. Son potentiel est &eacute;norme, mais, pour qu'il puisse &ecirc;tre pleinement exploit&eacute;, les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales doivent recevoir un appui ad&eacute;quat, a encore not&eacute; M. Roethlisberger. Le repr&eacute;sentant du CICR a engag&eacute; les Etats &agrave; prendre leurs responsabilit&eacute;s &agrave; cet &eacute;gard et &agrave; ne pas perdre de vue les enjeux humanitaires lorsqu'ils d&eacute;cident d'imposer des sanctions.<BR>

<P>Des repr&eacute;sentants de divers gouvernements et Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ont ensuite soulev&eacute; diff&eacute;rentes questions touchant aux th&egrave;mes de la Commission. Certains ont &eacute;voqu&eacute; notamment la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de mettre en place des syst&egrave;mes de financement qui permettraient &agrave; la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration et au CICR de r&eacute;pondre plus rapidement aux situations d'urgence, de mani&egrave;re &agrave; &eacute;viter des souffrances inutiles. D'autres ont insist&eacute; sur la responsabilit&eacute; qu'a le Mouvement de r&eacute;agir aux effets d&eacute;sastreux des sanctions sur les populations civiles et sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de r&eacute;affirmer ses Principes. <BR>

<P>Parmi les autres points &eacute;voqu&eacute;s figuraient encore l'attention particuli&egrave;re dont devraient b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier les questions se rattachant aux enfants en tant que victimes, &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration de la pr&eacute;paration aux catastrophes, &agrave; la protection du personnel d'assistance sur le terrain, &agrave; la coordination entre les agences humanitaires, &agrave; l'importance des jeunes dans le renforcement des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, ainsi qu'un appel &agrave; un soutien renouvel&eacute; en faveur des populations affect&eacute;es par la catastrophe de Tchernobyl.<BR>

<P>Un amendement a &eacute;t&eacute; propos&eacute; pour un projet de r&eacute;solution appelant les gouvernements &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; pour le Mouvement d'&eacute;tablir une distinction claire entre l'action humanitaire et les interventions de caract&egrave;re politique ou militaire. L'amendement sugg&eacute;r&eacute; recommande la cr&eacute;ation d'un comit&eacute; d'experts gouvernementaux et non gouvernementaux qui serait charg&eacute; d'&eacute;laborer plus avant cette distinction, de mani&egrave;re &agrave; en faciliter la mise en pratique.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Stand Information &amp; T&eacute;l&eacute;communications</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Comment envoyer un message rapidement, communiquer en temps opportun les informations appropri&eacute;es aux personnes concern&eacute;es, acc&eacute;der &agrave; l'univers de l'information, r&eacute;agir &agrave; une situation de crise par le biais des t&eacute;l&eacute;communications et de l'information -- telles sont quelques-unes des questions cl&eacute;s auxquelles est consacr&eacute; le stand Information &amp; T&eacute;l&eacute;communications situ&eacute; au niveau F, pr&egrave;s de l'entr&eacute;e du Centre de Conf&eacute;rences.<BR>

<P>Tout au long de la Conf&eacute;rence internationale, les d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s pourront voir comment le Secr&eacute;tariat de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale et le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge re&ccedil;oivent des informations de tous les points du monde et les retransmettent, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; diff&eacute;rents moyens de communication. <BR>

<P>Chaque jour, de 8 &agrave; 20 heures, les visiteurs du stand pourront en outre s'initier &agrave; l'utilisation du World Wide Web avec le concours de sp&eacute;cialistes de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration et du CICR, qui les guideront dans les m&eacute;andres du r&eacute;seau Internet. Des d&eacute;monstrations du CD-ROM du CICR sur le droit international humanitaire et du logiciel &quot;Random Ambush&quot; -- un programme d'ordinateur sur les mines terrestres -- leur seront &eacute;galement propos&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Stand Publications</B></H4>

<H2>Mongolia ratifies the Protocols</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Mongolia ratified on 6 December 1995 the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) and Non-International Armed Conflicts (Protocol II), adopted in Geneva on 8 June 1977. <BR>

<P>The instrument of ratification contained the declaration provided for in Article 90 of Protocol I, together with the following reservation: <BR>

<P>&quot;In regard of Article 88, paragraph 2 of &quot;The Additional Protocol to the Protection of Victims in the International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I) which states &quot;The High Contracting Parties shall co-operate in the matter of extradition&quot;, the Mongolian law which prohibits deprivation and extradition of its citizens from Mongolia shall be respected&quot;. (Original language) <BR>

<P>By a <I>note verbale </I>addressed on 26 February 1996 to the depositary, the government of Mongolia added the following clarification: The expression &quot;deprivation&quot; means &quot;deprivation of one s rights as a citizen of Mongolia&quot;.<BR>
Pursuant to their provisions, the Protocols will come into force for Mongolia on 6 June 1996. <BR>
This ratification brings to <B>143</B> the number of States party to Protocol I and to <B>134</B> those party to Protocol II. Mongolia is the <B>47th</B> State to make the declaration regarding the International Fact-Finding Commission. <BR>

<P>Le conflit du Sud-Soudan a caus&eacute;, au cours des 13 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, des souffrances indescriptibles &agrave; la population civile. Les programmes du CICR mis en place pour en prot&eacute;ger et assister les victimes visent deux objectifs  : sauver des vies, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'assistance chirurgicale apport&eacute;e &agrave; Lokichokio (Kenya) et Juba, et aider la population &agrave; survivre &agrave; plus long terme; cela, notamment, en assurant une formation aux soins de sant&eacute; communautaires, en am&eacute;liorant l'approvisionnement en eau et en distribuant des outils agricoles, des semences et du mat&eacute;riel de p&ecirc;che. <I>CICR, 1996, 15 p., photogr., carte, graph., tabl., 21 x 30 cm</I><BR>

<H3><B>Le CICR au Soudan - pourquoi et comment</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Depuis treize ans, la guerre civile ronge le Sud-Soudan. Si la violence qui d&eacute;chire la plus vaste nation africaine  plus de dix fois la superficie du Royaume-Uni  ne fait plus la une des journaux, les souffrances qu'endure le peuple soudanais sont aussi grandes, voire plus terribles encore, qu'au d&eacute;but des hostilit&eacute;s. Ce qui avait commenc&eacute; comme un soul&egrave;vement arm&eacute; du sud du pays contre le gouvernement de Khartoum s'est transform&eacute;, au fil des ann&eacute;es, en un conflit complexe marqu&eacute; par des scissions et de fr&eacute;quents renversements d'alliances. Ce combat entre le gouvernement et l'opposition, ainsi qu'entre les diverses factions elles-m&ecirc;mes, a m&ecirc;me fini par d&eacute;stabiliser dans une certaine mesure quelques-uns des pays voisins. &Agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur du Soudan, r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement, des communaut&eacute;s enti&egrave;res fuyant les combats sont d&eacute;plac&eacute;es. Leurs cultures sont abandonn&eacute;es, leur b&eacute;tail massacr&eacute;, leurs maisons br&ucirc;l&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>Au fur et &agrave; mesure que se d&eacute;roule ce conflit oubli&eacute;, la destruction de la vie des civils se poursuit inexorablement. Le CICR s'efforce de limiter les effets de la guerre sur les populations civiles en faisant en sorte qu'elles aient acc&egrave;s &agrave; des services chirurgicaux d'urgence et &agrave; des soins de sant&eacute; primaires, qu'elles soient approvisionn&eacute;es en eau potable, qu'elles aient les moyens de recommencer de z&eacute;ro lorsqu'elles sont d&eacute;plac&eacute;es et qu'elles puissent rester en contact avec leurs proches. Pourtant, qu'elle que soit l'aide ext&eacute;rieure, les besoins sont tellement &eacute;normes qu'elle ne suffira pas. &Agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de cette r&eacute;alit&eacute;, notre philosophie, au Soudan, est de faire tout ce que nous pouvons, et de sauver un maximum de vies.<BR>
<BR>
Cette brochure vous donnera une id&eacute;e de notre travail. Nous avons pour cette op&eacute;ration 64 expatri&eacute;s, dont 24 viennent des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge d'Allemagne, d'Australie, d'Autriche, de Belgique, du Canada, du Danemark, de Finlande, de Hongrie, d'Islande, du Japon, de Norv&egrave;ge, des Pays-Bas, du Royaume-Uni, de Su&egrave;de et de Tha&iuml;lande. La plupart d'entre eux sont en poste &agrave; Lokichokio, juste &agrave; c&ocirc;t&eacute; de la fronti&egrave;re sur territoire kenyen, o&ugrave; nous avons notre principale base logistique. De l&agrave;, ils effectuent des missions sur le terrain, en fonction des lieux accessibles. D'autres expatri&eacute;s sont bas&eacute;s en permanence &agrave; Khartoum, Juba et Nairobi. En ce qui concerne les employ&eacute;s locaux, nous avons 530 personnes sous contrat &agrave; plein temps et 150 employ&eacute;s &agrave; la journ&eacute;e.<BR>

<BR>

<P>
<P>C'est en 1987 que le CICR a ouvert l'h&ocirc;pital de Lopiding, &agrave; quelques kilom&egrave;tres &agrave; peine de Lokichokio. Depuis lors, l'&eacute;tablissement n'a cess&eacute; de se d&eacute;velopper pour faire face aux besoins chirurgicaux des victimes du conflit sud-soudanais. Il est pass&eacute; de 40 &agrave; 560 lits et dispose maintenant d'unit&eacute;s de radiographie et de st&eacute;rilisation, d'un laboratoire, de deux salles d'op&eacute;ration et d'un atelier d'appareillage orthop&eacute;dique o&ugrave; les amput&eacute;s sont &eacute;quip&eacute;s de membres artificiels.<BR>
<BR>
Outre son personnel expatri&eacute;, compos&eacute; de deux &eacute;quipes chirurgicales et d'un effectif infirmier d'une demi-douzaine de personnes, l'h&ocirc;pital emploie un personnel soignant local comprenant 10 infirmiers et infirmi&egrave;res dipl&ocirc;m&eacute;s d'&Eacute;tat et 35 aides. Dix techniciens orthop&eacute;distes recrut&eacute;s localement fabriquent des membres artificiels sous la supervision d'un orthop&eacute;diste expatri&eacute;. &Agrave; ces &eacute;quipes s'ajoutent, enfin, quelque 130 auxiliaires k&eacute;nyens qui compl&egrave;tent le personnel de l'h&ocirc;pital.<BR>
<BR>
Jorma, le chirurgien-chef de Lopiding, qui a &eacute;t&eacute; mis &agrave; la disposition du CICR par la Croix-Rouge finlandaise, nous en dit plus sur cet h&ocirc;pital de campagne fonctionnant dans un coin perdu :<BR>

<P>Ici, il s'agit de sauver des vies. Nous ne sommes pas un &eacute;tablissement r&eacute;gional o&ugrave; l'on envoie les patients du nord-ouest du Kenya, mais un h&ocirc;pital de chirurgie de guerre pour les victimes du conflit soudanais. Les habitants de Lokichokio ont parfois du mal &agrave; le comprendre, d'autant plus que l'h&ocirc;pital le plus proche est &agrave; un bonne demi-journ&eacute;e de voiture. Il y a dix ans, Loki n'&eacute;tait qu'un petit village; maintenant que c'est devenu une ville de 20 000 habitants, nous sommes souvent confront&eacute;s au dilemme de devoir refuser des patients. Cependant, nous acceptons toujours les cas locaux lorsque ce sont des urgences.<BR>
<BR>
Tous les patients que l'on transf&egrave;re sur Lopiding depuis le Soudan ne sont pas des bless&eacute;s de guerre. Certains ont simplement besoin, pour survivre, d'une op&eacute;ration que l'on ne peut pas pratiquer dans leur pays parce que le conflit y a d&eacute;truit la quasi-totalit&eacute; de l'infrastructure chirurgical. Les cas d'accouchements avec complications, de hernies, ou de mauvaises morsures de hy&egrave;nes et de serpents sont ramen&eacute;s chez en avion ou peuvent choisir d'&ecirc;tre transf&eacute;r&eacute;s sur le camp de r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s du HCR &agrave; Kakuma, dans le nord-ouest du Kenya.<BR>

<P>
<P><I>Guay a quatre ans. Il avait l'habitude de dormir dehors la nuit en gardant le b&eacute;tail de sa famille. Il y a huit jours, il a &eacute;t&eacute; attaqu&eacute; dans son sommeil par une hy&egrave;ne qui lui a d&eacute;vor&eacute; presque la moiti&eacute; du visage. Erika, infirmi&egrave;re de terrain du CICR, me raconte que de tels accidents sont fr&eacute;quents et que les hy&egrave;nes s'en prennent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement aux jeunes enfants ou aux personnes &acirc;g&eacute;es. S'il ne pouvait pas &ecirc;tre op&eacute;r&eacute;, Guay serait vou&eacute; &agrave; une mort quasi-certaine, car ses blessures se sont infect&eacute;es, provoquant une septic&eacute;mie.<BR>
</I><BR>
<I>Il a fallu cinq jours aux parents de Guay pour le porter jusqu'&agrave; Mapel, o&ugrave; il est pris en charge par deux infirmi&egrave;res de MSF. Elles calment sa douleur &agrave; l'aide de morphine en attendant l'arriv&eacute;e de l'avion du CICR.<BR>
</I><BR>
<I>Quelques minutes apr&egrave;s l'atterrissage de l'avion, nous red&eacute;collons avec Guay et sa m&egrave;re &agrave; bord. Je m'&eacute;merveille de la r&eacute;sistance de ce petit gar&ccedil;on, et j'ai peine &agrave; imaginer un enfant europ&eacute;en ou am&eacute;ricain survivant &agrave; pareille &eacute;preuve. Mais, bien s&ucirc;r, il doit y avoir beaucoup d'autres enfants soudanais qui se retrouvent dans des situations aussi graves et dont on n'entend jamais parler tout simplement parce qu'ils ne survivent pas.</I><BR>

<P><I>D&egrave;s l'arriv&eacute;e &agrave; Loki, l'enfant et sa m&egrave;re sont emmen&eacute;s de toute urgence &agrave; l'h&ocirc;pital chirurgical du CICR, o&ugrave; le visage de Guay sera recousu une fois l'infection termin&eacute;e. Pas le temps de faire quoi que ce soit de m&ecirc;me vaguement esth&eacute;tique - la chirurgie de guerre sert &agrave; sauver des vies, c'est tout. Mais, direz-vous, c'est une hy&egrave;ne qui a d&eacute;figur&eacute; Guay, pas un fusil. La m&ecirc;me pens&eacute;e ma travers&eacute; l'esprit. Puis j'ai essay&eacute; de me repr&eacute;senter la guerre dans mon propre pays: un conflit long et &eacute;puisant, r&eacute;duisant &agrave; n&eacute;ant toute l'infrastructure; des h&ocirc;pitaux sans m&eacute;dicaments ni m&eacute;decins. Et j'ai compris que Guay &eacute;tait bel et bien une victime de la guerre et que, d&eacute;figur&eacute; comme il &eacute;tait, il resterait une victime de la guerre jusqu'&agrave; la fin de sa vie. </I><BR>

<TABLE border>
<TR valign=top><TD>
<P>La vaste superficie du Sud-Soudan et sa division en zones contr&ocirc;l&eacute;es par les diff&eacute;rentes parties au conflit rendent tout d&eacute;placement extr&ecirc;mement difficile et font de l'avion le seul moyen de transport utilisable. Toutes les &eacute;vacuations m&eacute;dicales par la voie des airs doivent obtenir l'autorisation pr&eacute;alable des autorit&eacute;s soudanaises et des factions de l'opposition, et il arrive souvent qu'une destination soit d&eacute;clar&eacute;e zone interdite . Ceci signifie parfois que certains patients doivent &ecirc;tre amput&eacute;s &agrave; leur arriv&eacute;e &agrave; Loki, alors que cela n'aurait peut-&ecirc;tre pas &eacute;t&eacute; n&eacute;cessaire s'ils avaient atteint l'h&ocirc;pital plus t&ocirc;t. Bien entendu, cela signifie aussi des morts inutiles.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
<H3><B>L'eau et la sant&eacute;</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Apr&egrave;s plus de dix ans de destruction et d'absence totale d'entretien, les syst&egrave;mes d'approvisionnement en eau et les installations sanitaires du Sud-Soudan se trouvent dans un &eacute;tat de d&eacute;labrement &eacute;vident. Dans de nombreux villages isol&eacute;s par le conflit, les puits sont &agrave; sec ou pleins d'une eau putride. Les pompes install&eacute;es avant la guerre ne fonctionnent plus, soit quelles aient &eacute;t&eacute; endommag&eacute;es, soit qu'il n'y ait plus de carburant pour les faire marcher. Des communaut&eacute;s enti&egrave;res, oblig&eacute;es de fuir les combats, ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;plac&eacute;es vers des r&eacute;gions o&ugrave; les sources d'eau sont insuffisantes, ou sont rentr&eacute;es dans leurs villages pour y retrouver leurs puits sabot&eacute;s.<BR>
<BR>
Le CICR dispose d'une &eacute;quipe de sp&eacute;cialistes de l'approvisionnement en eau et de l'assainissement. Ils vont de village en village &agrave; travers le Sud-Soudan, r&eacute;parant les puits, rempla&ccedil;ant par des syst&egrave;mes manuels les pompes &agrave; eau d&eacute;truites, d&eacute;bouchant des forages et en creusant de nouveaux. Il ne s'agit pas uniquement de fournir de l'eau &agrave; la population mais &eacute;galement de r&eacute;duire les risques de maladies d'origine hydrique, qui repr&eacute;sentent un grave probl&egrave;me dans de nombreuses r&eacute;gions - et notamment celles de Jonglei, des Lacs et du Bahr el-Ghazal. Nos ing&eacute;nieurs constituent des &eacute;quipes d'ouvriers locaux et leur apprennent comment proc&eacute;der. Nous enseignons aussi quelques principes d'hygi&egrave;ne &eacute;l&eacute;mentaire et distribuons du savon - un  luxe  pour la plupart des habitants du Sud-Soudan, mais un produit &ocirc; combien essentiel &agrave; la sant&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Dans les m&ecirc;mes collectivit&eacute;s, le CICR m&egrave;ne un programme de soins de sant&eacute; primaires pour aider la population &agrave; d&eacute;velopper les structures sanitaires existantes. Nombre d'entre elles &eacute;taient d&eacute;j&agrave; insuffisantes avant le conflit, si bien qu'il faut souvent beaucoup de travail pour parvenir ne serait-ce qu'au niveau de soins le plus rudimentaire. Six infirmi&egrave;res du CICR forment les agents de sant&eacute; locaux &agrave; des techniques de soins infirmiers &eacute;l&eacute;mentaires qu'ils n'ont jamais apprises ou qu'ils ont oubli&eacute;es au fil des ann&eacute;es. L'obst&eacute;trique et le travail de la sage-femme, par exemple, sont un &eacute;l&eacute;ment important de cette formation puisqu'il contribue &agrave; la survie de m&egrave;res et d'enfants qui, autrement, pourraient figurer parmi les nombreuses victimes indirectes du conflit. <BR>

<H3><B>L'h&ocirc;pital universitaire de Juba</B></H3>
<P>
<P>La ville de Juba, au Sud-Soudan, est sous contr&ocirc;le du gouvernement soudanais. Le conflit a r&eacute;duit l'h&ocirc;pital universitaire de Juba (Juba Teaching Hospital, JTH) a un &eacute;tat de d&eacute;labrement g&eacute;n&eacute;ral: p&eacute;nurie de fournitures m&eacute;dicales, syst&egrave;me d'assainissement inad&eacute;quat et besoins criants dans le domaine chirurgical. Face &agrave; cette situation, le CICR a lanc&eacute; en 1994 un vaste programme de remise en &eacute;tat destin&eacute; &agrave; faire du JTH un h&ocirc;pital chirurgical central. Des travaux de r&eacute;novation importants ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans la salle d'op&eacute;ration, le service chirurgical, l'unit&eacute; de st&eacute;rilisation, la pharmacie, la cuisine, la banque du sang, l'unit&eacute; de radiographie et la salle des urgences, et les syst&egrave;mes d'approvisionnement en eau et d'&eacute;vacuation des eaux us&eacute;es ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;par&eacute;s. Dans ce dernier domaine, le travail r&eacute;alis&eacute; a transform&eacute; le mar&eacute;cage de vidanges qui constituait une grande partie du p&eacute;rim&egrave;tre de l'h&ocirc;pital en un espace fonctionnel dont les b&acirc;timents ne sont plus menac&eacute;s. D'autres am&eacute;liorations sont en cours.<BR>

<P>Une &eacute;quipe chirurgicale CICR compos&eacute;e d'expatri&eacute;s est en poste au JTH depuis mars 1994. Elle travaille aux c&ocirc;t&eacute;s d'un personnel chirurgical soudanais et dispense un savoir-faire sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;. Du mat&eacute;riel m&eacute;dical et chirurgical est r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement livr&eacute; par avion.<BR>

<P>Par l'interm&eacute;diaire de la section de Juba du Croissant-Rouge soudanais (SRC), le CICR nourrit toute la population de l'h&ocirc;pital. Dans la cuisine qu'il a remise en &eacute;tat, des volontaires du SRC pr&eacute;parent deux repas par jour. Les sections locales du SRC &agrave; Juba, Bentiu, Malakal, Raja et Wau b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient toutes d'un soutien logistique et financier du CICR et participent &agrave; des programmes de coop&eacute;ration dans des domaines tels que le r&eacute;tablissement des liens familiaux, la formation aux premiers secours, les cours conjoints de diffusion du droit international humanitaire et les distributions de secours</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
<P><IMG src="28b6_5.gif">Thierry Gassmann/CICR<I> (r&eacute;f.SD-D81/10)</I><BR>

<P>Le conflit du Sud-Soudan dure depuis plus de treize ans. Auparavant d&eacute;j&agrave;, la nourriture &eacute;tait rare et, pendant les p&eacute;riodes de p&eacute;nurie, la population cueillait des fruits sauvages et allait m&ecirc;me jusqu'&agrave; faire bouillir des &eacute;corces d'arbres pour survivre. Le CICR sait que, dans la plupart des cas, les familles d&eacute;plac&eacute;es ont besoin de moyens qui leur permettent de repartir de z&eacute;ro, et non de distributions de vivres qui ne durent pas. C'est pourquoi notre programme de secours vise &agrave; fournir &agrave; la population un moyen de survie: des semences et des outils pour les habitants des r&eacute;gions cultivables, du fil de p&ecirc;che torsad&eacute; et des hame&ccedil;ons pour ceux qui vivent pr&egrave;s des cours d'eau. Les agronomes du CICR effectuent au pr&eacute;alable des &eacute;tudes d&eacute;taill&eacute;es afin de d&eacute;terminer les vari&eacute;t&eacute;s de cultures les mieux adapt&eacute;es et &eacute;valuent ensuite les r&eacute;sultats des programmes. Ainsi, les Soudanais parviennent &agrave; retrouver une certaine auto-suffisance plut&ocirc;t que de devoir compter sur une aide ext&eacute;rieure prolong&eacute;e. Le CICR &eacute;change r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement des informations avec Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), ce qui permet d'&eacute;viter tout chevauchement inutile de programmes d'assistance.<BR>

<P>
<TABLE border>
<TR valign=top><TD>
<P>Pour les distributions de secours, le choix du moment est vital. Une op&eacute;ration de secours, comme les autres activit&eacute;s du CICR sur le terrain, d&eacute;pend des autorisations de vol accord&eacute;es par le gouvernement soudanais et l'opposition. Il en r&eacute;sulte souvent de graves difficult&eacute;s, surtout lorsque certaines destinations sont soudain d&eacute;clar&eacute;es zones interdites. S'ajoute &agrave; cette contrainte le probl&egrave;me des pluies: de nombreuses pistes d'atterrissage sont inutilisables pendant la saison humide. C'est ainsi que, par exemple, si une r&eacute;gion reste zone interdite jusqu'&agrave; l'arriv&eacute;e des pluies, il est souvent trop tard, ensuite, pour reprendre les distributions a&eacute;roport&eacute;es. Les probl&egrave;mes de s&eacute;curit&eacute; peuvent causer &eacute;galement d'autres perturbations aux plans de vol.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<H3><B>Maintenir les liens familiaux</B></H3>
<P>
<P>La perte de contact avec amis et famille est l'un des effets n&eacute;fastes de bien des conflits. Au Soudan, il est d'autant plus difficile de r&eacute;tablir ces liens familiaux que le territoire est tr&egrave;s vaste et que, fr&eacute;quemment, certaines destinations sont d&eacute;clar&eacute;es zones interdites. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; un r&eacute;seau d'employ&eacute;s locaux charg&eacute;s de la recherche de personnes, le CICR parvient &agrave; aider les familles &agrave; rester en contact, qu'il s'agisse de cas de proches d&eacute;plac&eacute;s &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur du Soudan ou r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s dans les pays voisins.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Perspective</B></H3>
<P>
<P><IMG src="28b6_6.gif">Thierry Gassmann/CICR <I>(r&eacute;f.SD-D83/12)</I><BR>

<P>Mener une op&eacute;ration de grande envergure au Soudan n'est pas t&acirc;che facile, ne serait-ce que d'un point de vue purement logistique. Les principaux probl&egrave;mes proviennent de l'impossibilit&eacute; de se d&eacute;placer autrement qu'en avion et du fait qu'il n'est pas toujours possible d'obtenir les autorisations de vol de toutes les parties. Alors que les programmes se trouvent interrompus pour des p&eacute;riodes plus ou moins longues, le rythme des pluies, lui, suit son cours. C'est ainsi qu'on peut se trouver dans l'incapacit&eacute; de distribuer les semences parce que les pistes d'atterrissage d&eacute;tremp&eacute;es sont inutilisables, ou arriver trop tard parce que la saison des semailles est d&eacute;j&agrave; termin&eacute;e. Les &eacute;vacuations m&eacute;dicales peuvent subir le m&ecirc;me type de retards, avec les cons&eacute;quences tragiques que cela implique pour les patients. Quant aux personnes anxieuses d'avoir des nouvelles de leur famille, elles doivent parfois attendre tr&egrave;s longtemps; il s'agit l&agrave; d'une souffrance int&eacute;rieure, mais qui n'en est pas moins forte.<BR>
<BR>
Bien entendu, les ramifications politiques du conflit ne sont pas &eacute;trang&egrave;res &agrave; ces probl&egrave;mes. L'une des t&acirc;ches constantes du CICR consiste &agrave; essayer de faire comprendre aux bellig&eacute;rants - et au gouvernement soudanais en particulier - qu'ils doivent lui assurer un acc&egrave;s r&eacute;gulier aux victimes des combats. Pour mieux les sensibiliser &agrave; cette n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, nous avons au Soudan un d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute; qui se consacre enti&egrave;rement &agrave; la diffusion du droit international humanitaire, surtout aupr&egrave;s des combattants. Soins pour tous les bless&eacute;s sans discrimination, protection des civils et de leurs biens, traitement correct des prisonniers et respect des employ&eacute;s et volontaires de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge sont quelques-unes des r&egrave;gles essentielles de ce droit. Au bout de treize ans d'op&eacute;ration au Soudan, nous esp&eacute;rons que le CICR est suffisamment accept&eacute; en tant qu'organisation humanitaire neutre et ind&eacute;pendante pour nous permettre d&eacute;tendre nos activit&eacute;s &agrave; d'autres domaines li&eacute;s &agrave; notre mandat : la protection et l'assistance &agrave; apporter aux prisonniers. Jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, seule l'Arm&eacute;e populaire de lib&eacute;ration du Soudan, principal mouvement d'opposition, autorise les visites &agrave; certains de ses d&eacute;tenus. Nous pourrions faire tellement plus si toutes les parties au conflit se montraient plus coop&eacute;ratives.

<H2>Special commemorative meeting of the General Assembly on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations </H2>
<P><I>By Cornelio Sommaruga</I>
<P>
<P><B>United Nations General Assembly 50th session, New York, 22 October 1995</B><BR>

<P><B>Statement by Mr Cornelio Sommaruga, President of the International Committee of the Red Cross</B><BR>
<a href=#1><BR>
<I>The fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations was celebrated at a special commemorative meeting of the General Assembly, held in New York from 21 to 25 October 1995.</I><BR>

<P><I>Following addresses by the President of the Assembly and the United Nations Secretary-General, some 160 heads of State and government leaders, as well as the heads of international and regional organizations, took the floor to highlight the problems faced by the UN and discuss ways to remedy its shortcomings. They reaffirmed that the organization is still essential to the international community but that reforms are needed, and stressed that more funds must be made available to it.</I><BR>

<P><I>The first day of the meeting ended with a statement by the President of the ICRC, Mr Cornelio Sommaruga, the text of which the </I><B><I>Review</I></B><I> has reproduced below:</I><BR>

<P>
<P>&quot;The celebration of the 50th anniversary of the United Nations is an event full of symbolism which invites us all to reflect upon world events, past and future. The International Committee of the Red Cross is therefore especially pleased to take part in this celebration, which provides it with the opportunity to reaffirm its faith in humanity by paying tribute to an institution that was created in the image of mankind : imperfect, unique and irreplaceable.<BR>

<P>Although the respective nature and goals of the United Nations and of the ICRC are completely different, the two institutions nevertheless spring from the same humanist philosophy. For the founders of the United Nations in 1945, as for the ICRC in 1864 and again in 1949, the aim was to cast out the demons of war in the aftermath of a devastating and deadly conflict by striving to define and express in tangible form universal values capable of bringing all peoples together.<BR>

<P>The Charter of the United Nations and the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the protection of war victims, which were adopted almost simultaneously and by the same States as a reaction to the Second World War, have today unquestionably become part of humanity's common heritage. The men and women who drafted the two instruments demonstrated not only their noble ideals and generosity but also a high degree of lucidity, for they were quite aware that war could not be banned altogether. The two initiatives were thus intentionally quite separate and have remained so.<BR>

<P>Over the past 50 years, while membership of the international community has grown considerably, the validity of these universal instruments has never been contested. It is remarkable to note that new States have endorsed the spirit of Geneva just as readily as that of San Francisco, and have indeed strengthened it by approving further treaties.<BR>

<P>Thus the Additional Protocols of 1977 came into being to expand upon and supplement the Geneva Conventions and to deal in particular with conflicts generated by the decolonization process and with the proliferation of internal armed conflicts. <BR>

<P>The very term &quot;international community&quot; would have remained a merely abstract concept had the United Nations not given it substance by bringing its members together right here in the General Assembly, and this is not the least of the organization's merits.<BR>

<P>While basic human values are now the subject of universal consensus, ensuring respect for them remains a daily challenge. Fortunately, we have so far been spared a Third World War, yet more than 120 conflicts have claimed 22 million lives throughout the world since 1945, and continue to cause untold suffering. The lip-service paid to human dignity today is matched only by the contempt in which it is held. Faced with this paradox, the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose humanitarian activities have taken on vast proportions, wishes to speak out here on behalf of the countless victims claimed by armed conflicts, whether spotlighted by the media or forgotten by the outside world.<BR>

<P>Do we not all bear some burden of responsibility for this situation? Is it not true that States have a political responsibility in these matters, and that institutions and individuals also have a part to play?<BR>

<P>If lives are to be saved in situations of extreme emergency, humanitarian action must be taken rapidly and independently of any considerations other than its immediate aim, which is to bring assistance and protection. While this type of response is indispensable, it has its limitations. The only effective way to prevent such emergencies is to strike at the root cause of the evil. The United Nations has steadfastly endeavoured to do just that, by creating the conditions necessary for the exercise of basic human rights, whether economic, political, social or cultural, and whether in the fields of environmental protection, development or disarmament, to mention only the most important. However, political action still remains a key factor in preventing crises and here States bear the primary responsibility. It is likewise up to States, acting either individually or jointly through the United Nations, to ensure respect for the rules of international humanitarian law, in particular those of the Geneva Conventions. It is also essential for the United Nations to move towards the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal.<BR>

<P>But a spirit of tolerance and solidarity, respect for minorities and indeed respect for one's fellow human beings in general also depend largely on the attitude of individuals. The growing efforts made by civil society to spur government action and to take part in major international debates can therefore be seen as a beacon of hope. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, ever faithful to its Fundamental Principles, is thoroughly committed to this process.<BR>

<P>Extraordinary developments in the field of communications and increasing interdependency have turned our planet into a close-knit universe, prompting greater cooperation but at the same time heightening tension. Indeed, the proliferation of crises and their deadly and destabilizing effects have confronted us with an unprecedented challenge.<BR>

<P>In the name of the universal values embodied by the United Nations, whose anniversary we are celebrating today, and mindful of its Charter, which begins with the words &quot;We the peoples...&quot; and thereby places us squarely before our responsibilities, we must, as a matter of urgency, reject the inevitability of a backward slide. Therefore, let us all form a united front to defeat intolerance and demand respect, at every opportunity, for human dignity.&quot;<BR>

<H2>XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja: Mito y Realidad</H2>
<P><I>By Yves Sandoz</I>
<P>
<P>
<H4><TD VALIGN=BOTTOM CELLPADDING=50></H4>
<P><I>EN GINEBRA DEL 4 AL 7 DE DICIEMBRE DE 1995</I><BR>

<P>	La XXVI Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, tan largo tiempo esperada, ha adquirido una dimensi&oacute;n casi m&iacute;tica en nuestro Movimiento. Hablamos de ella, en cierto modo, como si se tratara del soldado acantonado en un fuerte, esperando a los t&aacute;rtaros, en una c&eacute;lebre obra de Dino Buzzati (El desierto de los t&aacute;rtaros), con una mezcla de esperanza y de aprensi&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>	Intentemos analizar ambos sentimientos con lucidez.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>I. Esperanzas que suscita la Conferencia Internacional</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Unirse en favor de las personas vulnerables</B><BR>

<P>	El extraordinario progreso t&eacute;cnico y el galopante crecimiento demogr&aacute;fico que caracterizan nuestro siglo nos obligan a hacer constar: el hombre no ha conseguido gestionar estos fen&oacute;menos en beneficio de toda la humanidad y cada vez hay m&aacute;s personas en la miseria, m&aacute;s personas vulnerables o excluidas de la sociedad que necesitan ayuda y compasi&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>	As&iacute; pues, el cometido b&aacute;sico del Movimiento Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja en favor de las personas vulnerables, principalmente en tiempo de conflicto armado, pero tambi&eacute;n en cualquier otra circunstancia, es hoy esencial.<BR>

<P>	La principal esperanza suscitada por la Conferencia est&aacute; estrechamente relacionada con esta situaci&oacute;n y con la funci&oacute;n b&aacute;sica de la Conferencia: se trata de reanudar o, m&aacute;s bien, de relanzar y potenciar el di&aacute;logo entre los Estados y nuestro Movimiento, a fin de examinar c&oacute;mo pueden coordinar sus esfuerzos de la manera m&aacute;s eficaz para mejorar la suerte que corre la inmensa masa de personas que carecen de lo esencial y cuya vida es, a menudo, un calvario sin esperanza. Podemos y debemos hacer m&aacute;s. Podemos y debemos colaborar mejor. La Conferencia es una ocasi&oacute;n para reflexionar al respecto y para abrir nuevos caminos.<BR>

<P><B>2. Atenuar y prevenir las crisis</B><BR>

<P>	Actualmente, da la impresi&oacute;n de que la comunidad internacional pasa de una crisis a otra y de que pierde el aliento intentando cubrir brechas, cada vez m&aacute;s abiertas, sin medios suficientes. El malestar se apodera de los pueblos, sin que ninguno se encuentre totalmente libre de estas crisis o de sus efectos, con su tr&aacute;gica consecuencia de movimientos de repliegue sobre uno mismo: preferimos ignorar lo que no podemos dominar. La compasi&oacute;n tiende hacia lo inmediato, lo insoportable, lo que muestran los medios informativos, justamente por ser insoportable y por la necesidad de sentir que se est&aacute; actuando, pero ello en detrimento de lo que ya no se nos muestra - v&iacute;ctimas olvidadas - y de la reflexi&oacute;n a m&aacute;s largo plazo.<BR>
	<BR>
	La finalidad de la Conferencia es, pues, desarrollar tambi&eacute;n esta reflexi&oacute;n desde una perspectiva m&aacute;s general y examinar las posibles actuaciones para atenuar o incluso prevenir las crisis.<BR>

<P><B>a) Atenuar las crisis</B><BR>

<P>	Atenuar las crisis implica, ante todo, lograr un mayor respeto del derecho internacional humanitario en los conflictos armados.<BR>

<P>	El Gobierno suizo organiz&oacute; la reuni&oacute;n de un grupo intergubernamental de expertos, abierto a todos los Estados, de conformidad con lo solicitado, en 1993, por la Conferencia Internacional para la Protecci&oacute;n de las V&iacute;ctimas de la Guerra. Estos expertos estudiaron detalladamente la cuesti&oacute;n. Sus recomendaciones ser&aacute;n presentadas a la aprobaci&oacute;n de la XXVI Conferencia. Algunos de ellos deseaban que fuesen m&aacute;s &quot;vigorosas&quot;; es f&aacute;cil comprenderlos, a la vista de ciertas situaciones actuales que requieren una reacci&oacute;n en&eacute;rgica de la comunidad internacional. Sin embargo, dichas recomendaciones, que se centran en la prevenci&oacute;n y en las medidas aplicables a nivel nacional en tiempos de paz -promulgaci&oacute;n de leyes nacionales, mayor esfuerzo para difundir el derecho humanitario, particularmente en las fuerzas armadas, designaci&oacute;n de comisiones interministeriales, etc.- pueden mejorar considerablemente la situaci&oacute;n, con tal de que se tomen en serio y surtan efectos. Las Sociedades Nacionales, la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional y, sobre todo, el CICR, dado su cometido tradicional y estatutario en este &aacute;mbito, son abundantemente citados y solicitados. Es importante que respondan a la confianza que en ellos se ha depositado, que demuestren su disponibilidad y que exploten al m&aacute;ximo las propuestas que reciben. Pero se trata tambi&eacute;n, o tal vez deber&iacute;a decir sobre todo, de incitar a los Estados a invertir energ&iacute;a y recursos en estas tareas preventivas que, a pesar de ser poco espectaculares, pueden mejorar considerablemente la suerte que corren las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra si se toman en serio.[1]<BR>

<P>	Asimismo, se podr&iacute;a atenuar el efecto de las crisis con una mejor gesti&oacute;n y un mejor entendimiento de la acci&oacute;n humanitaria. De ah&iacute; la intenci&oacute;n de seguir reflexionando sobre el derecho de las v&iacute;ctimas a la ayuda humanitaria y sobre las normas &quot;deontol&oacute;gicas&quot; que deber&iacute;an observar las organizaciones humanitarias involucradas en la ayuda humanitaria de emergencia. El c&oacute;digo de conducta elaborado por la Federaci&oacute;n Internacional, en colaboraci&oacute;n con el CICR y con diversas organizaciones no gubernamentales, en particular, ser&aacute; sometido al examen de la Conferencia en esta perspectiva, as&iacute; como ciertas cuestiones relacionadas con la seguridad en la acci&oacute;n humanitaria.<BR>

<P><B>b) Prevenir las crisis</B><BR>

<P>	La prevenci&oacute;n de crisis es un tema mucho m&aacute;s amplio, ya que concierne a sus ra&iacute;ces, a las causas profundas, como la miseria y el subdesarrollo, al crecimiento demogr&aacute;fico descontrolado, al crimen organizado o a la corrupci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>	Nuestro Movimiento ha de ser modesto por lo que ata&ntilde;e a su capacidad para contribuir a resolver estos problemas. Pero cuenta con sus propias armas: las dos principales son su red de Sociedades Nacionales y sus Principios Fundamentales: una red de Sociedades Nacionales que se extiende por todo el mundo (principio de universalidad), dispuestas a trabajar en favor de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables (principio de humanidad), sin ning&uacute;n tipo de discriminaci&oacute;n (principio de imparcialidad) y sin intervenir en discusiones de &iacute;ndole pol&iacute;tica (principio de neutralidad). Acaso no responde, precisamente, a la necesidad tan actual de ayudar, sin segundas intenciones, a aquellos cuya insoportable miseria es inevitablemente caldo de cultivo de tensiones, crisis y guerras?<BR>

<P>	A este respecto, deber&aacute;n recordarse y precisarse la misi&oacute;n y el cometido de las Sociedades Nacionales en favor de los grupos m&aacute;s vulnerables de la poblaci&oacute;n, como los refugiados, los ni&ntilde;os callejeros o los enfermos de SIDA. La Conferencia Internacional es tambi&eacute;n una ocasi&oacute;n &uacute;nica para comprender mejor la utilidad de esta red, as&iacute; como para afinar la colaboraci&oacute;n entre las Sociedades Nacionales y los Gobiernos. &Eacute;stos han de comprender que les interesa apoyar a las Sociedades Nacionales sin menoscabar su independencia, sin tratar de utilizarlas con fines pol&iacute;ticos y, sobre todo, sin minar la credibilidad de que han de gozar por parte de las personas a quienes beneficia su ayuda.<BR>

<P>	Ahora bien, la Conferencia tambi&eacute;n permite a nuestro Movimiento hacer prueba de dinamismo por lo que respecta a su misi&oacute;n, todav&iacute;a incompleta, de desarrollar el conjunto de Sociedades Nacionales. Promoviendo la red de Sociedades Nacionales como instrumento esencial para ayudar a los m&aacute;s vulnerables y, con ello, previniendo las crisis, nuestro Movimiento ha de demostrar tambi&eacute;n su voluntad de fomentar la solidaridad interna de sus miembros y de revitalizar las Sociedades Nacionales, por desgracia numerosas, cuya situaci&oacute;n es a&uacute;n muy precaria.<BR>

<P><B>3. Movilizar al p&uacute;blico</B><BR>

<P>	El p&uacute;blico debe comprender y apoyar la acci&oacute;n de nuestro Movimiento. Esta comprensi&oacute;n es imprescindible, ya que las m&aacute;s de las Sociedades Nacionales basan su acci&oacute;n en la benevolencia y en las contribuciones privadas. Pero tambi&eacute;n es necesaria dado que la imagen p&uacute;blica de las Sociedades Nacionales cuenta mucho para los Gobiernos cuyo apoyo se solicita. Hay, pues, una din&aacute;mica, que debe desarrollarse, entre una acci&oacute;n eficaz en favor de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables, la simpat&iacute;a del p&uacute;blico con respecto a esta acci&oacute;n y el apoyo de los Gobiernos.<BR>

<P>	La Conferencia no es, en s&iacute;, un factor de movilizaci&oacute;n e incluso podr&iacute;a surtir un efecto negativo, dado que, al parecer, el p&uacute;blico est&aacute; cansado de grandes y costosas reuniones, cuyas repercusiones son dif&iacute;ciles de calcular.<BR>

<P>	Ahora bien, es el contenido lo que debe permitir recordar, en todos los pa&iacute;ses, la tr&aacute;gica suerte que corren las v&iacute;ctimas, as&iacute; como la acci&oacute;n de nuestro Movimiento en su favor. En este sentido, se ha considerado importante examinar problemas concretos relacionados con la protecci&oacute;n de la poblaci&oacute;n civil en los conflictos armados, los abusos de que son v&iacute;ctimas las mujeres, los dramas que viven miles de ni&ntilde;os, el problema crucial del agua, del hambre, especialmente por lo que ata&ntilde;e a los desplazamientos de la poblaci&oacute;n, as&iacute; como la dispersi&oacute;n escandalosa de minas antipersonal. La Conferencia Internacional permite tambi&eacute;n testimoniar, explicar, promover la simpat&iacute;a y contribuir al rechazo de lo inaceptable.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>II. Aprensiones suscitadas por la Conferencia</B></H3>
<P>
<P><B>1. Desavenencias sobre la participaci&oacute;n</B><BR>

<P>	Los agitados debates que captaron la atenci&oacute;n de los medios informativos en 1986 y que condujeron a la expulsi&oacute;n de la delegaci&oacute;n sudafricana siguen presentes en la memoria de numerosas Sociedades Nacionales que se vieron afectadas de lleno por la negativa repercusi&oacute;n de estos acontecimientos en la opini&oacute;n p&uacute;blica del respectivo pa&iacute;s. Tampoco ha sido olvidada por los Gobiernos, la crisis que provoc&oacute; el aplazamiento <I>sine die</I> de la Conferencia que hab&iacute;a de celebrarse, el a&ntilde;o 1991, en Budapest; por falta de acuerdo sobre la forma de una participaci&oacute;n palestina, los respectivos altos representantes se hab&iacute;an desplazado en vano.<BR>

<P>	Ni las Sociedades Nacionales ni los Gobiernos aceptar&iacute;an de buen grado que se repitiesen tales acontecimientos, que podr&iacute;an conducir a un serio cuestionamiento de la Conferencia.<BR>

<P>	Aunque jam&aacute;s ser&aacute; posible precaverse con garant&iacute;as de que se produzcan incidentes de &iacute;ndole pol&iacute;tica, riesgo inherente a cualquier reuni&oacute;n que pretenda congregar a Estados, se debe recurrir a todos los medios disponibles para evitarlos. Ya se ha comenzado a identificar los problemas potenciales y se ha entablado un di&aacute;logo, cada vez m&aacute;s a fondo, con los Gobiernos, por mediaci&oacute;n de un grupo de embajadores designados por la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, as&iacute; como con las entidades y los Estados directamente interesados. Ning&uacute;n problema parece insuperable en el contexto actual, pero tampoco hay que subestimar las dificultades ni dejar de ahondar en todas las cuestiones planteadas.<BR>

<P><B>2. Enfrentamientos pol&iacute;ticos en la Conferencia</B><BR>

<P>	Las entidades o los Estados involucrados en una divergencia pol&iacute;tica o militar, en especial, pueden verse muy tentados a utilizar el foro de la Conferencia Internacional como una tribuna para defender sus puntos de vista y acusar a sus adversarios.<BR>

<P>	El marco de la Conferencia y su brevedad no se prestan a este tipo de arreglos de cuentas que pueden, por el mecanismo del derecho de r&eacute;plica, envenenar r&aacute;pidamente el ambiente de la Conferencia e incluso comprometer sus resultados. Ciertamente, tales disputas incidir&iacute;an inevitablemente en el esp&iacute;ritu de consenso a la hora de aprobar resoluciones sobre las cuestiones abordadas.<BR>

<P>	&quot;Dejen sus cuchillos en el guardarropa&quot;: esta famosa expresi&oacute;n del general de Gaulle es muy pertinente en el marco de las Conferencias Internacionales de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja, donde no se pretende solucionar situaciones concretas ni debatirlas a fondo.<BR>

<P>	As&iacute; pues, es importante convencer a los participantes en la Conferencia de que la utilicen para lo que es: un foro de debate y de progreso en favor de la acci&oacute;n humanitaria y de la protecci&oacute;n de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables de nuestro planeta, y no como trampol&iacute;n de una causa pol&iacute;tica. Ha de transmitirse claramente este mensaje en la fase preparatoria de la Conferencia.<BR>

<P>	Una clara y firme regulaci&oacute;n de los debates durante la Conferencia podr&iacute;a contribuir, asimismo, a superar este escollo.<BR>

<P><B>3. Abundancia de materia</B><BR>

<P>	Muchos participantes tienen la preocupaci&oacute;n, comprensible y leg&iacute;tima, de utilizar este esperado di&aacute;logo del mejor modo posible, de no dejar escapar esta oportunidad. Pero, al igual que unos familiares que se re&uacute;nen tras larga separaci&oacute;n, hay tanto que decir que corren el riesgo de no comprenderse. Por lo tanto, es necesaria una selecci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>	El gran n&uacute;mero de participantes y el breve tiempo de que se dispone imponer, ciertamente, muy estrictas restricciones en la gesti&oacute;n de la Conferencia.<BR>

<P>	La Comisi&oacute;n Permanente ha tomado la decisi&oacute;n de organizar el trabajo de fondo de la Conferencia por mediaci&oacute;n de dos comisiones que se re&uacute;nen simult&aacute;neamente. Algunos habr&iacute;an deseado que fueran m&aacute;s numerosas para poder abordar un mayor n&uacute;mero de temas; pero, en tal caso, muchas delegaciones no podr&iacute;an estar representadas en todas las comisiones. Estas delegaciones podr&iacute;an, entonces, poner en tela de juicio, en la sesi&oacute;n plenaria final, el trabajo en ellas realizado. Adem&aacute;s, algunas delegaciones no est&aacute;n equipadas para trabajar en dos comisiones paralelamente y es importante obviar este inconveniente, en parte, mediante una colaboraci&oacute;n zonal y un di&aacute;logo a fondo en la fase preparatoria de la Conferencia. <BR>

<P>	Asimismo, la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente ha decidido no inscribir m&aacute;s de dos temas principales por Comisi&oacute;n, para que todas las delegaciones que lo deseen tengan tiempo material para expresar sus opiniones. Se trata, tambi&eacute;n de una restricci&oacute;n necesaria que obliga a establecer ciertas prioridades.<BR>

<P>	Ahora bien, la materia seleccionada es, hasta la fecha, rica y abundante, ya que los temas elegidos son de gran envergadura.[2]<BR>

<P>	Los participantes todav&iacute;a pueden formular otras sugerencias, pero han de tener en cuenta, llegado el caso, las mencionadas restricciones.<BR>

<P>	Adem&aacute;s, ser&aacute; precisa una seria negociaci&oacute;n previa con todos los participantes para poder esbozar un acuerdo en torno a las decisiones que cabe esperar de la Conferencia sobre estos grandes temas. Ello deber&iacute;a, igualmente, permitir a los participantes centrar sus intervenciones (que habr&aacute;n de ser breves) en los puntos que consideren fundamentales.<BR>

<P>	Mucha materia, muchas personas y poco tiempo: cada participante deber&aacute; asumir su parte de responsabilidad para resolver esta ecuaci&oacute;n, cuyos t&eacute;rminos no son modificables. <BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>III. Conclusi&oacute;n</B></H3>
<P>
<P>	La Conferencia Internacional de la Cruz Roja y de la Media Luna Roja no debe generar ilusiones ni aprensi&oacute;n, pero debe ser preparada con detenimiento para poder lograr, con serenidad, los objetivos que de ella se esperan.<BR>

<P>	La lucha en favor de las v&iacute;ctimas de la guerra y de las personas m&aacute;s vulnerables de nuestro planeta ser&aacute; larga y nosotros no veremos su final. As&iacute; pues, no exijamos de la Conferencia m&aacute;s de lo que se puede exigir.<BR>

<P>	En cambio, lo que s&iacute; debemos esperar de ella es que ponga de relieve ciertas situaciones y acciones intolerables; que identifique, en relaci&oacute;n con estas situaciones, medidas encaminadas, tanto a corto como a largo plazo, a mejorar la suerte que corren las personas vulnerables; y, por &uacute;ltimo, un compromiso firme por lo que se refiere a los medios necesarios para poner en pr&aacute;ctica estas medidas.<BR>

<P>	Por consiguiente, la Conferencia debe aspirar a movilizar a los pueblos, que han de considerarla como una ocasi&oacute;n para expresar su solidaridad con las personas que sufren, y tienen que esforzarse por lograr compromisos concretos en los puntos en los que parece posible hacer progesos.<BR>

<P>	Para llegar a estas dos metas, debe evitarse todo tipo de enfrentamientos pol&iacute;ticos o partidistas en la Conferencia; los Gobiernos deben contribuir al m&aacute;ximo, prestando ayuda en la fase preparatoria y con su actitud durante la Conferencia.<BR>

<P>	Ahora bien, el &eacute;xito de la Conferencia depende, aun m&aacute;s, de la actitud de nuestro Movimiento en su conjunto; &eacute;l debe movilizar al p&uacute;blico y a los Gobiernos en todos los pa&iacute;ses del mundo, aprovechando la Conferencia para defender a las personas a quienes desea ayudar y promoviendo el apoyo y la simpat&iacute;a en pro de su acci&oacute;n.<BR>

<P>	Tambi&eacute;n &eacute;l debe infundir un esp&iacute;ritu particular a la Conferencia: el de nuestro Movimiento, que debe hacer de ella un acontecimiento fuera de lo com&uacute;n, distinto de los foros diplom&aacute;ticos normales.<BR>

<P>	Nuestro Movimiento lo conseguir&aacute; si es firme y est&aacute; unido, no ocultando su diversidad sino, al contrario, explicando la fuerza de su complementariedad. Entonces podr&aacute; abordar con serenidad la Conferencia, que debe ser, para todos los participantes, un acontecimiento constructivo, orientado hacia el futuro.<BR>

<P>	Prepar&aacute;ndose en esta l&iacute;nea, nuestro Movimiento contribuir&aacute;, con los Gobiernos, al &eacute;xito de este encuentro, en el que tantas esperanzas se han depositado.<BR>

<H3><B>NOTES</B></H3>
<P>
<P>1 Recordamos que, en el n&uacute;mero anterior de la <I>Revista</I> (n 127, enero-febrero de 1995), se describe detalladamente la Reuni&oacute;n del Grupo Intergubernamental de Expertos y sus recomendaciones (p&aacute;gs. 4-42).<BR>

<P>2  La Comisi&oacute;n Permanente ha seleccionado, hasta la fecha, los siguientes cuatro temas principales:<BR>
	- Derecho internacional humanitario: derecho a la acci&oacute;n  Informe sobre el seguimiento de la Conferencia Internacional para la Protecci&oacute;n de las V&iacute;ctimas de la Guerra;<BR>
	- Protecci&oacute;n de las personas civiles en tiempo de guerra;<BR>
	- Principios e intervenci&oacute;n en la asistencia internacional, as&iacute; como protecci&oacute;n humanitaria internacional;<BR>
	- Potenciar la capacidad para ayudar y proteger a los m&aacute;s vulnerables.<BR>
	<BR>
	Est&aacute; siendo elaborado y ser&aacute; presentado en la sesi&oacute;n de la Comisi&oacute;n Permanente, del 1 y 2 de mayo de 1995, el contenido m&aacute;s detallado de estos temas, que ser&aacute;n debatidos con estos t&iacute;tulos.<BR>
	<BR>
	Por supuesto, se informar&aacute; ulteriormente, en la <I>Revista</I>, acerca de su desarrollo.</P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/Separator_Line_ICRC.gif" BORDER=0><P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/ButtonBar.gif" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#ButtonBar"><BR>

<P><I>&quot;that such a thing should happen at all is unacceptable. That it should happen to those who try to ease the suffering of the victims of a conflict that has claimed the lives of so many makes it even worse. All our endeavour is based on the belief that man retains a fundamental minimum of humanity. Events like this can make it very difficult to maintain this belief. But without it we would have to admit that nothing distinguishes man from beast and that we will not admit&quot;,</I> ICRC Head of Delegation.</TD></TR></TABLE>

<P>
<P>La XXVe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge,<BR>

<P><I>reconnaissant </I>que le d&eacute;veloppement technologique enregistre des progr&egrave;s constants dans de nombreux domaines et que nombre d'Etats d&eacute;ploient des activit&eacute;s dans le domaine nucl&eacute;aire,<BR>

<P><I>consciente </I>qu'il est impossible, dans la mise au point et l'application des techniques existantes ou nouvelles, d'exclure totalement qu'&agrave; tout moment d'&eacute;ventuels incidents techniques ne se transforment soudain en accidents graves ou en catastrophes qui menacent directement la sant&eacute; et la vie d'un grand nombre de personnes,<BR>

<P><I>reconnaissant </I>que des sinistres de ce genre peuvent &eacute;galement se produire sans pour autant repr&eacute;senter une catastrophe, mais exiger n&eacute;anmoins une action imm&eacute;diate et pr&eacute;ventive de la part de tous les organismes dont l'assistance peut &ecirc;tre demand&eacute;e,<BR>

<P><I>sachant </I>que les effets d'accidents graves et de catastrophes peuvent ind&eacute;pendamment du lieu o&ugrave; ils se produisent &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur d'un Etat - se propager sur le territoire d'autres Etats,<BR>

<P><I>consciente </I>que des accidents et catastrophes de ce genre n&eacute;cessitent des mesures sp&eacute;ciales et suppl&eacute;mentaires en mati&egrave;re de pr&eacute;vention, d'assistance ainsi que d'information et de soutien mutuels, mesures qui doivent &ecirc;tre programm&eacute;es et appliqu&eacute;es tant par les Etats que par les organisations internationales,<BR>

<P><I>exprimant le voeu </I>qu'&agrave; cette fin la coop&eacute;ration internationale soit renforc&eacute;e et intensifi&eacute;e,<BR>

<P><I>reconnaissant </I>que le Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge est plus particuli&egrave;rement tenu d'exercer les activit&eacute;s d'assistance et d'appui mutuel dans toutes sortes de catastrophes,<BR>

<P><I>reconnaissant </I>la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; pour le Mouvement de s'attaquer de mani&egrave;re plus compl&egrave;te et plus &eacute;nergique que jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent au probl&egrave;me des dangers et cons&eacute;quences &eacute;ventuels des catastrophes techniques et autres en vue d'offrir une assistance meilleure et plus appropri&eacute;e,<BR>

<P><I>notant avec gratitude </I>que les membres de l'Agence internationale de l'&eacute;nergie atomique r&eacute;unis &agrave; Vienne ont r&eacute;cemment adopt&eacute; une Convention relative &agrave; la notification rapide des accidents nucl&eacute;aires et &agrave; l'assistance mutuelle,<BR>

<P>1.<I> prie </I>les gouvernements d'intensifier leur collaboration internationale future pour la mise au point et l'application sans danger de techniques nouvelles et de s'efforcer de conclure de nouveaux accords bilat&eacute;raux et multilat&eacute;raux relatifs &agrave; une information mutuelle, rapide et compl&egrave;te ainsi qu'&agrave; des mesures d'assistance mutuelle,<BR>

<P><I>2. recommande </I>aux gouvernements et aux organisations internationales, lorsqu'ils concluent des accords et conventions de ce genre, de tenir d&ucirc;ment compte aussi de l'aptitude de leur Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge et du Mouvement tout entier &agrave; participer &agrave; l'action de secours et de les inclure d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but dans leur syst&egrave;me d'information,<BR>

<P><I>3. recommande </I>en outre aux gouvernements d'appuyer &eacute;nergiquement leur Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge dans ses efforts pour am&eacute;liorer leur capacit&eacute; d'assistance dans ce domaine,<BR>

<P><I>4. demande </I>aux Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge d'intervenir avec leur gouvernement de la mani&egrave;re indiqu&eacute;e ci-dessus et de s'efforcer d'am&eacute;liorer leur propre capacit&eacute; d'assistance,<BR>

<P><I>5. encourage </I>les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge &agrave; intensifier leurs efforts en vue de parvenir &agrave; des accords et engagements bilat&eacute;raux et multilat&eacute;raux d'assistance mutuelle en cas de grande catastrophe de toute nature,<BR>

<P><I>6. recommande &agrave; </I>la Ligue des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et &agrave; l'Institut Henry-Dunant d'entreprendre une &eacute;tude sur les possibilit&eacute;s et les n&eacute;cessit&eacute;s d'une meilleure assistance du Mouvement en cas de catastrophe technique ou autre, et &agrave; rendre compte des r&eacute;sultats de cette &eacute;tude &agrave; la prochaine Conf&eacute;rence internationale,<BR>

<P><I>7. demande </I>au Mouvement de ne pas ralentir ses efforts tendant &agrave; appuyer les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge lorsqu'elles cherchent &agrave; conclure des accords d'assistance mutuelle en cas de catastrophe technique ou de catastrophe de toute nature, d'une fa&ccedil;on aussi compl&egrave;te que possible et dans un esprit de solidarit&eacute; humaine, et &agrave; proc&eacute;der &agrave; un &eacute;change r&eacute;gulier de leurs exp&eacute;riences.<BR>

<H3><B>Introduction</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Les op&eacute;rations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies ont connu une croissance sans pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, et plus particuli&egrave;rement en 1992.  Entre 1945 et 1987, treize de ces op&eacute;rations ont &eacute;t&eacute; accomplies, alors que depuis, quatorze autres ont vu le jour.  En 1992 m&ecirc;me, trois nouvelles op&eacute;rations ont &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;es au Cambodge, dans l'ex-Yougoslavie et en Somalie, et, en 1993, une autre au Mozambique.  Au cours de l'ann&eacute;e 1992, le nombre de personnel de l'ONU engag&eacute; sur le terrain a &eacute;t&eacute;<B> </B>quadrupl&eacute; et d&eacute;passe 50.000 personnes, avec un budget total qui a atteint environ 2,5 milliards de dollars &agrave; la fin de 1992 [1].<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Forces des Nations Unies pour le maintien de la paix: d&eacute;finition et caract&eacute;ristiques </B>[2]</H3>
<P>
<P>Les Forces des Nations Unies pour le maintien de la paix (ci-apr&egrave;s FMP) ne sont ni les forces arm&eacute;es que le Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; pourrait constituer lui-m&ecirc;me, en vertu des articles 43 et 47 de la Charte des Nations Unies, ni celles mises sur pied par les Etats Membres, sur la base d'une invitation (comme en Cor&eacute;e, en 1950) ou d'une autorisation (les cas du Golfe, en 1990, et de la Somalie, en 1992) du Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, ces deux forces pouvant utiliser des mesures coercitives afin de <I>r&eacute;tablir </I>la paix internationale et la s&eacute;curit&eacute; (ou des conditions suffisantes de s&eacute;curit&eacute;) dans la r&eacute;gion concern&eacute;e.<BR>

<P>Les FMP diff&eacute;rent des forces pr&eacute;cit&eacute;es, tout d'abord de par leur mandat, qui est de <I>maintenir </I>la paix [3].  Dans ce domaine, on peut distinguer entre deux grands types d'op&eacute;rations men&eacute;es par l'ONU. L'un consiste en l'envoi d'une <I>mission d'observation.  </I>Par exemple, l'organisme des Nations Unies charg&eacute; de la surveillance de la tr&ecirc;ve en Palestine (ONUST), 1948, et le Groupe d'observateurs militaires des Nations Unies dans l'Inde et le Pakistan (UNMOGIP) en Inde et au Pakistan, 1949.  Ici, les membres de la mission n'ont qu'une fonction <I>d'observation, </I>&agrave; l'exclusion de toute possibilit&eacute; de jouer un r&ocirc;le actif.   En outre, ils ne sont pas arm&eacute;s.  Ce ne sont donc pas ces forces-l&agrave; qui sont concern&eacute;es par les questions d'applicabilit&eacute; du droit international humanitaire (ci-apr&egrave;s DIH).<BR>

<P>L'autre grand type d'op&eacute;rations est celui o&ugrave; les forces de l'ONU ont le mandat sp&eacute;cifique de <I>maintenir </I>la paix, en surveillant les accords d'armistice ou de cessez-le-feu, qui constituent une condition pr&eacute;alable pour le d&eacute;ploiement de ces forces.  Par cons&eacute;quent, une op&eacute;ration de maintien de la paix est un arrangement int&eacute;rimaire, visant &agrave; entretenir les conditions de paix et de s&eacute;curit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaires, notamment en emp&ecirc;chant la reprise des hostilit&eacute;s, pour permettre aux n&eacute;gociations sur un r&egrave;glement du diff&eacute;rend en question d'aboutir.  L'id&eacute;e est que la pr&eacute;sence physique d'une force multinationale, neutre et impartiale aurait sur les combattants un important caract&egrave;re dissuasif.  De telles FMP ont &eacute;t&eacute; constitu&eacute;es pour la premi&egrave;re fois en 1956: Premi&egrave;re Force d'urgence des Nations Unies (FUNU I, dans le Sina&iuml; et &agrave; Gaza), et continuent &agrave; l'&ecirc;tre aujourd'hui: Force de Protection des Nations Unies (FORPRONU) dans l'ex-Yougoslavie, Autorit&eacute; provisoire des Nations Unies au Cambodge (APRONUC).<BR>

<P>Les contingents affect&eacute;s aux FMP sont fournis par des Etats, sur une base volontaire, &agrave; la demande du Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'ONU.  En outre, le gouvernement sur le territoire duquel les FMP doivent se rendre, ainsi que l'autre ou les autres parties au conflit directement impliqu&eacute;es, doivent accorder leur consentement.<BR>

<P>Les FMP sont plac&eacute;es sous le commandement de l'ONU, confi&eacute; au Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, mais sous l'autorit&eacute; du Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, qu'il tient pleinement inform&eacute; du d&eacute;roulement des op&eacute;rations.  Le commandement sur le terrain est exerc&eacute; par un commandant de la Force, nomm&eacute; par le Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral avec l'assentiment du Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;.  Le commandant rel&egrave;ve du Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.<BR>

<P>Toutefois, la caract&eacute;ristique des FMP qui soul&egrave;ve de mani&egrave;re directe la question de l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH est que ces Forces sont <I>arm&eacute;es.  </I>Il serait utile ici de citer le paragraphe pertinent du rapport qui a &eacute;t&eacute; demand&eacute; au Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral par le Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; en vue de l'&eacute;tablissement, le 19 mars 1978, de la Force int&eacute;rimaire des Nations Unies au Liban (FINUL) [4].<BR>

<P><I>D) La Force recevra des armes de caract&egrave;re d&eacute;fensif.  Elle ne</I> <I>devra faire usage de la force qu'en cas de l&eacute;gitime d&eacute;fense.  La l&eacute;gitime d&eacute;fense comprendrait la r&eacute;sistance &agrave; toute tentative de l'emp&ecirc;cher par la force de s'acquitter de ses fonctions, conform&eacute;ment au</I> <I>mandat du Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;.  La Force partira de l'hypoth&egrave;se que</I> <I>les parties au conflit prendront toutes les mesures n&eacute;cessaires pour</I> <I>assurer l'observation des d&eacute;cisions du Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute;,</I><BR>

<P>Les probl&egrave;mes th&eacute;oriques et pratiques li&eacute;s &agrave; la r&eacute;alisation de la mission des FMP dans les limites pos&eacute;es par le principe directeur susmentionn&eacute; sans violer pour autant le DIH seront examin&eacute;s plus loin, &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re des mandats de ces Forces dans les cas actuels de l'ex-Yougoslavie et du Cambodge.  Il suffit de souligner ici le risque r&eacute;el de voir les FMP entra&icirc;n&eacute;s dans un conflit, ce qui est arriv&eacute; lors de leur op&eacute;ration au Congo men&eacute;e en juillet 1960 [5]. De ce fait, la question de l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP comprend deux aspects: le respect du DIH par ces Forces; le r&ocirc;le que ces Forces peuvent jouer pour contribuer au respect du DIH.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP: position du CICR et de la Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge</B></H3>
<P>
<P>A plusieurs reprises, le CICR ainsi que la Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge ont affirm&eacute; leur point de vue quant &agrave; l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP. On pourrait citer quelques exemples de ces affirmations, exprim&eacute;es &agrave; plusieurs occasions et sous des formes diverses.<BR>

<P><B>Sur le plan officiel, </B>on mentionnera le <I>M&eacute;morandum, </I>Application et diffusion des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve du 10 novembre 1961, adress&eacute; aux Etats parties aux Conventions et membres de l'ONU, par lequel le CICR attire l'attention du Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Nations Unies sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'assurer l'application des Conventions par les Forces mises &agrave; disposition de l'Organisation. Constatant que l'ONU n'est pas, comme telle, partie aux Conventions, le CICR estime que chaque Etat reste individuellement responsable de l'application de ces Conventions lorsqu'il fournit un contingent aux Nations Unies et, par cons&eacute;quent, qu'il devrait faire le n&eacute;cessaire, sous forme notamment d'instructions, avant que ses troupes ne quittent le pays.<BR>

<P>Le M&eacute;morandum souligne &eacute;galement qu'en vertu de l'article premier commun aux quatre Conventions, qui engage les Hautes Parties contractantes aussi &agrave; faire respecter les Conventions, les Etats fournissant des contingents ... <I>voudront bien, chacun, en cas de</I> <I>besoin, user de leur influence pour que les dispositions du droit humanitaire soient appliqu&eacute;es par l'ensemble des contingents engag&eacute;s,</I> <I>comme par le commandement unifi&eacute;.</I><BR>

<P><I>La r&eacute;solution XXV </I>Application des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve par les forces d'urgence des Nations Unies, adopt&eacute;e par la XXe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge (Vienne, 1965), fait trois recommandations, dont notamment:<BR>

<P>- que des accords appropri&eacute;s soient conclus afin d'assurer que les forces arm&eacute;es mises &agrave; la disposition des Nations Unies observent les r&egrave;gles des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve et soient prot&eacute;g&eacute;es par elles (paragraphe 1); et<BR>

<P>- que les Autorit&eacute;s responsables des contingents acceptent de prendre toutes les mesures n&eacute;cessaires pour pr&eacute;venir et r&eacute;primer les infractions &eacute;ventuelles aux dites Conventions (paragraphe 3).<BR>

<P>De m&ecirc;me, par une <I>lettre </I>adress&eacute;e au Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Nations Unies, le 10 avril 1978, &agrave; l'occasion de la constitution de la FMP au Liban (FINUL) le pr&eacute;sident du CICR rappelle le contenu du m&eacute;morandum et de la r&eacute;solution pr&eacute;cit&eacute;s, d'une part, et, d'autre part, se prononce sur les relations entre les Forces et le CICR, tous deux menant des activit&eacute;s sur le m&ecirc;me terrain, mais en fonction de mandats diff&eacute;rents.  Ainsi, <I>le CICR sait qu'il peut compter sur les Nations</I> <I>Unies et leur Force d'intervention au Liban pour qu'elles y facilitent</I> <I>la libert&eacute; de mouvement de ses d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s et garantissent, dans la</I> <I>mesure du possible, leur s&eacute;curit&eacute; dans les r&eacute;gions o&ugrave; ils doivent</I> <I>d&eacute;ployer leurs activit&eacute;s humanitaires et conventionnelles </I>... .<BR>

<P>A plusieurs reprises, dans des &eacute;tudes et essais, les membres et collaborateurs du CICR ont rappel&eacute; la position de l'institution.  Ainsi, l'obligation pour les forces de l'ONU d'observer les principes fondamentaux des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve ne saurait donc gu&egrave;re &ecirc;tre contest&eacute;e aujourd'hui ... . Quant aux Protocoles, il semble en tout cas que les forces de l'ONU devraient tenir compte des principes [les] ayant inspir&eacute;s ...  [6]. Enfin, il est incontest&eacute; que les Nations Unies sont li&eacute;es par les r&egrave;gles coutumi&egrave;res du DIH quand elles sont engag&eacute;es dans des hostilit&eacute;s [7].<BR>

<P><B>En r&eacute;sum&eacute;, </B>la position du CICR sur l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP et son respect par ces Forces souligne:<BR>

<P>- que les Principes fondamentaux et r&egrave;gles coutumi&egrave;res du DIH sont applicables et doivent donc &ecirc;tre respect&eacute;s;<BR>

<P>- que, pour ce faire, les Etats qui fournissent des contingents ont l'obligation de leur donner des instructions appropri&eacute;es, d'une part, et que les Nations Unies ont la m&ecirc;me obligation &agrave; l'&eacute;gard du commandement unifi&eacute;, d'autre part;<BR>

<P>- que les &eacute;ventuelles infractions au DIH doivent &ecirc;tre r&eacute;prim&eacute;es par les Autorit&eacute;s nationales du contingent concern&eacute;; et<BR>

<P>- que, en raison d'une certaine compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; entre les buts finals de leurs mandats respectifs, les FMP devraient offrir leur coop&eacute;ration au CICR, mais ne devraient en aucun cas entraver ses activit&eacute;s ni remettre en question sa comp&eacute;tence.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Position de l'ONU</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Il serait utile de rappeler certains &eacute;l&eacute;ments importants de la position de l'ONU quant &agrave; l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP.<BR>

<P>Au <B><I>niveau juridique, </I></B>la r&eacute;flexion interne aux Nations Unies portant sur l'adh&eacute;sion de l'organisation aux instruments du DIH a conclu que, premi&egrave;rement, certaines normes des Conventions ne pouvaient s'appliquer &agrave; l'ONU ou &ecirc;tre appliqu&eacute;es par elle: par exemple, celles relatives &agrave; l'occupation (articles 27-78 de la IVe Convention), &agrave; la r&eacute;pression des infractions graves (article 49/50/129/146 commun aux quatre Conventions, article 85, par. 1 du Protocole I, etc.). Deuxi&egrave;mement, &agrave; d&eacute;faut de d&eacute;finition (ou m&ecirc;me de mention) de forces pour le maintien de la paix dans les instruments du DIH, celles-ci pourraient &eacute;ventuellement appara&icirc;tre comme combattantes.  Il conviendrait &eacute;galement de d&eacute;terminer si l'ONU peut ou non &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme Puissance pour adh&eacute;rer aux Conventions.  Enfin, un probl&egrave;me se poserait dans le cas o&ugrave; une m&ecirc;me force comprendrait des troupes d'Etats parties au Protocole I et d'Etats non parties.<BR>

<P>Sur le <B><I>plan politique, </I></B>une demande d'adh&eacute;sion de l'ONU aux trait&eacute;s de DIH, ou m&ecirc;me une tentative d'obtenir une d&eacute;claration g&eacute;n&eacute;rale d'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP (par exemple, sous forme d'une r&eacute;solution de l'Assembl&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale) risquerait d'ouvrir un d&eacute;bat d&eacute;licat sur les Protocoles; d'autre part, ne faire porter cette demande d'adh&eacute;sion que sur les Conventions serait pr&eacute;judiciable &agrave; la promotion du DIH dans son ensemble.<BR>

<P>Finalement, il est &agrave; noter que m&ecirc;me si les soldats qui composent les forces des Nations Unies sont li&eacute;s par les engagements de leur Etat d'origine, l'ONU a toujours insist&eacute; sur le fait que, pendant l'exercice de leur mandat, ces troupes ne rel&egrave;vent que de la comp&eacute;tence propre de l'Organisation et non pas de celle de leur Etat d'origine.<BR>

<P><B><I>Les documents officiels qui viennent &agrave; l'appui de la position de</I></B><B> </B><B><I>l'ONU sont:</I></B><BR>

<P><I>le Interoffice m&eacute;morandum </I>adress&eacute; par MM. Guyer et Urquhart, le 24 mai 1978, &agrave; tous les commandants des Forces de l'ONU alors en exercice et un m&eacute;morandum du commandant en chef des Forces de l'ONU &agrave; tous les commandants de ces Forces (au niveau de l'&eacute;tat-major et des contingents m&ecirc;mes), en date du 30 octobre 1978.  Ce m&eacute;morandum pr&eacute;cise que dans les cas o&ugrave; ces Forces devaient faire usage de leurs armes, en conformit&eacute; avec leur mandat, les principes et l'esprit des r&egrave;gles du DIH telles que contenus (entre autres) dans les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949 et dans leurs Protocoles additionnels de 1977 s'appliqueraient.<BR>

<P>- Dans une <I>lettre </I>adress&eacute;e le 23 octobre 1978 au pr&eacute;sident du CICR, en r&eacute;ponse &agrave; la lettre de ce dernier du 10 avril 1978, le Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'ONU souligne que ... <I>les principes du droit humanitaire</I>... <I>doivent le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant trouver application dans le cadre</I> <I>des op&eacute;rations des Forces des Nations Unies.</I><BR>

<P>- On rel&egrave;ve &eacute;galement la <I>lettre </I>adress&eacute;e par le Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'ONU aux Repr&eacute;sentants permanents des gouvernements envoyant un contingent de la Force des Nations Unies pour le maintien de la paix au Liban (FINUL), du 23 octobre 1978.  Celle-ci rappelle que, dans les situations o&ugrave; les membres desdites Forces devraient faire usage de leurs armes d&eacute;fensives, conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la ligne directrice D, les principes et l'esprit des r&egrave;gles du DIH, <I>tels que</I> <I>contenus </I>inter alia, <I>dans les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve</I>... <I>les Protocoles du 8 juin 1977</I>... <I>doivent s'appliquer.  </I>A cette fin, les Etats fournissant des contingents doivent veiller &agrave; ce que leurs troupes connaissent pleinement les principes du DIH ainsi qu'&agrave; prendre les mesures n&eacute;cessaires pour assurer leur respect.  L'ONU, quant &agrave; elle, ... <I>se charge, par la voie hi&eacute;rarchique militaire, de contr&ocirc;ler</I> <I>l'application effective des principes du droit humanitaire par les</I> <I>contingents des forces de maintien de la paix.</I><BR>

<P><B>En r&eacute;sum&eacute;, </B>la position de l'ONU sur l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP n'est pas enti&egrave;rement satisfaisante.  Il y a certes eu des d&eacute;clarations dans le pass&eacute;.  Cependant, celles-ci &eacute;taient ponctuelles, d'une part, et ne contenaient qu'un engagement de respecter les principes et l'esprit des r&egrave;gles du DIH, d'autre part.  L'ONU pourrait donc examiner les moyens les plus appropri&eacute;s de constater l'applicabilit&eacute; &agrave; ses Forces &eacute;galement des r&egrave;gles pertinentes du DIH qui comprendraient, entre autres, celles relatives aux m&eacute;thodes et moyens de guerre, aux diff&eacute;rentes cat&eacute;gories de personnes prot&eacute;g&eacute;es, au respect des signes distinctifs (notamment la croix rouge et le croissant rouge), au personnel et transport sanitaires.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Probl&eacute;matique actuelle</B></H3>
<P>
<P>A la lumi&egrave;re de toutes les observations faites pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment, on pourrait proc&eacute;der &agrave; un examen de la situation actuelle, en relation avec la d&eacute;cision de l'ONU d'envoyer des FMP dans l'ex-Yougoslavie et au Cambodge.  Il s'agit d'identifier les lacunes et les probl&egrave;mes (existants ou pr&eacute;visibles), tant sur le plan g&eacute;n&eacute;ral (CICR - ONU - Etats fournissant des contingents) que sur le plan op&eacute;rationnel, &agrave; savoir: la mise en oeuvre et le respect du DIH par les FMP elles-m&ecirc;mes, le r&ocirc;le de ces Forces pour contribuer au respect du DIH par les diff&eacute;rentes entit&eacute;s sur place et la coop&eacute;ration entre les FMP et le CICR, et d'envisager les d&eacute;marches &agrave; entreprendre.<BR>

<P><B>Sur le plan g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</B> on constate que l'envoi des FMP dans l'ex-Yougoslavie et au Cambodge n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute; par des d&eacute;marches officielles de l'ONU, destin&eacute;es &agrave; rappeler le r&ocirc;le du DIH, comme il a &eacute;t&eacute; fait lors des occasions ant&eacute;rieures.<BR>

<P>Ceci repr&eacute;sente une lacune qu'il faudra combler, d'autant plus que d'autres op&eacute;rations ont &eacute;t&eacute;, depuis, mises sur pied (Somalie, Mozambique).<BR>

<P>A la date de la r&eacute;daction du pr&eacute;sent articles il n'y a pas eu de constat formel de l'ONU de l'applicabilit&eacute; des r&egrave;gles pertinentes du DIH &agrave; ses Forces.<BR>

<P>Il n'y a pas encore eu de lettre du Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'ONU aux Etats qui fournissent des contingents, telle que celle du 23 octobre 1978, leur rappelant leur obligation d'assurer que ces soldats connaissent pleinement le DIH ainsi que de r&eacute;primer les &eacute;ventuelles infractions.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Actions pour renforcer la diffusion du DIH</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Il convient de souligner ici que la responsabilit&eacute; principale, sur le plan op&eacute;rationnel, d'assurer la mise en oeuvre et le respect du DIH par les FMP incombe &agrave; l'ONU.  Le CICR a eu l'occasion de le rappeler au Secr&eacute;tariat de cette Organisation, tout en se d&eacute;clarant pr&ecirc;t &agrave; l'aider en contribuant &agrave; la diffusion du DIH aupr&egrave;s des FMP, dans la mesure de ses possibilit&eacute;s, notamment en fournissant un plan-cadre d'instructions en DIH qui pourrait &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute; aux besoins sp&eacute;cifiques de chaque FMP.<BR>

<P>De mani&egrave;re plus pr&eacute;cise, diverses actions de diffusion peuvent &ecirc;tre entreprises par le CICR en collaboration avec les Etats concern&eacute;s et l'ONU.<BR>

<P>Une action importante serait la diffusion aupr&egrave;s des contingents, avant leur d&eacute;part, notamment par la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation r&eacute;gionale du CICR.<BR>

<P>Il serait &eacute;galement utile d'envisager une information par la d&eacute;l&eacute;gation du CICR &agrave; New York des commandants des contingents lors de leur passage au si&egrave;ge de l'ONU.<BR>

<P>Enfin, il serait de la plus haute importance d'assurer une diffusion dans le pays d'affectation, par les d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s pr&eacute;sents ou des sp&eacute;cialistes au CICR de la diffusion aux Forces arm&eacute;es.  Ici, comme en d'autres occasions, l'accent pourrait &ecirc;tre mis &eacute;galement sur le fait que l'applicabilit&eacute; et le respect du DIH sont dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t m&ecirc;me des membres des FMP car, dans des situations concr&egrave;tes, ils pourraient se voir entra&icirc;n&eacute;s dans un conflit arm&eacute; et m&ecirc;me d&eacute;tenus par une Partie, et d&egrave;s lors il leur serait plus facile de recourir &agrave; tout le syst&egrave;me de protection et de responsabilit&eacute;s r&eacute;sultant des instruments du DIH.<BR>

<P>On pourrait m&ecirc;me faire un pas de plus et envisager la diffusion des principes et r&egrave;gles fondamentaux du DIH par les FMP elles-m&ecirc;mes aupr&egrave;s des membres des unit&eacute;s arm&eacute;es des parties au conflit en question, avec qui ces Forces pourraient &ecirc;tre amen&eacute;es &agrave; avoir des contacts. Ceci s'inscrirait dans le cadre des responsabilit&eacute;s de ces Forces d&eacute;coulant de l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH, &agrave; savoir de contribuer &agrave; faire respecter ce droit.  Les d&eacute;marches concr&egrave;tes &agrave; prendre seraient d'identifier ou, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, d'encourager la nomination d'un responsable des affaires humanitaires au sein des FMP afin de cr&eacute;er un groupe d'officiers qui, eux, pourraient enseigner le DIH aussi bien au sein des FMP qu'aux forces arm&eacute;es dans la r&eacute;gion concern&eacute;e.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Mise en oeuvre et respect du DIH par les FMP</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Il conviendrait de relever tr&egrave;s bri&egrave;vement les points essentiels du mandat des FMP dans l'ex-Yougoslavie (FORPRONU) et au Cambodge (APRONUC) ayant (ou susceptibles d'avoir) trait &agrave; l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH, d'une part, et aux activit&eacute;s men&eacute;es par le CICR dans ces r&eacute;gions, d'autre part [9].<BR>

<P>Dans les deux cas, les FMP auront des composantes militaire, administrative et de police.  La t&acirc;che de la composante militaire sera de stabiliser la situation en mati&egrave;re de s&eacute;curit&eacute; et d'instaurer un climat de confiance propice &agrave; une solution n&eacute;goci&eacute;e &agrave; la crise yougoslave et &agrave; la tenue des &eacute;lections au Cambodge.  Pour ce faire, les FMP superviseront le cessez-le-feu, le retrait de toutes les cat&eacute;gories de forces &eacute;trang&egrave;res du Cambodge et des zones d&eacute;militaris&eacute;es en Yougoslavie, notamment en d&eacute;sarmant et d&eacute;mobilisant les combattants et en prot&eacute;geant les personnes habitant dans les zones d&eacute;militaris&eacute;es contre toute attaque arm&eacute;e en &eacute;rigeant des points de passage aux endroits strat&eacute;giques. Les membres des FMP porteront des armes l&eacute;g&egrave;res qu'ils utiliseront uniquement en cas de l&eacute;gitime d&eacute;fense, mais disposeront &eacute;galement des v&eacute;hicules blind&eacute;s pour le transport de troupes et d'un appui de l'aviation.<BR>

<P>Il y a l&agrave; un vaste champ d'application du DIH couvrant la conduite des hostilit&eacute;s le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, mais surtout l'ensemble des principes et r&egrave;gles du DIH relatifs aux diff&eacute;rentes cat&eacute;gories de personnes prot&eacute;g&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>L'autre composante des FMP, la police civile, quoique non arm&eacute;e, aura pour t&acirc;che de superviser de pr&egrave;s le travail de la police locale pour garantir le maintien effectif et impartial de l'ordre public et le plein respect des droits de l'homme et des libert&eacute;s fondamentales.  A cette fin, ces forces de police civile accompagneront les membres de la police locale dans leurs patrouilles et auront un acc&egrave;s libre et imm&eacute;diat &agrave; tous les locaux et facilit&eacute;s de la police locale ou sous son contr&ocirc;le.<BR>

<P>Ici, mais &eacute;galement par rapport aux activit&eacute;s des FMP mentionn&eacute;es au paragraphe pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent, se pose toute la question de la d&eacute;tention et du mandat du CICR.<BR>

<P>Le mandat de la composante militaire des FMP ne fait aucune mention de leur comp&eacute;tence de faire des prisonniers.  Cependant, l'&eacute;tendue de leur mandat, bri&egrave;vement rappel&eacute; ci-dessus, laisse croire que dans des situations particuli&egrave;rement tendues, elles pourraient proc&eacute;der &agrave; des arrestations si l'enjeu l'exigeait.  Tel fut le cas, une fois dans le pass&eacute;, lors de l'op&eacute;ration des Nations Unies au Congo, et le r&ocirc;le du CICR dans de telles circonstances ressort clairement dans la description de ces &eacute;v&eacute;nements par un sp&eacute;cialiste [10].<BR>

<P>La force de police civile de l'ONU a, par contre, le mandat sp&eacute;cifique de superviser toutes les activit&eacute;s de la police locale et jouit d'un libre acc&egrave;s &agrave; tous leurs locaux.  Cela signifie que tous les d&eacute;tenus de la police locale tombent sous la supervision de la police civile de l'ONU.<BR>

<P>Quant &agrave; la comp&eacute;tence du CICR, oeuvrant sur le m&ecirc;me terrain que les FMP, elle est plut&ocirc;t claire dans des situations de conflit arm&eacute; international, o&ugrave; il peut invoquer le r&eacute;gime juridique des dispositions pertinentes des Ille et IVe Conventions pour visiter des prisonniers de guerre et intern&eacute;s civils ou superviser leur lib&eacute;ration.  La question est plus d&eacute;licate lorsqu'il s'agit des situations de conflit arm&eacute; non international.  Dans ces cas, il serait pr&eacute;f&eacute;rable que le mandat du CICR soit inscrit dans un accord g&eacute;n&eacute;ral (exemple: l'Accord de Paris pour un r&egrave;glement politique du conflit au Cambodge), &agrave; d&eacute;faut de quoi le CICR devrait n&eacute;gocier un accord avec l'ONU.<BR>

<P>Sur la question de la communication des rapports de visite, la position du CICR est claire.  En r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, les rapports relatifs aux visites de prisonniers captur&eacute;s par les forces des Nations Unies sont remis &agrave; la Puissance d'origine, &agrave; l'ONU ainsi qu'aux gouvernements des Etats ayant fourni les contingents qui ont captur&eacute; les prisonniers visit&eacute;s ou qui en ont la garde.<BR>

<P>Un autre domaine d'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH aux FMP est sans doute le respect et la protection que ces forces doivent &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de l'embl&egrave;me et du personnel, des transports et des unit&eacute;s sanitaires.  Dans la pratique aussi bien ant&eacute;rieure que r&eacute;cente, cela ne semble pas avoir pos&eacute; de probl&egrave;me.  En revanche, dans le cadre de la diffusion du DIH dans les pays d'affectation des FMP, ces forces pourraient contribuer &agrave; promouvoir le respect plus particuli&egrave;rement pour l'embl&egrave;me et les diff&eacute;rents &eacute;l&eacute;ments de l'activit&eacute; m&eacute;dicale du CICR aupr&egrave;s des unit&eacute;s arm&eacute;es des parties au conflit.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>R&ocirc;le que peuvent jouer les FMP pour contribuer au respect du DIH</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Il s'agit ici d'examiner de quelle mani&egrave;re les FMP pourraient faire respecter le DIH par les forces arm&eacute;es des parties au conflit, les forces de police et la population.<BR>

<P>Un moyen serait l'&eacute;tablissement de rapports sur les violations du DIH dans les secteurs o&ugrave; les FMP sont d&eacute;ploy&eacute;es.  Or, les mandats aussi bien de la FORPRONU que de l'APRONUC [11] pr&eacute;voient que certaines de leurs composantes (la force de police civile dans l'ex-Yougoslavie, la composante relative aux droits de l'homme au Cambodge) auront la t&acirc;che d'enqu&ecirc;ter sur des all&eacute;gations de violations des droits de l'homme et la composante militaire (dans le cas de l'ex-Yougoslavie) sur les all&eacute;gations de violations des zones d&eacute;militaris&eacute;es.   Il conviendrait au Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de veiller &agrave; ce que les FMP fassent de m&ecirc;me par rapport aux violations du DIH, dont certaines comprennent &eacute;galement celles des droits de l'homme; ces rapports pourraient &ecirc;tre communiqu&eacute;s aux parties concern&eacute;es et/ou au Conseil de s&eacute;curit&eacute; afin que cessent les violations et que des sanctions appropri&eacute;es soient prises envers les responsables.  Dans ce contexte, aussi bien les Etats concern&eacute;s que l'ONU pourraient promouvoir l'application de l'article 89 du Protocole I (coop&eacute;ration) [12] et, accessoirement, le r&ocirc;le de la Commission internationale d'&eacute;tablissement des faits (ci-apr&egrave;s CIEF).<BR>

<P>Rappelons ici que tout appel &eacute;ventuel aux services de la CIEF ne concerne pas automatiquement un conflit international car lors de sa r&eacute;union constitutive, les 12 et 13 mars 1992 &agrave; Berne, la CIEF s'est d&eacute;clar&eacute;e pr&ecirc;te &agrave; oeuvrer m&ecirc;me dans des situations de guerre civile, si les parties le lui demandaient.<BR>

<P>Enfin, les FMP pourraient &eacute;galement jouer un r&ocirc;le de pr&eacute;vention, notamment en &eacute;tablissant un contr&ocirc;le des forces militaires ou paramilitaires op&eacute;rant dans les secteurs o&ugrave; lesdites Forces des Nations Unies sont d&eacute;ploy&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H3><B>Coop&eacute;ration entre les FMP et le CICR</B></H3>
<P>
<P>Il peut (et devrait) &eacute;galement y avoir des possibilit&eacute;s de coop&eacute;ration et de coordination entre les activit&eacute;s humanitaires des FMP et celles du CICR.  C'est ce qu'indique un examen de la pratique exerc&eacute;e jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, o&ugrave; la collaboration op&eacute;rationnelle a port&eacute; sur la recherche de personnes, les visites, les secours, les enqu&ecirc;tes, la lib&eacute;ration et le rapatriement des prisonniers de guerre, les &eacute;vacuations, le transport, les services sanitaires.<BR>

<P>On pourrait citer certains cas &agrave; titre d'exemples:<BR>

<P>Dans le cadre des op&eacute;rations de la Force des Nations Unies charg&eacute;e du maintien de la paix &agrave; Chypre (UNFICYP, d&egrave;s mars 1964), un des rapports du Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de l'ONU avait pr&eacute;cis&eacute;: <I>En ce</I> <I>qui concerne les activit&eacute;s humanitaires, une r&eacute;union a eu lieu </I>.... <I>avec</I> <I>des repr&eacute;sentants du Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR),</I> <I>et il a &eacute;t&eacute; convenu que la Croix-Rouge assumerait la responsabilit&eacute;</I> <I>principale pour ce qui est de fournir des secours et de s'occuper des</I> <I>r&eacute;fugi&eacute;s, des prisonniers, des disparus, des all&eacute;gations d'atrocit&eacute;s et</I> <I>autres probl&egrave;mes semblables qui sont traditionnellement de la comp&eacute;tence du CICR.  La force continuera &agrave; jouer un r&ocirc;le actif, y compris</I> <I>pour les enqu&ecirc;tes et les n&eacute;gociations locales, et elle contribuera et</I> <I>coop&eacute;rera sans r&eacute;serve &agrave; l'ex&eacute;cution des op&eacute;rations humanitaires de secours </I>[13].<BR>

<P>A propos des investigations susmentionn&eacute;es, une r&eacute;solution de l'Assembl&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale avait demand&eacute; au Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, ... <I>de</I> <I>fournir ses bons offices, par l'interm&eacute;diaire de son repr&eacute;sentant</I> <I>sp&eacute;cial &agrave; Chypre, pour appuyer, avec la participation du Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge, la cr&eacute;ation d'une commission d'enqu&ecirc;te</I> <I>qui puisse agir avec impartialit&eacute;, efficacit&eacute; et rapidit&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on &agrave;</I> <I>r&eacute;soudre le probl&egrave;me dans les meilleurs d&eacute;lais </I>....  [14].<BR>

<P>De m&ecirc;me, &agrave; Chypre, <I>en raison du blocus de certaines zones habit&eacute;es par des Cypriotes turcs, le CICR (s'est efforc&eacute;), conjointement</I> <I>avec les Nations Unies, d'obtenir, de la part du gouvernement local,</I> <I>les all&eacute;gements </I>... <I>(permettant) &agrave; ces zones de recevoir malgr&eacute; tout du ravitaillement</I> [15].<BR>

<P>Dans le contexte des op&eacute;rations des Nations Unies au Congo (ONUC), une note du repr&eacute;sentant sp&eacute;cial du Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral a soulign&eacute;: <I>Le Secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</I>........ <I>r&eacute;it&egrave;re sa demande que les</I> <I>Nations Unies soient autoris&eacute;es &agrave; rendre de nouveau visite aux</I> <I>personnes d&eacute;tenues pour se rendre compte de la mani&egrave;re dont elles</I> <I>sont trait&eacute;es, par l'interm&eacute;diaire de repr&eacute;sentants de la Croix-Rouge</I> ...  [16]. Hormis ces visites, le CICR a m&ecirc;me organis&eacute; des &eacute;changes de prisonniers [17].<BR>

<P>Actuellement, au Cambodge, m&ecirc;me si le rapatriement est de la comp&eacute;tence principale du HCR, toute l'infrastructure m&eacute;dicale et chirurgicale du CICR au Cambodge est &eacute;videmment &agrave; la disposition des personnes rapatri&eacute;es.  Par ailleurs, le CICR entreprend un effort particulier dans le domaine de l'Agence centrale de recherches dans les zones contr&ocirc;l&eacute;es par les factions.  De plus, l'institution pourrait &ecirc;tre amen&eacute;e &agrave; s'occuper de la protection des minorit&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>En ex-Yougoslavie, la FORPRONU a r&eacute;uni les g&eacute;n&eacute;raux Mladi&eacute; et Halilovic &agrave; Sarajevo les 17 et 18 avril 1993.  L'accord sign&eacute; &agrave; l'issue de ces discussions, fixant le cessez-le-feu et la d&eacute;militarisation de Srebrenica, mentionne le CICR dont le r&ocirc;le consiste, d'une part, &agrave; participer &agrave; l'&eacute;vacuation des malades et bless&eacute;s graves et, d'autre part, de surveiller l'&eacute;change de prisonniers et de bless&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>Dans le but de poursuivre cette coop&eacute;ration humanitaire avec les FMP, le CICR s'efforce d'en identifier les domaines propices et de n&eacute;gocier, dans la mesure o&ugrave; la situation qui pr&eacute;vaut le permet, des arrangements ad hoc avec le commandement des FMP.<BR>

<P><B><I>En conclusion, </I></B>on peut constater que:<BR>

<P>- le DIH est en effet applicable aux FMP;<BR>

<P>- l'ONU a, par le pass&eacute;, reconnu l'applicabilit&eacute; au moins des principes et de l'esprit des r&egrave;gles de ce droit;<BR>

<P>- un engagement par l'ONU visant &agrave; renforcer l'applicabilit&eacute; du DIH &agrave; ses Forces repr&eacute;senterait une excellente contribution &agrave; la promotion de l'applicabilit&eacute; et du respect du DIH par les Etats fournissant des contingents, par l'Etat sur le territoire duquel se d&eacute;roule l'op&eacute;ration, ainsi que par toutes les parties au conflit.  Une telle promotion du DIH est en effet un but de la communaut&eacute; internationale, exprim&eacute; dans les r&eacute;solutions que l'Assembl&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des Nations Unies adopte tous les deux ans depuis 1977 sur le statut des Protocoles additionnels aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve [18].<BR>

<P>Il reste n&eacute;anmoins beaucoup &agrave; faire pour renforcer la mise en oeuvre et le respect du DIH par les FMP, notamment au niveau formel mais aussi sur le plan op&eacute;rationnel, en vue des op&eacute;rations en cours et celles &agrave; venir. Le CICR est actuellement en train d'en examiner les moyens les plus appropri&eacute;s et compte sur le concours en la mati&egrave;re des Etats et des Nations Unies.<BR>

<P>10. Circumstances developed in a way that it became necessary for the UN peace-keeping force to arrest and detain some of the foreign mercenaries who took up arms against the UN.  A contingent of the mercenaries was actually captured in a field op&eacute;ration and detained under UN custody at the Kamina military base in Central Congo. The detainees were treated according to the rules laid down in the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Part III on Prisoners of War. The UN handling of the detainees was supervised by ICRC repr&eacute;sentatives, dans Bjom Egge, Coordinating UN peace-keeping op&eacute;rations and relief and refuges programmes, <I>Paper submitted to the</I> <I>Nordic UN Seminar, </I>Oslo, 29 June 1988, p.13.<BR>

<P>12 Dans le cas de violations graves des Conventions ou du pr&eacute;sent Protocole, les Hautes Parties contractantes s'engagent &agrave; agir, tant conjointement que s&eacute;par&eacute;ment, en coop&eacute;ration avec l'Organisation des Nations Unies et conform&eacute;ment &agrave; la Charte des Nations Unies (article 89, Protocole I).<BR>

<P>Agir pour la protection de l'homme, y compris en temps de conflit arm&eacute;, r&eacute;pond aux buts des Nations Unies autant que le maintien de la paix et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute; internationales.  L'Organisation a manifest&eacute; cette pr&eacute;occupation sous deux aspects principaux : par sa participation au processus de r&eacute;affirmation et de d&eacute;veloppement du droit international humanitaire; par ses r&eacute;solutions pronon&ccedil;ant l'applicabilit&eacute; et demandant l'application du droit humanitaire &agrave; des situations ou &agrave; des cat&eacute;gories de personnes donn&eacute;es, ainsi que par ses rapports &eacute;valuant l'application et le respect de ce droit.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Humanitarian law in the Articles of War decreed in 1621 by King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden</H2>
<P><I>By Kenneth &Ouml;gren</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>Kenneth &Ouml;gren </I></B><I>holds a Master of Law degree from the University of Uppsala (Sweden). He has attended the Warsaw Course on International Humanitarian Law, organized by the Polish Red Cross and the ICRC. He has also served with UNIFIL and with the Swedish Field Hospital during the Gulf War.</I><BR>

<P>
<P>In July 1621 several regiments of the Swedish army were assembled at Arsta Meadow south of Stockholm awaiting transport by ship to the Baltic, where they were to fight the Russian forces which had invaded the provinces in early summer [1]. It was on this occasion that they heard for the first time the new<I> Articles of War</I> read to them by chancellor Axel Oxenstierna. The text had been drafted by King Gustavus himself and revised by Oxenstierna the preceding spring, and the final decree had been signed by the King at camp on 15 July [2].<BR>

<P>The <I>Articles </I>were indeed new in certain respects, but they were also based on familiar continental models and earlier Swedish texts. They borrowed something from the code of Ferdinand of Hungary (1526), something from the famous code of Maximilian II (1570) and something from the code of Maurice of Nassau (1590). The presence of numerous transcripts of continental codes in the Stockholm archives makes it clear that great care was taken to consult the systems used abroad. Yet the<I> Articles </I>differed in certain important respects from other codes of military law of that age. Earlier codes were closer in nature to an agreement between contracting parties, whereas King Gustavus' text comprised a set of orders. The <I>Articles</I> also differed from similar codes in that they established a hierarchy of military jurisdiction: inferior court martial, presided over by a colonel; superior court martial, presided over by a marshal; and final appeal to the King. This system was supplemented with special military prosecutors and a general auditor in charge of supervising the application of the rules, thereby strengthening the entire system of military justice. In other respects, the <I>Articles</I> did not differ much from existing codes : punishments were severe, at times draconian, and the death penalty was imposed for more than forty offences.<BR>

<P>After the Swedish army entered the Thirty Years  War, the soldiers of King Gustavus maintained, for some time, a good reputation. However, despite abundant evidence that the officers did their best to maintain high standards of behaviour, discipline broke down in the early 1630s as a direct result of the King's inability to pay his troops. In April 1631, Frankfurt an der Oder - an allied Protestant town - was savagely sacked and the following year G&ouml;ttingen was also plundered. King Gustavus vacillated a little in this state of affairs. To a complaint made in 1632 the King answered that &quot;war is war and soldiers are not novices&quot;. But on the whole he continued to struggle for more humanity in warfare, and when asked by George William of Brandenburg what to do with some Swedish officers who had committed outrages, he replied: &quot;Has my brother-in-law no gallows in his country, or is he short of timber?&quot;. At Mainz, in 1632, the King had the Articles published in German, with additions and changes, as a means of enforcing stronger discipline. <BR>

<P>The <I>Articles of War </I>decreed by King Gustavus comprise 150 articles, only seven of which can be said to contain humanitarian rules. Article 88 stipulates: &quot;He that forces any Woman to abuse her; and the matter be proved, he shall dye for it&quot;. This short and clear rule of law prescribes the same punishment as was found for that offence in most civil penal codes of the time. Article 90, which prohibits soldiers from setting fire to a town or village in a friendly country, clearly constitutes another fundamental humanitarian rule. Article 91 lays down the same rule for enemy territory, although it provides for one exception: a captain may order a town or village burned with the consent of the King or his marshal. The thinking behind this article is clear since the punishment for disregarding the prohibition is not penal but compensatory: a captain who wrongly ordered his troops to start a fire had to pay compensation for the loss of booty caused by the flames. <BR>

<P>Articles 99 and 100 contain the most clearly defined humanitarian rules: Article 99 stipulates that no churches or hospitals may be pillaged even if a city is taken by force and general plundering allowed. An exception to this rule is made for buildings used in defending the city. Article 100 prohibits the setting on fire of churches, hospitals and schools, and it forbids ill-treatment of clergymen, the elderly, women and children, provided they do not put up armed resistance.<BR>

<P>Although the humanitarian rules contained in the <I>Articles of War </I>are of a very rudimentary nature, they nevertheless point to the ever-present need for a measure of humanity in the midst of warfare. They also give us an idea of what existed in the way of humanitarian law before the publication of Grotius' <I>De Jure Belli ac Pacis </I>in 1625 and appear to have been inspired by Gentili's 1612 <I>De Jure Belli. </I><BR>

<P>Gustavus' Articles of War were, as previously said, at least in part an innovation. Compared with the code of Maximilian II - which contained humanitarian rules only in Articles 8 and 9 - they gave broader and better protection to civilians against some of the horrors of war. Enforcement was as much a problem then as today, and in this respect the Articles constituted a major improvement. With the establishment of specific rules and a hierarchy of court martials, the behaviour of combatants became a matter of law and there is evidence that the rules were applied for all categories of both officers and enlisted men. <BR>

<P>The impact of Gustavus' <I>Articles </I>should not, however, be overestimated. In much of Germany and Bohemia, the Swede, the Turk and the devil had much the same reputation. &quot;Sveda&quot; passed into the Czech language as a word for a criminal or ragged fellow. In Germany, a saying still goes <I>Bet Kind, bet Kind, morgen kommt der Schwede </I>[3]. Nevertheless, the Articles of War had a considerable influence and served as a model for the later development of the law of war in Europe. Swedish commanders who served under Gustavus carried the <I>Articles of War</I> with them when they went abroad and thus spread the law and its fundamental rules on humanity and protection wherever they travelled.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Introduction Western and Central Europe and the Balkans</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>In 1994 the ICRC was obliged to strengthen its presence in Western and Central Europe and the Balkans in order to respond to new crisis situations, launch dissemination and information programmes and develop cooperation with the international organizations present in the region. Cooperation with National Red Cross Societies also took on a new dimension in 1994.<BR>

<P>The fighting continued in Bosnia-Herzegovina and tension remained high in the United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs) in Croatia. Owing to the difficulty in finding global political settlements, the peoples of the former Yugoslavia were unable to regain their stability, and the ICRC maintained a large number of staff in the Balkans so that it could continue to assist all the victims of the various conflicts.<BR>

<P>In Bosnia-Herzegovina a large-scale reconstruction programme in Sarajevo and Mostar and a gradual return of refugees had been expected, but the situation on the front lines remained relatively static during the year. For the civilian population this meant a total lack of freedom of movement, which prevented the return of internally displaced people to their homes. The ICRC thus had to take steps to enhance respect for civilians, especially minorities, and to assist thousands of victims of the fighting or of repression. Despite the efforts of the international community and the institution, it unfortunately proved impossible to persuade certain actors in the conflict to relinquish the aim of establishing homogeneous ethnic areas in the regions under their control. The practice of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot;, which took on different forms but remained unacceptable, was thus pursued in some parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.<BR>

<P>To meet new needs arising largely from the prolongation of the conflict, the ICRC asked some 15 National Red Cross Societies to help it distribute emergency aid and set up rehabilitation programmes, mainly in the medical and sanitation sectors. This rehabilitation effort in the midst of an emergency is in line with the policy of continuity that the ICRC wants to establish in this type of situation, to help the population survive in conditions of decency and dignity.<BR>

<P>The ICRC presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the UNPAs facilitated dialogue between the various international protagonists in the field concerning the distribution of tasks. The ICRC's independent approach enabled it, at a time when NATO was threatening to intervene, to maintain a presence throughout the territory with the necessary guarantees from all the parties to the conflict, which recognized its neutral and independent position.<BR>

<P>Close ties were maintained with UNHCR and UNPROFOR (United Nations Protection Force) in order to avoid duplication of effort, particularly in the distribution of aid, and to guarantee the efficacy of humanitarian negotiation, which must be kept separate from discussion on political and military matters. There were also regular exchanges of views with representatives of European bodies (ECMM: European Community Monitoring Mission), (ECTF: European Community Task Force), (CSCE: Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe) and non-governmental organizations in the field in an attempt to harmonize their respective activities.<BR>

<P>The ICRC kept a considerable number of staff in the Republic of Croatia, in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, including Kosovo, Sandzak and Montenegro, and in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia so as to continue its humanitarian work, particularly in places of detention, and to develop contacts and set up dissemination and information programmes.<BR>

<P>Several missions were conducted to other countries of Central Europe and the Balkans. These countries, especially those suffering from the indirect effects of the conflicts in the region, were beset by instability and economic difficulties. The ICRC maintained regular contacts with National Societies and governments with a view to setting up dissemination programmes and preventive activities.<BR>

<P>In Turkey, the ICRC followed developments in the humanitarian situation with regard to the conflict in the south-east of the country and stepped up its efforts to be allowed to carry out its mission in this region. The escalation of the conflict, reported by official circles in Turkey, obliged the ICRC to insist on the need for its presence by virtue of Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions. This had unfortunately not been accepted by the end of the year.<BR>

<P>Elsewhere in Europe, close contacts were maintained with the governments of countries which the ICRC President or staff members had visited or whose representatives had been received at headquarters. Regular meetings were also held with ambassadors accredited to the United Nations in Geneva, either to present the ICRC's emergency appeals to them or to alert them, as representatives of the international community, to particularly serious situations in humanitarian terms.<BR>

<P>The ICRC also strengthened its relations with European bodies such as the European Union, which gives substantial support to its humanitarian work, and entities such as the CSCE and the Council of Europe which are in a position to exert influence on the parties to ongoing conflicts, with a view to improving respect for international humanitarian law. The ICRC attaches special importance to these relations, as humanitarian action would be considerably slowed down without the moral and financial support of the States party to the Geneva Conventions.<BR>

<P>Finally, the ICRC closely followed the renewed dialogue between the parties involved in Northern Ireland and the implications for its activities. ICRC delegates conducted a visit to prisoners there in April 1994. <BR>

<P><I></I>
<P>
<P><I>Geneva, 27-30 November 1995</I><BR>

<P>The 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent was preceded by the 10th Session of the General Assembly of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which was held in Geneva from 27 to 30 November 1995 and attended by almost 600 delegates from 179 countries. That figure included both delegates from member National Societies and observers from emerging Societies.<BR>

<P>In his opening address Mr Mario Villarroel Lander, President of the Federation, reviewed the state of the Federation and its activities since the previous session held in Birmingham and expressed his hopes for the future. With special reference to the Strategic Work Plan, he stressed that active and constant support from the National Societies was a matter of crucial importance.<BR>

<P><B>Eight new members of the Federation</B><BR>

<P>The eight new National Societies recognized by the ICRC since the General Assembly held in Birmingham in 1993 were all admitted to the Federation. They were the Societies of Andorra, Equatorial Guinea, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belaus and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Makedonski Crven Krst).<BR>

<P>Mr George Weber gave an overview of the Federation's activities since the previous General Assembly, emphasizing in particular the wide variety of relief operations conducted by the Federation in extremely complex situations around the world, the large number of National Societies (70 according to official reports) using the Strategic Work Plan as a frame of reference for planning and executing their programmes, and the growing attention being paid to the development aspect in emergency relief operations and to disaster preparedness among National Societies.<BR>

<P>Mr Weber went on to outline the Federation's priorities for the coming years, placing emphasis on the need for a firmer commitment to established goals, in particular those intended to enable vulnerable people to avert, cope with and recover from disasters.<BR>

<P><B>Strategic Work Plan</B><BR>

<P>Referring to Decision No. 35 taken by the General Assembly in Birmingham in 1993 on the updating and execution of the Strategic Work Plan for the Nineties (SWP) [1], the Assembly declared that the Plan would remain in force until the end of the decade. It urged all National Societies to develop or continue to implement their own SWPs, selecting activities outlined in the Federation's Plan and regularly sharing information on their implementation with the Secretary General so as to enable him to report on each and every Society's achievements to the 11th Session of the General Assembly in 1997 they should also ensure that adequate funds, coming from all national sources and preferably non-earmarked, were made available to the Secretariat for implementation of the Plan.<BR>

<P><B>Report of the Development Commission</B><BR>

<P>After adopting the Commission's report, the Assembly approved the Red Cross and Red Crescent Development Policy, which focused on the need to strengthen the capacity of vulnerable communities in their daily lives. The Assembly also stressed the urgent need to increase the participation of women in all aspects of Red Cross and Red Crescent action and called for greater support by donor Societies for the Development Fund.<BR>

<P><B>Report of the Health and Community Services Commission</B><BR>

<P>The Assembly approved the Commission's report deploring the widespread deterioration in the health and welfare of the most needy communities and expressing concern about the discrepancy between resources allocated for emergency relief and those devoted to long-term community development this imbalance was detrimental to the empowerment of vulnerable groups. In the context of that general decline in health and social service systems, Red Cross and Red Crescent action was becoming particularly important.<BR>

<P>The Commission focused its attention on disease prevention and promoting health and social welfare, and recommended that National Societies should become actively involved in the development of programmes relating to the health of women and children, water and sanitation, communicable disease control, psychological support for disaster victims and first aid.<BR>

<P>Lastly, the Assembly adopted a decision concerning Red Cross and Red Crescent work with migrants, which called upon National Societies to consider taking action in behalf of migrant populations within the framework of the SWP, which centred on assistance to the most vulnerable, and invited them to encourage migrants to participate in their activities as volunteers or employees, depending on the legal provisions in force in each country. <BR>

<P><B>Report of the Youth Commission</B><BR>

<P>After hearing the Commission's report, which highlighted the development and implementation of youth policy and strategy in all the National Societies, the Assembly recommended that, in implementing the SWP, National Societies should give due importance to the following priorities concerning Red Cross and Red Crescent youth: the position, recruitment and management of youth volunteers education and training networking within the regions health issues minorities, the rights of the child and human rights community action the links between youth and adult groups within National Societies and fundraising for youth activities. <BR>

<P>Another decision was adopted urging National Societies to make financial contributions to the Fund so that it could rapidly become operational.<BR>

<P><B>Report of the Disaster Relief Commission</B><BR>

<P>Since the previous General Assembly the Commission had looked at ways of improving disaster relief under five main headings: the changing nature of the United Nations system and its implications for the Federation the growing needs of refugees and displaced people problems arising from increasingly frequent technological disasters the need for humanitarian assistance organizations to be active in the field of advocacy and the need to set high professional standards in humanitarian assistance operations.<BR>

<P>The Commission stressed the importance of preserving independence and complying with the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent when working with United Nations agencies.<BR>

<P>After adopting the Commission's report, the Assembly requested the Commission, in cooperation with the Secretary General, to draw up a global disaster relief policy to guide the Federation in its work, and to update the existing policy on the use of food aid and nutrition in emergency situations and incorporate it in the global policy.<BR>

<P><B>Global revenue generation</B><BR>

<P>The Secretary General of the Federation introduced a document entitled &quot;Policy framework for global revenue generation&quot;, a project aimed at maximizing revenue for the benefit of all National Societies and based on the idea of bringing companies together in pairs. <BR>

<P>To that end <I>HelpAd Ltd</I>, a company set up by the Federation in London, was bringing together pairs of companies, one offering advertising space on its products and the other buying the space to advertise its own products, with the money going to the Red Cross and Red Crescent. <BR>

<P>The proceeds would go 50:50 to Federation operations and National Societies in multinational deals, and 75:25 in favour of National Societies in national deals. <BR>

<P>A trade launch had already been held in London and a full launch was planned for early 1996. Moreover, a foundation chaired by Mr George Weber had been set up in Geneva and would receive the proceeds from <I>HelpAd</I> operations, which were exempt from Swiss cantonal and federal taxes.<BR>

<P>The Assembly adopted a decision approving the policy framework in principle and calling upon National Societies to support the <I>HelpAd</I> scheme and to conclude the necessary agreements with <I>HelpAd Ltd</I> for implementing it in their own countries when the occasion arose. It also encouraged National Societies to use the policy framework to increase revenue from traditional sources and discover new ones, and to redouble their efforts to collect funds not only for their own programmes but also for strengthening the international network of National Societies.<BR>

<P><B>Plan and budget for 1996-1997</B><BR>

<P>The Assembly approved the Financial Reports for 1993 and 1994 and the plan and budget for 1996-1997, amounting to 52,971,000 and 55,734,000 Swiss francs respectively.<BR>

<P><B>Relations with international organizations</B><BR>

<P>The Assembly expressed its satisfaction with the status of permanent observer to the United Nations General Assembly, won by the Federation thanks to the coordinated efforts of its entire membership. In endorsing the document entitled &quot;Cooperation with international organizations&quot;, which would guide National Societies in their relations with such bodies, the Assembly noted that the activities of the Federation and National Societies in that respect should be governed first and foremost by the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and by international humanitarian law.<BR>

<P>In particular, the Assembly drew attention to the objectives which should guide the Federation and National Societies in their relations with international organizations, including the United Nations, its specialized agencies and special funds and programmes, namely: <BR>

<P>* to serve the interests of the most vulnerable and to strengthen the role and capacity of the Federation and the National Societies to meet their humanitarian needs;<BR>

<P>* to promote human dignity, the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and humanitarian values;<BR>

<P>* to protect the integrity and independence of action of the Red Cross and Red Crescent;<BR>

<P>* to broaden and develop the capacity of the National Societies and of the Federation as a whole;<BR>
	<BR>
* to offer more effective and efficient humanitarian assistance through enhanced cooperation and communication.<BR>

<P>Lastly, the Assembly requested the Secretary General to ensure that the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, international humanitarian law and the Federation's opinions and activities were systematically given the highest possible profile within the United Nations system, intergovernmental bodies and other international forums. The Secretary General should also promote greater recognition among the international community for the Federation as a front-rank service provider and a credible defender of the most vulnerable, through cooperation and agreement among National Societies, the Secretariat and its delegations.<BR>

<P><B>Amendments to the statutory texts</B><BR>

<P>The Assembly decided to postpone until the 11th Session of the General Assembly, due to be held in 1997, its consideration of amendments to the Constitution and corresponding articles of the Rules of Procedure.<BR>

<P><B>Date and venue of the 11th Session of the General Assembly</B><BR>

<P>The Assembly accepted the invitation of the Spanish Red Cross to host its 11th Session in 1997.<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>PART III Subjects related to the Convention itself and to possible Additional Protocols</B></H3>
<P>                             <BR>
 SECTION I<BR>

<P>
<H4><B> Possible amendments to the Convention</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>I. The introduction of implementation mechanisms</B><BR>

<P>The total lack of implementation mechanisms in the 1980 Convention is a problem that should be addressed during the Review Conference.<BR>

<P>The Symposium on mines that the ICRC hosted in Montreux, while recognizing the limits of the implementation mechanisms provided by international law, proposed that certain implementation provisions be incorporated into the main body of the 1980 Convention.  With this in view, the participants looked first at implementation mechanisms in other humanitarian law treaties that could be used in the 1980 Convention and then at other international law mechanisms that could be useful.<BR>

<P><B>(i) Proposals on implementation mechanisms stemming from those that exist in other humanitarian law treaties</B><BR>

<P>  Insofar as the provisions of the 1980 Convention reaffirm the rules of international humanitarian law found in other treaties, implementation measures provided for in those other treaties are naturally also relevant to the 1980 Convention.  However, it may be desirable to specifically include such measures in the 1980 Convention.<BR>

<P><B><I>Provision of legal advisers</I></B><BR>

<P>This is presently required by virtue of Article 82 of Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions.  A similar provision in the 1980 Convention could indicate that legal advisers should give guidance on matters relating to the use of weapons.  The participants in the Montreux Symposium recommended that legal advisers be appointed at all levels down to brigade or equivalent level and be incorporated into planning staffs.<BR>

<P><B><I>Specific requirements for training in humanitarian law</I></B><BR>

<P>Several of the participants in the Montreux Symposium placed great stress on the importance of correct training.  The requirement to instruct the armed forces in the law is provided in Hague Convention IV of 1907, the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their Additional Protocols of 1977.  It was thought that such a requirement ought also to appear in the 1980 Convention. Certain specific suggestions were made in this regard:<BR>

<P>-   there should be training in the use of weapons in accordance with humanitarian law at cadet academies and in all command and staff training programmes;<BR>

<P>-   manuals on weapon systems should incorporate the law applicable to their correct use in the languages of the user countries;<BR>

<P>-   the packaging of weapons should include warnings of the legal limitations on their use;<BR>

<P>-   all military training of foreign nationals should include training in humanitarian law.<BR>

<P><B><I>Incorporation into domestic law</I></B><BR>

<P>The 1980 Convention should be translated into local languages, and appropriate national laws and regulations should be adopted.  This is similar to the provision in Article 84 of Protocol I of 1977.<BR>

<P><B><I>Liability and criminal sanctions</I></B><BR>

<P>It is clear that the law of international responsibility applies in relation to violations of the law governing the use of mines.  The difficulty lies in determining liability with respect to compensation for damage resulting from violations of the law, and establishing which body should be responsible for making such decisions.  The possibility of compulsory adjudication will be considered below.<BR>

<P>With regard to individual liability, the participants in the Montreux Symposium thought that as a matter of principle criminal sanctions ought to be obligatory for violations of the rules contained in the Protocols of the 1980 Convention.  However, they recognized that similar provisions in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and Protocol I of 1977 have not usually been respected.<BR>

<P>If Protocol 11 to the 1980 Convention were to be amended to prohibit the use of certain types of mines, violation of such a rule would be much easier to establish than violation of the present rules, which place certain constraints on behaviour only.  The experts at the Montreux Symposium made some general suggestions as to how to improve implementation of the rule requiring the application of criminal sanctions (page 164).<BR>

<P><B><I>International Fact-Finding Commission</I></B><BR>

<P>It was suggested that the International Fact-Finding Commission provided for in Article 90 of Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions could also be used to investigate possible violations of the 1980 Convention.  In the context of the 1977 Protocol, the competence of the Commission is based on consent that can either be given in advance, in the form of a declaration, or ad hoc. it would have to be decided whether the same formula would be appropriate for the 1980 Convention and whether it should also be based on confidentiality, as provided for in the 1977 Protocol.  The participants in the Montreux Symposium pointed out that the Commission would be more effective as a law-enforcement mechanism if it had an automatic right to monitor possible violations of the 1980 Convention.<BR>

<P><B>(ii) Other possible implementation mechanisms</B><BR>

<P><B><I>Compulsory adjudication</I></B><BR>

<P>The following are possibilities:<BR>

<P>-    International Court of Justice. The compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ is provided for by several treaties and a similar provision could be incorporated into the 1980 Convention.  The disadvantage is that the ICJ has jurisdiction only over international disputes and cannot cover individual accountability.<BR>

<P>-    International arbitration. This depends on a certain degree of cooperation by the parties involved in order to create the arbitral tribunal and its regulations.<BR>

<P>-    International criminal court. The United Nations International Law Commission is at present studying the possibility of setting up such a court.  However, the suggestion of establishing such a court has existed for a long time and it is not likely to materialize in the near future.<BR>

<P>-    A court created especially for the 1980 Convention. A number of international treaties create courts for the implementation of their rules by deciding on allegations of violations and sometimes also by delivering advisory opinions. These courts are frequently very effective law-enforcement mechanisms as they often have jurisdiction not only over inter-State disputes but also over cases brought by individuals or organizations.<BR>

<P>The participants in the  Montreux Symposium thought that it was unlikely that States would accept compulsory adjudication, as this does not at present exist in any international humanitarian law treaty.  However, there is no doubt that it could be a very effective method, especially if individuals or organizations were able to bring claims.<BR>

<P><B><I>United Nations Security Council</I></B><BR>

<P>It was suggested during the Montreux Symposium that, in the absence of a compulsory adjudication mechanism, the Security Council might be able to impose suitable remedies for violations of the 1980 Convention.  However, this would depend on the political will of the members of the Council.<BR>

<P><B><I>Creation of a supervisory body</I></B><BR>

<P>A number of international treaties create specific supervisory bodies to help the implementation of their provisions.  These bodies typically receive periodic reports submitted by States Parties on the measures they have taken to implement the treaty, receive complaints about alleged violations, undertake investigations and discuss the results of these activities with the States concerned.  They also often undertake promotional activities in order to improve compliance with the law.<BR>

<P>The Review Conference could consider whether it would be appropriate to create an analogous body for the 1980 Convention or whether the terms of reference of the International Fact-Finding Commission could be extended to cover these roles for the purposes of the 1980 Convention.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H4><B>II. Extension of the scope of application of the Convention to non-international armed conflict</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The 1980 Convention at present formally applies only to international armed conflicts, even though the majority of conflicts are internal.  The laying of millions of mines during non-international armed conflicts has caused not only tremendous immediate suffering but also severe social and economic damage to the countries concerned.<BR>

<P>The major rules of international humanitarian law already apply to non-international armed conflicts by virtue of Article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Additional Protocol 11 of 1977 and international customary law.  However, specific rules applicable to the use of weapons in non-international armed conflicts would give useful precision to the law.<BR>

<P>The participants in the Montreux Symposium thought that the 1980 Convention ought also to apply to non-international armed conflicts, although they recognized that this may be a sensitive issue.  They felt that given the enormous damage that is frequently inflicted on the assets of a State by the widespread improper use of weapons in an internal armed conflict on its territory, there may be greater interest in making these international rules applicable in such conflicts,<BR>

<P>The most obvious way to extend the application of the 1980 Convention to non-international armed conflicts is by an amendment to Article I of the Convention.  Should this cause too much difficulty, another possibility is to create an optional protocol to this effect, or to introduce into the Convention an additional article which parties could accept by a declaration to that effect or, conversely, which would be applicable to parties unless they specifically opted out.  All three methods are to be found in other international treaties when a specific provision is desired by some of the parties but not by others.<BR>

<P>As indicated in Part 11 above (pp. 142-145), additional arms control measures are vital to limit the damage inflicted during internal armed conflicts.<BR>

<P>
<P>SECTION II<BR>

<P>
<H3><B>Specific weapons</B></H3>
<P>
<P>
<H4><B>1. Blinding weapons</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The ICRC is of the opinion that blinding weapons should be on the agenda of the Review Conference with a view to the possible adoption of an additional protocol on this subject.  Given the advanced stage of development of hand-held versions of this type of weapon, together with the real possibility of their appearance on the battlefield in the near future and their subsequent proliferation among all groups that use force, it is essential that the Review Conference use this last opportunity to take preventive action.<BR>

<P>(i) Information gathered at expert meetings convened by the ICRC  Prompted by reports concerning the development of certain types of laser weapons which would result in permanent and incurable blindness, the ICRC convened four meetings of experts.  The meetings were attended by leading specialists in laser technology, ophthalmology, military medicine and psychiatry, and international humanitarian law.  The scientists described the nature and effects of these laser weapons and the physical, psychological and social effects of blindness as compared with other combat injuries.  Subsequently, the legal and policy aspects of this issue were discussed, together with possibilities for future legal regulation.<BR>

<P><B><I>Technical characteristics of new laser weapons and their effects in medical terms</I></B><BR>

<P>The specialists gave information on laser weapons under development as reported in unclassified sources.<BR>

<P>A number of weapons were said to be designed for anti-sensor or anti-personnel use.  &quot;Anti-sensor&quot; use refers to the destruction of enemy optical viewing systems, whereas &quot;anti-personnel&quot; use refers to an intentional effect on peoples' eyesight.  As the energy and wavelength of the laser necessary to destroy sensors is similar to those necessary to damage eyes, laser systems said to be designed for anti-sensor purposes could also be used for anti-personnel purposes.<BR>

<P>With regard to current technical possibilities for the further development of anti-personnel laser systems, the experts stressed that lasers can be very small and pointed out that small, clip-on laser devices that can now be fitted to rifles for training purposes could easily be made non-eye-safe.  At present the range of these training devices is relatively limited but more powerful ones are being designed.  It was also indicated that lasers can be very cheap.  'Me group further pointed out that range-finding systems (which are less powerful than the anti- sensor/anti-personnel lasers being developed) could be misused to blind intentionally and that some accidents have indeed already occurred with these.<BR>

<P>With regard to the effect of these lasers on the eye, it was indicated that the extent of damage to the eye will depend on the energy and distance.  The anti-personnel and anti-sensor weapons presently under development will permanently blind a person up to a distance of a kilometre or more.  Beyond this distance a person may be flash blinded, or even further away may be dazzled if a visible wavelength is used.  The exact distance at which there is no longer a permanent blinding effect is unpredictable because a laser beam is affected by atmospheric conditions and dust.  The aiming of the beam does not appear to be particularly difficult as it can be diverged to an area of about 50 em across at a range of one kilometre, and the very large number of shots in each battery pack means that it is possible to sweep the battlefield with the beam.  The weapon is silent and the beam is invisible.<BR>

<P>The specialists then studied the possibilities for medical treatment and means of protection and concluded that neither was adequate.  Damage to the retina is permanent and irreparable; vision loss caused by haemorrhage might be successfully treated in only a small minority of cases and even in those cases the long-term outcome would be doubtful.<BR>

<P>Protection by special goggles would also seem to be largely illusory, as they would only screen out a limited range of known wavelengths, whereas lasers can operate over a wide range of wavelengths.<BR>

<P><B><I>Functional disabilities and psychological problems that would be caused by blinding weapons as compared with those caused by other weapons</I></B><BR>

<P>In making this assessment, the specialists drew attention to a number of considerations specific to blindness:<BR>

<P>There is no prosthesis to reduce the effect of the disability, and in functional terms blindness is an exceptionally severe handicap, even when compared with the worst of injuries.<BR>
         <BR>
Rehabilitation training for the blind is essential, but is not available everywhere, and it also gives rise to major difficulties:<BR>

<P>a.  the learning process is long and very complex;<BR>

<P>b.  a psychologically robust personality is needed to undertake this learning effort, but people who have been blinded usually suffer from severe depression and cannot do it well;<BR>

<P>c.  comparatively satisfactory results are seen only in persons with a good education and sound financial, family and social support;<BR>

<P>d.  successful rehabilitation allows recovery of only a fraction of the person's previous skills and he will always remain dependent to quite a large degree.<BR>

<P>The experts stressed that blindness almost always causes very severe depression which in a large proportion of cases lasts for many years, if not permanently.<BR>

<P> Another matter of importance in a war context is the prevalence of an extreme fear of blindness; for the majority of people it is the most dreaded injury and soldiers are no exception.  If soldiers are aware of the existence of weapons that can silently and invisibly blind them, there will be an increased incidence of combat stress disorder during battle and such weapons will cause more mental illness in the long term.<BR>

<P>The medical experts thought that public reaction to blindness caused by weapons especially used for that purpose is likely to be very negative, as the public in general tend to feel special pity for blind persons. They likened the fear of blindness and the probable reactions to blindness-inducing weapons to the fear and disgust aroused by chemical weapons.<BR>

<P>Finally, the experts pointed out that large numbers of blind persons would put an exceptionally heavy burden on medical and social services and on society in general.<BR>

<P>Foreseeable situation if there were to be widespread use of anti-sensory anti-personnel laser weapons here would evidently be an increase in the numbers of blind servicemen returning from war.  The number of eye injuries has steadily increased from 0.5% in the last century to between 5 and 9 % in the Vietnarn war.  The increase is said to be due to the effects of fragmentation weapons.  It has been estimated that if anti-sensor lasers were used, but not to target the human eye, eye injuries would nevertheless increase by 2-3%.  If, however, lasers were to be used intentionally to inflict blindness, so that blinding as a method of warfare became common practice, serious damage to the eye might account for between 25% and 50% of all casualties.<BR>

<P>The experts also pointed out that laser weapons could easily be used to cause terror outside armed conflict situations by repressive regimes, terrorists or criminals.  Since such weapons are so light and easy to transport, proliferation would be inevitable.<BR>

<P><B><I>Legal and policy considerations</I></B><BR>

<P>The final expert meeting was attended by 37 government officials, participating in their personal capacity, from 22 countries.  They considered the legal and policy implications of the information gathered by the scientists.<BR>

<P>The present lawfulness of the use of blinding weapons was discussed mainly in the light of the rule prohibiting the use of weapons of a nature to cause unnecessary suffering and superfluous injury.  One participant was of the opinion that any intentional blinding would violate this rule, including the use of lasers to blind the pilots of aircraft.  The majority of participants, however, thought that the most controversial use of lasers would be against infantry, as the latter can easily be put out of action by means other than blinding.  There was a division of opinion, however, as to whether such use is already illegal under existing law.<BR>

<P>The majority of participants thought that whatever the assessment of the  present lawfulness of such use, it should be subject to legal regulation because there are important policy reasons for prohibiting blinding as a method of warfare. Many thought that such a prohibition ought to be introduced simply because blinding weapons are horrific and therefore totally unacceptable.  The various possibilities for legal regulation were discussed and are outlined below.<BR>

<P><B>(ii) Possibilities for legal regulation</B><BR>

<P><B><I>Humanitarian law</I></B><BR>

<P>Several approaches have been used to prohibit or restrict the use of certain weapons in international humanitarian law; it is possible to consider which would be the most appropriate by analogy in the case of blinding laser weapons:<BR>

<P><U><I>a. Prohibition of the use of a certain type of weapon</U></I><BR>

<P>This was the method used for chemical weapons and dum-dum bullets, because it was recognized that the overall dangers represented by the use of such weapons outweighed their military utility.  In the case of laser weapons, this could involve prohibiting the use of all or of some types of anti-sensor/ anti-personnel weapons.  The difficulty is that these weapons can be used for both anti-sensor and anti-personnel purposes, but it could be decided that those more obviously suited to anti-personnel purposes should be prohibited.<BR>

<P><U><I>b.   Prohibition of certain uses of a particular weapon</U></I><BR>

<P>Examples of limitations of this type are seen in some military manuals which prohibit the use of incendiary weapons against unprotected soldiers, or state that explosive bullets may be used against objects but not persons.  In the case of laser weapons, such a regulation could prohibit the use of lasers against  persons, or against certain classes of persons, e.g., infantry.<BR>

<P><U><I>c.   Prohibition of the use of weapons which have a certain effect, without mentioning the weapon by name</U></I><BR>

<P>An example of this type of provision is Protocol I to the 1980 Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of any weapon the primary effect of which is to injure by fragments which cannot be detected by X-rays.  In the case of laser weapons, a norm of this type could read as follows: &quot;The use of weapons the primary effect of which is to damage eyesight is prohibited.&quot;<BR>

<P>Such an approach would have the advantage of covering not only lasers whose primary effect is to blind but also any other future weapons which may have this effect.  A disadvantage is that such a wording may give rise to arguments as to whether blinding is a primary effect, given that these lasers can also have other uses (anti-sensor in particular), and that at the end of  their range they only have a dazzle effect.  This wording would not cover intentional blinding by the misuse of other systems such as range-finders.<BR>

<P><U><I>d.  Prohibition of certain types of behaviour without any reference to the characteristics of a weapon</U></I><BR>

<P>This alternative could concentrate on the prohibition of blinding or of the use of weapons with the primary intention or expected result of permanently damaging eyesight.  A norm of this type could be worded as follows:<BR>

<P><I> &quot;blinding as a method of warfare is prohibited&quot;,</I><BR>
          or<BR>
&quot;<I>blinding as a method of rendering a combatant hors de combat is prohibited&quot;</I>.<BR>

<P>Alternatively, the wording of the rule could be more specific, such as:<BR>
<I>&quot; weapons may not be used against persons with the primary intention or expected result of permanently damaging their eyesight&quot;. </I><BR>

<P>Such an approach could also include rules that create a duty to take precautions to avoid accidental blinding by weapons that are particularly dangerous for eyesight.<BR>

<P><U><I>Arms control regulation</U></I><BR>

<P>States might wish to think about prohibitions or limitations on the production of certain types of lasers that could be too easily misused to blind because of their particular features, e.g., tunability, power, portability.  Other possibilities would be regulations to prevent undesirable proliferation, or policies favouring eye-safe lasers for range-finding, etc., in order to prevent avoidable cases of blindness.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<H4><B>II. Unexploded sub-munitions</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Unexploded sub-munitions are remnants of war that in many ways represent the same type of threat to the civilian population as anti-personnel landmines.<BR>

<P>Sub-munitions are bomblets which are delivered by aircraft or by artillery, rockets or guided missiles.  The bomblets are assembled in &quot;clusters&quot; of hundreds or even thousands and delivered from aircraft dispensers, artillery shells or rocket or missile warheads.  The bomblets are small (typically under 800 grams and under 7 cm in diameter) and can contain various payloads for use against different targets, such as a high explosive inside a controlled-fragmentation casing, a shaped charge (with or without a fragmentation easing), or a high explosive combined with an incendiary material.  They may be fitted with an impact fuse (with or without a delay mechanism) or a proximity fuse.<BR>

<P>Unlike landmines, which cause casualties among the civilian population when they are functioning normally, these bomblets create a similar situation as a result of malfunction, namely, when they have not exploded on impact and are left lying on or near the surface of the ground in an unstable condition.<BR>

<P>Bomblets have reportedly had very high failure rates - up to 40%, depending on the state of the ground (the rate is usually higher on soft ground) and on meteorological conditions (especially if the soil is covered with snow).  Once on the ground and unexploded, some of these bomblets are extremely unstable.  They are liable to explode at any time and can be triggered by even the slightest movement of the ground on which they are lying, such as vibrations caused by people walking or a moving vehicle.<BR>

<P>Clearing this unexploded munition is very difficult.  If the bomblets are in an unstable condition, is it not possible to touch them and they cannot be neutralized.  They must therefore be destroyed, but this too can be difficult. Indeed, it is very risky even to approach them as this might disturb the ground and trigger their explosion.<BR>

<P>The use of cluster bombs has increased tremendously over the last 30 years.<BR>

<P>Like anti-personnel mines, they have been used as area denial weapons.  This means that very large quantities of unexploded bomblets are now threatening the civilian population and, unless some solution is found, their numbers will increase.<BR>

<P><I>Possible solution</I><BR>

<P>This lack of reliability in exploding at the intended time has prompted many manufacturers of bomblets to include self-destruct devices in their new model now in production.  It is suggested that as the incorporation of such self-destruct devices is clearly a technical possibility, and acceptable to manufacturers, the Review Conference should seriously consider making such a measure mandatory.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>III.  Small-calibre weapon systems</B></H4>
<P>
<P>During the United Nations Conference that led to the adoption of the 1980 Convention, the governments of Mexico and Sweden submitted a draft protocol on the regulation of the use of small-calibre weapon systems.<BR>

<P>The Conference felt that further research was necessary to establish more accurately the wounding effects of new types of bullets in order to prevent an unnecessary increase in their injurious effects.  The Conference therefore adopted a resolution on small-calibre weapon systems, at its seventh plenary meeting on 23 September 1979, expressing the view that:<BR>

<P><I> &quot;...such research, including testing of small-calibre weapon systems, should be continued with a view to developing standardized assessment methodology relative to ballistic parameters and medical effects of such systems.&quot;</I><BR>

<P>The resolution also invited &quot;Governments to carry out further research, jointly or individually... and to communicate, where possible, their findings&quot;, and to &quot;exercise the utmost care in the development of small-calibre weapon systems, so as to avoid an unnecessary escalation of the injurious effects of such systems&quot;.<BR>

<P>A considerable amount of research has taken place since the adoption of this resolution and has confirmed that energy transfer is the most important factor for wound severity.  High energy transfer, resulting in more severe wounds, is often caused by early turning of the bullet once it hits the body and by the break-up of the bullet.  These phenomena can be caused by poor stability and by the construction of the bullet itself, especially the materials used and the thickness and toughness of the jacket.<BR>

<P>On the basis of this information, some States have taken steps to improve the design of their bullets, in particular to increase their resistance to fragmentation so as to conform to the letter and the spirit of the Hague Declaration of 1899 which prohibits the use of expanding bullets.<BR>

<P>Standardization of the testing of bullets would be a very important step towards clarification of manufacturing specifications in order to ensure that bullets do not fragment easily.  To this end, the Swiss government has offered (in a diplomatic note of November 1991) to put its anti-personnel weapon test facilities at the disposal of all interested States.<BR>

<P>The Review Conference could consider the most appropriate way to take these developments into account.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>IV. Naval mines</B></H4>
<P>
<P>In November 1991, the government of Sweden submitted to the First Committee of the United Nations General Assembly a working paper and a draft Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Naval Mines.  This draft was presented as an additional protocol to be attached to the 1980 Convention on certain conventional weapons.<BR>

<P>The only existing treaty regulating the use of naval mines is the 1907 Hague Convention Relative to the Laying of Automatic Submarine Contact Mines (Hague Convention VIII).  Although this Convention is still in force and has the effect of preventing the indiscriminate use of naval mines, it is clear that it has become outdated in certain respects.  In particular, it makes specific reference to automatic contact mines and does not take later technical developments into account.<BR>

<P>It would therefore be appropriate to consider this draft during the Review Conference with a view to adopting a new protocol to the 1980 Convention.<BR>

<P>The draft will need to be studied with care to make certain that it does not in any way provide less protection than the 1907 Hague Convention.  In this respect, it should be noted that Article 5 of the Hague Convention provides very clear guidelines as to which party is responsible for clearing mines after the conflict.  Ibis question is a critical one from a humanitarian point of view and the new protocol should not be weaker in this respect.  The other provisions can be studied in the light of suggested new rules relating to landmines, taking into account considerations peculiar to the naval context.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>V. Future weapons</B></H4>
<P>
<P>The Conference of Government Experts that met in Lucerne and Lugano in 1974 and 1976, and whose findings served as a basis for the United Nations Conference that adopted the 1980 Convention, discussed a number of futuristic weapons.  'Mese included laser weapons, microwave, infrasound, and light-flash devices, environmental warfare and electronic warfare.<BR>

<P>The experts recognized that at that time it was too early to consider specific restrictions on devices that were only at the research stage.  However, the majority stressed the importance of keeping a close watch on developments in order to introduce specific prohibitions or limitations that might be necessary before the weapon in question became widely accepted.  Several experts underlined the importance of national review measures, which are now required under Article 36 of Additional Protocol I of 1977, as well as of international review measures.<BR>

<P>As regards the futuristic weapons discussed at the Lucerne/Lugano Conference, developments in laser technology have raised the possibility of one disturbing application, namely, the use of lasers as anti-personnel weapons to damage eyesight.  This matter is referred to above under the heading &quot;Blinding weapons&quot;.<BR>

<P>There has also been further research into other new technologies, in particular directed energy weapons such as high-power microwave and infrasound devices.  Although it may be too early to consider the need for specific regulation, it should be recognized that such future developments are subject to the standards of humanitarian law.  In particular, it is important to ensure that new weapons do not have indiscriminate effects and that they do not contravene the rule prohibiting the use of weapons of a nature to cause unnecessary suffering or superfluous injury to combatants.  With regard to the interpretation of this latter rule, reference can be made to the standard on which it was originally based, namely, the provision in the 1868 St. Petersburg Declaration which states that weapons which &quot;uselessly aggravate the sufferings of disabled men or render their death inevitable&quot; are &quot;contrary to the laws of humanity&quot;.<BR>

<P>Cette Conf&eacute;rence s'est ouverte hier &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve en pr&eacute;sence d'un millier de d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s repr&eacute;sentant les gouvernements de plus de 100 Etats parties aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve et plus de 140 Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge .<BR>

<P>Le prince Botho zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein, Pr&eacute;sident de la Commission permanente de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, a appel&eacute; tous les gouvernements &agrave; soutenir l'oeuvre du Mouvement et ses efforts pour rendre l'aide humanitaire plus efficace.<BR>

<P>Le Pr&eacute;sident du Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge, M. Cornelio Sommaruga, a soulign&eacute; qu'il fallait contenir le d&eacute;ferlement de la violence, afin de pr&eacute;venir et d'apaiser les souffrances des victimes des conflits arm&eacute;s et des catastrophes naturelles. Pour le Pr&eacute;sident du CICR, la seule fa&ccedil;on d'atteindre cet objectif est de restaurer un respect plus rigoureux des droits de l'homme et du droit international humanitaire.<BR>

<P>M. Mario Villarroel Lander, Pr&eacute;sident de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; que cette 26&egrave;me Conf&eacute;rence internationale repr&eacute;sente l'occasion unique de revaloriser les Principes fondamentaux du Mouvement, de leur donner une nouvelle vigueur et d'accro&icirc;tre le respect de la dignit&eacute; humaine. Il a rendu hommage aux 130 millions de volontaires &agrave; travers le monde qui oeuvrent sans rel&acirc;che pour appliquer les id&eacute;aux d'Henry Dunant, c'est-&agrave;-dire pr&eacute;venir et all&eacute;ger, en toutes circonstances, les souffrances de l'&ecirc;tre humain, prot&eacute;ger la vie et la sant&eacute; en temps de conflit arm&eacute; et dans d'autres situations d'urgence.<BR>

<P>Au nom du pays h&ocirc;te, M. Kaspar Villiger, Pr&eacute;sident de la Conf&eacute;d&eacute;ration suisse, a souhait&eacute; la bienvenue &agrave; tous les participants. Il a exhort&eacute; les gouvernements &agrave; mobiliser toutes leurs ressources pour am&eacute;liorer le sort des victimes dans le monde entier et accro&icirc;tre leur soutien aux organisations humanitaires.<BR>

<P>M. Olivier Vodoz, Pr&eacute;sident du Conseil d'Etat de la R&eacute;publique et canton de Gen&egrave;ve, a remerci&eacute; les d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s pour leur engagement sans faille, leur courage et leur d&eacute;termination dans le combat qu'ils m&egrave;nent pour le respect des principes universels dans le monde entier.<BR>

<P>A l'ouverture de la c&eacute;r&eacute;monie, un spectacle en multivision a permis de projeter des images poignantes illustrant les principales causes de la souffrance humaine: guerre, captivit&eacute;, catastrophes naturelles, &eacute;pid&eacute;mies, exclusion sociale, des souffrances indicibles que les institutions humanitaires s'efforcent de soulager.<BR>

<P>Ces images ont &eacute;t&eacute; suivies de la lecture solennelle des Principes fondamentaux de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge et de t&eacute;moignages &eacute;mouvants sur le sort des victimes de la guerre.<BR>

<P>R&eacute;unis au sein du groupe Dissimilis, un ensemble de jeunes Norv&eacute;giens handicap&eacute;s ont offert aux d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s leur musique et leurs chants, d&eacute;montrant par ce biais la dignit&eacute; fondamentale de tout &ecirc;tre humain, tandis que l'orchestre et les choeurs de diverses &eacute;coles secondaires de Gen&egrave;ve ponctuaient la c&eacute;r&eacute;monie aux accents de Prokofiev et de Haendel.<BR>

<H2>A note from the Editor</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Just for once, the Review is devoting an issue almost entirely to the International Committee of the Red Cross and its activities in behalf of war victims.<BR>

<P>Professor David Forsythe's article examines one of the most important aspects of the ICRC's mandate by analysing its recent assistance operations for civilian populations in distress. He considers the issues involved and draws attention to existing problems and to those which are bound to arise in the near future. His analysis does not spare the ICRC, and he raises several questions that will give the reader food for thought.<BR>

<P>Andr&eacute; Durand opens a page of ICRC history with a biographical essay on Gustave Moynier, one of the founders of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and President of the ICRC from 1864 to 1910. The author describes the somewhat paradoxical relationship between the organizations advocating pacifism and the Red Cross.<BR>

<P>Turning now to official documents, the <I>Review</I> is publishing the new rules governing access to the ICRC's archives. Underlying this information is a significant change in the institution's policy in such matters: historians and other individuals interested in ICRC activities many henceforth consult files that have been closed for fifty years, as is the case in many national archives.<BR>

<P>Despite the passing years, the memory of the Second World War remains alive, as may be seen from the current controversy about property deposited in Swiss banks at the time by victims of Nazi persecution. In the wake of the accusations levelled against Switzerland and its banking secrecy, the ICRC has also come in for criticism, and this issue of the Review contains the institution's preliminary clarification of the issue.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Introduction Middle East and North Africa</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>In Israel and the occupied territories the ICRC pursued its protection activities for the civilian population under Israeli occupation and detainees held by the Israeli authorities, in accordance with its mandate under the Geneva Conventions. ICRC delegates kept up their efforts to make the various parties aware of their responsibilities in the face of violations of the most basic principles of international humanitarian law.<BR>

<P>Following the Cairo agreement of 4 May between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), and under the terms of a memorandum of understanding signed by the ICRC and the PLO in July, the institution adapted its activities to meet the humanitarian needs emerging in the autonomous territories of the Gaza Strip and Jericho.<BR>

<P>Following various meetings between the ICRC, the Federation and the &quot;Palestine Red Crescent Society&quot; in 1994, it was confirmed that the ICRC would continue to coordinate the activities of the various National Societies participating in programmes for the Palestinian population in the occupied and the autonomous territories. The ICRC also maintained close contacts with the &quot;Magen David Adom&quot; in Israel.<BR>

<P>Elsewhere in the region, and despite sustained efforts by the ICRC to resolve a number of humanitarian issues, the following situations still required its attention.<BR>

<P>- In the aftermath of the Iran/Iraq conflict of 1980 to 1988, the repatriation of Iraqi POWs and efforts to elucidate the fate of tens of thousands of missing soldiers from both sides remained deadlocked. The ICRC submitted a memorandum to the signatory States of the Geneva Conventions which were members of the UN Security Council, to the Organization of the Islamic Conference and to the United Nations requesting that they do everything in their power to resolve the situation.<BR>
- The ICRC pursued its efforts to resume its activities for the some 20,000Iraqi civilians on record as being interned in the Rafha camp in Saudi Arabia since the end of the Gulf war. Some of them had been POWs and had lost that status once the general repatriation was completed in October 1991.<BR>

<P>- The fate of the some 650 individuals (Kuwaitis, Saudis, Iraqis and others) reported missing in connection with the Gulf war remained to be determined. A Technical Sub-Committee was established to speed up progress in this matter.<BR>
When conflict broke out in Yemen in May the ICRC immediately started to carry out its traditional activities, in coordination with the National Society, in particular providing food aid, medical, sanitation and other supplies, and tracing services. ICRC delegates were able to visit and register persons detained in connection with the situation.<BR>

<P>Living conditions in Iraq continued to deteriorate to an alarming extent. In order to meet the most urgent needs throughout the country, the ICRC carried out medical, orthopaedic and sanitation programmes.<BR>

<P>In North Africa the ICRC's main concern continued to be the situation in Algeria. The ICRC's activities in the country had been suspended in July 1992, and it was unable to resume its work despite many approaches made to the authorities. In connection with the conflict in the Western Sahara the ICRC registered Moroccan prisoners held by the Polisario Front, and continued to visit Sahrawi prisoners in Moroccan hands who had been receiving ICRC visits since they resumed in 1993. The institution made representations to both sides with a view to finding a speedy solution to the problem of these people, some of whom had been detained for 19 years.<BR>

<P>Finally, the ICRC used audiovisual material, much of which was produced by the Cairo delegation, to spread knowledge of humanitarian law in the region and provide information about ICRC operations. In several countries the internal situation made it vital for the ICRC to pursue and step up contacts established with the authorities concerning the nature of its mandate and the exercise of its right of humanitarian initiative in situations of internal conflict not specifically covered by humanitarian law. In addition, delegates encouraged countries which had not yet signed one or both of the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions to become party to these treaties. <BR>

<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>During the year under review ICRC field staff had to respond to ever more desperate humanitarian needs, in situations whose horror was matched only by the suffering endured by the victims, most of them civilians.<BR>

<P>Meanwhile, in Geneva, a new challenge faced the institution: devising the most efficient means of solving the problems posed by the increasingly complex planning and management of ICRC activities. New policies were ready to be put into effect and much progress was made in the course of the year, especially as regards development of management and control mechanisms. These concerned not only staff management, as defined in the new personnel policy, but also the installation of a high-performance system for circulating information within the institution and outside, together with a management information system for keeping control over and and predicting the evolution of the financial situation.<BR>

<P>An in-depth study on the ICRC's image and identity was also undertaken, on the basis of a survey conducted both inside and outside the institution. This laid the groundwork for formulation of a communication policy which will identify the most effective and modern methods of putting the ICRC's message over to target groups without impairing its identity as a humanitarian organization dedicated to alleviating and as far as possible preventing the suffering of the conflict victims.</P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/Separator_Line_ICRC.gif" BORDER=0><P><IMG SRC="/gifsICRC/ButtonBar.gif" BORDER=0 USEMAP="#ButtonBar"><BR>

<H2>The International Conferences of the Red Cross as a factor for the development of international humanitarian law and the cohesion of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement </H2>
<P><I>By Philippe Abplanalp</I>
<P>
<P><B><I>Philippe Abplanalp</I></B><I>, born in 1956, joined the staff of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1983 after studying history at the University of Geneva. He first worked in the Financing and Press Divisions before becoming a documentalist/editor with the Division for Principles and Relations with the Movement in 1985. Since 1994, he has been responsible for historical research within the Directorate for Principles, Law and Relations with the International Red Cross and the Red Crescent Movement</I><B><I>.</I></B><BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>The International Conference, its role and purpose</B></H4>
<P>	<BR>
The 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent will take place in Geneva in December 1995. This Conference, which meets every few years, is unquestionably the most important forum for addressing humanitarian issues. It is also a source of cohesion between States and the various components of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, whose history since its inception has been closely linked with Geneva. The 26th International Conference should have been held in Budapest in 1991, but was unfortunately postponed owing to political problems. As a result, nine years have passed since the last Conference in 1986, which was also held in Geneva.<BR>

<P>The purpose of this article is to retrace the history of the International Conference and show what it has contributed to the development of humanitarian law and to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement as a whole.<BR>
	<BR>
From the outset, the Red Cross differed from other voluntary organizations that came into being during the second half of the nineteenth century in two basic respects, namely the permanent nature and the international aspirations of its component institutions.[1]<BR>

<P>In order to preserve the sense of solidarity required to unite them across national borders, the new Red Cross Societies had to be able to meet at regular intervals, as provided for by Article 9 of the Resolutions of 1863:<BR>
	<BR>
&quot;<I>The Committees and Sections of different countries may meet in international assemblies to communicate the results of their experiences and to agree on measures to be taken in the interest of the work&quot;.[2]</I><BR>

<P>To achieve the goals set, the various States had to be involved in the institution's activities. This was accomplished on both the national and the international level: each National Society had to establish a relationship of cooperation with the government of its country, and the States party to the Geneva Conventions were invited to participate in the International Conferences of the Red Cross, starting with the first such Conference in Paris in 1867.<BR>

<P>In accordance with the Statutes adopted by the 13th Conference at The Hague in 1928, revised by the 18th Conference at Toronto in 1952 and then by the 25th Conference at Geneva in 1986,[3] the International Conference is composed of the delegations from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, from the more than 160 recognized Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies and from over 180 States party to the Geneva Conventions. Each of these delegations has the right to vote, with one vote each.<BR>
	<BR>
Observers may also attend the Conference, but without voting rights. They represent more than 60 governmental or non-governmental, regional or international organizations which have working relations with the Movement or a special interest in humanitarian law or related problems. National Societies which are not yet recognized are also invited with observer status. <BR>

<P>The Conference is the supreme deliberative body for the Movement. It meets in principle every four years, at the invitation of a National Society, the ICRC or the Federation.<BR>
	<BR>
At the Berlin Conference in 1869, calls were made for the delegates of National Societies to be given precise instructions and adequate powers for the exercise of their right to vote.[4]<BR>
	<BR>
Government delegates likewise do not act in a personal capacity but as representatives of their respective State, whose official position they express in their statements and votes.[5] The participation of State representatives gives the International Conference a combined private and public status. The composition of the Conference furthermore determines the bearing of the resolutions it adopts:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>Voting by States transforms the originally private act into a semiprivate legal act of a composite nature: the Conference's resolutions thus verge on the sphere of public international law by reason of the capacity of their authors, and any obligations they contain can be upheld vis-&agrave;-vis States to an extent to be specified later&quot;.[6]</I><BR>

<P>State representatives are also able to intervene in order to keep the resolutions within such bounds as they deem compatible with their government's requirements. The fact that measures advocated by the Red Cross world are thus formulated in conjunction with government representatives is conducive to their eventual adoption by governments. Such was the case with the Geneva Conventions themselves.<BR>

<P>After an opening ceremony, the International Conference meets in plenary session to elect its Chairman, Vice-Chairmen, a Secretary-General and two Assistant Secretaries-General. Delegates then split up into two commissions, each of which may propose resolutions for submission to the Conference as a whole. The resolutions themselves determine the policy which States and the Movement will pursue with regard to the humanitarian problems of the moment.<BR>

<P>What powers does the Conference have? It takes decisions (recommendations and resolutions) which are binding on the statutory bodies of the Movement solely in respect of issues falling within the latter's exclusive competence, namely the interpretation and revision of the Statutes of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, its Rules of Procedure and disputes between its members. The Conference also ensures Red Cross <I>unity of effort</I> and respect for the Fundamental Principles.[7] It may confer mandates on the ICRC and the Federation with their agreement, though without modifying their Statutes.[8] On all other matters its authority is essentially a moral one and it can only issue recommendations. Those arrangements are in accordance with the spirit of the International Red Cross, one characteristic of which is the independence of its various components.<BR>
	<BR>
The International Conference's competence for handing down mandatory rules depends on whom those rules are intended for. It is broader in the case of the Red Cross or Red Crescent institutions than it is for States, and has greater implications for the ICRC and the Federation than for National Societies or States in that Conference resolutions concern the international aspect of the Movement as a whole. If adopted unanimously, however, such resolutions must be regarded as an expression of the international community's legal convictions. <BR>
	<BR>
Resolutions of the International Conference of the Red Cross therefore have some impact on international law which must be gauged on a case-by-case basis. <BR>

<P>It is also through resolutions of the Conference that the Movement has set itself the Fundamental Principles which guide its work, and has branched out into new areas of activity.<BR>

<P>Lastly, the Conference has left its mark on the development of international humanitarian law. Historically, all draft revisions of the Geneva Convention, as well as draft new humanitarian law treaties, have always been submitted to the International Conference, which has endorsed them for transmission with its recommendations to a Diplomatic Conference qualified to adopt hem.<BR>
	<BR>
Indeed, the International Conference has prompted decisive advances in that respect, and humanitarian law would not be what it is today without the Conference's own contribution. Moreover, the Conference has been and still is a forum for dialogue on the implementation of and respect for humanitarian law. Through its resolutions it has often been able to exert real pressure to restore respect for humanitarian law and put an end to violations it has condemned.<BR>
	<BR>
Discussions at International Conferences have also helped strengthen cooperation between the Red Cross and Red Crescent institutions and States to respond to the new challenges the Movement has had to face ever since its inception in 1863.<BR>
	<BR>
The protection of war victims, the organization of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the limitation of warfare are but a few of the fields on which International Conferences have left their mark.<BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>Protection of war victims, revision of the Geneva Conventions and development of international humanitarian law</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B>Wounded and sick in armed forces in the field</B><BR>

<P>In 1863 the International Committee decided to take the lead and convene an International Conference in Geneva to consider ways of remedying the inadequacy of medical services of armies in the field.<BR>
	<BR>
That first International Conference of 1863 brought together 36 delegates, including representatives of 14 governments, and adopted as a basis for discussion the Draft Covenant prepared by the Geneva Committee. Its discussions concentrated on the organization of national committees - the future National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies - and, more particularly, on the possibility of sending voluntary nurses in the wake of armies.<BR>

<P>The Geneva Committee's proposals were adopted in the form of ten resolutions and three recommendations addressed to governments,[9] which paved the way for the organization of the Movement and were the source of its Statutes. The adoption of those resolutions and recommendations marked a milestone in the development of humanitarian law and the protection of war victims. As Pierre Boissier so aptly wrote:<BR>

<P>&quot;<I>The resolutions and recommendations adopted at the conference of October 1863 constitute the fundamental charter for the relief of persons wounded in war. They are among the few fundamental texts which have positively influenced the destiny of man. They have not eliminated war but they have diminished its hold over man and have deprived it of innumerable victims</I>&quot;.[10]<BR>

<P>He considered that this must be recorded to its credit in the annals of mankind.<BR>

<P>The resolutions and recommendations of the Conference in 1863 laid the foundations for what was to become the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement but, since they were adopted by a conference without recognized competence, they were not binding upon States. In the following summer the Swiss government, at the ICRC's suggestion, therefore convened a Diplomatic Conference which adopted the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field, of 22 August 1864. That marked the beginning of contemporary international humanitarian law.<BR>

<P>The Geneva Convention was revised for the first time in 1906 and again in 1929 to take due account of the lessons of the First World War. Another revision, far more fundamental than its predecessors, took place after the Second World War and gave rise to the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field, of 12 August 1949, which is still in force today.<BR>

<P>During each revision, the International Conference played an essential part by examining the drafts prepared by the ICRC and stressing the importance it (the Conference) attached to the new provisions. <BR>
	<BR>
<B>Wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea</B><BR>

<P>It was also the International Conference that called for the principles of the Geneva Convention to be extended to war at sea. Consideration was given to the matter at the 1st, 2nd, 5th and 6th Conferences, held in Paris in 1867, Berlin in 1869, Rome in 1892 and Vienna in 1897 respectively,[11] and ultimately led to the Convention for the Adaptation to Maritime Warfare of the Principles of the Geneva Convention, adopted at The Hague on 29 July 1899 and revised on 18 October 1907. This Convention, too, was revised in 1949 to incorporate the lessons drawn from the two World Wars. Thus came into being the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, of 12 August 1949, which protects the shipwrecked and hospital ships.<BR>

<P><B>Prisoners of war</B><BR>

<P>Was it not the mission of the Red Cross, which sought to bring help to wounded members of the armed forces, also to ease the moral sufferings entailed by captivity? Prince Demidoff made his convictions in that respect clear from the start and Henry Dunant himself, speaking at the 1st International Conference of Aid Societies for the Nursing of the War Wounded, held in Paris in 1867.[12]<BR>

<P>Without actually going into the protection of and assistance to prisoners of war, the 2nd International Conference, held in Berlin in 1869, nonetheless adopted a resolution to the effect that in the event of war the International Committee should ensure the formation, at a suitably selected locality, of a correspondence and information bureau to facilitate by all means the exchange of messages between committees and the forwarding of relief.[13]<BR>

<P>The scope of that resolution should not be underestimated, for it led to the creation of a body which has provided irreplaceable services, namely the Central Tracing Agency.<BR>

<P>Indeed, ever since the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the International Committee has been venturing along new paths, far beyond the tasks entrusted to the modest information bureau envisaged at the Berlin Conference. Moreover, the Basel Agency did not confine itself to assisting wounded and sick members of the armed forces but extended its activities to able-bodied prisoners of war.<BR>
	<BR>
This was no easy matter, however. Although the transmission of lists of able-bodied prisoners was an obvious humanitarian task which the Red Cross could not ignore, the new activity implied a reorientation of the Movement as a whole, for until then the Red Cross had dealt only with wounded and sick members of the armed forces and neither the resolutions of 1863 nor any subsequent resolution had called upon it to intervene on behalf of able-bodied prisoners.<BR>
	<BR>
The role of the Red Cross in assisting prisoners of war was broached at the 7th International Conference, held in St. Petersburg in 1902. It was discussed in the light of the Regulations relating to the Laws and Customs of War on Land, adopted by the First Peace Conference held at The Hague in 1899. Article 14 of the Hague Regulations provided for the setting up of national bureaux for information on prisoners of war, while Article 15 entrusted relief work on behalf of prisoners of war to voluntary institutions, &quot;the<I> </I>Relief societies for prisoners of war&quot; which, three years after the adoption of the Hague Convention, had still not been established! <BR>
	<BR>
The Central Committees in both Paris and St. Petersburg took the view that only the Red Cross was in a position to perform the tasks laid down by the Hague Regulations, since it alone could rescue prisoners of war from the abandonment and isolation that had always been part of captivity. To do so, a special commission should be set up within each National Society to take advantage of the Society's organization and contacts, but without drawing on the resources allocated to hospital care.[14]<BR>

<P>As that proposal would mean a fundamental reorientation of the Red Cross, the Conference decided to refer it to the next Conference for consideration.<BR>
	<BR>
The issue was therefore raised again at the 8th International Conference, held in London in 1907. In the meantime, however, there had been two new developments. On the one hand, the National Societies had been examining their conscience and most of them had decided to assume the responsibility of assisting prisoners of war. Then again, during the recent Russo-Japanese conflict, both the Russian and the Japanese Red Cross Societies had helped able-bodied prisoners as well as wounded and sick members of the armed forces. The national information bureaux provided for in Article 14 of the Hague Regulations had therefore operated on both sides.<BR>

<P>The 9th International Conference, held in Washington in 1912, ultimately decided the issue. After lengthy discussions of a subject which had absorbed the attention of three International Conferences (St. Petersburg in 1902, London in 1907 and Washington in 1912), the Red Cross decided to take over the tasks entrusted to the phantom societies of the Hague Regulations. And since, foreseeably, no belligerent State would readily agree to delegates of the adverse party's National Society providing relief to prisoners of their own nationality detained within its territory, it was agreed to entrust that task to ICRC delegates. Such was the purpose of Resolution VI of the Washington Conference, proposed by the French Red Cross and adopted unanimously.[15]<BR>
	<BR>
Three International Conferences thus took place before the Red Cross could decide to do, on an official and regular basis, what it had already done so successfully during the Franco-Prussian War of 40 years before.<BR>

<P>However, the scope of Resolution VI of the Washington Conference should not be underestimated, for it is undoubtedly the most important of all decisions taken by the Red Cross since 1863.<BR>
	<BR>
By acknowledging the competence of the Red Cross to assist prisoners of war, the resolution set the institution on a new course of action which was to assume an unprecedented dimension. In addition, it altered the relationship between the associations gathered under the red cross emblem.<BR>
	<BR>
From the start, the Red Cross had been both national and international. Its success was largely due to the fact that it had been able to maintain a balance between those dual aspects and avoid the pitfalls both of nationalism, which would have severed the bonds of solidarity between the Central Committees, and of internationalism, which would have cut it off from its own national roots. Indirectly, Resolution VI shifted the balance somewhat, for whereas hospital care constituted first and foremost a national activity, as did peacetime activities, assisting prisoners of war required closer cooperation at the international level.<BR>
	<BR>
Under Resolution VI of the Washington Conference, the ICRC was made responsible for visiting servicemen in captivity and distributing relief supplies destined for them. Tasks were thus assigned to it that went beyond mere liaison. The Washington resolution made the International Committee the linchpin of assistance to prisoners of war.[16]<BR>

<P>Resolution VI came just at the right time. Moreover it contained an emergency clause, calling upon the special commissions responsible for providing assistance for prisoners of war to contact the ICRC within one year.[17] That one-year period was to prove too long; within five months, Resolution VI had to be put into initial effect when the Balkan Wars broke out. Europe was already headed for the First World War.<BR>
	<BR>
Since August 1914, the ICRC had been reminding all the National Societies of their commitments under Resolution VI of the Washington Conference and announcing the opening in Geneva of the International Prisoner-of-War Agency.<BR>
	<BR>
The expansion of ICRC activities during the First World War is well documented: the Agency communicated some 8 million items of information concerning prisoners of war, ICRC delegates carried out over 500 visits to prisoner-of-war camps and arranged for the transport and delivery of more than 1,800 wagon-loads of relief supplies and, once the war was over, the ICRC played a decisive part in the repatriation of prisoners.[18]<BR>

<P>Over the same period, however, the Great War cruelly revealed the shortcomings of the Hague Regulations, which set out general principles rather than immediately applicable rules and did not provide for any control mechanism.<BR>

<P>Immediately after the First World War, therefore, the ICRC began to prepare for revision of the Geneva Convention of 6 July 1906 and adoption of a new Convention to protect prisoners of war. Both items were entered on the agenda of the 10th International Conference of the Red Cross,[19] held at Geneva in 1921, and again on that of the 11th Conference,[20] which met in Geneva in 1923. The draft Conventions that emerged from the Conference in 1923 were transmitted to the Swiss Federal Council which, in July 1929, convened a Diplomatic Conference to review the Geneva Convention and prepare a new Convention to protect prisoners of war.<BR>
	<BR>
The Prisoner-of-War Code of 27 July 1929 rendered incalculable services throughout the Second World War. For millions of prisoners it meant the difference between captivity - admittedly hard enough to bear - and death. Its revision was nonetheless considered necessary after the Second World War to take account of the lessons of that unprecedented conflict. The result was the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, of 12 August 1949.<BR>

<P>The First World War had shown that war no longer took its toll among members of the armed forces alone, but that civilians were also being more severely affected than ever before. Territorial occupation, countless acts of violence and other excesses, internment and hostage-taking had created thousands of civilian victims who were not protected by the Geneva Convention of 1906.<BR>

<P>Was it enough, once peace had been restored, to stigmatize practices which seemed to come from a bygone age, or was it better to work for a convention to protect civilians in the hands of the enemy, even if there was a risk of sanctioning, by regulation of them, forms of behaviour that were morally unacceptable but whose recurrence international law had proved powerless to prevent? <BR>
	<BR>
The ICRC resolutely opted for the second solution.[21] The 10th International Conference, held in Geneva in 1921, likewise recommended that governments should adopt a diplomatic convention without delay to protect prisoners of war, deportees, evacuees and refugees, and called upon the ICRC to prepare a preliminary draft.[22]<BR>

<P>Convinced, however, that protection for prisoners of war and for civilian war victims had to be formulated in two separate texts, the ICRC submitted two draft conventions to the 11th International Conference, which took place in Geneva in 1923: one on prisoners of war, which eventually became the Convention of 1929 already discussed, and the other on civilians in enemy hands.<BR>

<P>On the dubious grounds that the fate of civilians in enemy hands came under the laws of war and was not a matter for the Red Cross, the 11th Conference dismissed the draft Convention on civilians and simply adopted a recommendation without any practical significance.[23]<BR>

<P>The ICRC tried to address the subject again at the 12th International Conference, but equally unsuccessfully. The Conference adopted a resolution that was as well-intentioned as it was ineffectual.[24]<BR>

<P>Once more the ICRC raised the issue by submitting to the 15th International Conference, held in Tokyo in October 1934, a draft Convention on civilians of enemy nationality on territory belonging to or occupied by a belligerent.[25]	<BR>
The draft contained general principles concerning <I>inter alia</I> permission to leave enemy territory and the banning of reprisals, deportation and the execution of hostages; it assured civilian internees of treatment at least equal to that of prisoners of war, and its provisions on the organization of monitoring were based on those of the Prisoner-of-War Code.[26]<BR>

<P>The <I>Tokyo Draft</I>, as it is commonly known, was not above criticism. Its provisions on occupied territories, among other things, could be construed as very timid given the experience gained during the First World War. However, it limited the rights of captor and occupier alike and prohibited the more arbitrary and cruel measures, thus offering an invaluable safeguard to civilian war victims; lastly, and maybe most importantly, it provided a basis for supporting the action of Protecting Powers and of the ICRC itself.<BR>
	<BR>
The Tokyo Conference recognized the value of the draft and asked the ICRC to do everything necessary to arrive at a Convention on the subject.[27] The ICRC therefore transmitted the draft to the Federal Council, which undertook to consult the governments most directly concerned; several governments expressed their doubts and, in the view of Federal Councillor Giuseppe Motta, the French government in particular sent &quot;a firm and definite refusal&quot;.[28] In the circumstances, the Federal Political Department concluded that the auguries were insufficiently favourable for any real chance of success and refused to convene a diplomatic conference.<BR>
	<BR>
Had the project completely foundered? The ICRC thought not. Immediately after the 16th International Conference, held in London in June 1938, it attempted to gain approval for several draft conventions, including in particular the one on the protection of civilians in enemy hands.<BR>

<P>However, the rationale of war prevailed. The Diplomatic Conference which the London Conference had called for was unable to meet owing to Germany's attack on Poland, which meant that those civilians who fell into the hands of the adverse party during the Second World War were deprived of any convention-based protection against the dictates of the detaining or occupying power. Countless acts of persecution occurred, culminating in the horror of the concentration camps and genocide. <BR>
	<BR>
<B>From the Geneva Conventions of 1949 to the Additional Protocols of 1977</B><BR>

<P>The Second World War had amply demonstrated the need to supplement the humanitarian conventions, especially with a view to providing proper protection for the civilian population.<BR>
	<BR>
After sending a memorandum to governments and National Societies on 15 February 1945, the ICRC submitted its initial drafts to the Preliminary Conference of National Red Cross Societies for the study of the Conventions and of various problems relative to the Red Cross, convened in Geneva from 26 July to 3 August 1945, and then to the Conference of Government Experts for the Study of Conventions for the Protection of War Victims, held in Geneva from 14 to 26 April 1947.<BR>
	<BR>
The International Committee then prepared four draft conventions, based on the findings of those two preparatory conferences and other consultations, relating to the wounded and sick in armies in the field (revision of the Geneva Convention of 27 July 1929), the wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea (revision of the Hague Convention of 18 October 1907), prisoners of war (revision of the Convention of 27 July 1929) and for the protection of civilian persons in time of war.<BR>
	<BR>
Those drafts were submitted to the 17th International Conference, meeting in Stockholm from 20 to 30 August 1948, which referred them to its Legal Commission for consideration. The Commission examined them article by article and approved them, subject to a few amendments. The Stockholm Conference further recommended &quot;that all Governments meet at the earliest possible moment in Diplomatic Conference for the adoption and signature of the texts now approved&quot;.[29]<BR>

<P>Convened by the Federal Council, the Diplomatic Conference opened in Geneva on 21 April 1949[30] and completed its work on 12 August 1949 after adopting four Conventions for the protection of war victims, including a new one extending protection to civilians. These were:<BR>
	<BR>
-	the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (First Convention);<BR>

<P>-	the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea (Second Convention);<BR>
	<BR>
-	the Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (Third Convention);<BR>
	<BR>
-	the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (Fourth Convention).<BR>
	<BR>
Two conclusions must be drawn with regard to the role of the 17th International Conference in formulating the Geneva Conventions. First, the Conference adopted the drafts practically as they had been prepared by the ICRC, i.e. harmonizing in four separate Conventions the Geneva Conventions of 1929 and the Hague Conventions of 1907. Second, it followed the ICRC's proposals for the protection of civilians, which went far beyond the Tokyo Draft. The Conference thus did much more than pave the way for the Diplomatic Conference of 1949: it presented the draft texts of the four new Conventions in their final form.<BR>
	<BR>
After the Geneva Conventions of 1949, of which it had been the architect, and especially the Fourth Convention protecting civilians in wartime had been adopted, the ICRC was all too well aware that the rules governing the conduct of hostilities had remained unchanged since the Second Peace Conference, held in The Hague in 1907. The rules on aerial bombardment in particular dated from the days of airships, so the protection of civilians and of non-combatants in general could clearly not be guaranteed without an updating of the rules governing the conduct of hostilities. <BR>
	<BR>
To remedy the situation, the ICRC prepared two draft additional protocols and submitted them to the 22nd International Conference of the Red Cross, which was held in Tehran from 8 to 15 November 1973. The Conference approved them without amendment and recommended that the next Diplomatic Conference convened by the Federal Council should adopt them as a basis for discussion.[31]<BR>
	<BR>
The Diplomatic Conference on the Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law applicable in Armed Conflicts met in Geneva in four sessions from 1974 to 1977. It was attended by representatives of 124 States and a number of national liberation movements, and the ICRC was associated with its work in an expert capacity. The Conference completed its work on 10 June 1977 after adopting two additional protocols:<BR>

<P>the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I);<BR>
	<BR>
* the Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Protection of Victims of Non-International Armed Conflits (Protocol II).<BR>
	<BR>
* The Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions came into force on 7 December 1978.[32] By 19 September 1995,[33] 186 States had become party to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, 140 to Protocol I and 131 to Protocol II.<BR>
	<BR>
The International Conferences held since 1977 have adopted a series of resolutions calling on States which have not yet become party to the Additional Protocols to do so and requesting the ICRC and the National Societies to make those instruments known and encourage their ratification.[34]<BR>
	<BR>
<B>Red Cross action in the event of civil war</B><BR>

<P>The American Red Cross must be credited with having prompted the first international consideration of Red Cross intervention in cases of internal conflict, for it was that Society which submitted to the 9th International Conference of the Red Cross, held in Washington in 1912, a report on the role of the Red Cross in the event of civil war or insurrection.[35]<BR>
	<BR>
The American Red Cross memorandum was a remarkable effort to reconcile the interests of victims, the impartiality and freedom of action of the Red Cross and the rights of the conflicting parties. The prerogatives of the legitimate government were also safeguarded. The draft moreover stressed that offers of service by National Societies of third countries must be of a philanthropic nature and could not be regarded as a recognition of belligerency, or even as a first step towards such recognition.<BR>
	<BR>
Although the draft nonetheless sparked a defensive reaction by several representatives of European governments, particularly that of Tsarist Russia, it was discussed within a Special Commission and then in plenary session. In order to avoid a vote which would have caused a rift within the Movement without enhancing the possibilities of Red Cross action, the Conference decided, however, not to express any opinion on the report submitted to it but merely to take cognizance of it.[36]<BR>

<P>What most National Societies lacked was experience of relief action on behalf of victims of internal conflicts. Rather than time, a precedent was needed. The upheavals that followed the First World War were soon to provide the occasion for it.<BR>
	<BR>
Nine years elapsed between the Washington Conference and the 10th International Conference in Geneva in 1921. This lengthy period was marked not only by the First World War but also by the Russian civil war, the Hungarian revolution and Spartacism in Germany, all civil war situations in which the Red Cross intervened without hesitation. <BR>
	<BR>
It was henceforth agreed as a matter of principle that the Red Cross was competent to assist victims of insurrections and civil wars. The inclusion of this item on the agenda of the 10th Conference was intended to prompt consideration of how, and not whether, such intervention should take place.<BR>

<P>Reports were submitted to the Conference by several National Societies,[37] virtually all of which had been confronted by civil wars or internal disturbances. In addition, the ICRC had devoted a chapter of its General Report to its interventions in Russia and Hungary.<BR>

<P>Although they referred to widely differing experiences, the reports submitted by the National Societies revealed many points of convergence, including the fact that Red Cross competence for assisting the victims of war or civilian disturbances was considered self-evident.<BR>

<P>Provided that the principle of impartiality was duly observed, the reports also expressed the view that the victims of a civil war should be assisted first and foremost by the National Society of the country concerned, though to do so with any chance of success it was essential that it retain complete independence, both from the political authorities and from the parties and factions involved.<BR>
	<BR>
It would, however, have been unreasonable to expect the National Society of a country disrupted by civil war to succeed indefinitely in dissociating itself from the struggle and carrying out its mission in a situation where the very State itself might disintegrate. Provision therefore had to be made for the intervention of a neutral international body capable of pursuing humanitarian action at the national level and, if necessary, preserving the independence and inviolability of the Red Cross vis-&agrave;-vis the respective parties. Lastly, assistance had to be organized at the international level. Presumably the ICRC would be requested to play this essential and natural intermediary role - a conclusion reached <I>inter alia </I>in the report by the German Red Cross.<BR>
	<BR>
The National Society reports thus gave the ICRC pride of place, stating the view that it should not only serve as the focal point for the organization of relief at the international level but also continue action at the national level if a National Society became paralysed. Those at least were the conclusions reached by the German Red Cross, the Italian Red Cross, the Ottoman Red Crescent and the Russian Red Cross (former organization).<BR>
	<BR>
The reports by the National Societies were submitted to the Conference's Third Commission, whose conclusions confirmed the analyses set out therein: on the one hand, the Red Cross had the right and duty to assist all victims of civil war; on the other, the National Society of a country stricken by civil war was primarily responsible for assisting the victims thereof; the independence and complete freedom of action of that Society should be respected; and, lastly, the ICRC was responsible for organizing relief at the international level.[38]<BR>

<P>The Third Commission's conclusions were adopted without discussion by the plenary Conference, which also adopted six resolutions; these were grouped together in Resolution XIV, which bears the title &quot;Civil War&quot;.<BR>
	<BR>
What conclusions may be drawn from Resolution XIV as adopted by the 10th International Conference in 1921? Three facts stand out:<BR>
	<BR>
First, the Russian civil war, which had just ended, had been one of the main concerns of the Conference; even though there were few direct references to it, the allusions were too transparent to be misunderstood.<BR>
	<BR>
Secondly, despite its clumsy drafting, Resolution XIV should not be underestimated. It is one of the most important texts in the history of the Red Cross, opening up a new field of action in a domain which international law had failed to codify. For over a quarter of a century, it was the only text on which the Red Cross could base its assistance to the victims of internal conflicts.[39]<BR>

<P>Lastly, Resolution XIV spectacularly confirmed the position of the ICRC, to which the Conference entrusted the mandate of intervening in relief work in the event of civil war. The ICRC thus emerges not only as the hub of relief action in the event of civil war but also as the authorized representative of the Movement as a whole.[40]<BR>

<P>During the Upper Silesian conflict and the Spanish war, however, the ICRC went far beyond the organization of relief as envisaged in Resolution XIV of the 10th International Conference and, in both those internal conflicts, endeavoured to gain respect for a minimum of humanitarian rules while actively helping to put them into practice. In a way, it transposed the operational pattern it had developed during conflicts between States and tried, often successfully, to cover the entire field of activity within the scope of the Geneva and Hague Conventions, which it constantly claimed should be applied by analogy.<BR>
	<BR>
It can thus be seen that the ICRC's policy and practical work are determined by its right to take any humanitarian initiative, for that is what comes into play here. It is even one of the factors which have contributed most directly to the development of contemporary humanitarian law.<BR>
	<BR>
The 16th International Conference, held in London in June 1938 under ominously darkening skies,[41] was to provide admittedly guarded support for the ICRC's new proposals regarding assistance in times of civil war.<BR>
 <BR>
Drawing on its experience in Upper Silesia, Ireland and Spain, the ICRC submitted a report to the Conference on the role and activity of the Red Cross in time of civil war. This report emphasized and enlarged on Resolution XIV of the International Conference of 1921 and drew attention to the diversity of the situations envisaged, which far exceeded situations of armed conflict alone. It was accompanied by a draft resolution designed not only to determine the possibilities and conditions of Red Cross intervention in the event of internal strife, but also to define guiding principles for the behaviour of combatants towards victims of conflict.<BR>
	<BR>
That draft resolution was certainly one of the most complete texts ever proposed to establish a legal regime applicable to internal conflicts in which there is no recognition of belligerency. It constituted a draft set of genuine regulations for the protection of victims of internal strife.<BR>
	<BR>
The fact that the ICRC report was sent in advance to all National Societies in February 1938 led the Spanish Red Cross in Madrid to publish a report on the same subject. On the basis of its experience during the civil war in its own country, the Spanish Red Cross demonstrated the need for the ICRC to intervene in the event of civil war as the sole neutral intermediary capable of taking effective action in such situations. <BR>
	<BR>
The reports by the ICRC and the Spanish Red Cross were submitted to the Conference's Legal Commission, which examined them in depth. Eventually, a compromise solution was reached. In Resolution XIV, which was voted without discussion and in plenary session, the 16th International Conference recalled Resolution XIV adopted by the 10th Conference in 1921 and invited the ICRC to continue its efforts to obtain the application of the two Geneva Conventions of 1929 and the Xth Hague Convention of 1907 to victims of civil wars. However, the resolution deferred the adoption of a more binding text and requested the ICRC, making use of its own practical experience, to continue its study of the problems raised by civil war as regards the Red Cross.[42] It was thus a kind of exhortation in which the Conference paid tribute to the work spontaneously undertaken by the ICRC on behalf of victims of internal conflicts and encouraged it to continue its activity in that connection, but without giving it the legal basis it wished to have for that activity.<BR>
	<BR>
In short, rather than risk a split over a text more clearly defined in scope, the Conference opted for the unanimous adoption of one that was bland enough to pass unopposed. But the need for a codification of the law applicable to internal conflict could not be postponed for long. It fell to the Diplomatic Conference responsible for revising the Geneva Conventions after the Second World War to resolve the issue. It did so by adopting Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949.<BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>Organization of the Movement</B></H4>
<P>	<BR>
<B>The Movement's Statutes</B><BR>

<P>Until the end of the First World War, the legal structure of the Red Cross was relatively slender, consisting of the resolutions of the founding Conference of October 1883, which the ICRC and the National Societies considered binding, a few resolutions of a regulatory nature adopted by International Conferences of the Red Cross, and a number of tacit rules imposed by the nature and aims of its work. Each International Conference adopted its own rules of procedure, using previous ones as a guide. Thus at the statutory level, the International Red Cross was governed by rules that were to a large extent customary.[43]<BR>

<P>With the funding of the League of Red Cross Societies arose the question of the Movement's organization at the international level, for the coexistence of two bodies at that level necessitated a rational sharing of tasks and responsibilities, as well as a clear demarcation between the position of the ICRC and that of the League within the Movement. The Red Cross as a whole had to adopt a statutory structure designed to safeguard the unity of the Movement and harmonize the activities of the National Societies, the ICRC and the League.<BR>
	<BR>
This is no place for a detailed account of those difficult negotiations.[44] Once all possibilities of merging the ICRC and the League had been explored in vain, it was eventually concluded that both should continue to exist as mutually complementary organizations. No attempt should be made to amalgamate them into a single body; each of them should be assigned a well-defined field of activity and they should form part of a larger institution, the International Red Cross.<BR>

<P>A set of draft Statutes drawn up by Professor Max Huber, then a member of the Committee, and by Colonel Draudt, Vice-President of the League, were adopted by the 13th International Conference at The Hague in October 1928.[45]<BR>

<P>Although for the most part the Statutes of the International Red Cross did no more than confirm the <I>status quo</I>, the delegates meeting in The Hague firmly believed that they had laid the foundations of a veritable international organization by giving the Red Cross statutory bodies vested with clearly defined powers.<BR>
	<BR>
The Statutes of the International Red Cross were revised at the 18th International Conference, held in Toronto in 1952. The main amendments were designed to give a more explicit definition of the respective competences of the ICRC and the League and to develop cooperation between the two institutions.[46]<BR>

<P>The Statutes were again revised at the 25th International Conference,[47] held in Geneva in 1986.<BR>
	<BR>
The basic tenor of the Statutes remained unchanged, although the Conference replaced the term &quot;International Red Cross&quot; by &quot;International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement&quot; to reflect the principle of the National Societies' equality, a principle that had been recognized from the beginning.<BR>

<P>It is not the purpose of this article to explain the content or offer an analysis of the Statutes.[48] It should, however, be noted that the Statutes adopted by the 13th International Conference of the Red Cross in 1928 and subsequently revised by the 18th and 25th International Conferences have stood the test of time. For more than three-quarters of a century they have provided and continue to provide the framework for the development of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, just as the Fundamental Principles have done in the moral sphere.<BR>
	<BR>
<B>The Fundamental Principles</B><BR>

<P>From the very start, the Red Cross was aware of following a number of fundamental principles dictated by the aims of the institution and the nature of its proposed activities. To a large extent these principles were expressed in the resolutions and recommendations of the Conference of 1863 and in the Geneva Convention of 1864.<BR>
	<BR>
In 1869, the Berlin Conference asked the International Committee to ensure that the principles were upheld and disseminated. But it was only in 1874 that Gustave Moynier, President of the ICRC, attempted for the first time to formulate the Fundamental Principles, namely <I>centralization</I> (only one Society in each country), <I>preparedness</I> (each Society should prepare for its activities in the event of war),<I> neutrality</I> (with regard to victims) and <I>solidarity</I> (between Societies).<BR>
	<BR>
When revising its own statutes after the First World War, the ICRC included the mention of four <I>&quot;fundamental and uniform principles which are at the basis of the Red Cross institution, namely: impartiality, political, religious and economic independence, he universality of the Red Cross and the equality of its members</I>&quot;.[49]<BR>

<P>These principles are mentioned, in almost identical wording, in Article 10 of the &quot;Conditions for the recognition of National Red Cross Societies&quot; approved by the 17th International Conference of the Red Cross (Stockholm, 1948), and in Article VI, para. 2, of the Statutes of the International Red Cross, revised by the Toronto Conference in 1952.<BR>

<P>To the four existing principles, however, the League's Board of Governors meeting in Oxford in 1946 (XIXth session) and Stockholm in 1948 (XXth session) added 13 others, in which the aims of the Red Cross, its fundamental principles and some rules of procedure were jumbled together.<BR>

<P>The Toronto Conference endorsed this new statement of principles, while stressing that the four original principles remained &quot;the corne-stone of the Red Cross&quot; - a remark that only added to the confusion.<BR>
	<BR>
Universally acceptable wording nonetheless had to be found. The Standing Commission decided to set up a joint ICRC-League commission for the purpose. On the basis of the resolutions of past Conferences and, in particular, the work accomplished by Max Huber and Jean Pictet, the joint commission prepared a draft of seven articles which was sent to all National Societies and approved unanimously by the Council of Delegates, meeting in Prague in 1961. The draft was then submitted to the 20th International Conference (Vienna, 1965), where it was adopted unanimously under the title <I>&quot;Proclamation of the Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross</I>&quot;.[50]<BR>

<P>Since then, the Fundamental Principles - humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary status, unity and universality - have been solemnly read out at the opening ceremony of each International Conference and are recognized as the Movement's basic charter.<BR>
	<BR>
The Fundamental Principles proclaimed by the 20th International Conference and reaffirmed by the 25th Conference are mandatory for all Red Cross and Red Crescent bodies. The representatives of the States party to the Geneva Conventions who attend the Conference must respect the principles in the same way as all the other delegations.[51]<BR>

<P><B>Recognition of National Societies</B><BR>

<P>Since 1876 the International Committee, as the founding body of the Red Cross and custodian of its principles, has applied a systematic procedure for the recognition of any new National Society wishing to become a member of the Movement.[52]<BR>

<P>By sending out circulars, the ICRC notified the National Societies of the foundation of any new Society, which became a member of the Movement after having met specific criteria: no equivalent and previously recognized Red Cross or Red Crescent Society already in existence (<I>criterion of unity</I>), sound management of the applicant Society and official recognition of it by the public authorities of its country (<I>criterion of independence</I>), and willingness of the applicant Society to take part in the activities of a universal Movement and respect its principles and ideals (<I>criterion of universality</I>). <BR>
	<BR>
On the basis of those provisions, in 1947 a joint commission of ICRC and League representatives prepared a draft confirming the previous practice and laying down the conditions that any new Society must meet to become a member of the Movement. The draft was adopted by the 17th International Conference of the Red Cross in Stockholm in 1948.[53]<BR>

<P>That resolution by the Stockholm Conference codified, within the framework of the Movement as a whole, a practice established by the ICRC as early as 1876. It also placed all National Societies on an equal footing, since all of them, even those already recognized, are required to meet the conditions for recognition.[54]<BR>

<P>Lastly, it should be noted that the 17th Conference did not challenge the ICRC's competence in the matter: the International Committee itself decides on the recognition of any new National Society, even though it does so on the basis of a prior examination carried out in close consultation with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.<BR>
	<BR>
<B>Principles and rules in the event of disasters</B><BR>

<P>The steady expansion of relief activities by the National Societies and their Federation during natural or technological disasters made it necessary to adopt rules for such operations in order to ensure mutual coordination of efforts and overall efficiency.<BR>
	<BR>
The <I>Principles and Rules for Red Cross Disaster Relief </I>were adopted at the 21st International Conference of the Red Cross in 1969.[55] Since then, every International Conference has taken decisions revising the <I>Principles and Rules</I> in order to adapt them to new situations and strengthen cooperation between the Federation, the National Societies and the ICRC in that specific field.[56]<BR>

<P>The 1991 Council of Delegates, in its Resolution 17, furthermore approved the drafting of a <I>Code of Conduct </I>for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and non-governmental organizations. That <I>Code</I>, which seeks to set principles of conduct applicable to all organizations taking part in disaster relief, will be submitted to the 26th International Conference to be held in Geneva this December.<BR>
	<BR>
<B>Other activities of the Movement covered by resolutions adopted by the International Conference</B><BR>

<P>Besides the Movement's Statutes and general organization, the International Conferences have adopted many resolutions to encourage and develop the activities of the Red Cross and Red Crescent.<BR>
	<BR>
It is not possible to go into detail here on the diverse areas of activity discussed by the International Conferences; to cite only a few at random, they have included the financing of the ICRC and the Federation, youth, voluntary service, exemption from customs duties and other facilities accorded to Red Cross staff, regional conferences, funds and medals, the press, blood transfusions, the fight against drug and tobacco addiction and even environmental protection.<BR>
	<BR>
<B>Limitations on warfare</B><BR>

<P>Faced with the major conflicts of our times, the International Conferences could not remain indifferent to the devastation wrought thereby or, more particularly, to the pernicious effects of technological developments in weaponry.<BR>
	<BR>
The post-war Conferences have consequently adopted many resolutions, often at the initiative of the ICRC, to limit or ban the use of weapons of mass destruction (chemical, bacteriological and nuclear weapons) and highlight the terrible threat such weapons pose to mankind.[57]<BR>

<P>The 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, to be held in Geneva early in December 1995, will pursue these efforts to ban certain such weapons and, in particular, the manufacture and use of anti-personnel mines.<BR>
	<BR>
These words on the limitation of warfare would not be complete without an unfortunately all too brief reference to the Red Cross contribution to peace. This subject, too, has been addressed by the International Conferences, which have adopted many resolutions to encourage peace initiatives, international rapprochement[58] and the struggle against racial discrimination and prejudice.[59]<BR>
	<BR>

<H4><B>A summing-up</B></H4>
<P>	<BR>
	Any account of the International Conferences must include a mention of the political problems they have had to face in the past. They have, it is true, sometimes been beset by political quarrels which have poisoned the atmosphere and paralysed their work, a fact which can only be deplored<BR>
	<BR>
There are various instances of this: the ideological controversies after the Korean war that emerged at the 18th Conference, held in Toronto in 1952, the question of Chinese representation at the 19th International Conference, held in New Delhi in 1957 and, more recently, the exclusion of the government delegation of the South African Republic from the 25th International Conference, held in Geneva in 1986, and the problem of Palestinian representation which led to the postponement of the 26th International Conference in 1991[60] are but a few of the setbacks which the International Conferences of the Red Cross have encountered and which have threatened the unity of the Movement.<BR>
	<BR>
However, those events - some of which were widely publicized - should not overshadow the many achievements of the Conferences themselves. Humanitarian law and action would not have become what they are today without the impetus given by the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent, which remains the prime international forum for addressing humanitarian issues.<BR>

<P>The International Conferences provide a unique opportunity for alerting States to the needs of the victims whom the Movement seeks to help. Admittedly, the dialogue with States is not confined to those few days every four years, but the big difference between bilateral contacts and the Conference is that the latter takes decisions which have a bearing upon the international community as a whole.<BR>
	<BR>
The Conference also obliges the governments to state publicly where they stand on the general or particular problems put before them. Any move to develop humanitarian law or to strengthen its implementation must perforce be dealt with by the International Conference. It is also at the International Conference that the international community makes commitments on National Society matters, in particular the development of the weakest among them.[61]<BR>

<P><B>Hopes placed in the 26th International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent</B><BR>

<P>The 26th International Conference thus hopes to resume such consideration at a more general level and examine what can be done to help the most vulnerable persons, to attenuate and prevent crises and, lastly, to strengthen the Movement and mobilize the public in support of its work.<BR>
	<BR>
To attenuate and prevent crises, the forthcoming Conference must secure greater respect for international humanitarian law during armed conflict, while remaining aware of the magnitude of the task and careful not to overreach itself.[62]<BR>

<P>But the Conference also enables our Movement to give evidence of the energy with which it intends to develop its member National Societies in order to assist victims more effectively and thus fulfil the ideals it has embraced ever since its inception in 1863. While promoting the network of National Societies as an essential tool for aiding the most vulnerable and thus for preventing crises, the Movement must also demonstrate its willingness to promote internal solidarity among its members.<BR>
	<BR>
Hence the importance of convincing all the participants in the Conference to make proper use of it as a forum for debate and for promoting humanitarian action and the protection of the world's most vulnerable people, and not as a sounding board for political causes. <BR>
	<BR>
As a humanitarian forum, what we can expect it to do is to highlight intolerable situations, identify appropriate short- and long-term measures for improving the lot of vulnerable people and, in such situations, make a firm commitment to provide the means necessary to implement those measures.<BR>
	<BR>
The Conference must therefore become a mobilizing force for all peoples, at the same time giving them an opportunity to express their solidarity with those who suffer and their wish to agree on specific commitments concerning areas where progress seems possible.<BR>
	<BR>
The success of the Conference, however, will depend most of all on the attitude of all the components of our Movement. They are the ones who must mobilize the public at large and the governments of every country worldwide by using the Conference to defend those whom they seek to help, and by creating support and approval for their action. They are also the ones who must imbue the Conference with the spirit of our Movement, making it a special event that stands apart from run-of-the-mill diplomatic meetings.<BR>
	<BR>
Our Movement will meet this challenge if it presents a united front, not by masking its diversity but rather by making the strength of its complementarity evident. It will thus be able to approach the Conference with confidence, viewing it as a constructive and forward-looking event for every participant. If our Movement goes about its preparations in this frame of mind it will, together with the governments, contribute to the success of this meeting in which so much hope has been placed.<BR>

<P>Les probl&egrave;mes pos&eacute;s par les mines antipersonnel, notamment au Cambodge, en Afghanistan, au Kowe&iuml;t, en<BR>
Angola, pour ne citer que les pays o&ugrave; elles ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;ploy&eacute;es en quantit&eacute;s consid&eacute;rables, et ce, dans des r&eacute;gions<BR>
o&ugrave; elles mettent en danger les populations civil m&ecirc;me longtemps apr&egrave;s la fin<B> </B>des hostilit&eacute;s, nous a amen&eacute; &agrave; nous<BR>
int&eacute;resser de plus pr&egrave;s.<BR>

<P>Dans cet article, qui ne saurait pr&eacute;tendre &ecirc;tre exhaustif, nous examinerons les diff&eacute;rents types de mines existant,<BR>
leur technologie, les moyens de les d&eacute;tecter et de les neutraliser, la possibilit&eacute; de les &eacute;quiper de dispositifs<BR>
d'autoneutralisation ou d'autodestruction et, Iast but not least, nous tenterons de faire le point sur la<BR>
probl&eacute;matique du commerce de ce type d'armes.<BR>

<P>Dans ces quelques lignes, nous ne nous occuperons que des mines antipersonnel, les mines antichars<BR>
appartenant &agrave; une cat&eacute;gorie &agrave; part qui ne repr&eacute;sente pas, en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, un danger direct pour les populations<BR>
civiles.[2]<BR>

<TABLE border>
<TR valign=top><TD>
<P>- Au moins dix millions de mines ont &eacute;t&eacute; dispers&eacute;es en Afghanistan depuis le d&eacute;but de la guerre, il y a 15 ans.[1]<BR>

<P>- Des centaines de milliers de mines - quatre millions selon certains - ont &eacute;t&eacute; pos&eacute;es au Cambodge au cours des 25 derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>- Elles tuent ou blessent une soixantaine de personnes chaque mois.<BR>

<P>- Au Kowe&iuml;t, on d&eacute;nombre environ un million de mines.<BR>

<P>- De 1945 &agrave; 1977, une quinzaine de millions de mines ont &eacute;t&eacute; retir&eacute;es du sol en Pologne.  Pendant la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode, quelque 4000 civils ont &eacute;t&eacute; tu&eacute;s et 9000 bless&eacute;s par des mines.[2]<BR>

<P>- D'importants champs de mines, datant de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, subsistent encore en Libye.<BR>

<P>- De vastes r&eacute;gions du monde sont interdites d'acc&egrave;s, de mani&egrave;re permanente, en raison des mines.<BR>

<P>- Les mines sont aussi meurtri&egrave;res pour les &ecirc;tres humains apr&egrave;s la guerre que pendant les hostilit&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>- Environ 35 pays sont connus pour fabriquer des mines.<BR>

<P>- La grande majorit&eacute; des mines ne sont pas &eacute;quip&eacute;es d'un m&eacute;canisme autodestructeur.<BR>

<P><I>1. Ces chiffres, extraits de la presse &eacute;crite, ne sont que des estimations.</I><BR>
<I>2. W. J. Fenrick, The Law of Armed Conflict: the Cushie Weapons Treaty, CDQ, &eacute;t&eacute; 1981. </TD></TR></TABLE>
</I><BR>

<P>Aux quatre pays mentionn&eacute;s ci-dessus, auxquels on pourrait d'ailleurs en ajouter une demi-douzaine d'autres, les<BR>
champs de mines mis en place durant les p&eacute;riodes de conflit sont d&eacute;j&agrave; responsables d'innombrables victimes<BR>
parmi la population civile.  Or, la majorit&eacute; de ces champs de mines n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; neutralis&eacute;e et repr&eacute;sente encore<BR>
un danger d'une extr&ecirc;me gravit&eacute; pour ces populations.  En outre, l'existence m&ecirc;me de ces champs de mines<BR>
rend probl&eacute;matique, voire impossible, le retour des populations civiles dans leur lieu d'origine o&ugrave; toute activit&eacute;<BR>
indispensable pour subvenir &agrave; leurs besoins vitaux sera s&eacute;rieusement compromise.  En effet, la quantit&eacute; de<BR>
mines antipersonnel dispers&eacute;es, la fa&ccedil;on dont elles ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;ploy&eacute;es et l'absence de marquage posent de tels<BR>
probl&egrave;mes, que les travaux agricoles et d'&eacute;levage ne pourront vraisemblablement pas &ecirc;tre repris avant de<BR>
nombreuses ann&eacute;es, voire des d&eacute;cennies, sans faire courir des risques consid&eacute;rables &agrave; ces populations.<BR>

<P>A titre d'exemple,[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 1][3] durant la seule ann&eacute;e qui a suivi le retrait des troupes sovi&eacute;tiques<BR>
d'Afghanistan, plus de 4000 personnes auraient d&eacute;j&agrave; perdu la vie et plus de 20 000 auraient &eacute;t&eacute; gri&egrave;vement<BR>
bless&eacute;es &agrave; la suite d'accidents dus &agrave; des mines!<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Objectif de l'installation de champs de mines</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Les champs de mines sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement mis en place, soit pour retarder l'avance de l'ennemi, soit pour le d&eacute;tourn&eacute; de sa route en le for&ccedil;ant &agrave; p&eacute;n&eacute;trer dans des zones plus facilement d&eacute;fendables, soit pour le harceler en faisant des morts et des bless&eacute;s dans ses rangs.<BR>

<P>A.P.V. Rogers, citant le colonel C. Sloan,[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 2] souligne que les mines antipersonnel sont principalement utilis&eacute;es:<BR>

<P>a)	dans les champs de mine antichars, pour emp&ecirc;cher que le personnel militaire ne les enl&egrave;ve ou ne les neutralise;<BR>

<P>b)	pour retarder et d&eacute;moraliser l'infanterie de l'ennemi qui avance;<BR>

<P>c)	pour prot&eacute;ger des localit&eacute;s d&eacute;fendues, en emp&ecirc;chant l'ennemi de suivre certains itin&eacute;raires et pour g&ecirc;ner le d&eacute;roulement de la phase d'assaut final d'une attaque lanc&eacute;e par l'infanterie.<BR>

<P>Les mines antipersonnel sont encore utilis&eacute;es pour prot&eacute;ger des positions et des installations militaires ou emp&ecirc;cher l'acc&egrave;s d'une localit&eacute;, d'un village ou d'une r&eacute;gion particuli&egrave;re.<BR>

<P>Il faut constater, h&eacute;las, que l'on a aussi parfois utilis&eacute; les mines antipersonnel pour emp&ecirc;cher la population civile de quitter une r&eacute;gion ou pour lui interdire l'acc&egrave;s aux zones agricoles et d'&eacute;levage, en minant les champs de culture, les p&acirc;turages et les rizi&egrave;res!<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Aspects techniques</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Les mines antipersonnel existent sous les formes les plus diverses, allant de l'engin le plus rudimentaire, quelquefois m&ecirc;me de construction artisanale, jusqu'au mod&egrave;le le plus sophistiqu&eacute; muni de dispositifs<BR>
&eacute;lectroniques de temporisation, d'armement et de mise &agrave; feu.  N&eacute;anmoins, &agrave; l'exception de quelques types de mines tr&egrave;s particuliers, elles peuvent se classer en trois cat&eacute;gories principales:<BR>

<P>- les mines antipersonnel &agrave; effet de souffle;<BR>

<P>- les mines antipersonnel &agrave; fragmentation (statiques ou bondissantes);<BR>

<P>- les mines antipersonnel directionnelles &agrave; fragmentation.<BR>

<P>Les explosifs utilis&eacute;s pour les mines sont, &agrave; quelques exceptions pr&egrave;s, de type classique.  Il s'agit principalement des d&eacute;riv&eacute;s nitr&eacute;s tels que le TNT (Trinitrotolu&egrave;ne ou Tolite, qui entre dans la composition de nombreux autres explosifs tels que l'Amatol, le Pentolite, la Composition B, etc.), l'acide picrique (Trinitroph&eacute;nol ou M&eacute;linite), le<BR>
Tetryl, le PETN (Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate) et le RDX (Cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine) deux parmi les plus violents explosifs connus, pour ne citer que les plus r&eacute;pandus.<BR>

<P>Les <B>mines antipersonnel simples, &agrave; effet de souffle, </B>sont constitu&eacute;es d'un bo&icirc;tier, le plus souvent en mati&egrave;re plastique, contenant une charge explosive, un d&eacute;tonateur et un dispositif de mise &agrave; feu.  Il peut s'agir d'un syst&egrave;me &agrave; pression (la pression n&eacute;cessaire pour la mise &agrave; feu est de l'ordre de 2 &agrave; 6 kg), d'un syst&egrave;me &agrave; traction par fils ou autre type de d&eacute;clenchement.<BR>

<P>Ces mines sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement de faible dimension (diam&egrave;tre &lt; 80 mm) et leur poids peut, tr&egrave;s souvent, &ecirc;tre inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; 100 g. Leur puissance est n&eacute;anmoins suffisante pour causer de tr&egrave;s graves blessures (pieds ou mains d&eacute;chiquet&eacute;s).  L'effet de souffle de l'explosion aura pour cons&eacute;quence de projeter dans les tissus adjacents et, souvent tr&egrave;s loin au-del&agrave; de la blessure principale, des &eacute;clats, des impuret&eacute;s et des d&eacute;bris divers pouvant entra&icirc;ner de graves infections, voire la gangr&egrave;ne.   Enfin, l'onde de choc provoqu&eacute;e par l'explosion de la mine peut &eacute;galement d&eacute;truire les vaisseaux sanguins jusque dans la partie sup&eacute;rieure du membre atteint. [r&eacute;f&eacute;rences 3 et 4]<BR>

<P>Selon le mod&egrave;le, l'importance de la charge et le type du bo&icirc;tier, les effets l&eacute;taux de ce type de mine antipersonnel peuvent atteindre un rayon d'environ 1 &agrave; 2m, mais rarement au-del&agrave;.  Relevons encore qu'aujourd'hui, ces mines ne contiennent qu'un minimum de pi&egrave;ces m&eacute;talliques et que leur bo&icirc;tier peut &ecirc;tre en bois, en mati&egrave;re plastique et plus rarement en m&eacute;tal, de sorte qu'elles sont pratiquement ind&eacute;tectables.<BR>

<P>Les <B>mines antipersonnel &agrave; fragmentation de type statique </B>sont constitu&eacute;es d'une charge explosive &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur d'un bo&icirc;tier m&eacute;tallique ou en mati&egrave;re plastique, dans lequel se trouvent des fragments m&eacute;talliques de forme cubique ou cylindrique aux ar&ecirc;tes ac&eacute;r&eacute;es ou, encore, sous forme de billes d'acier.  La dimension de ces fragments peut varier de 4 &agrave; 6 mm de longueur ou de diam&egrave;tre et leur poids se situe entre 0,5 et 6 g. Selon les types de mines, le nombre de fragments varie de quelques centaines &agrave; plusieurs milliers et leur vitesse initiale peut atteindre plus de 1600 m/s (&agrave; titre de comparaison, la vitesse initiale [VO] d'une balle de fusil est de l'ordre de 800 &agrave; 950 m/s et son poids de 3 &agrave; 11g, selon le calibre).<BR>

<P>La mise &agrave; feu peut s'op&eacute;rer au moyen d'un dispositif semblable &agrave; ceux utilis&eacute;s pour les mines &agrave; effet de souffle, c'est-&agrave;-dire par pression ou fils de tr&eacute;buchement, mais &eacute;galement au moyen de dispositifs &eacute;lectroniques, &agrave; capteurs sonores, magn&eacute;tiques, ou sismiques, barri&egrave;re IR (infrarouge) ou autres.  Le d&eacute;tonateur fait alors exploser la charge, projetant les fragments sur une distance pouvant atteindre 40 m. Selon certaines des sources consult&eacute;es, le rayon l&eacute;tal, qui d&eacute;pend de l'importance de la charge explosive et du type des fragments, peut atteindre 15, voire 25 m.<BR>

<P>La <B>mine antipersonnel &agrave; fragmentation de type bondissante</B> fonctionne sur le m&ecirc;me principe, mais n'explose qu'apr&egrave;s avoir &eacute;t&eacute; projet&eacute;e &agrave; une hauteur de 0,8 &agrave; 1,50 m. Dans ce cas, le syst&egrave;me de mise &agrave; feu, en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral &agrave; traction au moyen de fils pi&egrave;ge ou tout autre dispositif ad&eacute;quat, d&eacute;clenche une premi&egrave;re explosion qui projette le corps de la mine &agrave; la hauteur d&eacute;sir&eacute;e (entre 0,8 et 1,50 m) o&ugrave; sa charge principale explosera.  Le rayon l&eacute;tal est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement semblable &agrave; celui de la version statique, mais le fait d'exploser &agrave; une certaine distance du sol augmente sensiblement le nombre de fragments atteignant la cible.  Ces mines sont apparues durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale et n'ont cess&eacute; d'&ecirc;tre d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es depuis.<BR>

<P>Les <B>mines antipersonnel directionnelles &agrave; fragmentation, </B>(&eacute;galement nomm&eacute;es &agrave; effet horizontal), sont des mines &agrave; fragmentation construites de fa&ccedil;on que les fragments soient projet&eacute;s dans une direction d&eacute;termin&eacute;e, dans un secteur d'environ 60o.  Ce type de mine est g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pos&eacute; au sol sur un tr&eacute;pied, il peut aussi &ecirc;tre fix&eacute; au tronc d'un arbre ou &agrave; tout autre type de structure ad&eacute;quate.  Pour sa mise &agrave; feu, on peut utiliser tous les syst&egrave;mes habituels, fils pi&egrave;ge, barri&egrave;re IR, t&eacute;l&eacute;commande, etc.  Le nombre des fragments, constitu&eacute;s d'&eacute;clats de m&eacute;tal ac&eacute;r&eacute;s ou de billes d'acier, peut varier, selon les mod&egrave;les, de 700 &agrave; 1500, voire plus.  Leur dimension va de 4 &agrave; 6 mm de longueur ou de diam&egrave;tre et leur poids se situe entre 0,5 et 6 g. De nouveau, selon l'importance de la charge et le type de fragments utilis&eacute;s, la distance d'efficacit&eacute; (distance l&eacute;tale) sera de l'ordre de 50 &agrave; 100 m, pouvant atteindre 150 m pour certains mod&egrave;les.<BR>

<P>Dans la cat&eacute;gorie des <B>mines antipersonnel &agrave; fragmentation,</B> signalons encore la tr&egrave;s grande vari&eacute;t&eacute; dont l'origine remonte &agrave; la Seconde Guerre mondiale.  Ces mines sont r&eacute;alis&eacute;es &agrave; partir de grenades munies d'un manchon m&eacute;tallique &agrave; fragmentation ou en ciment contenant des fragments de m&eacute;tal.  Ces mines sont souvent munies d'un piquet m&eacute;tallique qui permet de les fixer verticalement au sol, mais elles peuvent &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre enterr&eacute;es.  Leur mise &agrave; feu se fait g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement au moyen d'un fil<B> </B>de traction ou par un dispositif &agrave; pression pour celles qui sont enterr&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>Relevons encore un type de mine qui a &eacute;t&eacute; largement utilis&eacute; en Afghanistan, baptis&eacute; <B>Butterfly </B>ou <B>Green Parrots (r&eacute;f&eacute;rence PMF-1 ou PMZ)</B>[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 5].<B> </B>De fabrication sovi&eacute;tique, ces mines sont, &agrave; l'instar de la plupart des mines antipersonnel modernes, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement dispers&eacute;es au moyen d'h&eacute;licopt&egrave;res ou d'avions.  Elles s'arment au moment de leur largage et pendant leur descente au sol.  Elles peuvent &eacute;galement, comme les autres types de mines antipersonnel, &ecirc;tre lanc&eacute;es au moyen de projectiles d'artillerie, de mortiers ou de grenades.<BR>

<P>Ce type de mines en mati&egrave;re synth&eacute;tique, comme d'ailleurs la plupart des mines antipersonnel &agrave; effet de souffle, n'ont pas pour but de tuer mais de mutiler et ne contiennent que tr&egrave;s peu de pi&egrave;ces m&eacute;talliques.  Cette mine est tr&egrave;s mince (environ 1,5 cm) et de couleur verte ou brune, elle devient vite invisible dans l'herbe ou dans un sol meuble o&ugrave; elle sera bient&ocirc;t recouverte par la terre ou le sable d&eacute;plac&eacute;s sous l'effet du vent ou, encore, par la neige.  Tr&egrave;s l&eacute;g&egrave;re, elle sera emport&eacute;e par la fonte des neiges ou par les alluvions, apr&egrave;s des pluies importantes; ainsi la retrouvera-t-on dans les cours d'eau en aval, toujours intacte et capable de blesser gri&egrave;vement les personnes se baignant ou y faisant leur lessive.<BR>

<P>Cette mine, dont la charge est compos&eacute;e de 40g d'un explosif liquide, explose &agrave; la suite d'une ou plusieurs pressions plus ou moins fortes exerc&eacute;es sur sa partie la plus &eacute;paisse.  Par exemple, la prendre entre le pouce et l'index peut suffire &agrave; la faire exploser!<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Dispositifs de s&eacute;curit&eacute;, d'autodestruction ou d'autoneutralisation incorpor&eacute;s</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Si, en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, presque toutes les mines antichars sont munies d'un syst&egrave;me de neutralisation, voire de destruction automatique apr&egrave;s une dur&eacute;e d&eacute;termin&eacute;e, il n'en va pas de m&ecirc;me pour les mines antipersonnel: le volume d'un tel dispositif et son prix seraient, selon les int&eacute;ress&eacute;s, disproportionn&eacute;s par rapport &agrave; celui de la mine elle-m&ecirc;me.<BR>

<P>Pour pouvoir les transporter sans risque, toutes les mines sont munies d'un syst&egrave;me de s&eacute;curit&eacute; qui est enlev&eacute; lors de leur mise en place.  Une fois arm&eacute;es, la plupart des mines antipersonnel ne peuvent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement plus &ecirc;tre neutralis&eacute;es, ceci pour &eacute;viter que l'ennemi ne puisse les enlever.  En r&eacute;alit&eacute;, souvent ces mines sont munies de pi&egrave;ges ext&eacute;rieurs contre l'enl&egrave;vement, alors que certaines d'entre elles sont m&ecirc;me &eacute;quip&eacute;es d'un dispositif interne qui en provoquera l'explosion &agrave; la moindre tentative de les d&eacute;placer ou de les d&eacute;samorcer.<BR>

<P>Enfin, dans la documentation que nous avons consult&eacute;e,[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 6] et sur les 124 mod&egrave;les diff&eacute;rents de mines antipersonnel que nous avons r&eacute;pertori&eacute;s, nous n'avons trouv&eacute; que quatre mod&egrave;les (!) mentionn&eacute;s comme &eacute;tant dot&eacute;s d'un dispositif d'autoneutralisation.<BR>

<P>En l'occurrence, il s'agirait de syst&egrave;mes programmables dans un intervalle allant de quelques heures &agrave; quelques semaines, voire plusieurs mois.  Bien que construit pour une dur&eacute;e de vie &eacute;quivalente &agrave; celle de la mine, la fiabilit&eacute; de ces dispositifs, selon certains experts, ne serait pas toujours suffisante et chacun s'accorde &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre qu'ils ne sont pas &agrave; l'abri d'un dysfonctionnement accidentel toujours possible.  En principe, ces dispositifs ne devraient pas &ecirc;tre d&eacute;t&eacute;rior&eacute;s ni influenc&eacute;s par les conditions climatiques et d'environnement.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Mines sp&eacute;ciales</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Au cours de nos recherches nous avons trouv&eacute; des mines qualifi&eacute;es d'antipersonnel contenant une charge FAE <I>(Fuel Air Explosive</I> = explosif gazeux) ou chimique; dans ce dernier cas il s'agit g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement de gaz moutarde ou de type Lewisite!  Il faut toutefois souligner, qu'en ce qui concerne ces derni&egrave;res, elles sont signal&eacute;es comme devant &ecirc;tre d&eacute;truites prochainement.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Aspects tactiques</B></H4>
<P>
<P>L'Acte final de la <I>Conf&eacute;rence des Nations Unies sur l'interdiction</I> <I>ou la limitation de l'emploi de certaines armes classiques, (Gen&egrave;ve,</I> <I>10 octobre 1980)[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 7], </I>et plus particuli&egrave;rement son Appendice C,<I> Protocole sur l'interdiction ou la limitation de l'emploi des mines, pi&egrave;ges et</I> <I>autres dispositifs (Protocole II) </I>dont l'Article 5, <I>Restrictions &agrave; l'emploi de mines mises en place &agrave; distance, </I>pr&eacute;cise que:<BR>

<P>1.	<I>L'emploi de mines mises en place &agrave; distance est interdit, sauf si</I> <I>ces mines sont utilis&eacute;es uniquement dans la zone qui constitue un</I> <I>objectif militaire ou qui contient des objectifs militaires et &agrave;</I> <I>moins:</I><BR>

<P><I>a)</I>	<I>Que leur emplacement soit enregistr&eacute; avec exactitude conform&eacute;ment &agrave; l'alin&eacute;a a) du paragraphe 1 de l'article</I><BR>
<I>7, ou</I><BR>

<P><I>b)</I>	<I>Que soit utilis&eacute; sur chacune d'elle un m&eacute;canisme efficace de</I> <I>neutralisation, c'est-&agrave;-dire un m&eacute;canisme &agrave;</I><BR>
<I>auto-d&eacute;clenchement, con&ccedil;u pour la d&eacute;sactiver ou pour provoquer l'autodestruction lorsqu'il y a lieu de penser</I><BR>
<I>qu'elle ne servira plus aux</I> <I>fins militaires pour lesquelles elle a &eacute;t&eacute; mise en place, ou un</I> <I>m&eacute;canisme</I><BR>
<I>t&eacute;l&eacute;command&eacute; con&ccedil;u pour la d&eacute;sactiver ou la</I> <I>d&eacute;truire lorsque la mine ne sert plus aux fins militaires pour</I><BR>
<I>lesquelles elle a &eacute;t&eacute; mise en place.</I><BR>

<P><I>2.	Pr&eacute;avis effectif sera donn&eacute; du lancement ou du largage de mines</I> <I>mises en place &agrave; distance qui pourrait avoir des effets pour la</I> <I>population civile, &agrave; moins que les circonstances ne le permettent</I> <I>pas.</I><BR>

<P>Le marquage des champs de mine doit permettre &agrave; la population civile d'&eacute;viter de p&eacute;n&eacute;trer dans un espace min&eacute; et, une fois les hostilit&eacute;s termin&eacute;es, faciliter leur &eacute;limination.<BR>

<P>Dans la pratique, ces dispositions ne pourront probablement s'appliquer que pour les champs de mines d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s, ou dont l'emplacement aura &eacute;t&eacute; planifi&eacute; avant le d&eacute;but des combats.  Les champs de mines mis en place et les mines dispers&eacute;es au cours des combats ne seront, le plus souvent, pas r&eacute;pertori&eacute;s.  Par ailleurs, l'exp&eacute;rience lors de r&eacute;cents conflits a montr&eacute; que, m&ecirc;me lorsque les champs de mines &eacute;taient r&eacute;pertori&eacute;s, souvent les marquages mis en place disparaissaient, &eacute;taient d&eacute;plac&eacute;s ou tout simplement enlev&eacute;s, soit intentionnellement, soit par inadvertance.  D'autre part, les documents &eacute;tablis lors de la mise en place des champs de mines, ne sont pas toujours r&eacute;cup&eacute;rables aupr&egrave;s des forces arm&eacute;es responsables; ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; soit perdus ou d&eacute;truits, soit tout simplement &eacute;gar&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>Actuellement, les mines sont tr&egrave;s souvent dispers&eacute;es au moyen d'h&eacute;licopt&egrave;res, d'avions, de mortiers ou de projectiles d'artillerie.  Ceci rend encore plus difficile le relev&eacute; des zones min&eacute;es et cela devient tout &agrave; fait impossible lorsqu'il s'agit de mines de petites dimensions, du type Butterfly, (voir plus haut) qui, in&eacute;vitablement, vont &ecirc;tre d&eacute;plac&eacute;es par les intemp&eacute;ries et pourront &ecirc;tre retrouv&eacute;es tr&egrave;s loin du lieu de leur d&eacute;ploiement.<BR>

<P>Relevons encore que, fr&eacute;quemment, des soldats reculant devant l'ennemi couvrent leur retraite en posant des mines derni&egrave;re eux, sans, bien s&ucirc;r, prendre le temps d'en relever les emplacements.<BR>

<P>La plupart de ces fa&ccedil;ons de proc&eacute;der sont non seulement en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral ill&eacute;gales, mais elles contribuent &agrave; rendre extr&ecirc;mement difficile la localisation des champs de mines, une fois les hostilit&eacute;s termin&eacute;es.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Localisation des mines et d&eacute;minage</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Avant de neutraliser ou d&eacute;truire les mines, il faut tout d'abord les localiser.  Le plus souvent, la recherche se fera avec les moyens de d&eacute;tection habituels, c'est-&agrave;-dire des instruments de d&eacute;tection magn&eacute;tique, dans la mesure o&ugrave; ceux-ci peuvent &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>En effet, de plus en plus les mines sont construites de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; rendre leur d&eacute;tection difficile, voire impossible.  A cette fin, on utilise tr&egrave;s largement pour leur fabrication des mati&egrave;res synth&eacute;tiques auxquelles les d&eacute;tecteurs magn&eacute;tiques ne r&eacute;agissent pas, et seules quelques pi&egrave;ces isol&eacute;es sont encore r&eacute;alis&eacute;es en mat&eacute;riaux ferromagn&eacute;tiques, principalement des pi&egrave;ces constitutives du syst&egrave;me de mise &agrave; feu (par exemple, le pointeau percuteur et quelques pi&egrave;ces qui lui sont associ&eacute;es).  Ceci a pour cons&eacute;quence que ces mines ne pourront &ecirc;tre d&eacute;tect&eacute;es que par des appareils &agrave; tr&egrave;s haute sensibilit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Or, il faut se souvenir qu'un d&eacute;tecteur magn&eacute;tique de m&eacute;taux sera influenc&eacute; <B>par toutes les pi&egrave;ces </B>et objets de m&eacute;tal (&eacute;clats d'obus, pi&egrave;ces d'armes d&eacute;truites, morceaux de ch&acirc;ssis et de carrosseries provenant de v&eacute;hicules endommag&eacute;s ou d&eacute;truits au cours des combats, etc.) qui peuvent se trouver dans le terrain o&ugrave; les mines sont recherch&eacute;es, rendant ce travail extr&ecirc;mement difficile, voire probl&eacute;matique.  Quelque-fois, des d&eacute;chets m&eacute;talliques sont dispers&eacute;s intentionnellement pour rendre plus difficile les travaux de d&eacute;minage.<BR>

<P>De nouveaux &eacute;quipements de d&eacute;tection, qui utilisent une technologie avanc&eacute;e (microprocesseurs, &eacute;lectronique &eacute;labor&eacute;e, etc.) ont &eacute;t&eacute; mis au point durant ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es.  Ils devraient permettre de d&eacute;tecter, non seulement les m&eacute;taux ferromagn&eacute;tiques, mais &eacute;galement les autres m&eacute;taux.  Ces nouveaux &eacute;quipements de d&eacute;tection seraient &eacute;galement tr&egrave;s sensibles et pourraient, selon leurs fabricants, m&ecirc;me permettre de d&eacute;tecter les mines en mati&egrave;re plastique qui n'auraient que quelques pi&egrave;ces constitutives en m&eacute;tal, ferromagn&eacute;tique ou non.   Cependant, les sp&eacute;cialistes consult&eacute;s &agrave; ce sujet ne sont pas unanimes quant &agrave; leur efficacit&eacute; et &agrave; leur fiabilit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>D'autres m&eacute;thodes de d&eacute;tections[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 8] en particulier utilisant l'infrarouge (IR) thermique a&eacute;roport&eacute; et un syst&egrave;me de radar millim&eacute;trique, seraient en cours de mise au point, voire d'essai.  Nous ne disposons malheureusement d'aucune information pr&eacute;cise et fiable &agrave; leur sujet.   N&eacute;anmoins, selon certaines sources, ces nouvelles m&eacute;thodes ne sembleraient pas encore donner enti&egrave;re satisfaction.  Enfin, il est &eacute;galement possible d'utiliser pour ce travail des chiens sp&eacute;cialement dress&eacute;s pour d&eacute;celer la pr&eacute;sence d'explosifs.  Les r&eacute;sultats obtenus sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement tr&egrave;s bons; malheureusement, les chiens se fatiguent tr&egrave;s rapidement et ne peuvent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement pas travailler beaucoup plus d'une heure par jour.<BR>

<P>A notre avis, des progr&egrave;s dans la r&eacute;alisation d'&eacute;quipements de d&eacute;tection sont certainement encore possibles.  On pourrait s'inspirer, par exemple, des &eacute;quipements de d&eacute;tection utilis&eacute;s depuis quelques ann&eacute;es dans les a&eacute;roports pour d&eacute;tecter les explosifs pouvant se trouver dans le fret ou les bagages des passagers.  Certains de ces &eacute;quipements fonctionnent g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement sur le principe de l'analyse des vapeurs r&eacute;siduelles &eacute;mises en tr&egrave;s faibles quantit&eacute;s par les explosifs.<BR>

<P>Selon certaines informations parues r&eacute;cemment dans la presse sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e,[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 9] des syst&egrave;mes de d&eacute;tection utilisant l'analyse des vapeurs d'explosifs seraient en bonne voie de d&eacute;veloppement, voire de r&eacute;alisation &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle industrielle.  Ces nouveaux syst&egrave;mes simuleraient le sens olfactif des chiens, qui est environ 10 000 fois plus sensible que les appareils de d&eacute;tection standard, qui sont utilis&eacute;s parfois pour la d&eacute;tection des explosifs et des mines.<BR>

<P>Il semble n&eacute;anmoins que de nombreux sp&eacute;cialistes s'accordent pour reconna&icirc;tre que la seule m&eacute;thode valable serait les mains et les genoux, c'est-&agrave;-dire l'utilisation d'une tige de bois ou de plastique pour sonder, en avan&ccedil;ant sur les genoux, le terrain o&ugrave; les mines sont suppos&eacute;es se trouver!<BR>

<P>En ce qui concerne le d&eacute;samor&ccedil;age, ou la neutralisation, des mines antipersonnel, les avis sont encore une fois unanimes pour reconna&icirc;tre qu'il s'agit d'une op&eacute;ration extr&ecirc;mement dangereuse, et la seule solution raisonnable est de les faire exploser une &agrave; une au moyen de charges ad&eacute;quates!<BR>

<P>Une autre possibilit&eacute; consiste &agrave; utiliser des dispositifs sp&eacute;ciaux,[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 10] tels que des lignes, cordons ou tuyaux explosifs, pour faire sauter en bloc un espace d&eacute;termin&eacute;, (par exemple pour ouvrir un passage de 0,60-0,80 m de large sur une longueur de 100 m ou plus, l'op&eacute;ration pouvant &ecirc;tre r&eacute;p&eacute;t&eacute;e pour augmenter la surface neutralis&eacute;e).  On peut &eacute;galement utiliser des charges FAE <I>(Fuel Air Explosive) </I>pour neutraliser plus rapidement une plus grande surface; ce moyen a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute; lors de la guerre du Viet Nam.  Il faut toutefois relever que ces m&eacute;thodes ne sont pas infaillibles, car un nombre de plus en plus grand de mines sont construites de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; r&eacute;sister aux surpressions de tr&egrave;s courte dur&eacute;e caus&eacute;es par des explosions se produisant dans leur voisinage imm&eacute;diat, comme par exemple celles des charges de d&eacute;minage, explosions FAE comprises.<BR>

<P>D'autres m&eacute;thodes de d&eacute;minage existent, mais elles font appel &agrave; une logistique lourde et co&ucirc;teuse.  Il s'agit de v&eacute;hicules blind&eacute;s, &eacute;quip&eacute;s sur leur avant de lames d'acier en forme de chasse-neige, de treillis ou de rouleaux &agrave; pointes, de fl&eacute;aux &agrave; cha&icirc;nes, etc.<BR>

<P>Ces v&eacute;hicules, qui sont le plus souvent utilis&eacute;s par les arm&eacute;es pour se frayer un passage &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur d'un champ de mines, demandent un personnel sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; tant pour l'exploitation que pour l'entretien, et des stocks de pi&egrave;ces de rechange importants pour assurer un travail continu.  En outre, l'efficacit&eacute; du d&eacute;minage effectu&eacute; avec ces moyens techniques est &agrave; peine de 70%, ce qui est peut-&ecirc;tre suffisant pour les forces arm&eacute;es d&eacute;sirant se frayer une br&egrave;che dans un champ de mines, mais ne l'est certainement pas lorsqu'il s'agit de d&eacute;miner des r&eacute;gions beaucoup plus vastes, en vue d'y r&eacute;int&eacute;grer des populations civiles.<BR>

<P>En effet, si au cours des combats on peut se contenter d'ouvrir un simple passage, dans le cas des op&eacute;rations de d&eacute;minage apr&egrave;s la fin des hostilit&eacute;s, il faudra proc&eacute;der &agrave; un d&eacute;minage complet d'&eacute;tendues beaucoup plus vastes.  Si l'on utilise des moyens m&eacute;caniques, plusieurs passages au m&ecirc;me endroit seront donc n&eacute;cessaires pour atteindre une profondeur suffisante et tenter d'&eacute;liminer la totalit&eacute; des mines dont certaines pourront se trouver jusqu'&agrave; 40 cm de profondeur.<BR>

<P>Il va sans dire que l'op&eacute;ration devra couvrir la totalit&eacute; du terrain qui doit &ecirc;tre d&eacute;min&eacute;.  Selon certains sp&eacute;cialistes, cette fa&ccedil;on de d&eacute;miner est celle qui donnerait les meilleurs r&eacute;sultats et serait la moins dangereuse, sans qu'elle soit pour autant totalement infaillible.  Cependant, on ne pourra pas &eacute;viter d'enlever et de d&eacute;truire manuellement, une &agrave; une, les mines antipersonnel qui ne l'auraient pas &eacute;t&eacute; par ces moyens m&eacute;caniques.<BR>

<P>Enfin, il convient d'ajouter &agrave; cela le co&ucirc;t initial et d'exploitation tr&egrave;s &eacute;lev&eacute; des v&eacute;hicules de d&eacute;minage, ce qui rendra leur utilisation difficilement accessible &agrave; la plupart des pays actuellement concern&eacute;s.<BR>

<P>On se rend donc compte qu'une op&eacute;ration de d&eacute;minage ne peut &ecirc;tre que longue, co&ucirc;teuse et tr&egrave;s dangereuse.  A titre d'information, au Kowe&iuml;t les &eacute;quipes de d&eacute;minage auraient d&eacute;j&agrave;, selon diff&eacute;rentes sources [r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 11], perdu plus de 80 d&eacute;mineurs &agrave; la suite d'accidents!  Or, dans ce pays, les champs de mines et les types de mines utilis&eacute;s &eacute;taient relativement bien connus et, d'autre part, il s'agissait d'un conflit de courte dur&eacute;e.  On peut donc s'imaginer l'importance des travaux de d&eacute;minage dans des pays tels que le Cambodge ou l'Afghanistan o&ugrave;, &agrave; certains endroits, il n'y aurait pas moins de trois couches de mines superpos&eacute;es!<BR>

<P>En Afghanistan,[r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 12] o&ugrave; plus de 30 mod&egrave;les diff&eacute;rents de mines auraient &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;s, les relev&eacute;s des champs de mines, lorsqu'ils existent, sont tr&egrave;s al&eacute;atoires.  Les mines y ont &eacute;t&eacute; dispers&eacute;es en tr&egrave;s grand nombre (selon les sources, les chiffres de 20 et 40 millions sont avanc&eacute;s!), et certains experts sont d'avis qu'il en resterait plus de trois millions toujours actives et en &eacute;tat de fonctionner.  Il sera donc probablement impossible de proc&eacute;der &agrave; un d&eacute;minage complet, rendant ainsi impossible, dans de nombreuses r&eacute;gions, toute activit&eacute; de culture et d'&eacute;levage pour des dizaines d'ann&eacute;es!<BR>

<P>Compte tenu de l'&eacute;tendue des surfaces infest&eacute;es de mines que l'on rencontre dans tous les pays affect&eacute;s par un conflit arm&eacute; plus ou moins long, on peut s'imaginer l'importance du probl&egrave;me que va poser le d&eacute;minage, pour assurer la s&eacute;curit&eacute; indispensable &agrave; la population civile qui devra y vivre.  La t&acirc;che sera consid&eacute;rable et tr&egrave;s co&ucirc;teuse en temps et en mat&eacute;riel, sans parler des risques d'accidents in&eacute;vitables lors des op&eacute;rations de d&eacute;minage.<BR>

<P>A ce sujet, on peut se demander s'il ne serait pas souhaitable que les fabricants de mines participent au d&eacute;minage des r&eacute;gions o&ugrave; leurs mines ont &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;es, ou que ceux qui les ont mises en place soient oblig&eacute;s de les enlever, une fois les hostilit&eacute;s termin&eacute;es.  Ils seraient en effet les seuls &agrave; en conna&icirc;tre les emplacements et les caract&eacute;ristiques techniques.  Ils devraient donc &ecirc;tre en mesure d'en assurer la neutralisation et l'&eacute;limination &agrave; moindre co&ucirc;t et, surtout, &agrave; moindre risque.<BR>

<P>Une autre possibilit&eacute; serait de faire participer financi&egrave;rement les fabricants de mines aux op&eacute;rations de d&eacute;minage![r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 13][4]<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Pays producteurs et exportateurs de mines antipersonnel</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Le bref inventaire que nous avons fait des pays producteurs et exportateurs de mines antipersonnel, de loin non exhaustif, montre d'abord que presque tous les pays fortement ou moyennement industrialis&eacute;s produisent ce type d'arme et qu'un bon nombre d'entre eux en exportent.<BR>

<P>D'apr&egrave;s les sources consult&eacute;es, qu'il faut n&eacute;anmoins consid&eacute;rer avec prudence car les informations publi&eacute;es sont souvent incompl&egrave;tes et impr&eacute;cises, les principaux pays producteurs sont la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration de Russie, l'Italie, les Etats-Unis d'Am&eacute;rique, l'ex-Yougoslavie, l'Autriche, la Chine, la France ainsi que peut-&ecirc;tre la Belgique, l'Egypte, le Portugal.  La plupart de ces pays sont &eacute;galement connus comme exportateurs, soit de produits finis, soit de licences de fabrication.  A cette liste, il manque Singapour qui, &agrave; notre connaissance, est un important pays fabricant (sous licence) et exportateur qui, souvent, travaille avec d'autres pays occidentaux.  Enfin, il faut &eacute;galement relever que des mines de fabrication allemande et isra&eacute;lienne, ou en provenance d'autres pays, ont &eacute;t&eacute; retrouv&eacute;es occasionnellement en R&eacute;publique sud-africaine, voire dans d'autres pays.  Lorsque des mines fabriqu&eacute;es dans les pays susmentionn&eacute;s sont trouv&eacute;es dans d'autres pays, cela ne signifie pas n&eacute;cessairement que ce sont les pays producteurs qui les aient r&eacute;ellement export&eacute;es; elles peuvent tr&egrave;s bien avoir &eacute;t&eacute; acquises sur le march&eacute; parall&egrave;le de l'armement, prises &agrave; l'ennemi ou tout simplement vol&eacute;es dans des entrep&ocirc;ts.  Les importants changements politiques qui sont intervenus ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es en Europe de l'Est et dans les anciens pays du Pacte de Varsovie, ont eu pour cons&eacute;quence que de tr&egrave;s importants stocks d'armes, y compris d'&eacute;normes quantit&eacute;s de mines antipersonnel, sont maintenant disponibles et propos&eacute;s tant sur le march&eacute; officiel que sur le march&eacute; parall&egrave;le, &agrave; des prix d&eacute;fiant toute concurrence!<BR>

<P>Concernant les prix, les mines antipersonnel se pr&ecirc;tent tr&egrave;s bien &agrave; une fabrication de grande s&eacute;rie semi-automatis&eacute;e, ce qui permet de les produire &agrave; des prix de revient extr&ecirc;mement bas.  Bien qu'il nous ait &eacute;t&eacute; impossible d'obtenir des indications pr&eacute;cises au sujet des prix de vente pratiqu&eacute;s, certaines informations [r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 14] laissent penser que ceux-ci pourraient se situer entre Frs. 20.- (certains avancent m&ecirc;me un prix de Frs.  I0.-) et 100.-/pce pour les mod&egrave;les les plus simples.  Tout r&eacute;cemment, nous avons appris que des mines, d'origine chinoise, auraient &eacute;t&eacute; offertes pour un prix unitaire inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; US$ 0,50/pce!<BR>

<P>Les mod&egrave;les plus &eacute;labor&eacute;s - les mines bondissantes &agrave; fragmentation, directionnelles &agrave; fragmentation - sont certainement plus co&ucirc;teuses.  Malheureusement, les seules informations fiables dont nous disposons quant &agrave; leur prix de vente concernant des r&eacute;pliques (inertes) de mines de type courant, destin&eacute;es &agrave; la formation et &agrave; l'entra&icirc;nement du personnel de d&eacute;minage.  Leur co&ucirc;t unitaire, pour des petites quantit&eacute;s, varie entre 300 et 500 Frs.  Or, il faut se rappeler qu'il s'agit de mod&egrave;les fabriqu&eacute;s en beaucoup moins grandes quantit&eacute;s que les vraies mines, donc d'un prix de revient probablement plus &eacute;lev&eacute;.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Conclusion</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Les probl&egrave;mes que posent les mines antipersonnel ont pris une dimension consid&eacute;rable car ils d&eacute;passent largement et la p&eacute;riode du conflit arm&eacute; durant lequel les mines ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;pos&eacute;es, et les pays dans lesquels ces conflits ont eu lieu.  Dans le premier cas on a vu que les mines antipersonnel peuvent rester op&eacute;rationnelles des dizaines d'ann&eacute;es apr&egrave;s leur d&eacute;ploiement et mettre en p&eacute;ril, &agrave; moyen ou long terme, la survie m&ecirc;me des populations concern&eacute;es qui se verront priv&eacute;es de la possibilit&eacute; d'exercer les activit&eacute;s de la vie courante, telles que la culture et l'&eacute;levage.  Comme il s'agit tr&egrave;s souvent de pays en d&eacute;veloppement, ils n'auront pas les moyens financiers n&eacute;cessaires pour proc&eacute;der &agrave; un d&eacute;minage complet et devront pouvoir compter sur l'aide technique et financi&egrave;re de la communaut&eacute; internationale.  Ceci aura sans aucun doute des effets n&eacute;gatifs sur leur d&eacute;veloppement, avec les cons&eacute;quences que l'on peut imaginer.<BR>

<P>Il est donc urgent que des mesures soient prises pour que cesse l'utilisation anarchique des mines antipersonnel qui, de plus en plus aujourd'hui, s'apparente davantage au terrorisme qu'&agrave; une conduite normale des hostilit&eacute;s dont le but, selon tous les instruments de droit international humanitaire applicables, devrait &eacute;pargner les populations civiles.  Peut-&ecirc;tre les Etats devraient-ils s&eacute;rieusement envisager l'interdiction des mines antipersonnel non d&eacute;tectables dont l'utilit&eacute; militaire est, &agrave; notre avis, plus que douteuse, ainsi que celles non pourvues d'un dispositif d'autoneutralisation ou d'autodestruction [r&eacute;f&eacute;rence 15]. Les effets dont ces mines sont responsables - difficult&eacute; de les &eacute;liminer, une fois les hostilit&eacute;s termin&eacute;es, avec les dramatiques cons&eacute;quences que cela repr&eacute;sente pour les populations civiles - sont nettement disproportionn&eacute;s par rapport aux pr&eacute;tendus avantages militaires, d'ailleurs plus que discutables.<BR>

<P>De nombreuses organisations, officielles et priv&eacute;es, sont conscientes de l'importance de ce probl&egrave;me et ont commenc&eacute; d'agir afin<B> </B>de lui trouver une solution et que cesse ce type de terrorisme envers les populations civiles qui, de plus en plus, sont prises comme cible et, en mati&egrave;re de victimes, payent le plus lourd tribut dans les conflits arm&eacute;s de l'&eacute;poque moderne.<BR>

<P>
<P>La XXVe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge,<BR>

<P><I>rappelant </I>la r&eacute;solution XIII de la XVIe Conf&eacute;rence internationale de la Croix-Rouge concernant la protection des femmes et des enfants dans les conflits arm&eacute;s,<BR>

<P><I>ayant pris note du Document final </I>de la seconde Conf&eacute;rence mondiale de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge sur la paix, tenue &agrave; Aaland et Stockholm en 1984, et des recommandations du Symposium de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge sur la protection des enfants qui s'est tenu &agrave; San Remo en 1985,<BR>

<P><I>profond&eacute;ment pr&eacute;occup&eacute;e </I>par le fait que, dans de nombreuses r&eacute;gions du monde, des enfants continuent &agrave; participer directement aux hostilit&eacute;s et sont recrut&eacute;s dans les forces arm&eacute;es,<BR>

<P><I>rappelant </I>que, dans les conflits o&ugrave; sont utilis&eacute;es des armes de mani&egrave;re indiscrimin&eacute;e, une proportion importante des victimes sont des civils innocents et en particulier des enfants,<BR>

<P><I>notant </I>que les enfants sont particuli&egrave;rement vuln&eacute;rables quand ils sont s&eacute;par&eacute;s de leur famille,<BR>

<P><I>reconnaissant </I>que les enfants qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;lev&eacute;s dans la haine et ont particip&eacute; aux atrocit&eacute;s de la guerre sont souvent handicap&eacute;s mentalement et moralement pour la vie,<BR>

<P><I>soulignant </I>que les Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949 et les deux Protocoles additionnels de 1977 accordent aux enfants protection et traitement sp&eacute;ciaux,<BR>

<P><I>1. prie </I>les gouvernements et le Mouvement international de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge de diffuser largement les dispositions du droit international humanitaire prot&eacute;geant les enfants dans les conflits arm&eacute;s ainsi que les publications relatives &agrave; cette question,<BR>

<P><I>2. rappelle </I>que, aux termes de l'article 77 du Protocole additionnel I aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve, les Parties au conflit prendront toutes les mesures possibles dans la pratique pour que les enfants de moins de quinze ans ne participent pas directement aux hostilit&eacute;s, notamment en s'abstenant de les recruter dans leurs forces arm&eacute;es.  Lorsqu'elles incorporent des personnes de plus de quinze ans mais de moins de dix-huit ans, les Parties au conflit s'efforceront de donner la priorit&eacute; aux plus &acirc;g&eacute;es,<BR>

<P><I>3. rappelle </I>&eacute;galement que, aux termes des Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve et des deux Protocoles additionnels, les enfants de moins de quinze ans qui ont particip&eacute; directement aux hostilit&eacute;s et qui tombent au pouvoir d'une Partie adverse continuent &agrave; b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier d'une protection sp&eacute;ciale, qu'ils soient ou non prisonniers de guerre,<BR>

<P><I>4. se d&eacute;clare </I>profond&eacute;ment pr&eacute;occup&eacute;e par le fait que des enfants de moins de quinze ans sont entra&icirc;n&eacute;s &agrave; des fins<B> </B>militaires <I>et recommande</I> qu'en toutes circonstances les enfants soient &eacute;lev&eacute;s dans le respect des principes humanitaires,<BR>

<H2>Books and reviews: &quot;Child soldiers: The Role of Children in Armed Conflicts&quot;</H2>
<P><I>By Lydie Ventre</I>
<P>
<P> [1] The participation of children in hostilities has become an increasingly common phenomenon which appears to be connected to the emergence of new kinds of conflicts, fought between regular armed forces and guerrilla forces. Despite the international community's growing concern for child soldiers, few studies take into account all the factors involved or make practical suggestions to remedy the problem.<BR>
	<BR>
By examining various typical conflicts this book analyses the issue in depth, closely studying each of the factors which give rise to this phenomenon. The authors begin by giving a definition of what a child is. Taking as a basis the age for military service and the voting age in more than 185 States, they conclude that the age of eighteen marks the transition between childhood and adulthood. A search for the reasons why children participate in hostilities reveals that their recruitment by armed groups is influenced by many widely divergent factors: the economic, social and political causes of the conflict, peer group pressure, fear, threats, the wish to feel safe or to take revenge. The authors then suggest a series of concrete measures to halt the enrolment of children.<BR>
	<BR>
In considering means of preventing the recruitment of children into the armed forces the authors review all the provisions of international human rights and international humanitarian law intended to protect children in periods of armed conflict. They observe that irrespective of the relevant legal instrument (the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols of 1977), the protection for young people is only indirect, depending on States and their national legislation. Even though the participation in hostilities of children below the age of fifteen is prohibited (Protocol I, Art. 77, para. 2 and Protocol II, Art. 4, para. 3(<I>c</I>)), effective application of these provisions is subject to numerous conditions, e.g. ratification of these treaties by States, or the consent or ability of non-State entities to implement them.<BR>
	<BR>
The authors also have the merit of looking into a subject which is rarely addressed, i.e. the mental and physical disorders caused in children by their participation in hostilities or a period spent in detention. A better knowledge of war trauma in children enables local non-governmental organizations - which are mainly responsible for rehabilitating children - to set up programmes to facilitate their reintegration into the civilian community.<BR>
	<BR>
Emphasis is placed by the authors on the fundamental role of the ICRC (present in most conflicts where children are involved) in protecting child soldiers on the spot, notably in visiting child detainees. They also underscore the complementary role which must be played by local non-governmental organizations and humanitarian agencies.<BR>
	<BR>
Noting that a significant part of international human rights law is based on the protection of children and young persons up to the age of eighteen, the authors believe that a total ban on the participation of these children in hostilities is a fundamental objective to be attained within the coming years. It requires a mobilization of the entire international community (non-governmental organizations, the United Nations and other international organizations, as well as States).<BR>
	<BR>
The best way of raising the age of participation in hostilities would be to adopt a declaration containing minimum humanitarian standards banning any participation whatsoever under eighteen years of age and clearly specifying the responsibilities of adults in charge of recruiting children. At the same time, the enrolment of children in armed factions could be discussed by the various bodies which monitor the implementation of human rights and international humanitarian law.<BR>
	<BR>
The interest of this study lies not only in the comprehensive analysis of the causes of participation by children in hostilities and the consequences their participation has, but also in the very specific proposals it puts forward to curb such practices.<BR>
	<BR>
An enormous amount of research went into compiling the remarkable annex to the book. It provides an exhaustive list of 189 countries indicating whether or not they are party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols and the main regional and international human rights treaties, as well as specifying the respective voting and military age in each State. This latest research into internal State practice serves as a basis for encouraging international acceptance of a higher minimum age for participation by children in hostilities.<BR>
	<BR>
This book by Guy Goodwin-Gill and Ilene Cohn, supported by an extensive bibliography, is unquestionably a first-class reference work for analysis of the phenomenon of child soldiers. May it be, as the authors desire, a further step towards preventing children from taking up arms.<BR>

<H2>Inde : dialogue avec les militaires</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Un s&eacute;minaire de deux jours, intitul&eacute; &quot;Le droit international humanitaire  : son importance dans le monde moderne&quot;, a &eacute;t&eacute; organis&eacute; conjointement par le d&eacute;partement du <I>Judge Advocate General</I> de l'arm&eacute;e indienne, le CICR et  la Croix-Rouge de l'Inde. Ce s&eacute;minaire, qui s'est tenu &agrave; New Delhi les 28 et 29  ao&ucirc;t, &eacute;tait le deuxi&egrave;me du genre, le premier ayant eu lieu en 1988.<BR>

<P>Le g&eacute;n&eacute;ral Shankar Roy Chowdhury, chef d'&eacute;tat-major de l'arm&eacute;e indienne, a prononc&eacute; le discours d'ouverture et a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; une nouvelle brochure, le <I>Code of conduct for combatants </I>(code de conduite pour les combattants).<BR>

<P>Des officiers sup&eacute;rieurs, appartenant au d&eacute;partement juridique et &agrave; celui des op&eacute;rations, des d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s du CICR et des repr&eacute;sentants de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale ont donn&eacute; des expos&eacute;s sur le droit international humanitaire et le droit des droits de l'homme, ainsi que sur leur applicabilit&eacute; dans diverses op&eacute;rations militaires. De l'avis des participants, le champ d'application de ces deux branches du droit devrait &ecirc;tre davantage clarifi&eacute;, notamment en ce qui concerne les conflits de faible intensit&eacute;.<BR>

<P>Le lieutenant g&eacute;n&eacute;ral Satish Nambiar, commandant des forces des Nations Unies en ex-Yougoslavie en 1992 et 1993, a fait un expos&eacute; sur &quot;L'applicabilit&eacute; du droit international humanitaire aux op&eacute;rations de maintien de la paix des Nations Unies&quot;.<BR>

<P>Ce s&eacute;minaire a permis aux forces arm&eacute;es indiennes, les quatri&egrave;mes plus importantes en nombre du monde, de r&eacute;affirmer leur engagement vis-&agrave;-vis du droit international humanitaire. Par ailleurs, Cette interaction entre officiers de l'arm&eacute;e et d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s du CICR a donn&eacute; &agrave; ceux-ci l'occasion d'expliquer les bases juridiques sur lesquelles reposent les activit&eacute;s de l'institution, en particulier ses op&eacute;rations dans le Jammu-et-Cachemire.<BR>

<P>Le d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;ral du CICR pour l'Asie et le Pacifique a exprim&eacute; l'espoir que ce dialogue avec l'arm&eacute;e encouragera le gouvernement indien &agrave; reconsid&eacute;rer la possibilit&eacute; de signer les deux Protocoles additionnels aux Conventions de Gen&egrave;ve de 1949.

<H2>Appels d'urgence du CICR pour 1997</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Apr&egrave;s le choc et la tristesse ressentis en apprenant la nouvelle de l'assassinat de six de ses d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s &agrave; Novy Atagi (Tch&eacute;tch&eacute;nie), le 17 d&eacute;cembre 1996, le CICR se doit de poursuivre ses efforts pour all&eacute;ger les souffrances des centaines de milliers de victimes de conflits &agrave; travers le monde. Il lui faudra examiner en profondeur de nouveaux moyens de mener &agrave; bien son action humanitaire mais, entre-temps, les op&eacute;rations en cours dans 25 zones de conflit, ainsi que dans 20 d&eacute;l&eacute;gations r&eacute;gionales, doivent &ecirc;tre soutenues et financ&eacute;es. Par cons&eacute;quent, le pr&eacute;sident du CICR, Cornelio Sommaruga, a lanc&eacute; le 18 d&eacute;cembre &agrave; Gen&egrave;ve, les appels de fonds pour l'ann&eacute;e 1997 : 142 millions de francs suisses (107 millions dollars US) sont n&eacute;cessaires pour le budget si&egrave;ge et 618 millions de francs suisses (465 millions dollars US) pour le budget terrain. Celui-ci pr&eacute;sente une augmentation de 8 % par rapport au budget initial pr&eacute;vu pour 1996, sans prendre en consid&eacute;ration d'&eacute;ventuelles op&eacute;rations au Za&iuml;re. <BR>

<P>La plus grande partie du budget terrain est affect&eacute;e &agrave; l'Afrique avec 236 millions de francs suisses (38% du budget). Viennent ensuite l'Europe orientale et l'Asie centrale avec 128  millions (20 %) et l'Asie avec 110 millions (18%). Les op&eacute;rations avec les budgets les plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s pour 1997 sont le Rwanda (67 millions de francs suisses), suivi par l'Afghanistan (61  millions) et l'ex-Yougoslavie (57 millions). En ce qui concerne les activit&eacute;s sp&eacute;cifiques, le budget est r&eacute;parti comme suit : 29 % pour les activit&eacute;s de secours, 26 % pour le r&eacute;tablissement des liens familiaux et les activit&eacute;s li&eacute;es &agrave; la d&eacute;tention et 15 % pour les activit&eacute;s de sant&eacute;.<BR>

<P>L'appel si&egrave;ge porte sur deux domaines importants : le soutien op&eacute;rationnel pour les actions d'urgence men&eacute;es sur le terrain, et les activit&eacute;s &agrave; long terme ayant pour but d'assurer une protection accrue aux victimes de conflits. Ces t&acirc;ches sont appuy&eacute;es par les activit&eacute;s administratives et de communication. Le si&egrave;ge du CICR compte actuellement 665  collaborateurs permanents.

<P>Eastern Europe, Central Asia and the Caucasus saw major developments in the political and military spheres during the year under review.<BR>

<P>The conflict over Nagorny Karabakh flared up twice during the early months of 1994. A cease-fire was signed in May and was still holding at the end of the year, while Russian diplomacy and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe were seeking a permanent negotiated settlement. In Georgia, the conflict that had been raging in Mingrelia came to an end in early 1994. A cease-fire agreed between the Georgians and the Abkhaz in May resulted in the creation of a buffer zone along the Inguri river, monitored by peace-keeping forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States under the supervision of United Nations observers. In the southern part of the Russian Federation there was a major conflagration in Chechnya at the end of the year. Chechnya had been claiming independence since 1991 and had been the scene of clashes between the Chechen authorities and internal opposition groups. On 11 December 1994, forces of the Russian Federation launched a military operation in Chechnya and a battle was raging as the year drew to a close.<BR>

<P>In Central Asia, there were periodic clashes on Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan, in the upper Garm valley, in the Tavildara district and in the Darwaz area. There were further population movements in Tajikistan, some displaced people returning to their homes in places where the situation had stabilized, and others fleeing areas affected by the fighting. Negotiations between the Tajik government and the opposition resulted in a temporary cease-fire, signed in Tehran in September and extended after a new series of negotiations in Islamabad from 20 October to 1 November. In Islamabad the parties also agreed to a simultaneous release of prisoners under ICRC auspices, which took place on 13 November.<BR>

<P>During the year the ICRC increased its presence in several theatres of operations where it had been working for a number of years. In the Caucasus delegates continued their visits to prisoners taken in the Ingush-Ossetian conflict and the conflicts in Abkhazia and Nagorny Karabakh. It was sometimes difficult to obtain notification of capture, to gain access to all prisoners covered by the ICRC's mandate and to hold interviews with them in private. However, progress was made in other areas: medical care for detainees was improved in some prisons while a number of women and children taken hostage in connection with the Nagorny Karabakh conflict were released.<BR>

<P>In Eastern Europe, despite constant approaches the ICRC was not allowed to repeat its visits to detainees from the &quot;Ilascu&quot; group being held in Tiraspol in the self-proclaimed Dniestr Republic. Delegates in Chechnya were able to visit only a small number of prisoners taken by Chechen forces, while by the end of the year the authorities of the Russian Federation had not notified the ICRC of any prisoners. In Central Asia, delegates in Tajikistan had access only to those detainees eligible for release under the agreement resulting from the inter-Tajik talks.<BR>

<P>Protecting civilians remained one of the ICRC's main concerns. The institution monitored the situation of a number of vulnerable communities, such as Georgians in Abkhazia and Ingush living in areas controlled by North Ossetia, and made recommendations, based on its delegates' observations, to the authorities for improving protection of those groups.<BR>

<P>With regard to tracing and restoration of family links, much progress was made in connection with the Abkhaz conflict, with a sharp rise in the number of messages exchanged between relatives separated by the fighting (72,000 family messages for a displaced population of 250,000).<BR>

<P>As for relief work, in the Caucasus the ICRC focused on winter relief programmes, emergency assistance and aid to vulnerable groups. In Central Asia, relief programmes centred on conflict areas in central Tajikistan and on the Dushanbe region.<BR>

<P>Medical activities were developed, ranging from support for establishments treating war casualties to orthopaedic workshops (projects initiated in Baku, Tbilisi and Gagra in Abkhazia) and on to sanitation programmes.<BR>

<P>In addition to its many activities aimed at relieving suffering due to armed conflict, the ICRC attached increasing importance to promoting knowledge of the basic rules of international humanitarian law and the working principles of the Red Cross and Red Crescent. A special effort was made to relate the ICRC's universal humanitarian message to local culture and to reach the most crucial target groups, above all the armed forces.<BR>

<P>Finally, the ICRC benefited greatly in its work throughout the year from the support of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and itself endeavoured to support the activities of the various Red Cross and Red Crescent organizations in the region. For example the Tashkent delegation, which is responsible for ICRC activities not only in Uzbekistan but also in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan, held a number of seminars in cooperation with the region's Red Crescent Societies to promote knowledge of international humanitarian law among their members and other audiences. The Societies received all the technical resources needed to take over this task with certain target groups, particularly at the local level. A further important area of cooperation was the training of National Society staff in tracing activities.<BR>

<H3><B>ANNEX II : Symposium of military experts on the military utility of anti-personnel mines</B></H3>
<P>
<P>One of the recommendations of the April 1993 Symposium was the convening of a meeting of military experts in order to study the military use of anti-personnel mines and possible alternatives.<BR>

<P>The ICRC hosted a Symposium for this purpose on 10- 12 January 1994.  The topics covered were as follows:<BR>

<P><I>The military utility of anti-personnel mines:</I><BR>

<P>- their use across the spectrum of conflict<BR>
- their military and cost effectiveness<BR>
- their means of delivery<BR>
- the military implications of marking/recording minefields.<BR>

<P><I>Alternative systems:</I><BR>
- what alternative systems exist<BR>
- whether they meet military requirements<BR>
- their likely cost-effectiveness<BR>
- any other implications of their use.<BR>

<P><I>Control measures:</I><BR>
-   self-destruct versus self-neutralizing mechanisms<BR>
-   suitable delay times prior to self-destruction or self-neutralization in different scenarios<BR>
-   the likely cost penalty and whether it can be offset by increased effectiveness<BR>
-   detectable versus non-detectable mines.<BR>

<P>The majority of the participants in this meeting were professional military combat engineers familiar with current tactical doctrine and trends within their own armed forces.  They drafted the following report during the Symposium.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>1. Military utility of anti-personnel mines</B></H4>
<P>
<P><U>(i) Introduction</U><BR>

<P>Mines are used in different types of armed conflict.  Accordingly, these weapons are also used in different ways.  The experts felt that there was a need to distinguish between conventional warfare, which is generally carried out in international armed conflicts where classical contemporary military doctrine prevails and where trained and disciplined soldiers are engaged, and civil war and counter-insurgency operations, where these conditions are seldom met.<BR>

<P>Mines should be distinguished from unexploded ordnance, which was not considered by the experts as it is an entirely different entity.  It is nevertheless a dangerous, uncontrollable and long-lived battlefield hazard.<BR>

<P><U>(ii) Conventional situations</U><BR>

<P>Landmines and anti-personnel (AP) mines in particular are to be seen as an integral part of a combined military plan.  By combining the effects of artillery, direct fire weapons and electromagnetic warfare with shaping of the terrain through the use of mined obstacles, the maximum synergistic effect is achieved. A combination of AP mines, anti-tank mines and other appropriate weapons systems therefore increases cost-effectiveness over what is achievable if one weapons system is used alone.  Mines thus enhance the effectiveness of other weapons systems across the spectrum of military operations and cannot be considered on their own.<BR>

<P><I>Purpose of the use of mines</I><BR>

<P>The military engineer supports his higher commander by altering or moulding the terrain in a manner that is synchronized with the commander's plan for conducting the operation.  Mines are used in the defence to deny access to areas, to encourage the enemy to focus its movement into areas where it can be attacked effectively, and to restrict the enemy's mobility while being attacked.  Mines are used in the offence to prevent the enemy from manoeuvring through an area to attack the flank of an advancing force and can be used to block an enemy retreat. Furthermore, mines can be used to hinder logistic traffic and create confusion among headquarters elements.<BR>

<P><I>Military utility and cost-effectiveness of mines</I><BR>

<P>Mines are very effective and efficient.  Manpower employed in laying mines produces much more effect on the battlefield than manpower attempting to mould the terrain in other ways.  Very little equipment is required in addition to that normally carried by soldiers.  The main purpose of mines is to canalize and delay the enemy; but they have the added advantage of inflicting casualties.  This inherent ability to inflict casualties also has a powerful demoralizing effect on the enemy soldier.  Forces are likely to avoid areas where there is even a reasonable possibility of encountering mines.<BR>

<P>There are two basic types of mines.  Anti-personnel mines attack the enemy soldier on foot, while anti-tank mines attack mounted enemy and other vehicular platforms such as tanks.  The enemy threat usually dictates what type of mine is needed.  Anti-personnel mines are used to deny access to friendly positions, to help protect anti-tank minefields from being breached and to attack enemy footsoldiers accompanying mechanized forces through such anti-tank minefields.<BR>

<P>Mines can also reinforce existing natural and man-made obstacles.  This type of use compels the enemy to deploy multiple means to overcome the obstacle, thus delaying him in his planning and in his ability to overcome the obstacle.<BR>

<P>Mines can be emplaced by hand.  This is a very slow and deliberate process that offers the possibility of the most accurate recording.  Soldiers laying mines by hand can emplace several per hour.  The rate for vehicles laying mines by mechanical means is several hundred per hour per vehicle.  Anti-tank mines can also be mechanically laid on the ground or even ploughed into the soil.  Mines may also be scattered by artillery, aircraft or vehicle; these are known as scatterable or remotely delivered mines.  Scatterable mines systems are technically capable of dispensing thousands of mines per hour but usually operate for very short periods of time.  Scatterable mines are the most difficult to record and mark.<BR>

<P> With the advent of scatterable mines the commander has more flexibility in employing minefields.  A force can now employ mines over a greater distance in relatively short periods.  It is, of course, still necessary to ensure that mine warfare is synchronized and complementary to other weapon systems on the battlefield.  There is also the need to plan the logistics involved.  Generally, once authorized by the overall commander, scatterable mines greatly enhance flexibility.<BR>

<P>There are certain hazards associated with all minefields.  The most immediate is the potential danger to friendly forces.  Uninformed individual soldiers can wander into minefields, and routes needed for counterattack or resupply can be closed off by uncoordinated mining.  This hazard can increase with the use of scatterable mines if they are not the type that self-destruct or self-neutralize.<BR>

<P>Military doctrine requires that landmine warfare operations are highly controlled.  Commanders of manoeuvre formations must give positive approval for subordinate units to lay mines.  Only commanders have this authority, which is usually held at the formation or general-officer level.  Small units may lay cornmand-detonated mines for immediate perimeter security.  These will be recovered when the unit moves.<BR>

<P>During operations all feasible precautions should be taken to protect civilians from the effects of mines.  In particular military units should:<BR>

<P>-   report intention, initiation and completion of minefields;<BR>
-   record details of minefields;<BR>
-   pass records of minefields on to other units that later become responsible for the terrain;<BR>
-   mark and fence minefields, with the exception of protective minefields and air/ artillery/rocket-delivered minefields.<BR>

<P>The experts recognized that in practice precautions may be difficult to take in all circumstances, e.g. in surprise enemy contact or retrograde operations.<BR>

<P>In summary, forces that properly integrate mine warfare with other systems to maximize weapons effects are capable of quick, decisive victory.  Forces that report and record minefields properly enhance the safety of their own soldiers and of non-combatants.<BR>

<P><U>(iii) Use of mines in internal and unconventional armed conflict</U><BR>

<P>The experts thought that it would be useful to analyse the use of mines by insurgent forces in internal and internationalized guerrilla armed conflict.  This analysis also includes the response by conventional forces engaged in counterinsurgent warfare in such situations.<BR>

<P><I>Insurgents</I><BR>

<P>Just as in conventional doctrine troops use mines to stop, delay and create psychological trauma among the opposition, insurgent forces use them to target the opposition not only to weaken its military capability, but also to weaken its economic and sociopolitical infrastructure.<BR>

<P>Insurgents rely on mines to a great degree for the following reasons:<BR>

<P>-   their limited financial and material resources lead them to place greater  reliance on mines, which are relatively cheap and are seen as force and mat&eacute;riel equalizers;<BR>

<P>-   mines are effective in spreading terror in order to influence the population for political gain.<BR>

<P>Insurgent forces have no incentive to use detectable rather than non-detectable mines, as the latter may be perceived as being more effective in further slowing down the opposition military and creating more casualties.<BR>

<P>As the availability of funds to insurgent forces is limited, the perceived utility of mines increases and therefore more are used as a substitute for other more expensive systems.<BR>

<P>With regard to the means of delivery of mines used by insurgent forces, their typical lack of resources means that they rely on hand emplacement or at most scattering from vehicles.  It is highly improbable that they would be able to use artillery or aircraft scattering systems.<BR>

<P>With regard to marking minefields, insurgent forces almost never do so as they consider this as risking loss of effect against the opposition military.<BR>

<P>On the other hand, they are more likely to keep records of minefields for their own use, but as there is usually a low level of training, expertise and discipline, this is frequently not done.  Further, it is questionable whether such forces have an adequate infrastructure for the recording of minefields and the passing on of this information to their own troops or possibly to the civilian population as a warning.<BR>

<P><I>Conventional forces engaged in counterinsurgency</I><BR>

<P>Conventional forces are able to apply conventional doctrine in deploying landmines in counterinsurgency operations to stop, delay and create psychological trauma among the opposition forces.  The casualties resulting from the use of landmines are particularly effective as opposition forces lack the medical infrastructure to care for their wounded.<BR>

<P>Mines are also used by the conventional military to protect their own positions, as well as national assets and other installations and infrastructure such as power lines, water treatment plants, bridges and airports from interference by guerrilla fighters.<BR>

<P>As the level of conflict grows, however, and the insurgents gain increased territorial control, the actual theatre of combat is extended and frequently encompasses the entire national territory.  As this situation develops, the use of landmines by the counterinsurgent forces increases.  This has the effect of placing economic and sociopolitical pressure on the insurgent forces, and the large numbers of mines also have dire effects on the local population.  This situation  is therefore worse for the civilian population than conventional warfare.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>II. Alternative systems</B></H4>
<P>
<P><U>(i) Introduction</U><BR>

<P>In order to assess the viability of alternatives to anti-personnel mines, the experts first reviewed the utility of anti-personnel mines and identified alternative military systems.  The alternative systems were then assessed against the military attributes of anti-personnel mines.  The results of the assessment were incorporated into an evaluation of the general effectiveness and/or contribution of alternative systems in terms of the following:<BR>

<P>a. fulfilment of military requirements<BR>
b. military cost-effectiveness<BR>
c. post-conflict implications.<BR>

<P><U>(ii) utility of mines</U><BR>

<P><I>Purpose of laying mines</I><BR>

<P>-    Delay the enemy<BR>
-    Canalize the enemy<BR>
-    Disrupt the enemy<BR>
-    Inflict casualties<BR>
-    Divert enemy resources/effort<BR>
-    Protect own positions<BR>
-    Reinforce terrain/obstacles.<BR>

<P><I>Desired military effects of mines</I><BR>

<P>- Psychological effect of maimed casualties<BR>
- Surprise the enemy<BR>
- Enhance other weapons<BR>
- Flexibility of use and application.<BR>

<P><U>(iii) Assessment of alternative systems</U><BR>

<P>The alternatives to anti-personnel mines identified by the experts were assessed in terms of their ability to achieve the purposes of anti-personnel mines.<BR>

<P>The conclusions are summarized in a Table (see page 177).<BR>

<P><I>Anti-personnel mines</I><BR>

<P>The use of anti-personnel mines calls for considerable resources to procure and store systems, to transport items to the battlefield and then to deploy and arm the mines.  These demands are acceptable in view of the ease of deployment and the effects of mines on the enemy.<BR>

<P>Anti-personnel mines are very effective in creating delay and in canalizing and disrupting the efforts of the enemy.  Military experience is that the use of mines in defence reduces the number of casualties to own troops.  Studies and war-game modelling support these findings.<BR>

<P>A further important impact of anti-personnel mines is the psychological effect on soldiers of seeing their comrades injured and the logistic burden involved in treating casualties.  Particular advantages of anti-personnel mines are that they are not affected by weather, they need no maintenance or logistic support once laid, they are constantly alert and are unaffected by morale. However, the laying of anti-personnel mines must be recorded accurately and the information disseminated widely to prevent own troops taking casualties on their own mines during operations.  The major disadvantage of anti-personnel mines is their existence after hostilities and their possible effects on the returning civilian population.<BR>

<P><I> Wire</I><BR>

<P>Some of the effects of mines may be achieved using wire obstacles, but the disadvantages to the military are the costs involved in purchasing and transporting  the materials, plus the intensive manpower effort required to build the obstacle. Wire has little impact after hostilities other than a nuisance effect.<BR>

<P><I>Ditches</I><BR>

<P>These can only partly replace mines.  They are costly in terms of the time and machine effort required for construction.<BR>

<P><I>Improvised devices</I><BR>

<P>The experts were unanimous in their view that if anti-personnel mines are not available to combatants, the latter will improvise and make alternative exploding devices during hostilities with the armaments and equipment available. The cost of such devices will be greater in terms of the time and manpower required to make and lay them.<BR>

<P>Improvised devices will be difficult to neutralize and lift as they will not be of standard design.  Military casualties could be higher with &quot;field-made&quot; devices because of the excessive amounts of explosives used (e.g., improvised 155 mm shell mines).  Ale need to construct such devices in the field could. on the other hand, reduce the overall number deployed.<BR>

<P><I>Flooding/mud</I><BR>

<P>Flooding can be highly cost-effective, but it is not reliable or flexible. Moreover, it is very difficult to control and may place the civilian population at risk.  After hostilities there could be long-term effects on agriculture, especially when sea-water is involved.<BR>

<P><I>Landforcefire</I><BR>

<P> While land force fire can achieve the desired effects of anti-personnel mines, it is costly in terms of maintaining alert troops and the amount of ammunition involved.  It is also limited by weather and visibility.  Artillery fire can increase the incidence of unexploded ordnance on the battlefield if it is used to compensate for the lack of mines.<BR>

<P><I>Airpower</I><BR>

<P>Air-delivered weapons are extremely flexible and have considerable range. However, their accuracy is not sufficiently good for use near to own troops and they are costly in terms of skilled manpower and maintenance.  If air-delivered weapons are used to replace anti-personnel mines, the occurrence of unexploded ordnance would increase.<BR>

<P><I>Novel devices</I><BR>

<P>The experts took note of research into new devices, such as glues, foam, infrasound, etc., but had little information on such devices and saw no indication that they would achieve the military objectives of mines.  The possible collateral effects of novel devices, such as toxicity and the effect of weather, plus the side- effects of countermeasures, are unknown.<BR>

<P><U>(iv) Conclusions</U><BR>

<P>Having considered alternative systems and analysed their utility and short-comings, the following assessment was made:<BR>

<P><I>Do alternative systems meet military requirements?</I><BR>

<P>No alternative meets military requirements in the way that anti-personnel(AP) mines do.  The improvised explosive device (IED) comes closest to replacing the AP mine.  If AP mines were not available, such devices would proliferate.  Although there would be fewer of them than AP mines, the casualty effect of each IED could be very great, and post-war problems of clearance would remain.<BR>

<P><I>Military cost-effectiveness</I><BR>

<P>The AP mine is the most cost-effective system available to the military.  The alternatives require more resources and are less effective.  In particular, land force fire and air power would never be available in adequate quantities and would be extremely expensive.  Their effectiveness is also subject to the weather and visibility.<BR>

<P><I>Post-conflict implications</I><BR>

<P>AP mines create the worst post-war effects unless they have self-destructed, self-neutralized or been removed.  Massive demining operations are required to render areas safe for the civilian population and for agricultural use.  IED would pose a similar problem, although there should be fewer of them.  As for air power and land fire, the problem of unexploded ordnance (UXO) would significantly increase, as approximately 20 to 30 percent of the munitions would not function on use.  UXO would also have to be removed from the battlefield to make the area safe for civilian use.  All other alternatives are safe in this respect as they  have practically no post-war implications.<BR>

<P>In summary, the military do not regard alternative systems as being viable.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>III.  Control measures</B></H4>
<P>
<P><U>(i) Introduction</U><BR>

<P>This subject comprises four specific issues that were treated separately by the experts:<BR>

<P>-   self-destruct versus self-neutralizing mechanisms;<BR>
-   suitable delay times prior to self-destruction or self-neutralization in different scenarios;<BR>
-   the likely cost penalty and whether it can be offset by increased effectiveness;<BR>
-   detectable versus non-detectable mines.<BR>

<P>The experts began by observing that mines used in an armed conflict situation cause considerable civilian casualties both during the conflict itself and for many years thereafter.  It is regrettable that at times mines are intentionally employed against civilians, even though such use is illegal.  The experts then defined the two categories of mines involved.<BR>

<P><B>Anti-personnel mines</B> are small, autonomous, victim-initiated explosive devices, usually designed to wound rather than kill.  They may be point detonating, directional fragmentation (e.g. Claymore), or jumping fragmentation mines. They may be scattered from vehicles, artillery or aircraft, or hand-emplaced.<BR>

<P><B>Anti-tank mines</B> are larger, and normally require heavy pressure to set them off, although other means of initiation exist.  Anti-tank mines can be fitted with anti-handling devices, designed to deter hand-clearance.  They can also be modified and misused so that a man rather than a vehicle can initiate them . This practice was not considered further by the working group because it represented gross and uncontrollable misuse.<BR>
   <BR>
<U>(ii) Self-destruct versus self-neutralizing mechanisms</U><BR>

<P>Self-destruct mines (SD) contain an integral system that causes the mine to be spontaneously destroyed at the end of a predetermined period of time.<BR>

<P>Self-neutralizing mines (SN) neutralize themselves so that they cannot be victim-initiated after a predetermined period of time.<BR>

<P>With SD, there is nothing left after detonation.  Therefore, should any mines fail to go off, they can be treated as live and dealt with accordingly.  There is some danger when the mines detonate, but this was considered acceptable by the working group.  The disadvantage with SN mines is that it is difficult to determine whether the system has functioned or not, resulting in no real danger but necessitating some form of clearance.<BR>

<P><U>(iii) Economic aspects</U><BR>

<P>The experts also discussed the possible reuse of scatterable SN mines for economic reasons, and concluded that this was too dangerous to be a viable option because failure of the self-neutralizing system might have catastrophic results if the mines were being carried in vehicles or kept in storage bunkers.<BR>

<P><U>(iv) Failure rates</U><BR>

<P>With modem electronic fusing, it should be possible to bring failure rates down to between one in a thousand and one in a million for both SD and SN, and to design the system in such a way that the mechanism becomes harmless after failure.  Mechanical pressure fuse systems can use air or gas generators to initiate SD or SN with varying degrees of reliability.  In the future, chemical or other forms of degradation may be possible.<BR>

<P><U>(v) Suitable delay times prior to self-destruction or self-neutralization in different scenarios</U><BR>

<P>a.   The delay time is the time that a mine is on the ground and active and therefore capable of being victirn-initiated.  The term &quot;delay time&quot; does not relate to the time a mine can be kept in storage prior to use, nor the time between emplacement and the mine becoming active.  After discussion, the experts agreed that the delay time was dependent on the tactical scenario.<BR>

<P>b.   Scatterable mines. In a tactical situation where scatterable mines are likely to be employed, the majority of military experts felt that at the most a 12-month delay time would be acceptable.  This delay time would be programmable at time of launch and would be selected by the formation commander depending on his appreciation of the military situation.  This would generally be considerably less than 12 months, but adoption of a compulsory shorter delay time-frame would be militarily unacceptable.  This is because should mines be required for longer periods (i.e. up to the full year) they would have destroyed themselves and would have to be replaced at great economic and military cost. A minority of military experts expressed the view that the maximum delay time should not be specified but left to individual nations to decide.<BR>

<P>c.   Hand-emplaced mines. Hand-emplaced AP mines fall into two categories  for the purpose of this paper: those deployed for relatively short periods of time, i.e. tactical; and those needed for an indefinite period of time, possibly many years, i.e. strategic, usually barrier minefields.<BR>

<P>-   AP mines used in a tactical scenario are not needed for long periods and should be SD with a limited, timed life.  They would thus represent a hazard to innocent civilians for only a limited amount of time, even in the event of illegal misuse.<BR>

<P>-   Strategic AP mines guarding international borders or sensitive military sites will be required to remain active for many years.  These cannot SD  for military and economic reasons but must therefore always be subject  to tight control, recording and marking.  This may require international verification systems.<BR>

<P><U>(vi) The likely cost penalty and whether it can be offset by increased effectiveness</U><BR>

<P>It was recognized that any additional feature, such as SD capability, fitted to a mine will cost money without any direct increase in the military performance of the mine.  It will, however, allow flexibility in military operations by aiding future mobility.  Developments in technology and the inevitable reduction in cost of mass- produced electronics will bring down the cost of SD, but today that cost may be prohibitive to many nations.  On the other hand, SD will reduce demining expenses should the mines ever be used in the future.  However, as the acquisition costs of a mine system are critical to most nations, the possibility of saving money in the future may not be a compelling argument, particularly if the price is double or triple for a SD mine.  Future developments may reduce this cost so as to make SD acceptable to all.  Once the heavy initial cost of an electronic fuse is accepted, various features such as SD, SN, etc. are relatively cheap.<BR>

<P>The experts did recognize that if humanitarian considerations and the enormous cost of mine removal are considered, a self-destruct capability becomes highly desirable and ultimately cost-effective.<BR>

<P><U>(vii) Detectable versus non-detectable mines</U><BR>

<P>Recent AP mines are made of plastic for cheapness, ease of manufacture and resistance to the effects of weather.  Concealment is therefore not the main reason for the use of plastic in manufacture.  In certain countries, mine doctrine requires that all anti-personnel mines be fitted with a metallic ring to allow detection by current electronic metal-seeking mine detectors.  It is almost inevitable that electronic fuses will be detectable anyway.  However, some participants felt that, from an operational point of view, non-detectability by electronic mine detectors played a crucial role in internal conflicts, as detectable mines could be recovered and used by other parties.  They also considered that non-detectable mines offered an increased surprise factor.  Other participants observed that &quot;non-detectable&quot; mines could be detected by other methods, such as prodding.  Where minefields are covered by fire, the value of non-detectability of mines is drastically reduced.<BR>

<P>From a humanitarian point of view, delectability by electronic metal-seeking devices is crucial to the whole process of mine clearance, and it was generally felt by the majority of participants that such delectability in mines would have few negative consequences.<BR>

<P><U>(viii) Recommendations with regard to Protocol 11 of the 1980 Weapons Convention</U><BR>

<P>a. All scatterable mines should self-destruct; however, it is highly recommended that even in the case of self-destruct mines the general area of their use be recorded in accordance with existing law and military doctrine, and that where possible they be used in fenced or marked areas.<BR>

<P>b.  At the end of hostilities, self-destruct times should be declared to all parties, together with all other minefield information.<BR>

<P>c.  For the foreseeable future there will be a military need for some forms of hand-emplaced mines that will not self-destruct, for use in long-term and barrier minefields, but they must be used in tightly controlled circumstances.<BR>

<P>d.  The experts acknowledge that directional fragmentation mines, such as Claymore mines, will not necessarily be fitted with a SD mechanism, because they are principally designed for reuse.  It is suggested that jumping mines be either SD or SN after a timed life, as they are too difficult and dangerous to reuse.<BR>

<P>e.  Despite the increased acquisition costs, future AP mines should self-destruct, except in the circumstances already mentioned in these recommendations, thereby reducing the tragic post-conflict toll of human lives and social, economic, medical and mine clearance costs.<BR>

<P>f. In the future, all AP mines should be detectable.<BR>

<P>
<H2>Suisse : le CICR infiltr&eacute; par les Nazis ?</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>D&eacute;but ao&ucirc;t, des documents tir&eacute;s des archives de l'<I>Office of Strategic Services (OSS)</I>, datant de la fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, ont commen&ccedil;&eacute; &agrave; circuler. Certaines des all&eacute;gations contenues dans ces documents ont &eacute;t&eacute; reprises par la presse; il en est ressorti l'impression que le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge (CICR) avait &eacute;t&eacute; noyaut&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;poque par des agents &agrave; la solde de l'Allemagne nazie.<BR>

<P>Ce sont l&agrave; de tr&egrave;s graves all&eacute;gations que le CICR examine avec le plus grand s&eacute;rieux. Ses archivistes ont imm&eacute;diatement entrepris de retrouver la trace des individus ou des faits cit&eacute;s dans ces documents, recherches qui ont permis de constituer un <A HREF="2b62.htm">dossier</A> faisant le point sur ces all&eacute;gations. Ce dossier est disponible aupr&egrave;s de la Division de Presse du CICR.<BR>

<P>En r&eacute;sum&eacute;, voici ce qui ressort de cette premi&egrave;re approche : seules 16 des 21 personnes pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es dans les documents am&eacute;ricains comme li&eacute;es au CICR ont effectivement travaill&eacute; pour l'institution. Dans plusieurs cas, le libell&eacute; &quot;espion&quot;, accol&eacute; &agrave; des d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s du CICR, s'explique ais&eacute;ment par le fait que l'agent am&eacute;ricain ignorait tout du mandat de l'institution. Ainsi s'&eacute;tonnait-il qu'un d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute; CICR communique des d&eacute;tails techniques sur un navire <I>(SS  Canada); </I>or, le CICR avait &eacute;t&eacute; saisi par le gouvernement fran&ccedil;ais en exil qui lui demandait de notifier les autorit&eacute;s allemandes de la mise en service du b&acirc;timent, lequel &eacute;tait, conform&eacute;ment au droit de La Haye, un bateau-h&ocirc;pital.<BR>

<P>De m&ecirc;me, l'agent am&eacute;ricain reprochait au CICR qu'un de ses d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s ait communiqu&eacute; les noms et adresses de deux prisonniers de guerre, alors que le CICR a transmis &agrave; leurs Puissances d'origine et &agrave; leurs proches des informations sur des millions de captifs.<BR>

<P>Pour l'instant, le CICR n'est pas en mesure de certifier qu'il n'y a pas eu d'espions nazis (ou autres!) dans ses rangs durant le second conflit mondial; toutefois, il appara&icirc;t d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; que l'agent de l'<I>OSS</I> a qualifi&eacute; d'espionnage des activit&eacute;s exerc&eacute;es en toute transparence, avec l'accord ou &agrave; la demande des autorit&eacute;s alli&eacute;es. Toute la lumi&egrave;re sur ces all&eacute;gations devra &ecirc;tre faite, et le CICR prendra contact avec l'&eacute;quipe de chercheurs am&eacute;ricains puisant actuellement dans les dossiers de l'<I>OSS</I> pour apporter les r&eacute;ponses de l'institution sur ces points.

<H2>Rwanda : acc&egrave;s direct &agrave; l'eau</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Depuis quelques jours, les habitants de la pr&eacute;fecture de Gikongoro au Rwanda ont de nouveau un acc&egrave;s direct &agrave; l'eau potable. &quot;Au d&eacute;but des travaux, pas une goutte d'eau n'arrivait dans les fontaines publiques r&eacute;parties sur les 48 km du r&eacute;seau qui vient d'&ecirc;tre remis en &eacute;tat&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; Markus Baechler, coordonnateur du CICR pour les questions d'eau et d'assainissement. &quot;Aujourd'hui, de larges parties de la population peuvent s'approvisionner directement sans avoir &agrave; faire de longs et p&eacute;nibles trajets &agrave; pied&quot;, a-t-il ajout&eacute;, le jour de l'inauguration du nouveau syst&egrave;me de distribution d'eau. <BR>

<P>Ce projet, r&eacute;alis&eacute; par la Croix-Rouge am&eacute;ricaine sous les auspices du CICR, est l'un des neuf projets d'approvisionnement en eau et d'assainissement r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans les pr&eacute;fectures de Gikongoro et de Butare. Selon Markus Baechler, &quot;le r&eacute;tablissement de l'eau potable reste une des priorit&eacute;s dans ce pays&quot;. Parall&egrave;lement, le programme d'&eacute;ducation et de sensibilisation de la population se poursuit. Une pi&egrave;ce de th&eacute;&acirc;tre a notamment &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;e pendant plusieurs semaines, qui explique comment &eacute;viter des maladies li&eacute;es &agrave; la consommation d'une eau de mauvaise qualit&eacute;. Il est en effet important de continuer &agrave; entretenir les syst&egrave;mes d'approvisionnement en eau.

<H4><B>Fin des travaux de la Commission I</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Les travaux de la Commission I se sont termin&eacute;s en fin de matin&eacute;e, mercredi 6 d&eacute;cembre, avec les interventions des repr&eacute;sentants du Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge et de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s de la Croix-Rouge et du Croissant-Rouge. Tous deux ont vivement remerci&eacute; les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations pour leurs contributions d&eacute;terminantes et ont f&eacute;licit&eacute; le Pr&eacute;sident de la Commission pour la fa&ccedil;on dont il a conduit les d&eacute;bats.<BR>

<P>Les repr&eacute;sentants des deux institutions genevoises ont soulign&eacute; avec satisfaction que les recommandations du groupe d'experts ont &eacute;t&eacute; largement soutenues par les d&eacute;l&eacute;gations qui se sont exprim&eacute;es &agrave; la tribune. Ces derni&egrave;res ont condamn&eacute; le viol et les agressions sexuelles, de m&ecirc;me que la participation d'enfants dans les hostilit&eacute;s. Elles ont demand&eacute; l'interdiction totale de l'utilisation des mines antipersonnel. Enfin, elles se sont toutes engag&eacute;es &agrave; trouver les moyens de mettre en oeuvre le droit international humanitaire, notamment en le faisant mieux conna&icirc;tre des forces arm&eacute;es de leur pays et de la population dans son ensemble.<BR>

<P>Plusieurs d&eacute;l&eacute;gations ont enfin adress&eacute; leurs remarques au Comit&eacute; de r&eacute;daction pour la pr&eacute;paration des r&eacute;solutions finales, qui doivent &ecirc;tre pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es en s&eacute;ance pl&eacute;ni&egrave;re le jeudi 7 d&eacute;cembre.<BR>

<P>
<H4><B>Fin des travaux de la Commission II</B></H4>
<P>
<P>Durant la derni&egrave;re session des travaux de la Commission II, de nombreux intervenants ont &agrave; nouveau mis l'accent sur la mobilisation des ressources humaines et financi&egrave;res pour faire face aux besoins des plus vuln&eacute;rables, tant au sein de la collectivit&eacute; que lors de situations de crise. La condition des plus vuln&eacute;rables, dont le nombre ne cesse d'augmenter dans le monde, n'est pas simplement li&eacute;e &agrave; la pauvret&eacute; mais  aussi et surtout &agrave; l'ignorance, de telle sorte qu'un effort particulier doit &ecirc;tre engag&eacute; dans le domaine de l'&eacute;ducation.<BR>

<P>L'int&eacute;grit&eacute; des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et leur ind&eacute;pendance ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;affirm&eacute;es, ainsi que la coop&eacute;ration  r&eacute;gionale en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement. Le renforcement de leurs capacit&eacute;s pour mener &agrave; bien leur mission humanitaire aupr&egrave;s des plus vuln&eacute;rables a &eacute;t&eacute; une nouvelle fois mis en &eacute;vidence. A ce  propos, un amendement au projet de r&eacute;solution a &eacute;t&eacute; sugg&eacute;r&eacute;. Il a pour but de donner la possibilit&eacute; &agrave; la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration d'&ecirc;tre inform&eacute;e sur toutes les actions prises de concert par les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales et leur gouvernement en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement.<BR>

<P>La participation active des jeunes aux programmes du Mouvement a &eacute;t&eacute; soulign&eacute;e. Il faut qu'ils se fassent entendre, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; un repr&eacute;sentant de Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale. Il a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;galement propos&eacute;  une intensification de la collaboration du Mouvement avec les Nations Unies, ainsi qu'une plus grande attention aux catastrophes technologiques et &agrave; la protection de l'environnement &agrave; propos de laquelle il convenait de mettre en place des mesures pr&eacute;ventives.<BR>

<P>Les participants ont, comme hier, largement exprim&eacute; leur soutien aux projets de r&eacute;solutions de la Commission, en r&eacute;affirmant leur devoir de solidarit&eacute; envers les populations vuln&eacute;rables. Certaines Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales ont demand&eacute; aux donateurs d'accro&icirc;tre leurs contributions pour qu'elles puissent mieux prot&eacute;ger les plus d&eacute;munis. <BR>

<P>Certains intervenants ont soulign&eacute; que le Mouvement doit rappeler aux gouvernements leur obligation d'autoriser les institutions de la Croix-Rouge et le Croissant-Rouge &agrave; remplir leur devoir envers les victimes dans la neutralit&eacute; et l'impartialit&eacute;.  Malgr&eacute; l'immensit&eacute; de la t&acirc;che et la complexit&eacute; grandissante des situations d'urgence, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; un des orateurs, il faut plaider sans rel&acirc;che en faveur des victimes de catastrophes.  D'autres ont pos&eacute; la question de savoir si la souffrance inflig&eacute;e sur les plus vuln&eacute;rables par les sanctions &eacute;conomiques &eacute;tait un moyen l&eacute;gitime de faire pression sur des dirigeants politiques. <BR>

<P>Au terme des interventions des repr&eacute;sentants des Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales, de gouvernements et d'observateurs, le Rapporteur de la Commission a esquiss&eacute; les grandes lignes du rapport de la Commission, qui sera pr&eacute;sent&eacute; demain. Puis, un repr&eacute;sentant de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration internationale, apr&egrave;s avoir remerci&eacute; les d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s du soutien qu'ils ont exprim&eacute; pour le travail de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration, a rappel&eacute; aux gouvernements l'importance de renforcer leur Soci&eacute;t&eacute; nationale et de soutenir l'ind&eacute;pendance de l'assistance humanitaire. Un repr&eacute;sentant du CICR a rappel&eacute; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de diffuser le droit international humanitaire et a, lui aussi, soutenu un amendement aux projets de r&eacute;solutions, amendement qui appelle &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation d'un groupe d'experts sur la s&eacute;paration entre l'action humanitaire, &eacute;conomique et politique. Ce sont les actes qui soulagent les victimes, a-t-il d&eacute;clar&eacute;. <BR>

<P>
<P>La Croix-Rouge de Norv&egrave;ge a mis au point un logiciel interactif de nature humanitaire, qui est &agrave; la fois une banque de donn&eacute;es, un divertissement et un jeu de r&ocirc;les. L'id&eacute;e est de se mettre dans la peau d'un personnage appartenant &agrave; un groupe ethnique minoritaire et d'examiner divers sc&eacute;narios possibles pour tenter de r&eacute;soudre une crise humanitaire.<BR>

<P>Le h&eacute;ros de cette histoire, Jakac, &acirc;g&eacute; de 17 ans, vit dans le pays imaginaire de Lokaya, qui est en proie &agrave; des troubles et des tensions internes entre divers groupes ethniques.<BR>

<P>Le jeune homme a vu dispara&icirc;tre son p&egrave;re au cours d'un enl&egrave;vement. Il d&eacute;cide de partir &agrave; sa recherche et nous entra&icirc;ne dans son sillage. Par exemple, dans l'un des sc&eacute;narios, Jakac se heurte &agrave; l'incompr&eacute;hension de la police et doit se d&eacute;brouiller tout seul sans l'aide d'aucune organisation internationale.<BR>

<P>Ce programme informatique, intitul&eacute; Human Quest I, est tr&egrave;s didactique. En effet, la banque de donn&eacute;es qui lui est li&eacute;e comprend toutes sortes de renseignements sur les droits fondamentaux de la personne humaine et les cons&eacute;quences de leur violation. Il offre aussi &agrave; l'utilisateur de nombreuses informations sur les caract&eacute;ristiques d'un pays o&ugrave; se d&eacute;roulent des conflits internes.<BR>

<P>Ce logiciel est accompagn&eacute; d'un manuel d'utilisation et d'une brochure contenant de nombreux articles et th&egrave;mes de discussion. C'est un outil p&eacute;dagogique tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;cieux pour les enseignants, leur permettant de sensibiliser leurs &eacute;l&egrave;ves au respect de la dignit&eacute; humaine. Il peut aussi &ecirc;tre utilis&eacute; comme instrument de diffusion du droit international humanitaire par les Soci&eacute;t&eacute;s nationales de la Croix-Rouge ou du Croissant-Rouge.<BR>

<P>Une repr&eacute;sentante de la Croix-Rouge de Norv&egrave;ge se fera un plaisir de vous d&eacute;montrer tous les avantages d'un tel logiciel. Elle vous attend &agrave; l'entr&eacute;e du Centre de conf&eacute;rences, pr&egrave;s du stand des publications.<BR>

<P>D'autre part, la 26&egrave;me Conf&eacute;rence internationale est en liaison directe avec le Forum CompuServe, qui a des utilisateurs dans le monde entier. Ceux-ci peuvent adresser leurs questions au Forum, et des experts du Mouvement y r&eacute;pondent directement depuis Gen&egrave;ve en pianotant sur le clavier d'un ordinateur. <BR>

<P>
<H4><B>The internment of the First French Army in Switzerland on 1 February 1871</B></H4>
<P>
<P><B><I>Fran&ccedil;ois Bugnion, </I></B><I>Arts graduate and Doctor of Political Science is Deputy Director of the ICRC Department for Principles, Law and Relations with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. He is the author of </I>Le Comit&eacute; international de la Croix-Rouge et la protection des victimes de la guerre<I>, ICRC, Geneva, 1994.</I><BR>

<P>
<P><I>&quot;The army is ready; not a gaiter button is lacking&quot;</I>, declared Marshal Leboeuf, Napoleon III's Minister of War, when the funds needed for mobilization were being voted.<BR>

<P>Rarely has such an ill-considered remark been made: the French army, poorly equipped, inadequately trained and, above all, incompetently led, was soon to suffer a succession of crushing defeats. As soon as the first clashes took place in August 1870 it was forced to abandon Alsace and Lorraine, save for a few strongholds  Strasbourg, S&eacute;lestat, Neuf-Brisach, Metz and Belfort  all of which remained under siege. On 2 September Napoleon III capitulated at Sedan with 80,000 men, bringing down the Second Empire, and the Prussians marched on Paris.<BR>

<P>The Republic proclaimed on 4 September inherited a desperate situation: Paris was under siege from 18 September and the Government of National Defence was blockaded in the capital together with its best troops; Strasbourg, in flames, was forced to surrender on 28 September; and on 27 October Marshal Bazaine capitulated at Metz with 150,000 men, enabling the Prussians to reinforce the siege of Paris, where the hungry population soon began to suffer the effects of winter cold [1].<BR>

<P>All eyes were now focused on Paris, whose fate would decide the outcome of the war. New troops from the provinces, hastily raised and barely equipped, were thrown into battle in an attempt to break the siege of the capital. Against all odds, the Army of the Loire met some success, driving the Bavarians from the field at Coulmiers on 9 November and then marching on Beaune-la-Rolande on 28 November before being forced back to the south. On 6 December, the Prussians occupied Orl&eacute;ans. Paris, meanwhile, was subjected to heavy artillery bombardment and morale plunged as conditions became more and more precarious: there was no fuel to heat the houses, any bread available was inedible and the butchers' stalls began to display siege fare  horse, donkey, dog, cat and rat [2].<BR>

<P>Having failed to lift the siege, the War Ministry, serving as general staff headquarters in name if not in competence, decided to try a diversion to the east and a new army was established from the remnants of the Army of the Loire. Its task was to relieve Belfort, the town commanding the route between the Vosges and the Jura, whose garrison had so far held the besieging forces in check. Success here would threaten the invaders  lines of communication and draw part of the Prussian army well away from Paris [3].<BR>

<P>Victorious at Villersexel on 9 January 1871, the Army of the East, commanded by General Bourbaki, came within firing range of Belfort before being halted on the Lisaine. The Prussians, though fewer in number, were far better trained and three days of fierce fighting (15-17 January) failed to dislodge them from their lines. Meanwhile, the German high command launched a devastating counter-move. A new force was raised from the troops besieging Paris and, avoiding Dijon, was dispatched to attack the Army of the East from the rear, threatening its supply lines and cutting off its retreat [4].<BR>

<P>With the French demoralized by a series of defeats and exhausted by two months of ceaseless march and countermarch, the now inevitable retreat soon turned into a rout. Struggling through Arctic conditions, the ragged and ill-shod army abandoned all semblance of discipline and sometimes even the will to survive. Many soldiers threw away their weapons and equipment; others lay down exhausted in the snow and expired by the roadside. Their horses, most of which had not been unharnessed for weeks, were reduced to skin and bone; they had not been shod for winter conditions and when they fell on the ice were unable to stand up again.<BR>

<P>On 26 January, shattered by the disasters which had befallen his army, General Bourbaki put a gun to his head and attempted suicide. On the 28th, Jules Favre, Foreign Minister of the Government of National Defence, and Count Bismarck, Chancellor of the German Empire proclaimed a few days earlier in the Hall of Mirrors, signed an armistice at Versailles which led to a suspension of hostilities on all fronts. The Army of the East, however, was excluded from the armistice, an exception which further added to the confusion and disarray of the troops [5].<BR>

<P>Realizing that the war was now lost and seeing the Prussians cutting off his last lines of retreat, General Clinchant, the successor of the unfortunate Bourbaki, after a last attempt to break through the enemy encirclement, decided to request internment in Switzerland as the only alternative to capitulation.<BR>
At dawn on 1 February 1871, General Herzog, Commander in Chief of the Swiss army, and General Clinchant signed an agreement at the border post of Les Verri&egrave;res, authorizing the Army of the East to enter Switzerland on condition that it laid down its arms (see box) [6].<BR>

<P>Throughout that day, all night and part of the following day, men, carriages, horses, artillery pieces, carriages and wagons streamed across the border in an endless procession.<BR>

<P><I>&quot;The entry of the French troops of the Army of the East offered a striking spectacle and one's heart was profoundly moved by the sight of so much suffering&quot;,</I> wrote Major Davall in the official report on the French troops interned in Switzerland. He continued:<BR>

<P><I>&quot;Once they were no longer sustained by fear of the constant danger which had followed them for weeks [...] and as soon as they felt themselves on hospitable soil, where helping hands stretched out to them from all sides, the soldiers collapsed completely and lost what little energy they had conserved.</I><BR>

<P><I>A large proportion of them were marching barefoot or had wrapped their feet in rags. Their boots had been made of spongy, poorly tanned leather which could not withstand marches in snow and mud [...] and were generally too tight. Thus, the feet of many of these unfortunates were frozen or covered in blood. Their uniforms were in tatters and the soldiers, having appropriated whatever clothing they could find to replace missing items, were as motley a crew as you could ever imagine. Some of them were still in the canvas trousers they had received at the start of the campaign and were shivering pitifully.</I><BR>

<P><I>As soon as the soldiers set foot on Swiss territory, they were disarmed and made to laid down their rifles, their sabres and their ammunition. Soon there were immense piles of weapons and effects on either side of the road.</I><BR>

<P><I>The horse presented a particularly pathetic sight: starving, long neglected, often poorly harnessed, their hides sometimes no more than one revolting sore; thin, bony, barely able to stand, they gnawed at anything within reach - wheel rims, old sacks, the tail or main of the animal next to them. From time to time, one of these poor beasts, too exhausted to respond to the whip, would fall and expire where it lay. It would then be cut from its traces and dragged to the roadside already littered with the carcasses of other animals [...].</I><BR>

<P><I>The drivers themselves admitted that many of the artillery horses had not been out of harness for weeks [...].</I><BR>

<P><I>The procession began on the morning of 1 February and continued all day without interruption. First came a mixed crowd of soldiers, in no order of any kind and obeying no-one [...]. Later, some more organized units appeared: here one or two companies, there a battalion accompanied by its officers, and finally one or two complete regiments [...].</I><BR>

<P><I>By a natural instinct of self-preservation, all these men kept close on the heels of those in front so that the march-past formed a solid column with no breaks or halts [...].</I><BR>

<P><I>The slopes of the Jura were covered with snow, and at this season only three or four of the roads crossing into</I> <I>Switzerland were passable. What a strange spectacle this was to behold, with the long black lines of men winding through the countryside like a ceaseless torrent plunging down into the valley. The human flood, interspersed with thousands of carriages, streamed on with no halt, no rest. Pushed on ceaselessly by the press from behind, crossing a sparsely populated land whose meagre resources could do little to meet such urgent needs, the soldiers made their way down into the valley until they came to a town or large village where they could at last find a moment s rest. The first troops to cross the border had to march until evening in order to leave the road open for other units to advance. When they finally arrived in inhabited areas where the population was waiting with relief supplies, these poor soldiers, hungry and exhausted, slid to the ground beside the houses and remained there squatting, inert, incapable of action and barely able to speak.</I><BR>

<P><I>From one end of the columns to the other there came a constant chorus of strident coughing; almost all the men had chest infections and this constant hacking contributed to their prostration.&quot; </I>[7]<BR>

<P>The French command had given a figure of 42,000 men. In fact, the numbers that entered Switzerland were: 87,847 men (including 2,467 officers), 11,800 horses, 285 cannon and mortars and 1,158 carriages [8].<BR>

<P>General officers were allowed to choose where they were to stay in Switzerland. The troops were split up and billeted in 188 towns and villages in all the Swiss cantons - except the Ticino - in numbers proportionate to the population [9].<BR>

<P>Some 5,000 men had to be evacuated to hospital immediately, but almost everyone needed medical care and all the places where the internees were accommodated - churches, schools, barracks, etc. - were turned into infirmaries [10].<BR>

<P>On 2 February, the Federal Council instructed the Swiss minister in Paris to start negotiations with the Government of National Defence and with Bismarck with a view to the repatriation of the internees. However, while the French were in agreement, Ambassador Kern met with a flat refusal from Bismarck, who intended to use every available means to force the French government to sign a humiliating peace treaty as quickly as possible [11].<BR>

<P>Thus it was not until the ratification of the peace preliminaries on 2 March 1871 that the Germans would consent to the repatriation of the internees. The repatriation itself took place on 13 and 14 March, with the bulk of the troops travelling by rail from Geneva and the remainder through Les Verri&egrave;res and Divonne or by boat across Lake Geneva [12].<BR>

<P>About a thousand f the internees were still in hospital; they were repatriated in small groups after they had recovered. Some 1,700 internees died during their stay in Switzerland from the effects of typhus, smallpox or pulmonary disease [13].<BR>

<P>The costs arising from the internment amounted to 12 million francs. In accordance with the Agreement of Les Verri&egrave;res, France reimbursed this sum in full in August 1872 [14].<BR>

<P>
<P>The war of 1870-1871 had exposed deep uncertainties with regard to the rules applicable to the conduct of hostilities, since, apart from the recently concluded Geneva Convention of 22 August 1864 for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field, the law of war still remained entirely customary. These uncertainties had given rise to serious differences between the belligerents, leading to reprisal measures.<BR>
Inspired by the example which the International Committee of the Red Cross had set in proposing the adoption, in time of peace, of a convention to govern the conduct of belligerents, Tsar Alexander II called a conference in Brussels from 27 July to 27 August 1874 to codify the laws and customs of war.<BR>

<P>In the draft declaration which was to serve as the basis for the work of the Brussels Conference, the St Petersburg government had not envisaged any provision relating to internment in a neutral country. However, the retreat of Bourbaki's army was still too fresh in the memory for this question to be passed over. After all, never before in history had such a large army been interned in a neutral country and under such dramatic circumstances. Moreover, this internment had raised new legal problems relating to both the law of war and the law of neutrality; problems which had been resolved by Switzerland's negotiations with Germany on the one hand and with France on the other [15].<BR>

<P>The Conference, therefore, agreed without difficulty to consider the views of the Belgian delegate, who proposed that the matter be settled and submitted draft articles to this effect. Prolonged discussion led to the adoption of Articles 53 to 56 of the Brussels Declaration, which clearly bore the mark of the events at Les Verri&egrave;res [16].<BR>

<P>As the Brussels Declaration was not subsequently ratified, the issue was taken up again at the First International Peace Conference, meeting in The Hague from 18 May to 29 July 1899. The articles which had been adopted in Brussels were incorporated almost word for word in the Convention Respecting the Laws and Customs of War on Land of 29 July 1899 [17].<BR>

<P>Finally, having set itself the objective of codifying not only the law of war but also that of neutrality, the Second International Peace Conference, meeting in The Hague from 15 June to 18 October 1907, incorporated these provisions in the new Hague Convention Respecting the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land [18]. The Conference also determined two points on which the Brussels Conference had been unable to agree, namely, how to deal with escaped prisoners of war seeking refuge in a neutral country on the one hand, and with prisoners of war brought along by troops taking refuge in neutral territory on the other [19].<BR>

<P>Thus agreement was finally reached on Articles 11 to 15 of the Convention, which remains in force to this day. These articles form Chapter II, entitled &quot;Belligerents Interned and Wounded Tended in Neutral Territory&quot;.<BR>

<P>
<TABLE border>
<TR valign=top><TD ALIGN=CENTER>
<P><B><I>Article 11</I></B><BR>
<I>A neutral Power which receives on its territory troops belonging to the belligerent armies shall intern them, as far as possible, ata distance from the theatre of war.</I><BR>

<P><I>It may keep them in camps and even confine them in fortresses or in places set apart for this purpose.</I><BR>
<I>It shall decide whether officers can be left at liberty on giving their parole not to leave the neutral territory without permission.</I><BR>
<B><I>Article 12</I></B><BR>
<I>In the absence of a special convention to the contrary, the neutral Power shall supply the interned with the food, clothing and relief required by humanity.</I><BR>

<P><I>At the conclusion of the peace the expenses caused by the internment shall be made good.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Article 13</I></B><BR>
<I>A neutral Power which receives escaped prisoners of war shall leave them at liberty. If it allows them to remain in its territory it may assign them a place of residence.</I><BR>

<P><I>The same rule applies to prisoners of war brought by troops taking refuge in the territory of a neutral Power.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Article 14</I></B><BR>
<I>A neutral Power may authorize the passage over its territory of the sick and wounded belonging to the belligerent armies, on condition that the trains bringing them shall carry neither personnel nor war material. In such case, the neutral Power is bound to take whatever measures of safety and control are necessary for the purpose.</I><BR>

<P><I>The sick or wounded brought under these conditions into neutral territory by one of the belligerents, and belonging to the hostile party, must be guarded by the neutral Power so as to ensure their not taking part again in the military operations. The same duty shall devolve on the neutral State</I> <I>with regard to wounded or sick of the other army who may be committed to its care.</I><BR>

<P><B><I>Article 15</I></B><BR>
<I>The Geneva Convention applies to the sick and wounded interned in neutral territory [20].</TD></TR></TABLE>
</I><BR>

<P>These provisions, which pertain to both the law of war and the law of neutrality, have been applied on various occasions, notably during the two World Wars. The best-known case was that of the French 45th Army Corps, commanded by General Daille, which was encircled by the German armour of General Guderian just as the Army of the East had been by the Prussian infantry 70 years previously. Once again, the French were forced to seek refuge in Switzerland. On 18 June 1940, when Marshal P&eacute;tain had petitioned for an armistice and General de Gaulle launched his call for resistance from London, some 45,000 men, including 29,000 Frenchmen and Moroccans and 12,000 Poles who had enlisted in the French army, crossed the border a few kilometres to the north-east of Les Verri&egrave;res. While the French and Moroccans were repatriated in January 1941 under an agreement between Germany and Vichy France, the Poles remained interned in Switzerland until the end of the hostilities [21].<BR>

<P>
<P><I>&quot;The entire generation of Swiss citizens who witnessed this grim epilogue to a cruel war has kept an undying memory of the tragedy. Never before, in this fortunate country, had such a disaster been seen&quot;,</I> wrote Colonel &Eacute;douard Secretan by way of conclusion to his history of the Army of the East [22].<BR>

<P>Because the troops were scattered all over Switzerland, their pitiful state was plain to everyone and the public was profoundly moved. There was a tremendous surge of sympathy in the towns and villages through which the French soldiers had passed, and even more in the places where they were billeted while waiting to return to their homeland. During the first days of the internment this generosity was spontaneous, innumerable families unhesitatingly sharing with the troops the reserves of food and fodder they themselves needed to survive the winter. But the authorities and the Swiss Red Cross - founded four years previously - quickly mobilized to help the internees and provide them with the necessary food and medical care. Indeed, the reception of the &quot;Bourbakis&quot; was the first major aid operation conducted by the Swiss Red Cross [23].<BR>

<P>The impression made by the arrival of the French soldiers was so deep that many who witnessed the event sought to immortalize it in print and on canvas [24].<BR>

<P>In 1876, the entrepreneur Benjamin Henneberg decided to construct a panorama to depict the events at Les Verri&egrave;res and commissioned the Geneva artist &Eacute;douard Castres to do the painting. In 1880, the &quot;Soci&eacute;t&eacute; anonyme des Panoramas de Marseille, Lyon et Gen&egrave;ve&quot; undertook the construction of the building in Geneva. The rotunda was of an impressive size: 40 metres in diameter and 28 metres in height. The panorama which covered the inside wall was 14 metres high [25].<BR>

<P>&Eacute;douard Castres was the obvious choice, not only because of his artistic talent but also because he had volunteered as a stretcher-bearer with the French Red Cross and had served in a mobile field hospital during the campaign of the Army of the East. On 1 February 1871 he had found himself at Les Verri&egrave;res both as a participant in and as a witness to the tragedy that befell his companions in arms [26]. The vast circular panorama he created, covering 1,100 square metres, immortalized the ordeal of the French troops at the moment when they were crossing the Swiss frontier to be disarmed.<BR>

<P>The panorama was inaugurated on 24 September 1881. <I>&quot;The illusion is complete [...] and the whole effect is remarkable&quot;</I>, wrote the <I>Journal de Gen&egrave;ve</I> at the time [27].<BR>

<P>The <I>Panorama des Verri&egrave;res </I>remained on show in Geneva until 1889. It was then moved to Lucerne where it can still be seen [28]. We owe a debt of gratitude to the committee formed to preserve the panorama and also to the authorities of the city and canton of Lucerne who recently allocated funds for the restoration of this exceptional work. It is the last vestige of a form of artistic expression which flourished in the 19th century but has now long since disappeared and, at the same time, it is a moving testimony to the unspeakable suffering that every war leaves in its wake.<BR>

<P>23. Unfortunately, as far as we know there is no general report covering all the activities of the Swiss Red Cross in connection with the arrival of the Army of the East. However, we do have the report of the Neuch&acirc;tel branch which, because of its geographical location, was the first to come to the assistance of the internees. This describes the arrangements which were made on an ad hoc basis during the initial passage of the troops and which became increasingly well-organized as the weeks went by: kitchens were set up to provide hot meals for soldiers passing through; the infirmaries were opened to tend the sick and wounded awaiting evacuation to hospital; both the sick and the able-bodied were accommodated in public buildings and private homes; food, clothing, fodder, firewood, etc. were distributed. Soci&eacute;t&eacute; suisse de Secours aux Militaires bless&eacute;s, Neuch&acirc;tel branch, <I>Rapport g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</I>, 1 July 1871, Imprimerie James Attinger, Neuch&acirc;tel, 1871.<BR>

<P>25. <I>Ibid.</I>, pp. 15-16. The panorama was a mode of artistic expression which enjoyed a great vogue during the second half of the 19th century. It consisted of a circular building in the form of a rotunda, the inside wall of which was covered by a circular canvas depicting a landscape or some great historical event and designed to create an illusion of depth. The floor and ceiling were similarly decorated so that the visitor, entering the panorama by an underground passage and a spiral staircase giving access to an elevated platform in the centre of the rotunda, felt himself suddenly transported into the middle of the scene depicted. Many Western European cities had their own panoramas and the companies which operated them would circulate the canvases from one town to another. This mode of expression foreshadowed the cinema, the medium which eventually supplanted it. A few of the rotundas have survived and been converted into theatres, a good example being the &quot;Rotonde des Champs-Elys&eacute;es&quot;. To the best of our knowledge, the only panorama which has remained continuously on show since its creation is that of Les Verri&egrave;res in Lucerne. According to contemporary accounts, it was also the finest of them all.<BR>

<H2>The Paul Reuter Prize</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>The Paul Reuter Fund was created in 1983 thanks to a donation made to the ICRC by the late Paul Reuter, Honorary Professor at the University of Paris and member of the <I>Institut de droit international</I>. The Fund's purpose is twofold: its income is used to encourage a work or an undertaking in the field of international humanitarian law and its dissemination, and to finance the <I>Paul Reuter Prize</I>.<BR>

<P>The Paul Reuter Prize, in the amount of 2,000 Swiss francs, is awarded for a major work in the sphere of international humanitarian law.<BR>

<P>The prize has been awarded four times so far: it was first awarded in 1985 to Mr Mohammed El Kouh&egrave;ne, Doctor of Laws, for his doctoral thesis entitled &quot;Les garanties fondamentales de la personne en droit humanitaire et droits de l'homme&quot;. The second award was made in 1988 to Ms Heather A. Wilson, Doctor of Laws, for her thesis entitled &quot;International Law and the Use of Force by National Liberation Movements&quot;. In an exceptional decision, there were two recipients of the prize in 1991: Mr Edward K. Kwakwa, Doctor of Laws, for his thesis entitled &quot;Trends in the International Law of Armed Conflict: Claims relating to Personal and Material Fields of Application&quot;, and Mr Alejandro Valencia Villa, a lawyer, for his book &quot;La humanizaci&oacute;n de la guerra: la aplicaci&oacute;n del derecho internacional humanitario al conflicto armado en Colombia&quot;. The most recent award, in 1994, was to Professor Eric David, of the Free University of Brussels, for his work &quot;Principes de droit des conflits arm&eacute;s&quot;.<BR>

<P><B>The prize will be awarded for the fifth time in February 1997.</B><BR>

<P>In accordance with the Regulations of the Paul Reuter Fund, the works submitted must fulfil the following conditions:<BR>

<P>-	they must be aimed at improving knowledge or understanding of international humanitarian law;<BR>

<P>-	they must either be still unpublished or have been published recently, in 1995 or 1996.<BR>

<P>Applications may be submitted in English, French or Spanish, and must include:<BR>

<P>- a brief curriculum vitae;<BR>
 <BR>
- a list of the applicant's publications;<BR>
 <BR>
- three unabridged copies of the work submitted to the Commission.<BR>

<P>Authors who meet the above requirements may send their applications no later than 15 September 1996 to<BR>

<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Le manque de fonds pour l'ann&eacute;e en cours est un sujet de pr&eacute;occupation pour le CICR. Il manque encore 54 millions de francs suisses (41 millions dollars US) pour clore les comptes de 1996 sans d&eacute;ficit. En outre, des promesses de dons, se montant &agrave; 60 millions de francs suisses et non encore vers&eacute;s, doivent encore &ecirc;tre honor&eacute;es. Si les donateurs ne r&eacute;agissent pas imm&eacute;diatement pour combler cet &eacute;cart, le CICR se verra sans doute confront&eacute; &agrave; une situation financi&egrave;re sans pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent &agrave; la fin de l'ann&eacute;e.

<H2>A note from the Editor</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>Last year, international humanitarian law experts gave special thought to Fyodor Fyodorovich Martens (1845-1909) on the 150th anniversary of his birth. The Review is pleased to include in this issue an article about that renowned authority on international law. It is written by Professor Vladimir Pustogarov, a well-known Russian scholar whose works include a biography of Martens (as yet available only in Russian). The Review also hopes that publication of his article will pave the way for a further extension of its relations with the Russian-speaking world.<BR>

<P>The Review Conference of the 1980 United Nations Weapons Convention, which ended on 3 May last, produced two specific results. Louise Doswald-Beck reports on the development and scope of the new Protocol IV prohibiting the use of blinding laser weapons in war, a very commendable achievement. The other, less commendable, result of the Review Conference is dealt with by Peter Herby in his report on the revision of Protocol II on mines, and the failure of the representatives of the States party to the Convention to agree on a satisfactory text. As a result of their failure, the law still provides civilians in particular with no effective protection against the scourge of those cruel devices.<BR>

<P>In his article, Paul Berman describes the organization and work of the ICRCs new Advisory Service on international humanitarian law, set up to help implement the recommendations of the 1993 Conference for the Protection of War Victims and thereby promote greater compliance with the Geneva Conventions in all armed conflicts.<BR>

<P>Finally, it is the Reviews sad duty to report the killing of three ICRC delegates on 4 June last in Burundi, when an ICRC convoy came under fire. Three young men who sought to bring some small measure of humanity to that tormented country paid for their dedication with their lives. The ICRC has had to suspend its work in Burundi, as the red cross emblem obviously no longer provides the guarantee of protection essential for its delegates activities. A lamentable fact in a lamentable situation.<BR>

<H2>Fiftieth Anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P>The fiftieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp was held on 2627 January 1995. Attending the ceremonies at Krakow and Auschwitz were several hundred survivors of the camp, representatives of associations of former deportees, 19 heads of State and numerous distinguished guests, including Mr Elie Wiesel and Mrs Simone Veil.<BR>
	Invited in its capacity as Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the ICRC was represented at these ceremonies by its President, Mr Cornelio Sommaruga; Mrs Liselotte Kraus-Gurny, a member of the Committee; Mr Charles Biedermann, Director of the International Tracing Service; Mr Fran&ccedil;ois Bugnion, Deputy Director for Principles, Law and Relations with the Movement, and Ms Ewa Tuszynski, interpreter.<BR>
	On 26 January, Mr Biedermann and Mr Bugnion attended a formal meeting of the Senate of the Jagiellonian University of Krakow, which marked the opening of the ceremonies. First was an address by the rector of the University on the subject of academic responsibility in seeking truth and fostering tolerance. Afterwards, the President of Poland, Mr Lech Walesa, and other dignitaries spoke on various topics, with particular emphasis on the vital importance of respect for one's fellow human beings, tolerance, and the importane of preserving the memory of the Holocaust while avoiding any revisionist changes.<BR>
	That afternoon, Mr Sommaruga and Mrs Kraus-Gurny attended a meeting of delegation leaders, including several heads of State, convened by Mr Walesa to approve the text of an appeal for peace and tolerance that was to be made the following day at Auschwitz-Birkenau. During the meeting, which was held at Wawell, the Krakow Royal Palace, the ICRC President pointed out that the ICRC was taking part in these ceremonies to pay tribute to the memory of all victims, and to express its admiration of and solidarity with the survivors of Auschwitz. &quot;I say it with humility, aware of the possible omissions and mistakes of the Red Cross in the past,&quot; he added. Mr Sommaruga also called for the development of a society based on tolerance and solidarity.<BR>
	On Friday 27 January, commemorative ceremonies were held at Auschwitz-Birkenau in the presence of many distinguished guests, including 19 European heads of State, representatives of Jewish organizations and associations of former victims of persecution, as well as several hundred former deportees.<BR>
	Participants first went to Auschwitz I, where they passed through a gate above which the words <I>Arbeit macht frei</I> [&quot;Work makes you free&quot;] were written in iron letters. A wreath was placed between Blocks 10 and 11, in front of the wall where the executions took place.<BR>
	The main ceremonies were held in front of the Monument of Nations at Auschwitz-Birkenau, at the end of the railway where trains carrying deportees stopped.<BR>
	Prayers were offered in keeping with Jewish, Catholic, Orthodox, Reformed and Islamic tradition, followed by an address by Baron Goldstein, President of the International Auschwitz Committee. Testimonies were then given by Mr S. Ryniak, a former deportee (registered under No. 31, he was the oldest surviving deportee), Mr S. Weiss, Speaker of the Knesset of the State of Israel, Mr Wiesel, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and Mr Walesa. The predominant note sounded by these speakers was an appeal for tolerance.<BR>
	Wreaths bearing the colours of each of the 31 countries whose citizens had been exterminated at Auschwitz were then placed at the site.<BR>
	At the end of the ceremonies, thousands of candles were lit and placed along the railway as a tribute to the countless victims of Nazi persecution.<BR>

<P>	Auschwitz symbolizes the most heinous crime ever committed in the history of mankind. For the Jewish people, it was an unprecedented tragedy, the extreme expression of the Hitler regime's attempt to annihilate them through genocide. For over one million men, women and children, it marked the final phase of an unspeakable ordeal. Of the victims, 90 per cent were Jews; the others were Romanies, Soviet prisoners of war, and members of the Resistance, the Polish intelligentsia and the clergy. There were a mere 7,500 survivors.<BR>
	Auschwitz also represents the greatest failure in the history of the ICRC, aggravated by its lack of decisiveness in taking steps to aid the victims of persecution.<BR>
	By its presence at these ceremonies, the ICRC wished to show its awareness of the terrible wounds inflicted, and of the need to keep the memory of these events alive in order to protect victims from a second death $ that of being forgotten.<BR>

<H2>Books and reviews: &quot;Conflictos armado internos y derecho internacional humanitario&quot;</H2>
<P><I>By Araceli Mangas Mart&iacute;n</I>
<P>
<P>Reviewed by Mar&iacute;a Teresa Dutli<BR>

<P>Although great strides have been made in developing the legal rules governing relations among States, the international community today is gravely concerned with the problem posed by the proliferation of non-international armed conflicts. The author of this study [1] analyses the phenomenon of violence within the confines of a State in relation to the application of international humanitarian law.<BR>

<P>As the number of armed conflicts in the world has increased in recent years, so has the number of publications devoted to the discussion of humanitarian law. However, few of them approach the subject solely from the point of view of the rules applicable to internal armed conflicts. One of the main interests of this study is no doubt the fact that it helps to fill this gap by providing an in-depth analysis of this aspect of the law and thereby promotes a better understanding of it. <BR>

<P>After reviewing the major internal armed conflicts which have taken place in the world since 1945, the author points out that never before in the history of mankind have there been as many conflicts of this type, and of such varied duration and intensity, as there are today.<BR>

<P>The study advances ideological extremism, religious, racial and cultural fanaticism and local social and economic factors as the major causes of the increase in internal armed conflicts. Taking into account this reality, it then discusses the rules of international humanitarian law which are intended to make these situations less inhuman. It is well known that internal armed conflicts are far more ruthless than war between States.<BR>

<P>In summarizing the historical development of the international rules governing internal armed conflicts, taking as a starting point the work of the Salamanca school of theologians and jurists and of E. de Vattel, the author concentrates mainly on recent codification of the law. In particular, she points to the initiatives by the ICRC which led to the adoption by International Conferences of the Red Cross of resolutions that form the basis of current codification in this area. One of the most valuable aspects of the study is its in-depth analysis of the codification process which led to the adoption of Article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and of their Additional Protocol II of 1977. A detailed examination is made of the discussions on proposals for humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts which took place during the 1949 and 1977 Diplomatic Conferences.<BR>

<P>The study's interest lies not only in its thorough analysis of every aspect of the law applicable in internal armed conflicts, but also in its examination of the implementation of that law in present conflicts. The study draws, among other sources, on Annual Reports of the ICRC and on various positions adopted by the institution.<BR>

<P>Included in this examination is a discussion of the distinction between internal armed conflicts and international armed conflicts and, within the former, of the various areas of practical application of humanitarian law, which are determined by the seriousness of the situation, the general nature of the rules governing internal armed conflicts and the legal character of humanitarian law. Also examined are the provisions on protection included in the law and the entire question of monitoring its implementation. <BR>

<P>Araceli Mangas Mart&iacute;n's thorough study, with its extensive bibliography, is particularly relevant today when the international community is faced with so many internal armed conflicts. It will no doubt provide the reader with a great deal of information and food for thought. <BR>

<H2>Now back in Liberia, ICRC calls for fundamental reappraisal (22 April 1996)</H2>
<P><I></I>
<P>
<P><I>The Review does not normally report on the ICRC's operational activities in various regions of the world. Situations are constantly changing and news  including press reports  rapidly becomes outdated. Nevertheless, from time to time the Review would like to publish an ICRC press release or other text dealing with an operational matter which is of more than immediate interest or can serve as an example.</I><BR>

<P>
<P>Two delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) arrived in Monrovia from Freetown on Sunday 21 April aboard a helicopter loaded with emergency supplies. The main task of the two delegates, who spent the night outside the city centre, is to support volunteers from the Liberia National Red Cross Society in their work to identify the most pressing needs of the country's people.<BR>

<P>This mission has begun eight days after the ICRC delegation's premises, in the Mamba Point neighbourhood, were looted and the delegates were consequently withdrawn. In the present situation there are no plans to base an ICRC team in Monrovia. Working with the ICRC's local Liberian employees and using those vehicles that it has proved possible to recover, the Red Cross will endeavour to take the injured to the city's hospitals and to collect the dozens of bodies that are strewn around the streets, presenting a serious health hazard. <BR>

<P>The ICRC feels that the present needs can be met only through a large-scaleoperation, but that no such operation can be carried out unless steps are taken to ensure the safety both of the victims and of those coming to their aid. The humanitarian agencies' supplies, equipment and vehicles have been regularly and systematically stolen and used to increase the means at the disposal of the warring factions.<BR>

<P>In view of the fact that the civilian population has been spared no suffering or humiliation over the past six years - and in particular since the present fighting started on 6 April - the ICRC feels that a thorough reappraisal is needed. It therefore calls on the community of States to take into account the particular nature of this type of conflict in its urgent search for ways to restore order and stability. <BR>

<P>ICRC, <I>Press Release No. 96/15</I><BR>
22 April 1996<BR>

<H1>Scientific Programs at the NREL</H1>
<HR>
<P>
Current research at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory focuses on seven themes:
the long-term response of ecosystems to global change, the functioning of agricultural
ecosystems, linkages between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems, the interactions
of plants and animals, the role of humans in ecosystems, the synthesis and modeling
of knowledge gained from ecosystem studies and soil biodiversity.  Each of these
programs incorporates the
strength of an interdisciplinary approach to dealing with complex problems.  Programs
will continue to emerge at NREL as research shows the need for incorporating new 
disciplines and technologies and as synthesis of research results and scholarship
generates new perspectives on environmental problems.

<h2><blink><A name="spotlight"><H2>Spotlight on
Science</H2></A></blink></h2>
<h3>Featuring:  Elisabeth Holland - NCAR/ACD &amp; NREL</h3>
Beth Holland is a member of the Global Modeling Group of the Atmospheric Chemistry Division
of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and a research scientist affiliated with
NREL.  Beth is currently working on bio-atmospheric nitrogen deposition on terrestrial carbon
uptake and the importance of NO emitted from soils to atmospheric chemistry.  Some of her
papers are  listed in the NREL News Notes Publications Section.  Beth was recently awarded the
Directorship of a NATO Advanced Study Institute on "Soils and Global Change:  Trace Gases,
the Carbon Cycle and Hydrology" to be held at the Chateau de Bonas, France, June 16-17, 1997. 
As she puts it, "the NATO ASI and my affiliations with NREL, CSU and CU give me all sorts of
opportunities to interact with students which I love." <p>

Beth is a true NREL product.  She started working at NREL with Dave Coleman and Bill Parton
in 1980 as an undergraduate research assistant on a belowground project.  Her first research
project was on "Dew formation influences on soil respiration."  Since 1982 when Beth received
her B.S. in Zoology at CSU, she has gone on to lead a varied and successful research career.  She
did research on interactions between litter placement, bacterial vs. fungal decomposition and soil
organic matter stabilization for her MS in Agronomy with Dave Coleman, Ken Doxtader and Bill
Parton (1985).  In 1988, Beth received her Ph.D. in Rangeland Ecosystem Science, working on
how herbivory influences on plant carbon allocation affected nitrogen cycling as part of the Wind
Cave Project with Jim Detling.  She still credits Vern Cole and his argumentative style for
providing the training and practice needed for persistence in science.  <p>

In September 1988, Beth left NREL for a Stanford post-doctoral fellowship with Hal Mooney
and Peter Vitousek.  Stanford was an amazing contrast with NREL.  Stanford discussions were
intense and required an instant in depth analyses of the issues while scientific discussions at NREL
could go on for weeks.  At Stanford, Beth worked on nitrogen cycling in a serpentine grassland
and began her involvement with the NSF-funded Jasper Ridge CO2 project with Chris Field, Terry
Chapin and Hal Mooney.  In late 1989, Beth returned to Colorado to work at NCAR.  <p>

Two aspects of the NREL experience have served Beth particularly well:  (1) the emphasis on
modeling and truly quantitative analysis and (2) the willingness to tackle interdisciplinary
problems with the critical thought and in- depth analysis that they deserve.  <p>

We are pleased to highlight another of our outstanding scientists.  <p>

<p>

<blink><h2><A name="announce"><H2>Announcements</H2></A></blink></h2>
Dave Swift was presented an award for "Outstanding Professor 1995-1996" by the Rangeland
Ecosystem Science Department.  Congratulations, David, Nice Job!!<p>

David Valentine has accepted a tenure track position in Forest Soils in the School of Agriculture and Land
Resources Management at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.  This will enable him to stay in the same town
as his daughter, Kirsten, who will be moving to Fairbanks this fall.  The University of Oklahoma understood
the situation and has graciously released Dave from his commitment there this fall.  Dave and By will be
leaving for Alaska around August 1 and his job begins September 1, 1996.  His time will be split, 60%
research, 30% teaching, and 10% service.  He will be teaching 2 courses per year, one in undergraduate forest
soils (junior level) and the other a graduate course of his choice.  Dave and By will indeed be missed at NREL
and we all wish you a great deal of success in your new job!<p>

Geneva Chong recently returned from Honduras where she worked with the Partnership for Biodiversity in
the Mosquitia (or Mosquito Coast).  She evaluated a butterfly farm in the Rio Platano Biosphere Reserve that
was started by the Peace Corps, San Diego Zoological Society and MOPAWI (a Honduran non-governmental
organization).  She had a fantastic time, and hopes her recommendations will help the farm meet its goals of
ecological and economic sustainability.  <p>

The PROGRAM and ABSTRACTS for the 1996 combined Ecological Society of America,
Society of Conservation Biology, Association for Tropical Biology, American Association of
Naturalists, and International Society of Ecological Modeling Annual Meeting were sent to Allen
Press for printing and publication.  A million thanks go out to the NREL Production staff:  Becky
Techau, Melissa Baker, Amy Whitehead, Shauna Bowler, Michelle Nelson, Suzy Lutz and Brian

<blink><h2><A name="grants"><H2>Grants Funded</H2></A></blink></h2>
<p>

<h4>National Science Foundation</h4>
Diana Freckman and Bob Niles received word that their proposal titled "Nematode Biodiversity in
Ecosystems Stressed by Extremes of Temperature" was funded by NSF/DEB for $100,000.  This
is an 18 month project which is to conduct an extensive survey of soil nematodes inhabiting
ecosystems in the western United States stressed areas.  Nematodes will be surveyed from the
Chihuahuan Desert [Jornada Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site] and the transition
zone of the Chihuahuan Desert, Great Basin, and shortgrass steppe (Sevilleta LTER). 
Nematodes, their descriptions, and site data will be organized in a relational database that will be
accessible on the Internet and WWW.  <p>

<p>

<h4>U.S. Department of Agriculture</h4>
Deb Coffin (NREL and Rangeland Ecosystem Sciences) and George Beck (Plant Pathology and
Weed Science) were recently funded by the USDA/ National Research Initiative Competitive
Grants Program for the project titled "Invasion of Rangeland by Aggressive Perennial Weeds: 
Ecology and Management."  The goal of the project is to predict the environmental conditions
under which the aggressive, perennial weed, Russian knapweed, maintains its dominance through
time and the conditions where native vegetation returns to dominance as a result  of succession. 
The project will use experimental studies and simulation modeling to evaluate the short- and long-term effects of soil texture and precipitation on invasion dynamics of Russian knapweed in
rangelands of Colorado.  The three-year project will start July 1, 1996 and was funded at
$387,500. <p>

Diana Freckman was funded by USDA/Research, Education and Economics, for "Evaluation
Study Proposal."  The 1-year grant will consist of 2 meetings:  1 at NREL and 1 at the
Smithsonian Institute and will bring administrators of USDA, scientists and economists in a think-tank for The Bioregional Research Meeting.  <p>

<p>

<h4>National Biological Service</h4>
A proposal titled "Epizootiology of Brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone Area:  A
Comprehensive Stochastic Model" was funded by the NBS-State Partnership Program for 18
months at $20,800.  PI's are T. Kreeger (Wyoming Fish and Game), M. Miller (Colorado Division
of Wildlife), J. Gross (NREL), and S. Anderson (University of Wyoming).  This project will use
an individual-based model to simulate the dynamics of brucellosis in elk, bison, and cattle. 
Simulations will be used to evaluate the potential consequences of management actions including
vaccination and removals, and to identify aspects of the disease that are inadequately understood.  <p>

<H2>The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory: Interdisciplinary Research in a
University Setting</H2>

Improving our understanding of the ecological complexity of the world we live
in increasingly requires us to ask questions that can only be answered by bringing
a wide range of skills to bear on them. Advances in our knowledge of ecological
relationships and our ability to put that knowledge to work to solve practical
problems will depend more and more upon research that integrates the perspectives
and techniques of several disciplines. The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory
(NREL), an ecosystem research center that will celebrate its 30th anniversary in
1997, has a long tradition of bringing scientists from different disciplines
together to examine complicated ecological problems. Originally focused on the
grasslands of the western United States, research at NREL today spans the globe
and contributes to the scientific basis for understanding the interactions that
sustain our environment, locally, regionally and globally.<P>
A unique feature of the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory among ecosystem
  centers is its position as an interdisciplinary research institute in a
  university setting. Organized as a research unit within the College of Natural
  Resources at Colorado State University, NREL cuts across disciplinary and
  structural divisions. Some of its scientists are affiliated entirely with NREL.
  Others have joint appointments with university departments, and some are
  employees of federal or state agencies. They come together in an environment
  that minimizes disciplinary boundaries and enhances creative thought.
  Researchers and students at NREL include organism ecologists, biogeochemists,
  computer scientists, modelers and atmospheric scientists who work together to
  address complex local, national and global problems. The laboratory's new
  facility in the recently completed Natural and Environmental Sciences Building
  features state-of-the-art computer facilities, geographic information systems
  (GIS) and the newest technology for chemical and physical analysis to support
  these collaborations.<P>

The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory contributes to Colorado State University's
  mission of teaching, research and service. Our scientists play key roles in
  academic departments by teaching and serving as mentors for future scientists.
  The broad range of laboratory and field experiences that they provide for
  students contributes to the training of a new generation of scientists committed
  to working in an interdisciplinary fashion to solve environmental problems.
  Through their work in our community schools as well as through the involvement
  of high school students, undergraduates and volunteers in the daily activities
  of the laboratory, NREL staff members share their excitement about science and
  ecosystems with students of all ages and contribute to a scientifically
  knowledgeable public.<P>
Current research at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory focuses on five
  themes: the long-term response of ecosystems to global change, the functioning
  of agricultural ecosystems, linkages between the atmosphre and terrestrial
  ecosystems, the interactions of plants and animals, the role of humans in
  ecosystems, and the synthesis and modeling of knowledge gained from ecosystem
  studies. Each of the essays to follow illustrates not only the strengths of an
  interdisciplinary approach to dealing with complex questions, but also the
  importance of basic research in the search for solutions to the environmental
  problems that face Colorado, the nation and the world. Programs will continue
  to emerge at NREL as research shows the need for incorporating new disciplines
  and technologies and as synthesis of research results and scholarship generates
  new perspectives on environmental problems. These essays, written in the spirit
  of scientific collaboration by those who are involved in the programs, stress
 the achievements of interdisciplinary research at the Natural Resource Ecology
Laboratory.<P>

<TITLE>NREL Brochure:  Introduction to the NREL</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>
<A NAME="introduction"><H2>Introduction to the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory</H2></A>
The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), a part of Colorado State
University in Fort Collins, Colorado, is dedicated to the study of ecological
systems and to the application of scientific knowledge to the preservation and
management of natural resources. NREL is an interdisciplinary research center
within the university's College of Natural Resources. The 35 scientists who
comprise the laboratory's senior staff represent a range of disciplines in the
biological, physical and social sciences; our collaborative research focuses on
ecosystems. Research programs are funded primarily by grants and contracts from
federal and state agencies with additional support from private corporations.<P>
Situated at the edge of the foothills that mark the boundary between the Rocky
  Mountains and the rangelands and croplands of the Great Plains, NREL was
  established in 1967 to administer the multidisciplinary Grassland Biome Study
  of the International Biological Program (IBP). Over the years since that study
  was completed, the scope of research at NREL has expanded to include projects
  on every continent and topics ranging from the soil microbial dynamics
  associated with the grazing of bison to global-scale studies of climate change
  and its impact on the terrestrial carbon cycle. Despite the diversity of study
  sites, scales and topics, the ecosystems approach to research questions runs as
  a common thread throughout our work.<P>
Ecologists traditionally studied individual organisms and their interactions with
  each other and with their environment. Early ecosystems studies focused instead
  on the flux of energy and materials among components of systems rather than on
  the components themselves. Research at NREL has improved our ability to
  penetrate the complexities of ecosystems by linking the dynamics of elements
  such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the biota, the soils and ultimately
  the atmosphere. George Van Dyne, first director of NREL, recognized the
  importance of bringing together researchers with diverse knowledge to work in
  interdisciplinary teams in order to address the ecosystem-level problems facing
  managers of natural resources. Clear understanding of the complex interactions
  that characterize whole ecosystems is required if we are to devise management
  strategies for the conservation and use of natural resources that will assure
  the long-term viability of the biosphere.<P>
Systems-level studies of these complx interactions require a wide range of
  knowledge, skills and tools. NREL scientists have been pioneers in the
  development and use of mathematical models that aid researchers in assimilating,
  organizing and understanding the large amounts of data and information needed
  to describe complex biological systems. Such models not only assist in the
  organization of research but also provide a means of testing our understanding
  of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. Ecosystem-level models have
  become important tools for managers charged with making decisions about natural
  resources. Models that were developed at NREL, such as Century, are widely used
  to test the implications of various management and climate-change scenarios.<P>
Several basic themes that are common to the research efforts undertaken at NREL
  are critical to the development of ecological theory. Some of the initial
  impetus to pursue these themes comes from the unanswered questions arising from
  the IBP research. But the pursuit has been spurred as well by the practical
  quest for a better understanding of how human activities modify the environment
  and for ways of resolving the conflict between sustaining the biosphere and
  addressing human needs.<p>
These themes include the long-term response of ecosystems to change, linkages
  between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere, interactions between plants
  and animals, the structure and functioning of agricultural ecosystems, and the
  human contribution to ecosystem dynamics. The essays that follow describe
  various NREL studies that reflect these themes. These essays articulate some of
  the fundamental characteristics of our research philosophy. Critical linkages
  across sub-disciplinary boundaries provide the starting point of our research
  endeavors. Scientists at NREL are engaged in defining and understanding the
  connections between the processes that are important at one level of biological
  organization, such as the individual organism, and those that are important at
  other levels, such as populations, communities or whole ecological systems.<P>
We are now applying the ecosystem approach to new challenges. They include:<P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>Incorporating human activity into the study of ecosystems;
  <LI>Determining the role of biodiversity and biotic conservation in ecosystem
dynamics at various scales;
  <LI>Assessing potential risks to the sustainability of ecosystems;
  <LI>Studying the effects of global change on ecosystems and the ways in which
ecosystems modify these changes.
</UL>
<P>
Our scientific activities and findings over the years speak to our commitment to
developing a better understanding of the ecosystems that support us and a greater
appreciation of the earth that we inhabit.<P>
<P>
<B>Organization and Activities<P>
</B>Although it has many ties to departments of the College of Natural Resources
at Colorado State University, NREL is organized as a research unit rather than as
an academic department. Staff members are housed primarily in a single facility
equipped with laboratories and computer facilities where specialists are available
to assist the research efforts. NREL scientists train graduate students and
postdoctoral investigators, and many staff members have teaching appointments in
university departments. In 1992 and again in 1995, the university designated NREL
as a Program of Research and Scholarly Excellence, recognizing its local, national
and international contributions to ecosystem research and education.<P>
<P>
This ability to reach across academic disciplines has enabled the laboratory to
extend its efforts to conduct research in collaboration with numerous state and
federal agencies, both nationally and internationally. In cooperation with the
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service and the
university's departments of Forest Science and Rangeland Ecosystem Science, NREL
participates in a field research site in the Central Plains Experimental Range
(CPER). This site became part of the National Science Foundation's Long-Term
Ecological Research (LTER) program in 1982. NREL scientists conduct a wide variety
of studies at this site that focus on such topics as plant-animal interactions,
soil biotic processes, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, the formation
of soils and the response of grasslands productivity to climate variation and
land-use changes.<P>
Research at NREL on grassland and agricultural ecosystems has expanded from the
  original focus on the semiarid shortgrass steppe of the Great Plains to include
  networks representing the entire central United States and as well as studies
  in regions of Mongolia, China and East Africa. NREL scientists also carry out
  research projects in the alpine and subalpine ecosystems of the Rocky Mountains,
  in the arctic and sub-arctic ecosystems of Alaska, Canada and northern Europe
  and in the dry valleys of Antarctica as well as several tropical countries.<p>
NREL researchers have assumed an ever-increasing role in the application of
  scientific knowledge to the formulation of environmental policy and the solution
  of management problems. Collaborative projects have been established with a
  number of agencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Department of
  Interior and Environmental Protection Agency as well as the Colorado Division
  of Wildlife. Research efforts at home and abroad provide educational
  opportunities for students and environmental solutions for natural resource
  managers as well as addressing basic scientific questions.<P>
Scientists at the NREL also participate in the work of national and international
  committees, such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that are
  addressing the effects of climate change, acid deposition, elevated carbon
  dioxide levels, land degradation, deforestation, ultraviolet radiation and the
  loss of biodiversity. Staff members have been invited to brief government
  officials, legislators and resource managers on a variety of environmental
  issues.<P>
NREL staff members are regularly asked to serve on a wide variety of governmental
  and non-governmental committees, including boards and panels of the National
  Science Foundation, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the
  Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National
  Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Research Council and the
  National Academy of Sciences. One senior scientist has recently completed a term
  as president of the American Institute of Biological Sciences and a member of
  the board of the Association of Ecosystem Research Centers; another served as
  director of the Sustainable Biosphere Program. Several NREL scientists ar
  members of committees and working groups of the Global Change and Terrestrial
  Ecosystems study, a core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere
  Programme. Many staff members serve on committees of the Ecological Society of
  America.<P>

<TITLE>NREL Brochure:  Long-Term Observations</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>

<A NAME="long-term"><H2>Long-Term Observations Yield Insight Into Ecosystem Responses To Climate Change</H2> </A>
Natural systems have rhythms and progressions over time that strongly
influence, if not dictate, the characteristics of individual components. Variation
in climate, periodic disturbances and internal community dynamics are all involved
in shaping ecosystems. Long-term observations are required in order to formulate
meaningful, testable hypotheses that describe and predict ecosystem responses to
changing conditions.<P>
Many research projects of the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) depend
  upon long-term observations. Studies begun in 1968 as part of the Grassland
  Biome Study continue today under the Shortgrass Steppe Long-Term Ecological
  Research (LTER) Program. Other long-term research efforts at NREL include the
  Loch Vale Watershed Long-Term Research and Monitoring Program (LVWS) and the
  National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), which monitors atmospheric
  deposition throughout the United States.<P>
<P>
<B>Shortgrass Steppe Long-Term Ecological Research<P>
</B>An example from the LTER program shows us how the time span of observations
can affect conclusions about the impact of climate variation on ecosystems. Four
years of data from the 1970s, collected during the Grassland Biome Study, suggest
that the annual net production of plants at the LTER site averages about 90 grams
per square meter (g/m2) but that large decreases can be expected as a result of
fluctuations in weather (Figure 1a). Twenty-one years of data from the Grassland
Biome Study and the LTER program lead to the same conclusion about average
production but different conclusions about the response to weather extremes
 (Figure 1b). If we extend the record back to 1939 using U.S. Forest Service and
Agricultural Research Service observations, however, long-term average production
over the 54-year period is 100 g/m<em sup>2</em>, and fluctuations can be as much as
60% in either direction (Figure 1c). Our understanding of ecosystem behavior is
thus linked to the length of record available for interpretation.
The goal of the Shortgrass Steppe LTER program since its beginning has been to
  understand the long-term processes that account for the origin and sstainability
  of shortgrass ecosystems. Three topics addressed by LTER researchers illustrate
  the relationship between this goal and specific research projects.<P>
<P>
<B>Development of Landscapes and Soils During the Holocene<P>
</B>The evolutionary history of the shortgrass steppe or grassland is preserved
in Holocene paleosols, buried soils formed in ancient landscapes that retain an
imprint of the climate and ecosystems prevailing during their formation. Gene
Kelly and Caroline Yonker of Colorado State University's Department of Soil and
Crop Science use the stable carbon isotopic composition of paleosol organic
matter, soil carbonate and opal phytoliths (silica deposits from grass leaves) to
characterize the vegetation of the era and make inferences about Holocene climate
change.<P>
Isotopic characterization of paleosol constituents led to the identification of
  three soil-forming intervals during the last 10,000 years. Cool-season C<em
  sub>3</em> grasses appear to have been the dominant vegetation in the early
  Holocene, during a period of cooler climates. They gave way during mid- and late
  Holocene soil-forming intervals to dominance by C<em sub>4</em> grasses, which
  process carbon dioxide more efficiently. Understanding paleosol formation, in
  the context of the geologic episodes that resulted in their burial, allows
  interpretation of the magnitude of ecological and landscape responses to climate
  variability.<P>
<P>
<B>Response of Dominant Plant Species to Disturbances<P>
<I></B>Bouteloua gracilis</I>, or blue grama grass, accounts for 70% to 90% of the
productivity of shortgrass ecosystems. Of all the grass species in the ecosystem,
it is most able to resist grazing and drought. As a consequence, blue grama is a
key species to consider in making management decisions, whether for conservation
or for sustainable livestock production. The prevailing view about blue grama at
the start of the LTER project was that this grass was a relict species,
established under climactic conditions that no longer existed. Researchers thought
that blue grama would never regrow once an area was disturbed. Over the past 13
years, field and modeling studies led by NREL scientists William Lauenroth, Debra
Coffin and Ingrid Burke have shown conclusively that blue grama does recover,
although slowly, after disturbance. Studies in abandoned fields have demonstrated
that the degree of recovery varies greatly from field to field, but that blue
grama has recovered to some degree in all of them. Because of the critical role
that blue grama plays in the sustainability of shortgrass ecosystems, these
results have important consequences for management of disturbed areas.<P>

<IMG SRC="pawnee.gif"><BR>

plant samples in an abandoned field. Photo by W.K. Lauenroth</I>

<P>
<B>Responses of the Ecosystem to Grazing<P>
</B>Large herbivores have been an important component of shortgrass ecosystems
 since the retreat of the Pleistocene glaciers and the start of the Holocene about
10,000 years ago. Cattle currently graze about 45% of the shortgrass steppe area,
and grazing will continue to be important because much of the land is marginal for
sustainable crop production. Long-term research conducted by Daniel Milchunas and
Lauenroth has established that grazing has a small effect on the plant species
composition and net primary productivity of the ecosystem. Invasions by exotic and
native weed species are more likely to occur, in fact, in ungrazed plots than in
 grazed ones. Burke has also established that soil organic matter pools and
nutrient availability are affected only slightly by grazing.<P>
We conclude from these results that shortgrass ecosystems are highly resistant to
  grazing. The plant species in the shortgrass steppe evolved under strong
  pressure from large herbivores and periodic drought. These forces favor plant
  species that have morphological and physiological adaptations to drought and
  grazing. They also result in ecosystems with more than 90% of their total
  organic matter in the soil.<P>

grasses. Photo by M. Lindquist
 </I>
<P>
<B>Loch Vale Watershed Research and Monitoring<P>
</B>Although the alpine and subalpine environment of the Loch Vale Watershed
(LVWS), located in Rocky Mountain National Park in the Front Range of the Colorado
Rockies, differs greatly from the shortgrass steppe, our approach to understanding
the structure and functioning of these ecosystems is similar. From its beginning
in 1980, LVWS research led by NREL scientist Jill Baron has addressed the problem
of differentiating the consequences of disturbance caused by human activity from
natural variation. One major focus is on understanding ecosystem responses to the
deposition of substances from the atmosphere.<P>
Research at Loch Vale began with paleohistorical studies designed to project the
  record of atmospheric deposition back to preindustrial times. Lake sediments
  preserve a record of substances that enter the atmosphere through industrial
  emissions and are deposited over the landscape. Metals and algal indicators of
  deposition found in these sediments provide the baseline for interpreting the
  results of long-term observations of precipitation and the chemical composition
  of surface waters. Interpretation of the sediment records has allowed us to
  conclude that the deposition of sulfate in rain and snow does not currently pose
  an ecological threat, but that the deposition of nitrate and ammonium may, in
  fact, be excessive for the maintenance of existing plant communities.<P>
We use deposition chemistry data, collected from the LVWS National Atmospheric
  Deposition Program site, in conjunction with data on the chemical composition
  of alpine and subalpine streams to construct an overall picture of the flux of
  major nutrients and pollutants into and out of the basin. These measurements are
  supplemented with in-depth studies of ecosystem processes. Examples include
  studies of hydrologic flows, including snow redistribution and melting patterns,
  nutrient cycling in wetlands and in old-growth forests dominated by Englemann
  spruce and subalpine fir, and the sources and fate of nitrogen and carbon in
  tundra, forests and lakes.<P>
Models are used in LVWS studies both to test hypotheses and to generate them. For
  example, Baron, Dennis Ojima and William Parton of the NREL and Elsabeth Holland
  of the National Center for Atmospheric Research used an application of the
  NREL's Century model to explore the possibility that high concentrations of
  nitrogen in lakes and streams in the watershed are the result of nitrogen
  saturation in alpine tundra and subalpine forest ecosystems. Current levels of
  nitrate and ammonium deposition from the atmosphere are many times greater than
  those of pre-industrial times, potentially providing terrestrial ecosystems with
  more nitrogen than plants and microbes can use. Simulation results suggest that
  nitrogen availability currently limits productivity in forests and that
  saturation has not occurred. But they also suggest that nitrogen no longer
  limits growth in the alpine tundra, and that nitrogen leached from this
  terrestrial source may be sufficient to account for the levels observed in
  streams (Figure 2). In conjunction with the Niwot Ridge LTER and U.S. Geological
  Survey Water, Energy and Biogeochemical Budgets projects, we are conducting a
  series of field experiments to test these model results and to confirm or refute
  the proposition that nitrogen saturation is an ongoing phenomenon in the Front
 Range.
<P>
<B>National Atmospheric Deposition Program<P>
</B>Both the LTER and LVWS studies rely on monitoring results from the National
Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP), an NREL program developed and led by James
Gibson. Organized in 1978, the NADP assumed responsibility for the federal
National Trends Network (NTN) in 1982. The combined program now has 200 sites
throughout the U.S. In order to assure the quality of the data, NREL staff member
David Bigelow established a quality assurance program for the NADP/NTN. Over the
years, the NADP has built a comprehensive, high-quality record of the geographical
patterns and temporal trends of chemical deposition in precipitation that is the
most comprehensive in the world.<P>
Originally organized in response to national concerns about the effects of acid
  precipitation, the program has provided policymakers with information not only
  on the geographical patterns and trends in acidic deposition, but also on the
  deposition of chemical nutrients. Framers of the 1990 revisions of the federal
  Clean Air Act made use of the NADP/NTN data set as they developed the new
  regulations. They will rely on these data in the future as they assess the
  effectiveness of the reduction in sulfur and nitrogen compounds called for in
  the 1990 amendments.<P>
<P>
<B>New Long-Term Research Programs</B><P>

Several new programs are increasing the scope of long-term research at NREL.
Gibson is developing a national program for the long-term measurement of
ultraviolet-B radiation to assess its potential effects on crops and forests.<P>

Jeffrey Welker, postdoctoral student Andrew Parsons and colleagues from the
  University of Colorado have begun a five-year study of the effects of changes
  in snow cover and summer temperatures on the structure and function of arctic
  ecosystems in Alaska. This project is part of the International Tundra
  Experiment (ITEX), which comprises a network of olar and alpine sites where
  similar studies are underway. Researchers are using both modeling simulations
  and natural gradients in snow cover to predict long-term consequences of changes
  in carbon and nitrogen dynamics in arctic ecosystems.<P>

<TITLE>NREL Brochure:  Agroecosystems</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>

<A NAME="agroecosystems"><H2>Agroecosystems: From Process Studies to Regional Assessments</H2></A>
Human beings practice agriculture, the cultivation of the soil to produce food
and fiber, over a significant portion of the land area of the earth. Agriculture
thus affects natural processes at every spatial scale, from local to global. In
the late 1970's, Vernon Cole and his coworkers at the Natural Resource Ecology
Laboratory (NREL) developed one of the first programs for studying agricultural
ecosystems (agroecosystems) to be funded by the National Science Foundation. Since
then, NREL scientists have focused on gaining a fundamental understanding of the
biogeochemical flows related to the dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) and the
cycling of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Studies of SOM in
agroecosystems and simulation analyses with the NREL's Century model have provided
a broad base of knowledge that is applicable to the dynamics of nutrients within
ecosystems in general. We are using this understanding to address ecosystem
questions at multiple scales of resolution in time and space.<p>
The approach that many NREL researchers use for dynamic regional ecosystem
  analysis is illustrated in a diagram developed by Edward Elliott and Cole in
  1989 (Figure 1). It makes use of models that depend upon knowledge derived from
  experimental studies and field observations of agroecosystem processes. These
  models are subsequently used to make large-scale and long-term projections of
  the ways in which changes in climate and management practices can influence
  ecosystem properties such as SOM content and primary production.<P>
Extrapolating from small-scale studies to assessments at the regional scale
  requires spatially explicit information on the variables, such as temperature,
  precipitation, soil texture and historical management practices, that regulate
  ecosystem processes. This information is organized into databases using
  geographic information system (GIS) programs. These databases provide input on
  these critical variables with which to run models for different locations across
  the landscape or region. Results from model simulations are then projected back
  onto the region from which the data were obtained.<P>
We evaluate model analyses by comparing simulations with data obtained from a
  network of sites covering the region over which projections are being made.
  Well-tested models used in conjunction with the appropriate
  geographically-organized databases are our best tools for investigating the ways
  in which land use, crop productivity and trace gas fluxes may be influenced by
  future changes in climate and management practices.<P>
Key to the success of our approach is the teamwork of researchers who study
  ecosystem processes, sample site networks, organize geographical databases and
  carry out modeling simulations. For example, NREL researchers including Elliott,
  William Hunt, John Moore, and other colleagues, established the importance of
  interactions among components of the underground foodwebs in accelerating the
  cycling of elements essential for plant growth. These scientists were the first
  to dmonstrate that soil fauna enhance the growth of plants and that soil
  structure controls trophic interactions (Figure 2) and their subsequent
  influence on nutrient dynamics. The concept of functional groups of soil biota
  that contribute to soil biogeochemistry was incorporated in model simulations,
  which predicted a significant role for soil fauna in soil fertility. Diana
  Freckman, Robert Niles, and their coworkers continue this soil ecology research
  in collaboration with other colleagues at Colorado State University.<P>

<IMG SRC="microb.gif"><BR>
<I>Figure 2: Microbial life in the soil is constrained by the soil structure, which
affects the ability of the organisms to move and feed. This figure depicts foodweb
interactions among key players in one square centimeter of grassland soil. Figure

</I><P>

The Century model, developed by William Parton, Cole and their coworkers at NREL,
  incorporates the concept of organic matter fractions with differing turnover
  times. Elliott and his students and colleagues have isolated fractions with
  laboratory techniques to separate the soil physically into its components. This
  approach is based on the premise that the structure of the soil, as expressed
  in the aggregation of soil particles and organic matter, is a primary factor
  controlling the accessibility of organic matter for soil organisms, its
  subsequent mineralization and the availability of nutrients in soil.<P>
Isolation of one of these physical fractions, particulate organic matter (POM),
  has stimulated a series of studies across the U.S. and around the world to
  examine this fraction as a major contributor to the long-term fertility of
  soils. POM seems to account for a greater proportion of total SOM dynamics than
  any previously isolated fraction. We are currently evaluating these methods on
  soils obtained around the world.<P>
In another project, Cole and other scientists at NREL are collaborating with Gary
  Peterson and Dwayne Westfall of the Colorado State University Soil and Crop
  Sciences Department in establishing long-term field experiments at three sites
  in eastern Colorado. These studies are designed to determine the feasibility of
  increased cropping frequency with reductions in bare fallow, ground that is kept
  bare during the growing season to trap water in the soil profile for the next
 growing season. Now in their twelfth year, these studies are showing that the new
cropping systems are economically superior and improve soil properties.<P>

<IMG SRC="plow.gif"><BR>
<I>Change in land use affects regional biodiversity and water and radiation budgets,
resulting in changes in soil productivity and trace gas emissions.
</I><P>

The Great Plains of the western U.S. provide a wonderful field laboratory for
  studies of the regional distribution of SOM. The region is a climatic
  checkerboard; temperature varies north to south, and precipitation, from east
  to west. Cole, Ingrid Burke and other investigators from NREL observed that the
  organic matter patterns found within the region, obtained through analysis of
  large databases of soil samples, were primarily accounted for by precipitation,
  temperature and soil texture. The researchers derived projections of SOM loss
  across the Great Plains for different soil textures by using regional climatic
  data as input for the Century model and comparing the output to existing data.
  They were able to obtain accurate predictions of SOM levels using only a few
  variables: climate, soil texture and the lignin content of plants.<P>
Burke also used geographically organized climate and soil texture data to derive
  SOM and plant productivity maps, first for northeastern Colorado and eventually
  for the central grassland region. Some results are shown in the first part of
  a figure that accompanies the article on atmosphere-ecosystem interactions in
  this report. The northeastern Colorado study showed that, while plant production
  was primarily controlled by precipitation, the texture of the soil was the
  predominant control over SOM. Results indicated that agricultural management
  practices over the last 50 years were likely to have had a far greater impact
  on SOM stores in the central grassland region than potential climate changes
  over a similar period. A modeling simulation conducted by Cole and Keith
  Paustian predicted, in fact, that the increasing trend of crop yields and
  adoption of no-till methods would render the Great Plains and the Corn Belt a
  significant sink for carbon from the atmosphere.<P>
NREL scientists are currently making regional assessments of the changes in soil
  carbon that may take place with alternative management scenarios for lands
  currently under the U.S. Conservaion Reserve Program (CRP), which subsidizes
  farmers for fields planted in grass. These analyses have contributed to the
  federal decision-making process. Such model predictions must be corroborated,
  however, if they are to be useful to policymakers.<P>
Regional databases are essential if we are to have confidence in projections made
  with models. Elliott and Paustian have brought together a network of sites and
  a group of collaborators in one of the largest long-term ecological experiments
  ever conducted on disturbance and biogeochemistry. The project includes more
  than 40 agricultural experimental sites, established by the U.S. Department of
  Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service and the Land Grant universities.
  These sites are located throughout the Great Plains and the Corn Belt.
  Preliminary analyses suggest that sequestration of soil carbon is enhanced when
  the flux of carbon into the soil is increased, and when soil disturbance is
  reduced. This effect appears to be greater in areas where precipitation is
  higher.<P>
Another important NREL network of sites developed by Burke and Debra Coffin
  consists of abandoned fields, reestablished as grasslands over periods of up to
  50 years, and their cultivated counterparts. Soil organic matter has increased
  significantly at many of these locations; the rate of increase is related to the
  texture of the soil and the climatic regime. These sites are being used to
  estimate the potential long-term impact of the CRP on SOM levels. Existing
  conservation reserve lands are currently being sampled as well.<P>

The agroecosystem science program at NREL has not only developed information
  useful for understanding agricultural ecosystems, it has also contributed to our
  fundamental knowledge of ecosystem biogeochemistry and organic matter dynamics.
  This knowledge contributes to our understanding of the impact of changes in both
 climate and management practices on agroecosystems over large areas and long time
periods, and it provides policymakers and managers with a scientifically sound
basis for making decisions.<P>

<A NAME="atmosphere"><H2>Ecology and Atmospheric Science: Studying the Interactions Between Ecosystems and the Atmosphere</H2></A>
Improvements in our understanding of ecological processes have played a major
role in the unraveling of important problems in the atmospheric sciences and
geophysics over the last decade. Earth scientists have observed increases in the
atmospheric concentrations of a number of biogenic trace gases during this period;
their observations have had, in turn, a massive impact on the practice of ecology.
Scientists at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), in collaboration
with colleagues at other laboratories, have become progressively more involved in
studying the interactions between ecosystems and the atmosphere as understanding
the effects of climate change has become a national and international priority.<P>
Ecologists have traditionally focused on understanding processes within
  ecosystems. They have attempted, in general, to identify scales of biological
  organization where external influences can be assumed to be weak relative to the
  effects of internal dynamics. Studies of ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, in
  contrast, focus on the relationship between atmospheric and ecological processes
  and on processes external to the ecosystem. These interactions can occur through
  the exchange of substances that have an influence on both ecosystems and the
  atmosphere. An example is water, which is exchanged through precipitation,
  evaporation and transpiration from plants. Because the spatial and temporal
  dynamics of precipitation have a profound influence on vegetation and soils,
  modeling the effects of precipitation on terrestrial ecosystems and on the
  exchange of water and energy between ecosystems and the atmosphere has become
  a major focus at NREL.<P>
Evaporation and transpiration, referred to collectively as evapotranspiration,
  have a reciprocal effect on atmospheric processes. The role of vegetation,
  topography and soils in regulating evapotranspiration and thus atmospheric
  processes has also been a major focus of modeling efforts among NREL scientists
  Jill Baron, Timothy Kittel, William Parton and David Schimel and collaborators
  such as Roger Pielke of the Atmospheric Sciences Department at Colorado State
  University and Steven Running of the University of Montana. Schimel, Parton,
  Kittel, Dennis Ojima, David Valentine and Ingrid Burke have also participated
  in large field programs that focused on transpiration. Among them was a study
  in the tallgrass prairie of Kansas that was supported by the National Aeronautic
  and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the International Satellite Land
  Surface Climatology Program. Ongoing projects have extended the range of
  questions asked about the exchange of water between ecosystems and the
  atmosphere. The South Platte Project, for example, focuses on the way topography
  and river systems redistribute water and thus alter the exchange with the
  atmosphere.<P>
Trace gases such as nitrous oxide (N<em sub>2</em>O), nitric oxide (NO), methane
  (CH<em sub>4</em>) and ammonia (NH<em sub>3</em>) are produced as by-products of the
  biogeochemical processes of decomposition and itrogen cycling. We can generally
  study the flux of elements in ecosystem-level processes such as primary
  production or carbon storage without needing to identify the gaseous emissions
  of nitrogen or carbon as discrete chemical compounds. The atmosphere, on the
  other hand, is affected by specific compounds in different ways. For example,
  N<em sub>2</em>O is a chemically inert but potent greenhouse gas. NO is one of the
  most potent reactive species of nitrogen controlling or regulating tropospheric
  ozone, itself a greenhouse gas. Former NREL student Elisabeth Holland and her
  coworkers at the National Center for
 Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder have found that NH3, while not directly
involved in the greenhouse effect, has a major effect on the pH of rain and may
influence global ecosystem carbon storage.<P>

Collaborative studies by Parton, Valentine, Schimel, Ojima and research associate
  William Pulliam of the NREL and Arvin Mosier of the U.S. Department of
  Agriculture have progressed from measurements of the exchange of trace gases
  between ecosystems and the atmosphere and studies of the controls on rates of
  production to modeling trace-gas exchanges on a regional scale. This group has
  recently developed models that predict the fluxes of nitrogen trace gases and
  the ratios of the various chemical species based on biophysical constraints on
  the microbial ecology of the nitrogen cycle. While the modeling of gas fluxes
  is an important part of developing nitrogen budgets, a traditional concern in
  ecology, modeling the ratios of chemical species is motivated by questions that
  arise in atmospheric chemistry.<P>

The study of atmosphere-ecosystem interactions has also stimulated a shift in the
  spatial scale of ecosystem field studies and modeling efforts. Environmental
  perturbations that modify the photochemistry of the atmosphere or the balance
  of energy can affect the atmosphere over areas ranging from tens to thousands
  of kilometers. The effects of long-lived, globally-distributed greenhouse gases
  such as carbon dioxide (CO<em sub>2</em>) or CH<em sub>4</em> can only be described in
  terms of global budgets because their effects on climate stem from changes in
  global concentrations. In the late 1970s, Mosier, Schimel, Parton, Robert
  Woodmansee and Vernon Cole, together with students from Colorado State's
  Agronomy Department, began to work on techniques for extrapolating ecological
  information to larger spatial scales, beginning with constructing organic matter
  budgets, studying trace-gas exchanges and using landscapes as building blocks
  for regional analyses.
In the mid 1980s, the NREL began using geographic information systems (GIS) and
  remote-sensing data to carry out spatial extrapolations and modeling. Schimel
  and Burke and their coworkers carried out studies in the Great Plains of the
  U.S., and Michael Coughenour, Jim Ellis and former NREL graduate student Robin
  Patten worked in the Turkana region of Kenya. Both GIS and remote-sensing
  technologies are now used for projects ranging from Burke's research on the
  impact of land use in the central grasslands of the U.S. to Ojima's modeling
  studies of the effects of climate change on grasslands around the globe. NREL
  has participated in efforts leading to basic improvements in GIS technology
  through a collaboration with IBM's Federal Systems Company and in research on
  the uses of remote sensing, carried out by Schimel and colleagues from NASA and
  the University of Colorado.<P>

The simulation of soil carbon for the entire U.S. (b) is based on a 0.5  x 0.5 
grid using average climate and soil properties from a U.S. Department of
Agriculture soils database. This simulation estimates carbon for potential natural
vegetation. At this scale, ecosystem type is an important determinant of carbon
storage.
In a simulation of global carbon storage (c), the model was run at representative
sites worldwide. The results were interpolated using a standard global climate
database and a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization soils map for
physical properties. At this scale, climate and physical properties are the
primary determinants of carbon storage, and ecosystem type and the chemistry of
leaf litter are secondary determinants.
</I><P>

NREL scientists have developed versions of the laboratory's Century model with
  different levels of resolution, which have been used to study specific regions,
  the biomes of the whole U.S. and the entire globe (Figure 1 a-c). We simulated
  the effects of temperature on carbon storage at each of these scales in a
  variety of ways. A number of field studies and measurement programs are
  collecting data on larger scales as well. These projects include regional
  sampling networks for ecosystem properties ranging from soil organic matter to
  ultraviolet radiation and micro-meteorological flux measurements to
  remote-sensing measurements on a global scale.<P>
 NREL ecologists find themselves conducting research to answer questions raised
  by atospheric chemists, and colleagues in the atmospheric sciences find
  themselves learning ecology. If we view the atmosphere and the biosphere as
  linked through a complex set of feedbacks, in which the biota controls much of
  the chemistry of the atmosphere and atmospheric composition influences the biota
  through climate, solar radiation, ozone levels and nutrient transport and
 deposition, the ecological significance of atmosphere-ecosystem studies becomes
clear. Such studies are inherently interdisciplinary. The interaction among
researchers from different disciplines has provoked debate over priorities, but
it has also expanded the horizons of research in ecology to new scales and ways
of thinking. In particular, studies of atmosphere-ecosystem interactions require
an understanding of ecological processes at spatial scales that have an impact on
the atmosphere. Interdisciplinary analyses of atmosphere-ecosystem interactions
and collaborations with atmospheric scientists now comprise a substantial portion
of NREL's effort in research and education and are likely to increase in the
future.

<TITLE>NREL Brochure:  The Human Role in Ecosystem Dynamics</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>

<A NAME="human"><H2>The Human Role in Ecosystem Dynamics</H2></A>
The role of humans in the structure and functioning of ecosystems is among the
principal topics of study at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), one
of the first research institutions to incorporate human ecology into the analysis
of ecosystems. This research tradition began in 1980 with the South Turkana
Ecosystem Project (STEP), an interdisciplinary study of the ecological role of
nomadic pastoralists in southern Kenya. Supported by the National Science
Foundation, STEP integrated the work of several social and environmental
scientists from Kenya and the United States.<P>
Over the 15 years since STEP began, NREL ecologists and anthropologists have
  developed three interrelated research themes that explore interactions between
  humans and their environment:<P>
<P>
<UL>
  <LI>the ecology of pastoralism
  <LI>climate change and human land use
  <LI>land use and biodiversity
</UL>
<P>
<B>Ecology of Pastoralism<P>
</B>Under the leadership of NREL ecologists Jim Ellis and David Swift and
anthropologists from the State University of New York at Binghamton, the South
Turkana project evolved a research approach that treated humans as interactive
components of the ecosystem, not simply as external driving forces or sources of
perturbation. STEP brought together ecological and anthropological perspectives
to examine the behavioral and biological adaptations f Turkana pastoralists to
ecosystem dynamics.<P>

regularly practiced in this region, which only receives an average of 500-600
millimeters of rain a year. Photo by K.A. Galvin
</I><P>

Turkana strategies for coping with a harsh and highly seasonal environment include
  owning several species of livestock, such as camels, cattle, sheep, goats and
  donkeys; moving livestock daily in search of forage and water; migration out of
  the Turkana region during drought conditions; sharing food, and making sure that
  nutritional shortages are borne primarily by adults and older adolescents rather
  than young children. These strategies determine the flow of energy through the
  ecosystem to humans (Figure 1).<P>
Ellis, Swift and NREL anthropologist Kathleen Galvin conducted a study of the ways
  in which pastoralists cope with drought. NREL ecologist Michael Coughenour
  devised schemes to link remote sensing, geographic information systems (GIS) and
  spatial ecosystem models in a drought-monitoring or early-warning system for
  famine. His Savanna model includes a pastoralism component that simulates human
  energy intake, herd management and strategies for coping with droughts.<P>
NREL scientists are now comparing land-use patterns among pastoralists and
  agropastoralists in the Republic of China, in Mongolia and throughout Africa in
  order to see how populations respond to different ecological regimes. For
 example, Galvin's comparative nutritional studies have led to an analysis of the
impact of seasonal rainfall patterns on the viability of agriculture versus
pastoralism in east and west Africa.<P>
<P>
<B>Climate Change and Human Land Use<P>
</B>STEP was the first study to identify the pervasive role of climate variation
in dry ecosystems dominated by human populations. This theme encompasses two
principal topics: non-equilibrium dynamics and global environmental change.<P>
In the late 1980s, a synthesis by Ellis and Swift of data from STEP and other
  studies in Africa and Australia showed that dry tropical ecosystems are often
  dominated and controlled by climate variability rather than by biological
  interactions. This discovery has crucial implications for land use, ecosystem
  management, economic development, conservation of biodiversity and climate
  change over the 65% of the earth that is arid or semiarid.<P>
NREL scientists are currently conducting investigations in Africa and Mongolia to
  explore further the role of climate variability in human ecology and land use
  and to begin to determine the role of ecosystem instability in biodiversity and
  in the generation and loss of genetic variation in dryland organisms. We have
  also participated in syntheses sponsored by the U.S. National Academy of
  Sciences, the British Overseas Development Agency and the Norwegian Aid Agency
  that are aimed at elucidating the impact of climate variation on pastoral land
  use and livestock development. NREL research on land use in the U.S. shows that
  dryland agricultural practices in the central grasslands are also susceptible
  to changes in climate. Simulation studies using the Century model show, however,
  that changes in land use can override the effects of climate change in these
  temperate regions.<P>
Indeed, environmental factors alone do not determine land-use patterns or changes;
  human activities stimulate environmental change and often override natural
  ecosystem dynamics. NREL scientists are endeavoring to understand the impact of
  human land use and to determine how it contributes to environmental change.
  Several studies have begun to investigate the socioeconomic and environmental
  constraints on land-use decisions. Among them are studies of grazing patterns
  in the Mongolian steppe, of Conservation Reserve Programs in Colorado and of
  lad-use decisions for conservation reserves in Tanzania. Working with social
  scientists at University of Colorado, Galvin has found that conservation
  policies in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area of Tanzania have severely
  restricted pastoral land use. The economic viability of livestock production has
  decreased, and the lack of alternatives has compromised the economic state,
  health and nutritional status of pastoralists in the area, regardless of
  socioeconomic class (Figure 2).<P>
<P>
<B>Land Use and Biodiversity<P>
</B>Patterns of land use have major implications for the future of global
biological diversity as well as for human well-being. NREL scientists have studied
the relationship between biodiversity, conservation and human development in other
 countries and have focused on the interactions of biodiversity, conservation and
ecosystem management in the U.S.<P>
In conjunction with state and federal agencies, Coughenour, Thomas Stohlgren and
  Thompson Hobbs of the NREL are developing and testing field methods and GIS
  techniques at a scale useful to land managers. One study focuses on management
  issues in and adjacent to Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. Researchers
  are addressing strategic concerns for ecosystem management, including
  development, urbanization, invasive species and fragmented habitats. Another
  project includes developing a system for making land-use planning decisions in
 several counties in Colorado. Its purpose is to help planners assess the
potential impact of recreational facilities on wildlife diversity. The system
relies on a collaborative team of stakeholders from each county and on citizen
participation for testing and validation.<P>
Swift and University of Colorado scientists are collaborating with representatives
  of the Lakota (Sioux) Nation and the National Park Service to develop a wildlife
  management plan for southern parts of Badlands National Park that are also part
  of the Pine Ridge Reservation. The goal is to develop policies and procedures
  that are both founded on sound ecological principles and consistent with the
  Lakota view of humankind's relationship to the natural world.<P>
The conflicting needs of traditional societies and the conservation of biological
  resources are at the heart of a study, conducted by Galvin and Ellis, of the
  compatibility of human populations, livestock and wildlife in Tanzania. The NREL
  researchers are comparing the 'park&#34; model of biological conservation with
  a 'regional' or 'community' model that includes local human populations as
  stakeholders in wildlife conservation. The coexistence of Maasai pastoralists
  and wildlife in northern Tanzania is threatened as a result of the perceived
  conflict between conservation policy and the needs of the local people.
  Resolution of this issue is crucial in Africa as countries try to improve living
  standards through economic development while also preserving their wildlife
  resources, which provide considerable revenue from tourism.<P>
NREL studies also explore the dynamics of ecosystems dominated by humans in order
  to ensure that land-use planning and economic development preserve a balance
  between ecological sustainability and economic viability. Sustainable
  development is the ultimate goal of two projects in which NREL is participating.
  Ellis is working with former NREL student Robin Reid, now at the International
  Laboratory for Research on Animal Diseases in Nairobi, to assess the impact of
  efforts to control trypanosomiasis, the most serious disease of livestock in
  Africa, on agricultural production, human welfare and biodiversity. Swift is
  involved in a sustainableagriculture program of the U.S. Agency for
  International Development that includes local participation in the development
  process.<P>

Starting with the pioneering South Turkana project, NREL scientists have continued
  to explore the interaction of humans and the environment in a variety of ways.
  Research projects today address different geographic regions and different
  spatial scales. Studies have become more sophisticated with the use of GIS,
  satellite data, simulation models and theoretical models that include the
  socioeconomic and political factors affecting human behavior. The NREL continues
  its commitment to research on fundamental human ecological issues, including the
  impact of human populations on ecological systems and environmental influences
  on human behavior and biology.<P>

<TITLE>NREL Brochure:  Plant-Animal Interactions</TITLE></HEAD>
<BODY>

<A NAME="plant-animal"><H2>Studying the Role of Plant-Animal Interactions in Ecosystems Dynamics</H2></A>
Herbivory, the consumption of plants by animals, has a pervasive influence on
 the structure and functioning of ecosystems. It modifies the amount of energy
that moves through ecosystems, changes the pathways that energy follows and
affects the composition and nutrient cycling of plant communities. Studies
conducted in many parts of the world have demonstrated the importance of herbivory
in both natural ecosystems and those dominated by livestock. In grassland and
savanna ecosystems, herbivores above and below the soil surface consume between
10% and 90% of the net primary production. Energy and materials are thus diverted
from detrital food webs into herbivorous ones, many of which provide nutrition for
humans. Belowground herbivores, particularly nematodes, reduce plant production
by a quantity far greater than the biomass they consume.<P>
The Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) has a long history of studying
  plant-animal interactions at all levels of biological organization, from
  organisms to ecosystems. Looking at these interactions from an interdisciplinary
  perspective, we examine the ways that herbivory influences the flows of carbon,
  nutrients and water throughout the ecosystem, and in turn, how changes in these
  fluxes affect other ecosystem components and dynamics. Our approach requires
  integrated studies of plants, soils, animals and, in certain contexts, human
  populations.<P>

<IMG SRC="bison.gif"><BR>

Research at NREL on plant-animal interactions began with the International
  Biological Program's Grassland Biome Study (1967-1974), which involved extensive
  studies of vertebrate and invertebrate herbivory, both above and below ground,
  in the grasslands of the western United States. NREL scientists Daniel
  Milchunas, Debra Coffin, William Lauenroth and Ingrid Burke continue research
  on herbivory at sites in the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), now part
  of the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program. Their findings show that
  different conclusions may be reached about the effects of livestock grazing,
  depending upon whether these effects are viewed from the perspective of plant
  community composition, primary production, nutrient cycling or other consumer
  populations. This diversity of views emphasizes the necessity of approaching
  questions about the role of herbivory from different levels of biological
  organization.<P>
<P>
<B>Plant-Animal Interactions at the Organism Level<P>
</B>NREL scientists have devoted considerable effort to studying organism-level
interactions between herbivores and plants. David Swift constructed a detailed
model of the effects of changes in quality of diet and availability of forage on
herbivore energy and nitrogen balance. Starting from this point, Swift and
Thompson Hobbs have developed increasingly sophisticated approaches to determining
how many herbivores a given ecosystem can support. Ongoing studies by Hobbs and
John Gross take a functional approach to understanding how plant density,
structure and tissue quality affect the rates at which individual animals consume
plants and how foraging behaviors are linked to animal body size. These studies
seek to develop general models that are widely applicable.<P>
Our studies at NREL have demonstrated a wide variety of plant responses to grazing
  and browsing, developed in response to long-term selective pressures. We have
  explained these responses in terms of numerous interacting processes and traits
  at the individual plant and leaf levels. James Detling and Michael Coughenour
  have found that increases in photosynthetic rates and shifts in carbon and
  nitrogen allocation contribute to the ability of plants to tolerate herbivory.
  Increases in nitrogen uptake rates have been documented in North American and
  African grasses and dwarf shrubs in response to herbivory. Genotypes of grasses
  adapted to grazing have been found on and near prairie-dog colonies in Wind Cave
  National Park, South Dakota. The allocation of energy and materials to root
  biomass partly explains the ability of North American shortgrass prairie species
  to resist grazing. Jim Ellis has shown that livestock in Kenya facilitate the
  regeneration of Acacia trees by eating and redistributing seedpods, a likely
  carryover of coevolution between Acacia and native ungulate species.<P>
<P>

the study of plant-animal interactions. Here Tom Hobbs is observing dietary
choices of tame big horn sheep in studies of the effects of fire on mountain shrub
ecosystems. Photo by John Gross </I><P>

<B>Population, Community and Ecosystem<P>
</B>The effects of these responses at the level of individual organisms are felt
at population, community and ecosystem levels as well. Gross and Francis Singer
are studying insular populations of native and exotic ungulates in U.S. western
national parks. Studies of bighorn sheep are carried out in 11 of these parks,
 where researchers are employing empirical and modeling studies of metapopulation
persistence, dispersal and gene flow to conserve populations and their genetic
diversities. Studies conducted by Detling and Coughenour in the Pryor Mountains
of Montana will be used to determine the size of wild (Spanish) horse populations
that can optimize the genetic diversity of the species while minimizing danger to
plant and soil resources.<P>
Community-level studies undertaken by Detling and his students in Wind Cave
  National Park have investigated the affinity of bison for areas around
  prairie-dog colonies. They demonstrated that prairie dog grazing maintains
  grasses in a state that provides higher levels of nutrition for bison. Hobbs and
  Swift have shown that grazing in herds may likewise facilitate an increased flow
  of nutrients to the animals in question. <P>
NREL scientists have also conducted numerous ecosystem-level studies. Detling's
  Wind Cave study went beyond the concerns of community ecology to study the role
  of herbivores in modifying primary production and nutrient cycling. Ellis,
  Swift, Coughenour and Kathleen Galvin have studied a nomadic pastoral ecosystem
  in northwest Kenya. Couhenour, Singer, Edward Elliott, Jeffrey Welker and David
  Valentine are currently conducting studies of herbivory in five western national
  parks. They are investigating the impact of interactions among ungulates, plants
  and soils on nutrient cycling, primary production and the relationship between
  plants and water. They are also examining interactions among elk, fire, riparian
  plants, beaver and hydrological features of the landscape.<P>
<P>
<B>From Ecosystems to Landscapes<P>
</B>Researchers at NREL are increasingly attempting to extend the scale of their
studies from the ecosystem to the landscape to improve their understanding of the
role of herbivores at larger spatial scales. Along with plant and soil processes,
herbivory is not uniform in its spatial distribution. We have found that spatial
heterogeneity must be considered if we are to succeed in using our observations
from leaves, plants and patches to provide integrated assessments of pasture,
landscape and regional systems.<P>
Several research programs are contributing to our understanding of the large-scale
  impact of herbivory. Detling's studies in Wind Cave National Park have
  documented large differences induced by herbivory in primary production and
  nutrient cycling within and outside prairie-dog colonies. Milchunas has found
  that grazing in the CPER decreases the heterogeneity of plant communities and
  soil nutrients at scales ranging from square meters to landscapes. Coughenour
  has carried out spatial modeling and empirical studies that have shown how the
  timing, intensity and duration of herbivory are affected by changes in elk
  distribution in response to snow, forage, cover and topography in Yellowstone
  and Rocky Mountain national parks and by patchy rainfall, forage and
  availability of water in pastoral ecosystems in Africa.<P>
Coughenour, Hobbs and Gross are using spatial ecosystem modeling, population
  modeling, geographic information systems and risk analysis in studies of
  ungulates in a wide variety of habitats (Figure 1). The foraging of large
  herbivores is influenced by factors that can be analyzed at a variety of scales,
  from plants and patches to landscapes and regions. <P>
Recent projects have begun to examine the links between biodiversity and ecosystem
  function. Coughenour, Thomas Stohlgren, and Daniel Binkley are conducting a
  landscape-scale 'gap analysis&#34; study to determine how measures of plant
  diversity at various levels of spatial resolution and sampling intensity are
  related to elk distributions and herbivory and historical changes in land use
  along the Colorado Front Range. This study aims to develop a general approach
  to assessing biodiversity at scales useful for management and planning.
  Conservation biology is central to Hobbs's study of spatial patterns and effects
  of fragmentation of wildlife habitats in areas of Colorado dominated by human
  activity.<P>
Belowground grazing is another area of interest to NREL researchers. William Hunt,
  Diana Freckman and Elliott have investigated underground foodwebs in Colorado
  grasslands and their response to climate change. Hunt has shown that
  invertebrate herbivory belowground supports complex food webs that may
  contribute to enhanced nutrient cycling. Freckman is studying the impact of
  disturbance on the diversity of soil nematodes in natural and agricultural
  ecosystems.<P>
NREL research on plant-animal interactions contributes to a deeper understanding
  of the structure and dynamics of natural and managed ecosystems. Ecosystem
  management is ultimately based upon theories of ecosystem function. One set of
  theories has emphasized the tendency f plants and herbivores to come into a
  dynamic equilibrium with one another at an ecological carrying capacity. Our
  research has shown that non-equilibrial tendencies must also be considered in
  the management of ungulates in U.S. national parks and in the economic
  development of pastoral ecosystems in developing countries. Similarly, the
  failure to consider the spatial aspects of plant-animal interactions can lead
  to inappropriate and unsustainable ecosystem 'design.&#34; Building upon a
  foundation of small-scale process studies and extrapolating the results to
  large-scale analyses, NREL research aims to provide a sound scientific basis for
  ecosystem management.<P>

<BODY>

<A NAME="modeling"><H2>Ecosystem Modeling: Contributions to Synthesis</H2></A>
Scientists at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) have a long
tradition of developing and using mathematical models as a means of advancing
synthesis in ecology. Synthesis is the process of bringing together disparate
information into a unified whole in order to discover new patterns, mechanisms or
interactions. Its goal is to achieve a new level of understanding of complex
systems and thus to improve our ability to predict the ways in which such systems
will respond to change. Used in conjunction with results from field and laboratory
studies, modeling is a powerful tool for bringing together existing information
on the various components of ecosystems, finding the gaps in our knowledge and
advancing our understanding of how ecosystems work. A contemporary form of
synthesis that depends upon modeling is the projection of ecosystem responses to
scenarios of future conditions. Such projections are currently our only means of
predicting the impact on ecosystems of large-scale, long-term changes in climate
and other critical variables.
Modeling efforts at NREL are primarily directed towards understanding how the
  major components of ecosystems, such as plants, animals, soils, nutrients and
  water, interact with each other and with external factors such as atmospheric
  conditions. Although NREL modelers have traditionally focused their efforts on
  grassland, savanna and agricultural ecosystems, current studies also include
  work on tundra ecosystems, shrublands and forests. Modeling studies are used to
  provide practical assessments of the impact of resource management practices and
  potential changes in climate as well as to advance our scientific knowledge.<P>

Ecosystem modeling at NREL has its roots in the research that began with the
  Grassland Biome Study in the late 1960s, one of the first large-scale ecosystem
  modeling efforts to be attempted. One of the early goals was to develop a
  general grassland model, a synthesis that would simulate ecosystem dynamics for
  diverse grassland types, include all of the major ecosystem components and be
  able to respond to changes in management practices and atmospheric
  conditions.<p>
Following this early tradition, most of the models developed at NREL are created
  in the context of large, interdisciplinary projects that include field and
  laboratory experiments as well as modeling. Models are used to guide the
  formulation of experiments, the results of which are used, in turn, to test and
  revise the models. This interaction between model development and field research
  yields new insights into the structure and functioning of whole ecosystems and
  their potential response to change.<P>
NREL scientists have focused from the beginning on the cycling of carbon, nitroge
  and phosphorus through and within ecosystems. More recent research has advanced
  modeling representations of interactions among element cycles and of key
  processes such as primary production, nutrient mineralization, and soil organic
  matter (SOM) formation and loss. Much of this work has been devoted to poorly
  understood belowground processes such as root production and exudation,
  mycorrhizal activity and microbial production as well as SOM formation. Modeling
  studies conducted by William Lauenroth, William Hunt and others have shown that
  standard estimates of root production may seriously underestimate actual
  production.<P>
Field and laboratory research on soil fauna and nutrient mineralization led to
  modeling studies by Hunt and John Moore that focused on the relationships
  between complexity, diversity, stability, productivity and the flow of energy
  among species in detrital food webs (Figure 1). Studies such as these bring
  together the traditional methods and interests of biogeochemistry and community
  ecology.<P>
<P>
<B>Impact Assessment<P>
</B>Models developed at NREL have been used to assess the impact of potential
changes in climate, atmospheric gas concentrations and grazing patterns on
grasslands in the United States and elsewhere. Since the 1970s, NREL scientists
have used grassland ecosystem models to evaluate the impact of climate change
scenarios on plant and animal production, nutrient cycling and sustainability of
grasslands. These efforts were stimulated initially by questions about the impact
of cloud seeding and supersonic transport on climate and more recently by concerns
about the effects on ecosystems of the increased temperatures and altered
precipitation patterns that could result from an increase in atmospheric
greenhouse gases such as methane (CH<em sub>4</em>), nitrous oxide (N<em sub>2</em>O) and
carbon dioxide (CO2).
Hunt, David Schimel, William Parton and Dennis Ojima have conducted a number of
  modeling studies aimed at evaluating both the potential direct effects of
  increased levels of atmospheric CO<em sub>2</em> on grasslands and the combined
  impact of both increased CO2 and changes in climate. Results from this work
  showed that increases in atmospheric CO2 can bring about increases in plant
  production but that the long-term rate of increase is moderated by the
  availability of nitrogen in the soil. An accompanying decrease in the nitrogen
  content of plant material, however, is likely to decrease animal production.
  Although the impact of changes in both atmospheric CO2 levels and climate is
  much less certain, our models are being used to design experiments that will
  improve our understanding of their combined effects.
Our efforts at modeling agricultural ecosystems (agroecosystems) address the
  question of how environmental factors and management practices interact in
  controlling production and nutrient dynamics in agricultural systems. Studies
  span a range of temporal and spatial scales, from a detailed examination of
  management effects on ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes at a single field
  site to long-term, regional assessments of productivity and soil organic matter
  in relation to major land-use and climate change patterns. Although most of
  these studies use the Century model, developed by Parton, Vernon Cole and
 others, to analyze temperate-zone agricultural systems in North America, we are
also undertaking studies of agricultural systems elsewhere in the world.<P>
NREL researchers have also developed models for assessing the impact of
  contaminants on humans and ecosystems. In one study, Thomas Kirchner and
  colleagues from the Department of Radiolgical Health Sciences at Colorado State
  University computed doses received by people in communities surrounding the
  Nevada nuclear bomb test site. The effort required simulating the transport of
  radionuclides through agroecosystems. Although external exposures tended to
  dominate total body doses, the ingestion of contaminated milk was responsible
  for significant thyroid doses. The model also demonstrated the importance of
  taking into account agricultural practices and the transport of contaminated
  milk within a region. People in communities that received no fallout were
  affected nevertheless because they drank contaminated milk imported from other
  areas. The model resulting from this effort was also used to help evaluate the
  impact on human populations of fallout from the 1986 Chernobyl reactor accident
  in the Ukraine.<P>
Our experience with contaminant transport modeling is now being applied to the
  development of models for assessing risks to ecological systems as well as to
  humans (Figure 2). In collaboration with researchers from Colorado State
  University's Center for Ecological Risk Assessment and Management, Kirchner is
  working on ways to improve the quality and facilitate the construction of models
  for evaluating the effects of contaminants on ecosystems.<P>
<P>
<B>Integrated Modeling<P>
</B>Researchers at the NREL have developed integrated modeling programs that focus
on the interactions of different components in ecosystems. Among these are models
that look at the interaction of herbivores and plants and the short- and long-term
impact of grazing management practices in grassland ecosystems. These models have
been extended to evaluate the effect of management practices on the economic
viability of grazing systems and the consequences for the human populations that
rely on them.<P>
Michael Coughenour, David Swift, Jim Ellis and Kathleen Galvin have combined
  modeling with field research in their studies of a pastoral ecosystem in
  Turkana, Kenya. The South Turkana Ecosystem Project (STEP) synthesized data on
  plant distribution and production, animal production and human nutrition.
  Analyzing these data within a geographic information system (GIS), the team
  developed a static model of annual energy flow through the ecosystem. This
  analysis clearly revealed the importance of browse and browsers (camels) in what
  was thought to be a grazing ecosystem and a socioeconomic system dominated by
  cattle.<P>
Early STEP simulation modeling efforts focused on plant and animal production and
  dynamics. Later models of the pastoral enterprise included such variables as
  livestock management, tactics for coping with drought and human nutrition. Among
  these was Savanna, a spatially organized dynamic ecosystem model, developed in
  order to assess the significance of landscape heterogeneity and the migration
  patterns of the nomadic herdsmen. Monthly vegetation indices and other GIS data
  were used for inputs and verification. The model demonstrated the importance of
  pastoral mobility as a strategy for dealing with temporal changes in forage
  availability. It also showed how water redistribution in the landscape affects
  vegetation and ecosystem dynamics, resulting in relatively productive patches
  within an arid system.<P>
One of the first spatially explicit ecosystem models, Savanna is also being used
  by Coughenour, Swift, Galvin and Ellis for analysis of several North American
  ecosystems dominated by large herbivores (Figure 3).<p>

<A HREF="mikec.gif"><IMG SRC="../ABOUTNREL/mikec.gif"></A><P>
<I>Figure 3: Overall structure of Savanna, a spatially explicit, dynamic ecosystem
model that was originally developed for studies of African pastoralism. It has
also been applied to western U.S. and Canadian national parks as an ecosystem
management model. Ungulates and their interactions with plants are a principal
concern. Savanna is unique in representing linkages between plant production and
population processes as well as between ungulate energy balance and their
population processes. Primary production is tied directly to the soil water
budget. The model uses geographic information systems for both data input and
output.
</I><P>

In another synthesis project, Lauenroth and Debra Coffin integrated Steppe, a
  model that simulates the recruitment, growth and mortality of individual plants,
  with Solwat, a multilayer soil process model. Steppe was recently modified to
  simulate the ways in which grass types might shift in the mixed-grass and
  tallgrass prairies of the central Great Plains by incorporating competition for
  nitrogen and light in addition to competition for water.<P>
The linked Steppe-Soilwat model was used to assess the effects of changes in
  climate on the composition and structure of grassland vegetation. Preliminary
  simulations suggest that although different types of vegetation respond
  differently to climate change, shifts in types occur within 40 years of the
  change in conditions. Warm-season (C<em sub>4</em>) grasses increase in dominance
  or importance with a change in climate, primarily as a result of increases in
  temperature. These predicted shifts in the dominance and importance of
  cool-season (C<em sub>3</em>) versus warm-season grasses have important
  implications for the management of natural grasslands as well as the cultivation
  of crops in the central grassland region.

<A NAME="education"><H2>Educational Activities</H2></A>
Although the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) is a center for
research rather than an academic department, it participates actively in the
educational mission of Colorado State University. Its staff members teach courses
in various university departments, supervise graduate and postgraduate research
and share their knowledge with students at local schools and community
organizations.
The laboratory provides research opportunities, supervision and support for
  graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who participate in its programs. Over
  the last five years, NREL has supported 26 graduate students and 14 postdoctoral
  fellows with funds derived from research grants. During their years at the
  laboratory, these students have the opportunity to work closely with active
  researchers, both staff members and visitors. They have access to excellent
  computing and analytical facilities and technical support, attend and make
  presentations at national meetings, and participate in the process of writing
  grant proposals and papers for publication.<P>
NREL scientists also advise graduate students who receive support from sources
  other than NREL research projects. Scientists often undertake responsibility for
  the graduate education of students who arrive with their own funding but no
  adviser, just as departmental faculty members do. Among the organizations that
  have supported students at NREL in recent years are the U.S. Agency for
  International Development, the African Development Bank, the U.S. Department of
  Interior's National Park Service and National Biological Survey, Rotary
  International, and various national governments. Some 60 graduate students, in
  addition to those mentioned above, have benefited from the guidance of NREL
  staff members over the last five years.<P>
Nine NREL scientists have joint appointments and teach courses in the College of
  Natural Resources and other colleges at the university. During 1993, laboratory
  staff members taught 10 graduate-level courses with a total enrollment of 180
  students. Many serve as members of graduate student committees; the total over
  the last five years is more than 150.<P>
NREL plays a significant part in undergraduate education as well. During 1993,
  staff members taught eight undergraduate courses with a total enrollment of more
  than 1,000. The laboratory has provided 20 undergraduate students with research
  opportunities over the last five years through the "Research Experiences for
  Undergraduates&#34; program of the National Science Foundation (NSF). Research
  projects also provide financial support and experience for many other
 undergraduate students who are hired as hourly employees to work on laboratory
analyses or to collect field data for research projects. During the last five
years, 195 undergraduates have worked at NREL.<P>
Like their academic colleagues, NREL scientists contribute to education at the
  university in many other ways. Some serve on departmental, college and
  university committees dealing with such matters as curriculum, scholastic
  standards and admission. Others serve as mentors to minority undergraduates.
  Staff members often give guest lectures in courses taught on campus. These
  lectures provide an opportunity to discuss current research with students,
  enriching the educational experience and demonstrating the role of research in
  the generation of new knowledge.<P>
NREL staff members are frequently invited to make presentations on such topics as
  acid deposition, atmospheric pollution or wildlife conservation for students at
  local schools and colleges. They also speak regularly at meetings of
  conservation groups and other public organizations. One scientist has served as
  a mentor for Native American high school students who are interested in science.
  Another has instructed junior high school students on using the Internet. Yet
  another has taught an adult education course on arctic ecology.<P>
High school students have participated in NREL research projects from time to
  time. With support from the NSF, one high school senior from Nevada worked at
  the NREL for two weeks during the summer of 1994 and traveled to Antarctica the
  following January to participate in a field project in the Dry Valleys near
  McMurdo Station.<P>

Human beings practice agriculture, the cultivation of the soil to produce food and fiber,
over a significant portion of the land area of the earth.  Agriculture thus affects
natural processes at every spatial scale, from local to global.  In the late 1970's
Vernon Cole and his coworkers at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL)
developed one of the first programs for studying agriculture ecosystems (agroecosystems)
to be funded by the National Science Foundation.  Since then, NREL scientists have
focused on gaining a fundamental understanding of the biogeochemical flows related to the 
dynamics of soil organic matter (SOM) and the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur
and phosphorus.  Studies of SOM in agroecosystems and simulation analyses with the
NREL's Century model have provided a broad base of knowledge that is applicable to the 
dynamics of nutrients within ecosystems in general.  We are using this understanding
to address ecosystem questions at multiple scales of resolution in time and space.

Scientists at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL) have a long
tradition of developing and using mathematical models as a means of advancing
synthesis in ecology. Synthesis is the process of bringing together disparate
information into a unified whole in order to discover new patterns, mechanisms or
interactions. Its goal is to achieve a new level of understanding of complex
systems and thus to improve our ability to predict the ways in which such systems
will respond to change. Used in conjunction with results from field and laboratory
studies, modeling is a powerful tool for bringing together existing information
on the various components of ecosystems, finding the gaps in our knowledge and
advancing our understanding of how ecosystems work. A contemporary form of
synthesis that depends upon modeling is the projection of ecosystem responses to
scenarios of future conditions. Such projections are currently our only means of
predicting the impact on ecosystems of large-scale, long-term changes in climate
and other critical variables.

The role of humans in the structure and functioning of ecosystems is among the
principal topics of study at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), one
of the first research institutions to incorporate human ecology into the analysis
of ecosystems. This research tradition began in 1980 with the South Turkana
Ecosystem Project (STEP), an interdisciplinary study of the ecological role of
nomadic pastoralists in southern Kenya. Supported by the National Science
Foundation, STEP integrated the work of several social and environmental
scientists from Kenya and the United States.

Improvements in our understanding of ecological processes have played a major
role in the unraveling of important problems in the atmospheric sciences and
geophysics over the last decade. Earth scientists have observed increases in the
atmospheric concentrations of a number of biogenic trace gases during this period;
their observations have had, in turn, a massive impact on the practice of ecology.
Scientists at the Natural Resource Ecology Laboratory (NREL), in collaboration
with colleagues at other laboratories, have become progressively more involved in
studying the interactions between ecosystems and the atmosphere as understanding
the effects of climate change has become a national and international priority.

Natural systems have rhythms and progressions over time that strongly influence, if
not dictate, the characteristics of individual components.  Variation in climate,
periodic disturbances and internal community dynamics are all involved in shaping
ecosystems.  Long-term observations are required in order to formulate meaningful,
testable hypotheses that describe and predict ecosystem responses to changing conditions.

<P>
Herbivory, the consumption of plants by animals, has a pervasive influence on
 the structure and functioning of ecosystems. It modifies the amount of energy
that moves through ecosystems, changes the pathways that energy follows and
affects the composition and nutrient cycling of plant communities. Studies
conducted in many parts of the world have demonstrated the importance of herbivory
in both natural ecosystems and those dominated by livestock. In grassland and
savanna ecosystems, herbivores above and below the soil surface consume between
10% and 90% of the net primary production. Energy and materials are thus diverted
from detrital food webs into herbivorous ones, many of which provide nutrition for
humans. Belowground herbivores, particularly nematodes, reduce plant production
by a quantity far greater than the biomass they consume.

<h3>Project Name: Regional Projections of C Dynamics with Global Change
in the Central U.S. (ADAPT-I)</h3>
Funding Agency: NIGEC/DOE<p>

Starting/Ending Date:  1994-1996<p>

Description: <p>

The key objective of our research is to separate the interactive effects of climate, elevated CO2
and management on soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics in the Central U.S. wheat and corn
growing regions.  We conducted a simulation study of changes in soil C as a function of climate
and CO2 change, for a suite of different management systems,  at locations representing a climate
sequence in the central Great Plains of the U.S.<p>

Significant Products to Date:  <p>

Our results demonstrate the importance of management in determining potential responses of
agroecosystems to global change.  Changes in climate will determine changes in management as
farmers strive to maximize profitability.  Therefore, changes in soil C may be a complex function
of climate driving management and management driving soil C levels and not be a simple direct
effect of either climate or management.<p>

<body>
<h3>Project Name: Spatially Explicit Projections of C Dynamics with Global
Change in the Central U.S. (ADAPT II)</h3>
Funding Agency: DOE-NIGEC <p>

Starting/Ending  Date: 1996-1998<p>

Description: <p>

This project focuses on making regional projections of global change impacts on C storage and
agroecosystem productivity.  Driving variable input for the model is derived from spatially explicit
data representing the region, which is organized with a geographic information system.
Regionalized output from global circulation models will be used to modify climate when driving
variables are altered to simulate future climate. We will provide information on crop yields to
researchers at Montana State University, and they will reciprocally provide information to us
about the probability of the economic and environmental "success" of particular management
systems as feedback into our ecosystem model. Model output from the linked
ecosystem/economic models will then be projected back onto the region to obtain spatially explicit
regional information.<p>

<h3>Project Name: Determination of Agroecozones for use in Policy
Analysis (AGROECOZONES)</h3>
Funding Agency: USDA-ARS<p>

Starting/Ending Date: December 1995- March 1996<p>

Description:<p>

The purpose of this work is to define the spatial extent of agroecozones for the 48 conterminous
states.  We are responding expeditiously to provide information to policy and decision makers to
assist them with decisions being currently made. We are providing an analysis and evaluation of
one of the most widely applied and accessible databases, the Land Resource Regions (LRRs), and
subunits of the LRRs, the Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) which is spatially organized
information on land as a resource for farming ranching, forestry, engineering, recreation and other
uses. <p>

Significant Products to Date:<p>

Cluster analyses have been completed using the primary 181 MLRAs.  Those which concurrently
use normalized values of precipitation, growing degree days and available soil water holding
capacity are showing the most promise and we have completed clusters of 10, 20, 30 and 40
subunits (MLRAs).  The 1992 county level crop statistics are now organized in a coherent
database and are ready to include in the next phase of the analysis.<p>

We are investigating environmental modification and plant resistance as
ways to reduce alfalfa disease incited by Ditylenchus dipsaci in Colorado.
Three objectives, each with associated research questions, govern the investigation.
(1) Determine the within-plant distribution of D. dipsaci and Aphelenchoides
ritzemabosi. Are the two nematodes distributed differently within infected
plants? Does nematode distribution within plants change throughout the growing
season? Does nematode distribution within plants differ between resistant
and susceptible varieties? (2) Identify alfalfa varieties expressing resistance
to field populations of nematodes. Do varieties express differential resistance
to nematodes? Do patterns of resistance and susceptibility vary throughout
the growing season? How are population abundances related to yield? (3)
Modify the environment to reduce initial nematode populations. Does the
application of carbofuran reduce nematode populations and the incidence
of disease? Does plant response to carbofuran vary between resistant and
susceptible varieties? <BR>

<title>BOREAS</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Project Name:  Field micrometeorological measurements,
process-level studies, and modeling of methane and carbon dioxide
fluxes in a boreal wetland ecosystem (BOREAS project)</h3>
Funding Level: $50,000 per annum (CSU portion), 1993-1997<p>

Description:<p>

Based on our earlier laboratory work on methane production from northern wetland peats, we
had found that the quantity of substrate generated by fermentation processes--and the quality of
organic matter from which it derives--was a more important control over methanogenesis than
temperature.  Our participation in this BOREAS project presented an opportunity to examine the
importance of litter quantity and quality to methane emission rates in a field setting.  Our major
field season was summer, 1994, during which we applied a 2x2 factorial combination of carbon
(C, as wheat straw) and nitrogen (N, as urea) and tracked resulting changes in CH4 emissions. 
Our measured fluxes from control areas were highly consistent in magnitude and timing with
those derived from the eddy correlation technique, and CH4 emission and residue decomposition
rates were higher with added N than without.  In conjunction with our NIGEC-supported work in
the Sandhills wetlands, we are now incorporating these results into our process-level model of
CH4 emissions in wetlands.<p>

Connor Stohlgren (age 11 3/4, 6th grade) was awarded "Best
of Fair" at the Timnath Elementary School 1994 Science Fair. 
His seven week project entitled "Will the Greenhouse Affect
Grass Species?" involved 3 types of grasses, two watering
regimes, and 24 jam jars (four replicates each).  His father,
Tom, who never won a prize for his research, just stayed out
of the young scientist's way.  Connor competes in the PR-1
District Science Fair next week.  <P>
