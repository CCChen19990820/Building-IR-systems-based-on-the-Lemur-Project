<H3>ALVIN BRIGHTBILL</H3>
Musical Director/Conductor<br>
Saddleback Master Chorale<br>
<p>
Alvin Brightbill is a very busy man. He is head of vocal music at Saddleback College, directs the community-based Saddleback Master Chorale, is adjunct professor of voice at UC Irvine, and maintains a rigorous performance schedule as a professional singer.
<p>
Professor Brightbill has long been associated with the Oregon Bach Festival, which is under the direction of renowned conductor Helmuth Rilling. For the Festival's 25th anniversary season in 1994, he appeared as both a soloist and member of the chorus. He has also appeared as tenor soloist with the Portland, Los Angeles, Euterpe and Western Opera Companies, the Roger Wagner Chorale, where he was featured on a recording of early Latin American music, and the William Hall Chorale, where he served as associate conductor. 
<p>
Professor Brightbill has one other claim to fame - when Carmine opened his mouth to sing an operatic aria on an episode of TV's "LaVerne and Shirley" show, it was Brightbill's tenor voice that was heard by millions.
<p>
Professor Brightbill has a bachelor of music degree from Chapman University and a master of fine arts degree in voice and conducting for California Institute of the Arts.

The Saddleback Master Chorale was formed over 30 years ago, primarily to provide musical accompaniment for the Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach. Now based at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, the 100-member Chorale has expanded its musical horizons to include performances at the Verdi Festival in San Diego, the Harvest Festival in Irvine Meadows, the Southern California Brahms Festival, among others. Last fall, the Chorale joined 900 other singers to present Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the Hollywood Bowl. The choristers were also featured on Swedish National Radio as an example of the excellent quality of choral music to be heard in Southern California.

<H2>ABOUT THE SADDLEBACK SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA ...</H2>

The Saddleback Symphony Orchestra, which operates under the auspices of the Division of Fine Arts & Communications at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, was founded in 1974. The Orchestra has increased its season from three to over 10 major concerts, performing regularly in Saddleback's intimate McKinney Theatre as well as venues throughout Orange County to the delight of more than 10,000 music lovers annually.
<p>
For the past three years the Saddleback Symphony has taken center stage at the Orange County Performing Arts Center for the City of Mission Viejo's "Celebration of the Arts," accompanying a chorus of over 300 voices. The Symphony's summer series has included Lake Mission Viejo's Sunset Concerts, Aliso Viejo's annual Fourth of July celebration, and now the fabulous three-day "Taste of Orange County" event held at the Irvine Spectrum. In 1990, the Symphony was honored by its selection to perform for the grand opening celebration and dedication of the John Wayne Airport.
<p>
The Saddleback Symphony specializes in a POPS series, which features "An Evening of Lerner & Loewe," "The Music of Rodgers & Hammerstein," and "A George Gershwin Spectacular." Many of the Symphony's concerts have involved full chorus and guest artists. The Orchestra also has a wide repertoire of Broadway and Hollywood favorites, and has been in the forefront technologically, staging laser-light and multi-media concerts which combine music with film. 
<p>
The Saddleback Symphony is also dedicated to nurturing the careers of talented young musicians. Each year, the Orchestra co-sponsors a concerto competition for instrumentalists and vocalists studying with members of the Music Teachers' Association of California or the American String Teachers' Association. In addition to cash prizes and trophies, the winners receive an invitation to perform as guest soloists with the Symphony in a special concert presentation.

<h1>Vostok Island</h1>
<BODY>

</BODY>

</HTML>
Our arrival at Vostok was at 1500 hrs.  The entrance through
the coral fringing reef was very small and extremely tricky
to negotiate with our Zodiacs to insure a safe shore landing.
 The captain informed us we should be ready to depart
the island in 2 1/2 hours to insure enough sunlight to detect
the water color differences between the navigable channel
and the dangerously shallow reef.
     The island was incredibly small and pristine.  Hundreds
of frigate birds lifted from their nests as the first of the
expedition teams landed on the coral beach.  We had three choices
: to the right or left down the beach encircling the island,
or directly ahead through the jungle to meet the beach on the
other side.  We chose the latter and made the right decision.
In the jungle overgrowth we observed an incredible number of
nesting birds, scarlet hermit crabs and even several giant
coconut crabs.   
Most<img src="junk.gif" align=left>
unique was the incredible amount of flotsam and jetsam observed
on the beaches.  Scattered everywhere among the white coral
and broken shells were hundreds of bottles, deserted fishing
gear including Japanese glass floats, and a seemingly
unending variety of plastic and Styrofoam objects.
 The pounding
surf on the windward side of this tiny island cut an 8 foot
high berm in the coral clump beach.  We found the partial remains
of a whale skeleton and planted a special "treasure" bottle
close to it.  This "treasure" bottle contained not only a 
greeting
message, but the names of everyone on the expedition.  If 
presented
to the captain of the World Discoverer, it promised the finder
a chilled bottle of French champagne!
     Our late arrival and short stay prevented us from entering
the water to dive with the numerous species of colorful tropical
reef fish that make the coral reefs of Vostok their full time
residence. Since the exploration of the island was so interesting
we were still very content....especially since we new that at
daybreak we would be at Caroline Atoll and an entire day of
underwater exploration.

<h1>Caroline Atoll</h1>
</HTML>
<img src="wreck1.gif" align=right>
Breathtakingly stunning but mysteriously ominous was the way
I would describe Caroline Atoll.  We launched the first Zodiac
at sunrise. Our Zodiac landing site was located on the south-west
side through a small, blind channel. At the end of this channel
the boats would be "walked" over the extremely shallow coral
reefs marking the entrance to the protected inner lagoon.
     Indeed the channel entrance was ominous since two vessels
were careened on the reef adjacent to the channel.  The first
was a 46 foot sailing boat from California that was skippered
by a young couple with an 11 year old son.  Their allowable
6 month-stay in French Polynesia had expired and they planned 
to resupply the ship in Hawaii before returning for 
another 6 month visit.  As their were leaving Caroline Atoll
through its narrow, blind entrance, their prop broke free of the 
drive shaft.  Within minutes the vessel was hopelessly stranded
on the reef.  Using their single-sideband radio the
shaken owners contracted the harbormaster in Tahiti for hiring
an ocean going tug to pull them from the reef.
<img src="boat1.gif" align=left>  The tug
arrived days later only to meet with a similar fate.  The tow
line accidentally got tangled in the tug's propellers and without
control the expensive tug was swept by the breaking waves onto
the reef wedging its steel hull deeply into the shallow coral
bottom.  After a distress call was make to Tahiti, a French
Coast Guard vessel arrived at Caroline rescuing both the family
from the sailboat and the crew from the tug.  Further details
of this incredible incident can be found in the cruising yacht
magazine Latitude 38.<img src="crab.gif" align=right>
     I waded the shallow reef and boarded the sailboard to find
it virtually as it had been abandoned less than a year previous.
 Owners clothes, books, personal possessions including the 11
year olds school books and toys still remained.  It was indeed
a tragic site, but by no means the last ship wreck we were to
uncover in walking the beaches of Caroling atoll.
     Our expedition team broke into three separate groups 
depending
on specific interest.  Edmundo and Christian, our resident 
archeologists
took a Zodiac to explore a previously reported ancient
Polynesian site on the northern most island of the atoll.
Bill, our expedition leader, took a large following into the
interior of one of the southern islands to document the local
bird populations.  Ron McPeak and myself went off to search
for the most interesting of several dive sites for the snorkel
expedition we planned after lunch.
     Reports from all teams were fascinating, however the dive
sites we located including entire reefs composed of giant 
Tridnacia
clams was more that I could have ever imagined!

<h1>Mataiva Island</h1>
<BODY>

</BODY>

</HTML>
Mataiva was our first port of call in French Polynesia.
We arrived as the sun was breaking over the horizon, 
approximately
0545. 

<img src="huts.gif" align=left> While part of the expedition boarded Zodiacs for a shore
excursion into the village, my preference was a scuba dive on
the coral reef just north of the lagoon entrance.  Wearing my
special full-face mask with underwater microphone
connected to my underwater video system, I provided
a 45 minute live, underwater lecture which focused on the coral
diversity of this unique reef. Scuba tanks empty, I remained
in the water another 2 hours snorkeling in shallower water just
outside the breaking wave zone.  The diversity of the fish was
incredible.  I could often see more than 30 different species
within the field of view of my dive mask!

<P>
<H3>General Information</H3>
	Over fifteen years experience instructing at the college and university level as well as teaching high school, junior high and directing programs k-6 has given me depth and breadth as an educator.  As President of <A HREF="#bridges"> Building Bridges Seminars</A> I  work with  corporations, professional, medical and educational groups.  Particular areas of specialization are interpersonal, group, public speaking, gender and intercultural communication.  My undergraduate work was done in speech communication at Idaho State University and graduate work at University of Maryland.
<P>
<H3>Saddleback College And Other Teaching Experience</H3>
	This fall will be my twelfth year at Saddleback.  I taught here from 1979-1989 and then a transfer with my husband's work took us to Long Island, New York for six years. I returned to staff at Saddleback in January of this year. Subject areas at Saddleback have included <A HREF="#speech1">Speech 1</A> (Communication Fundamentals)  and  Speech 105 (Interpersonal Communication).  I enjoy the diversity of the student body and constantly challenge myself to keep classes relevant and stimulating. 

	Earlier experience has included teaching speech at St Joseph's Women's College & University of Maryland, both in Maryland and teaching junior high school and high school in Michigan. 
<P>
<A NAME="bridges"><H3>Building Bridges Seminars</H3></A>
When we moved to New York in 1989 I incorporated and did business as <I>Building Bridges Seminars</I>  offering a variety of communication curricula to assorted professions and providers of speech and communication education. This diversity of audiences and subject matter provided me with exciting real-life experiences not only developing and delivering presentations myself but also working with individuals who were immediately using skills learned in their jobs & communities. A typical day might find me teaching Intercultural Communication at State University of Stony Brook's Continuing Education Corporate Development Program in the morning, working with 5th. graders with a Peer Mediation program I developed and then facilitating a Parenting Network group at a high school in the evening.
<P>
<H4>Speaking topics include:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>Team Building and Communication Skills
	<LI>Managing Conflict:  Anything's Negotiable
	<LI>He Says--She Says:  Men and Women in Communication
	<LI>Intercultural Communication:  Understanding Diversity
	<LI>Gender Communication And Sexual Harassment
	<LI>Speak Easy:  Keys To Effective Public Speaking
	<LI>Gender-Bias In The Classroom:  Fact or Fiction?
	<LI>Effective Communication Climates For Learning
	<LI>How To Be The Cool Head In The Hot Situation
</UL>
Further information on these topics is available upon request.
<P>
<H3>Personal Data</H3>
Growing up in rural Idaho made me want to see what other parts of the country were like. Since then I've lived in Nevada, Michigan, California and New York. My husband Vince and I have two children, Michael and Katie, and now live in San Juan Capistrano. I love teaching and strive to be open, receptive and available to students ideas and needs. I look forward to a stimulating and productive fall of 1996 at Saddleback.

<P>The Speech Department offers courses which develop and enhance oral
communication skills at all levels. In this rapid-growing, ever-changing
world, the ability to express ideas clearly, concisely and with self-assurance
is an invaluable tool to anyone regardless of his or her field of endeavor.
Students can focus on interpersonal communication, persuasion, group dynamics
and leadership, or can improve and enhance their vocal and articulatory
control. In addition, the oral interpretation and readers' theatre courses
give students a means of communicating the human condition both physically
and verbally, while helping them to develop a strong stage presence. </P>

<P>Saddleback College won its first national championship, not in a sports
arena, but in a speaker's forum. Since capturing this national title in
1982, forensics students have won numerous regional and state speech and
debate competitions, and have consistently placed in the top 10 in national
tournaments. Saddleback's forensics program teaches students how to express
themselves effectively, concisely, and with confidence, all of which leads
to success in the classroom, the job interview, and the work place. Good
public speaking and debate skills are particularly helpful to students
considering careers in law, politics, business, and mass communications.

<p>Aikido is a relatively modern Japanese martial art based upon nonresistance rather than strength. It is a non aggressive, noncompetitive art based upon a philosophy that stresses harmony with nature and control of body and mind. In Aikido, an attack is never stopped; it is guided in a way that causes the attacker to be thrown by the momentum of his own attack. Aikido develops the individual mentally as well as physically. Physically it produces good posture, physical skill and quickness of body reflexes. Mentally it develops coordination, determination, responsibility and etiquette. (R-E)</p><br>

<p>When Comet Halley returned to the inner Solar System in the winter of 1985 and the spring of 1986 it became the most closely scrutinized comet of all time. Unfortunately, the l985-86 return was not anywhere as spectacular as its previous visits. A combination of Earth's orbital position, the Comet's path around the sun and the greater amount of industrial and light pollution, made this passage visually the worst in 2,000 years. Even under the most ideal conditions, observers at mid-Northern latitudes had a modest display of this most fabled comet at best.  (R-E)</p><br>

Saddleback College's award-winning Civic Light Opera (SCLO), its Guest Artist Series, and the fabulous "Just for Kids" program are made possible through the fundraising efforts of the ANGELS. This support organization for the performing arts is made up of residents, civic and business leaders, service organization members and lovers of the arts-in other words, your friends and neighbors. 
<p>
If you're a fan of theater, of performances with heart and humor, of performing artists on the cutting edge of their disciplines, then you're an ANGEL! Your support will not only keep the arts going and growing, it will raise the quality of the programming! Everybody wins! By becoming an ANGEL, you not only help bring cultural excellence to your community, you also help provide a creative environment in which the arts and the artists can grow and flourish!
<p>
Make an Angel membership your priority. The performing arts at Saddleback College cannot, will not, survive without YOUR support!
<p>
<H4>WHERE DO YOUR ANGEL DOLLARS GO?</H4>
<p>
<strong>Scholarships.</strong> Today's students are tomorrow's teachers, actors, designers, technicians, and playwrights. The Angels provide financial assistance to aspiring creative artists to help them continue their education and/or pursue their careers.
<p>
<strong>Sponsorships.</strong> The Angels are the proud sponsors of the Guest Artist Series, the award-winning Saddleback Civic Light Opera (SCLO), and "Just for Kids," an on-going program which entertains, educates and stimulates young imaginations.
<p>
<strong>Special Equipment Purchases.</strong> The Angels make the purchase of big-ticket items possible-like the new tram, which transports disabled and elderly audience members from their cars to the theater door
<p>
<strong>Innovative Programs.</strong> The Angels back a number of innovative programs and services-like childcare for theater-going parents. This unique program lets parents drop off their little bundles of joy at Saddleback College's nationally accredited Child Development Center. While the kids dine on pizza and milk and make new friends, their parents can enjoy a relaxing dinner in a local restaurant, then catch an SCLO show in either the McKinney or Cabaret Theatre.
And right now, the ANGELS are leading the charge to build an ampitheater and regional performing arts facility in south Orange County.

One of the largest, most innovative performing arts programs in Orange County exists at Saddleback College. From September through May, a dazzling array of international artists-from world-class dance companies, music ensembles and theatrical troupes to family-oriented magic/comedy shows, puppet theaters and vaudeville acts-take to the 400-seat McKinney Theatre stage to the delight of community members of all ages.
<p>
During the summer months the college becomes Southern California's largest producer of Broadway musicals through its award-winning Saddleback Civic Light Opera (SCLO). In past years, audiences have been captivated by such hits as Peter Pan, Singin' in the Rain, Ain't Misbehavin', and A Chorus Line. In 1993 the productions of Sweeney Todd and Oklahoma! captured nine Drama-Logue awards for Outstanding Achievement in Theatre, plus nine "ROBBY" nominations from the Los Angeles theater critics. SCLO's 1994 show, Me & My Girl, received three Drama-Logue awards-best actor, actress and director.
<p>
Both the Guest Artist Series and SCLO are made possible through the fundraising efforts of the <A HREF="angels.html">Angels</A>, a support organization for the performing arts.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#810C11">How to Register:</FONT></B> To
enroll in any Honors Program course except SPSW 1, register by telephone
or in person as you would for any other course. You should then contact
the Honors Office (see the e-mail address and telephone number below).
SPSW 1 is open by instructor interview only.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#811011">What The Courses Are Like:</FONT></B>
Honors courses are small, with a maximum class size of 25. Because of the
size and population of the courses, instructors are able to be more flexible
in instructional methods. Whether the environment is outside in the field,
in a laboratory, or in a seminar, the emphasis is always on close interaction
between Honors students and faculty. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#810E0C">What Courses We Have: </FONT></B>The
Honors Program is growing continuously, so any detailed list of courses
would not be up-to-date. The present portfolio includes classes in anatomy,
anthropology, art, astronomy, biology, computer science, economics, English
literature, foods and nutrition, geology, history, marine science, peace
studies and political science.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1><B><FONT COLOR="#810707">The Program's Structure:</FONT></B>
Although Honors electives are spread across the curriculum, the Program
has a strong base in composition and humanities, which make up its core
requirements (see the <B><A HREF="honcomp.html">Program Completion</A>
</B>page). To complete the Program in good standing, a student must maintain
at least a 3.25 G.P.A. overall and in Honors courses. At least five Honors
courses must be taken: three core courses and at least two electives. </FONT></P>

transfer institutions. Students who successfully complete the Honors Program
are eligible for guaranteed or preferential admission consideration with
several colleges and universities. Some agreements contain financial aid

these agreements. </FONT></P>

<b><big>O</big></b>n February 8, 1996 at 9:30 a.m. and again at 11:00 a.m. Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, California broke new ground in the area of distance learning.  Project G.O.A.L. (Global Ocean Adventure Learning) provided the first live, interactive, undersea broadcast with simultaneous transcription of pictures and text to the world wide web.  Students in Tony Huntley's Oceanography class at Saddleback College and Mary Anne Winegard's fifth grade science class at Tustin Ranch Elementary School, in Tustin California spent two 30 minute sessions asking diver and professor Joe Valencic questions about the underwater environment off Dana Point, California.  As these sessions took place, a team of programmers, writers and webmasters, headed by Nancy Reynolds, Mark Sierakowski and Mike Estes (from the Innovation and Technology Center, Saddleback College) composed web pages in real time, allowing netizens around the world to share in the adventure.</p><p>
In the days since the broadcast, we've cleaned up, edited and added even more of the pictures snapped live on Feb. 8.  Cruise this site and enjoy the wonder of our <i>UNDERSEA CLASSROOM</i> as we make history through technology.</p><p>



<b>The Narrative</b>: This is the descriptive narrative, composed as the event took place.  It has been edited for spelling and scientific veracity.  This text was written by Penny Lewis, Connie MacClain and Susan Lemkin.  Some pictures snapped in real time by Nihar Mehta are included here.

<title>NARRATIVE</title>
</head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<small>This page was designed for viewing in Netscape 1.2 or better!</small><br><br>
<h3>Narrative of the First Live, Interactive Broadcast
</h3>

<img src="tony.gif" align=left>
<p>9:30 Dr. Tony Huntley gave students an introduction to what is being done this morning.  Professor Valencic's class has an assignment: </p>
<p>Create a species list and write a species account for two organisms from the list. </p>

<p>What's going to happen: </p>

<p>We will call the dive boat via celll phone, which links to Joe under water.
Those students with questions should come up to the front of the room to use the phone. Questions will broadcast to 200,000 homes in Orange County, so think before you talk.  Each broadcast with Joe will last about 30 minutes. </p>

<p>Nancy Reynolds will demonstrate websites (ours and others), especially Cyber24 . </p>

<p>We are going to be developing Web Pages right here.  Connie McClain and Penny Lewis are writing a narrative and Mike Estes is integrating it into the Web Page.</p>
<hr>
<IMG SRC=UW2.JPEG>
<hr>

<p>9:40 Tony Huntley contacted Tustin Ranch Elementary School.</p>

<p>As we tried to establish contact with Joe, Nancy Reynolds showed us Hong Kong via Cyber24.</P>

<p>We now have a live picture.  Kate Roth is doing the introduction for Saddleback TV. We cut to a short clip of Professor Valencic explaining how we are able to view him live underwater, communicate with him via cellular phone and connect to the web.</p>

<p>At last!!! We are live, underwater with Professor Valencic. Looks pretty murky, Joe can't get down more than about 20 ft, because he's having problems with cable tenders. He seems to be hung up at the moment and unable to dive further.  Visibility is about 1 ft. We've established audio contact with Joe.  Welcome to our underwater trip - Tony and Joe exchange hellos. We think that Joe may not be able to hear us, but we can hear him. Joe is descending to the bottom.

<p>Joe is holding up seastar, the white dot on the top is known as a madroporite. It's part of the water vascular system. This animal is an echinoderm and exhibits radial symmetry.  Joe can now hear Dr. Huntley. The crowd applauds wildly.  Joe asks for questions.</p>

<p>"What's the water temperature down ther?" 52 degrees.  He's putting his finger on a sea urchin.  It's back in acrevice for protection, also on the bottom we have a number of shells we'll talk about.  </p>

<p>Question:  "Are you having fun down there?  With all of the kelp beds below you would you say they that the sediments are mostly biogenous or lithogenous?"  75% of the bottom seems to be lithogenous, but - as you look closely you will see lots of little shells and shell bbits -it's about 25%  biogenous sediment.</p>

<p>We also have man-made artifacts down here... Joe shown us a fishing rod - "true underwater fishing - you don't have to have anything on the hook!" Joe will bring it back to the classroom to examine a little more.</p>

<p> Tustin Ranch student asks, "What do phytoplankton eat?"    Phytoplankton are plants so they photosynthesize.  They need sunlight and nutrients.  </p>

<p> Oh wow! We have a Horned Shark. The dorsal fin has a clear, sharp spine, hence the name.  Uses its serrated teeth to crush its food. Joe's really being thrown around underwater.  He has a vial which contains fluoroscene dye to show us the current. The incredible surge has caused him to drop the vial. <p>

<p>Scott at Tustin Ranch asks "How do octopus change color?</p>

<p>Chormatophores, pigment cells that expand and contract. Scott, you'll have to take one of Joe's Oceanography classes.</p>


<IMG SRC=UW3.JPEG>
<hr>

<p>Joe shows us a small urchin, about 2 cm across.</p>

<p> We have lost audio to Joe. </p>

<p>Joe moving close to sea fan which we can see - it's moving back and forth with the surge. </p>
<p>Tony reconnects with Joe.</p>

<p>Question "How deep are you?"  30 ft. Joe shows the depth gauge (about 34 ft).  His air is about 1400 psi. </p>

<p>Question: "Where are you - what's your location?"  About 1/4 mile south of the Dana Point Whistle Buoy. </p>

<p>9:50 Here we have a garibaldi. It swims by rapidly. Here's an interesting mollusk,  wavy top turbin.  It has a muscular foot. It's in agroup called gastropods - "gastro" means stomach, "pod" means foot.  It has a round shell called an operculum which closes over the opening.  Joe puts it back on the reef. </p>

<p>Nicole at Tustin asks, "How does algae grow?" </p>

<p>Most algae use photosynthetic pigments.
Brown algae are the largest - and can grow up to 2 ft a day - the "Jack in the Beanstalk" of the sea.
Red algae have a red pigment and are better adapted to depper waters..
Most algae don't have a root structure, they have a holdfast to keep them in one place. </p>
<p>
While looking at algae, Joe finds a tunicate.  It is long and slender.  It has an incurrent and excurrent siphon through whihc water flows. Tuncatyes are very adsvanced animals related to chordates (animals with a supporting structure called a notochord down their backs).</p>

<p>Question:  "Do red algae cause red tides?"?
Red tide caused by plankton, not algae.  He continues by showing us some red coralline algae.
The algae have a calcium carbonate structure.  The red pigment allows it to photosynthesize at deeper depths. </p>

<p>"Hey Joe was that another garibaldi?" - Yes  Now the horned shark is back. Appears he likes the camera and is excited about making a debut on the WWW.  "Is  it male or female?" - It's a female! Professor Valencic chides his colleague, Dr. Huntley, " I think this would be a good date for you!"  There was wild applause from the group, but Dr. H. was not amused. </p>

<p>Joe says being down here in this current is somewhere between a root canal and being sat upon by a sumo wrestler! </p>

<p>Joe is now checking his air supply, and says that he hopes his current experience doesn't discourage anyone from diving. </p>

<p>10:10 Our pictures and text have just begun to appear on the world wide web! </p>

<p>Joe is going to come up to the surface now.  "I hope everybody has enjoyed this - it's taken a lot of work from many people."  Joe is pressing a button on his suit which gives him positive buoyancy and he moves up, despite 42 lbs of lead on hbis weight belt.  There is a change in the coloration of the water as he ascends; it is becoming clearer and less blue.  Coming up - now we see him on the surface and the boat. </p>
<p>10:15 Our first broadcast has ended.</p>
<p>Applause! </p>

<title>PRESENTATION II</title>
</head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h3>Narrative of the Second Live, Interactive Broadcast
</h3><p>
<img src="bill.gif" align=left>
<p>10:28 Between classes, Joe continues to give us information from the surface at the boat.  One thing that we were told is that the type of mask that he is using uses almost 2 times the amount of air.  This is becasue of the microphone designed into the mask </p>

<p>Bill Weisgerber, Professor of Business Science is introducing the project to his Marketing class.  They are interested in the technology and the building of the Web page, as well as the actual dive.  Tony is introducing the program the next Oceanography class.  Classroom instructions and assignments are repeated from the first session. </p>

<p>Tustin Ranch Elementary is now on the phone. </p>



<p>Our typing is being sent to Michael Estes for the web page; Nihar Mehta is downloading pictures.  Mark Sierakowski is coordinating all of the data links.  Tony explains the Cyber24 link and their project "Painting on the Walls of the Digital Cave"  Saddleback College is one out of 100 world-wide sites chosen to participate. </p>



<p>They are refilling and checking out air tanks and batteries on the boat, thus the program is running late. The boat and divers must necessarily dictate the schedule. </p>


<IMG SRC=UW5.JPEG>
<hr>


<p>11:00 We are now live as Joe begins the descent with the camera.  The visibility is very poor.  The cables get tangled and impede movement. Now they are on the bottom in some of the worst diving conditions.  </p>

<p>Joe is taking us along the bottom at a depth of 35 feet.  The audio connection is made between Tony and Joe. </p>

<p>Joe is going to demonstrate the surge with the use of a dye.  He opened a vial and let the flourecsine dye  color the water and show the current. </p>

<p>He shows a clam shell with a serrated pattern and a sand tube worm encrusted on it.   Now moving close the reef with a red material that is identified as a red crested volcano sponge. </p>

<p>Joe shows the color change when a red color correctiong filter is placed over the camera lens. He explains that red colors do not penetrate very deeply into the water.  So the filter "adds" them back.  </p>

<p>Question: Keith Jay from Saddleback College asks "What is causing the surge and movement?"</p>
<p>The heavy swell today and yesterday have been creating these conditions. </p>

<p>11:15 On the bottom there are a lot of urchins.  On a rock we see a Bat Star.  A sea cucumber is near it.  Sea cucumbers have  characteristics similar to urchins- five part anatomy and tube feet. Sea cucumbers are harvested as food by the Japanese. </p>

<p>Vicki at Tustin Ranch asks "Why do sea urchins have spines?"   The spines are for protection as well as assisting in locomotion.  Underneath the body (oral surface) is the mouth structure.  This urchin is very much a vegetarian, eating primarily algae.  The large red urchins, fewer in number have a very long scientific name: <i>Strongylocentrotus franciscanus</i>. Urchins are also eaten.  The eggs of urchins are a <i>uni</i> in Japanese, and you frequently see them at the sushi bar.  Divers get 50 to 75 cents a pound for them. </p>


<p>Heather at Tustin Ranch would like to know how many types of dolphins there are? Joe refers this question to Tony. Dolphins belong to a large group of whale-like animals called cetaceans. There are about 90 species of cetaceans in the sea.  Dolphin is a broad category that covers those cetaceans which have teeth.  However, when you say dolphin, most folks are talking about the smaller sized toothed cetaceans,  about 2 m (6 feet) in size.  Locally we have many species, including Bottle-nosed dolphins and Harbor Porpoises. </p>

<p>Joe finds a Chestnut Cowrie (<i>Cypraea spadicea</i>). This smoothly polished shell is  one of the few  cowrie type molluscs in California.  This cowrie is a carnivore, eating anemones, sponges and occasionally snail eggs.</p><p>A surge pushes Joe about 30' and upside down ! </p>

<p>Question from Saddleback College: "Will you be bringing back any samples?"  Yes, Joe  will be bring back some shells and a sample of the
lithogenous/biogenous sediment for examination in the lab. </p>

<p>Joe shows us apiece of abalone shell and clam shells. We are interrupted with the return of the Horned Shark. We get a good look at the horn located on the poeterior end of the dorsal fin.  We also see tthe tiny serrated teeth used for grinding and crushing food.</p>

<p>A student at Tustin Ranch asks, "How long does the horned shark live?"  In the neighborhood of 10-12 years. But that's an estimate, we really don't know for sure.  This one is about 2-1/2 feet long, and is probably 5 or so yeares old. The are very non-agressive. </p>

<p>Joe asks a question:  "Is the picture  better with the red correcting filter or not? "  The class vote is for the picture  without the filter! </p>

<p>Question: Have you seen any lobster?" I would bring one back if had I seen some. It is really too rough for lobsters to stay in the area."  They are a lot smarter than Joe! </p>


<p>Morgan at Tustin Ranch asks "What is the biggest sea urchin you have ever seen?"  Joe says about 9 to 11" across. They eat algae and if there is a lott of algae, they grow larger. </p>


<p>Question: "If you flew up to the surface would you get the bends? "</p>

<p>Excessive amount of nitrogen in the blood causes bends.  This generally only occurs on long dives to 60 feet or more.  The surge tossing Joe about is probably more dangerous. Especially with the possiblity of being throw onto the sea urchin spines.  </p>

<p>We see a gorgonian, the California Sea Fan (<i>Muricea californica</i>).  </p>

<p>Steve at Saddleback asks, "When you were back at the brown algae, I saw some encrusted organisms. What are they? </p>

<p> The larger light dots are snails. However, the lacy light material on the blade is a Bryozoan, <i>Membranipora tuberculata</i>.  It is colony of animals commonly found on the blades of brown algae. Look for these animals on drift algae thrown onto the beaches this winter. </p>

<p>Joe shows us an orange volcano sponge </p>

<p>Judy at Saddleback asks, "What type of sediment is present in this area?" Joe shown us the bottom and explains that most of the sediment is lithogenous, from rock origins. Biogenous sediment from shells, spines make up about 25% of the bottom here. He will bring a sample back. </p>

<p>11:40 Joe shows us his gauges. Depth gauge says 35 feet  and there is 400 lbs of air. He need to come up to the surface now. </p>

<p>Joe says thanks to all who made this hook-up possible. </p>

<h3>17 SEPT.: Fanning Island</h3>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3> 

	Fanning Island, referred to by the locals as Tabuaern Atoll,
is named for it's discoverer, Captain Edmund Fanning.  The
island itself consists of a classic circular coral atoll ringed
with palm trees.  The island is located 3 degrees 52 minutes
N and 159 degrees 20 minutes W, about 75 NM SE of Toraina Island
.
 The island is administered as part of the Republic of Kiribati.
 The District Commissioner for Fanning Island resides at 
Kititimati
Atoll (Christmas Island). </p>
<p>The islands of this atoll are thickly covered with coconut
<img src="palm.gif" align=right>
palms 18 to 27 m (60 to 90 feet)high, visible at a distance
of about 15 NM.  The barrier reef is not more than a meter
or so high.

<h3>Climate and Oceanographic Setting</h3>
<p>Prevailing winds are from the E to ENE with an average speed
of about 10 knots.  Unfortunately during our visit the wind
increased to 16 to 18 knots and created a significant wind chop
in the lagoon.  Rainfall here is but a fraction of that at
Palmyra, averaging only 75 inches per year.
Currents in the vicinity of the island are both strong and
variable.  At English Harbor, the major settlement, the flood
current runs at 4.5 to 5 knots and the ebb current at 7 knots.
 Slack water lasts only about 15 minutes!
<h3>Landing</h3>
<p>The island's only harbor is English Harbor situated within
the barrier reef, near the SW side of the island. It is a natural
harbor with a settlement situated on the S side of the entrance.
 The landing for our Zodiacs was very easy, especially since
the locals were happy to assist.  Upon landing, we were escorted
to a larger open-air hut.  A musical and dance program was
given.  Following the program school supplies, including two
Apple computers, scanner, copier etc... were provided to the
local school.  Fanning Island has the only secondary school
in the Line Islands.
<h3>Scientific Observations</h3>
Eleven species of birds were observed including: Great Frigate
Bird, Red-footed Booby, Brown-footed Booby, Brown Noddy, Black
Noddy, White-tailed Tropicbird, Golden Plover and Wandering
Tattler.</p>
<p> The dive party visited two different reef areas within the
lagoon.  Strong 20 knot winds and a heavy swell prevented diving
outside the lagoon.  The first area visited was sandy with
scattered patches of coral.  The fish were abundant. 
<img src="cuc2.gif" align=left> Our guide,
Naan, told us that sharks were never observed on the inner lagoon
reefs.   The corals seemed quite healthy despite occasional
sightings of Crown-of-Thorns sea stars and a large population
of coral munching Parrotfish.
Our second dive was in a sandy, sheltered area to the south
of the lagoon entrance.  Several species of sea cucumbers were
observed with densities as high as 3 per square meter.
  On
Christmas island, our next stop, sea cucumbers are sold at up
to $7 per kilogram.  Also abundant was species of cowry, known
locally as "money cowry", as well as several species of sea 
stars.
 Several species of crabs were seen on the pristine coconut
palm beaches.  I collected vials of the unique biogenous 
sediments
.
 At 1700 h we hoisted anchor and proceeded south at 12.5 knots
to Christmas Island.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+2>From an autobiographical perspective,
I have been an academic dean at Saddleback College for almost 15 years.
I started as a professor of art history with an emphasis in the arts of
Africa. With both graduate and undergraduate training from the University
of California, I have been privileged to bring a &quot;non-Western&quot;
point of view to the curriculum and educational programming at Saddleback
College. In addition to my academic activities, my wife Nancy and I are
kept busy with three children, two of whom are still in college. Along
with lecturing occasionally, I also enjoy staying busy participating in
the arts in Southern California. As for those of you who may know me, I
almost never cook any more, can't find enough time to read anything interesting
and am always curious how people survive in a world gone mad.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<TITLE>Palmyra, 15 Sept., Anthropology and Ecological
Importance</TITLE>

<BODY>
<body background="rckhead2.gif">


<META NAME="AUTHOR" CONTENT="Nihar Mehta, Tony Huntley, Joe
Valencic, Travis  White">


<h4>Anthropology and Archaeology</h4>

	At 1300 h a group lead by Christian and Edmundo walked to the 
airfield and fighter runway, now used by nesting Sooty Terns.  
Concrete bunkers for machine gun emplacements were seen at the 
ends on the runway.  A brick oven for baking bread was seen.  A 
hulk of a wrecked plane was also seen.  A large 3m x 4m cistern, 
built to supply water to the island, is now used by Roger to 
provide bathwater for an old bathtub.
	It is hard to imagine that 6000 troops lived on Palmyra during 
W.W.II but the rusting remnants that remain visible through the 
dense foliage make the case certain.  A photographic inventory of 




the W.W.II artifacts was made by Bonnie Doester.

<h4>Ecological Importance</h4>
	Several years ago a luxury condo resort development was proposed 




for Palmyra atoll.  The NOAA expedition documented the potential 
hazards of such a development.
	Of islands under US control, Palmyra atoll in unique in terms of 




location and vegetation.  The conclusions reached by the 1992 
NOAA expedition stated that because of the island's high rainfall 




and complex vegetation structure it is significantly different 
from other seabird colonies.  Although its total land area is 
small (229 hectares), the  breeding of pelagic birds, and the 
fish and invertebrate diversity cause its ecological importance 
to far outweigh its size.  
	Development on Palmyra would have far reaching effects.  Seabird 




populations would surely be affected.  Palmyra supports the 
second largest Red-footed Booby colony in the world.  Due to 
their evolution in the absence of land-based predators, nesting 
seabirds are often adversely effected by human development.  On 
Heron Island, in the Great Barrier Reef of Australia, resort 
development over the last 60 years as resulted in the loss of 7 
species of breeding seabirds.
	The NOAA report summarize the potential effects: "Even though 
only 47% of the land area of the atoll (Cooper-Meng and Sand) 
would be affected by the proposed development, it would be 
impossible to carry out this project without having dire effects 
on the entire ecosystem."  Although the luxury condo concept 
appears to have died, there are plans to develop an exclusive 
$10,000 per person per week ultra-luxurious fish camp.</p>

<h3>18 SEPT.: Christmas Island</h3>

<p>0800 We arrive at Christmas Island.  This is a large atoll,
having one of the largest land areas of any atoll: almost 140
square miles.  It is the best known of the Line Islands with
a population of about 2500 spread out into the villages of 
<img src="fish.gif" align=right>
London,
Banana and Poland.  Because there are few cash job, either with
the government or with the fisheries, most people live a 
subsistence
lifestyle collecting copra to survive.  Our plans are not only
for scientific observations, but to attend a performance this
afternoon by the Maneba dance group.</p><p>We were fortunate
to have visit onboard Tekinaiti Kaiteie of Roton village (Roton
is the local name for London village).  Tek is s former 
government
minister and current store owner-seaweed/sea cucumber exporter.
 Having business in Hawaii, he boarded the boat for a one-way
trip back to Christmas Island.  He offered to take diving on
the sites where he collects and raises sea cucumbers.</p><p>
Our plan is to launch a scuba equipped Zodiac at 0815 for the
first of several dives around this atoll.  Water temperature
is estimated at 84 degrees F, with visibility near 200 ft. 
Manta rays, green turtles and... unfortunately several pelagic
sharks have been reported in the area.  With only 15 minutes
to ready my gear, I will close this report and give it Tek who
will transmit it directly from Christmas Island...

<P>
This website records the log of a trip on Society Expedition's
<I><B>MV World Discoverer</B></I> that began on September 11,
1995 when Professor Joseph Valencic left Honolulu for the Line
Islands and Tahiti. The map at the right shows the route that
will be taken during this trip.
<P>
On Sept. 29, Dr. Tony Huntley will take over in Tahiti and travel
to the Marquesas, Tuamotus , Gambiers, Pitcairns and Easter 
Island.
Look for &quot;In the Wake of the Bounty.&quot;
<P>
What follows are regular updates of text and pictures from these
trips.
<H2>11 Sept. Honolulu, Hawaii </H2>

<P>
The ship departs Honolulu this evening at 1800. Did a quick 
check-out
dive this afternoon. On each of the islands we hope to use 
underwater
video to document species present. <IMG src="joe.gif" align=left>
<p></p><p></p>
<b><i> About The Equipment...</i></b> <p></p>
The yellow housing contains a Hi-Band 8mm camcorder with wide
angle optics and full electronic controls
including zoom, focus, and white balance.
Mounted below the housing is a 100
watt U/W light. The white cylinder is a miniaturized buoyant
broadcast system that can send audio/video and receive audio
from audiences 20km away. It is connected to the
U/W video system by a special underwater cable. The gray dive
mask permits underwater narration and interactive
lectures by Professor Valencic.

<H2>17 Sept. Fanning Atoll</H2>

<P>
Named for its discoverer, Captain Edmund Fanning, this classic
circular coral atoll is ringed with palms.  Our plan is larch
our expedition Mk V Zodiacs and travel inside the lagoon to the
village of Baerau where the local inhabitants and school children
plan a native singing and dancing program.

<H2>18 Sept. Christmas Island</H2>

<P>
The World Discoverer will travel almost 200 nautical miles to
visit our next port of call, infamous Christmas Island. Named
by Captain Cook, its discoverer, this unique island has a well
developed history tracing its  European roots back to Christmas
Day 1777.

<H2>19 Sept. Enroute to Malden Island</H2>

<P>
Our 402 nautical mile voyage from Christmas to Malden Island took
us across the imaginary great circle called the Equator.  By 
right
of passage, first timers crossing the Equator by ship were 
required
to be initiated into King Neptune's domain, making the transition
from neophyte Pollywog to seasoned Shellback!  This was indeed
a ritual we Shellbacks aimed to preserve.....so, Pollywogs beware
as our expedition log  so vividly recounts!

Expedition Log</a>


<H2>20 Sept. Malden Island</H2>
<P>
Malden is an uninhabited coral island fringed by an incredible
reef.  It is inhabited by large numbers of masked, brown and 
red-footed
boobies.  There is evidence that the island did, at one time,
have a prolonged period of human settlement.  Our plan was to
visit early Polynesian archeological sites and explore the 
intriguing,
rusting remains of machinery used for the mining of guano 
deposits
left by the birds.  Guano was highly prized as fertilizer by the
Australians who occupied Malden from about 1850 to 1920.  The
tombstones of workers that died on Malden pay tribute to both
dedication and hardship.  We will also investigate the ruins of
a British observation base used between 1965 and 1959 during the
British H-bomb tests.   Malden is a time capsule of antiquities,
to one degree preserved by isolation yet weathered by both the
elements and the passage of time.
<P>

<a href="http://www.saddleback.cc.ca.us/div/mse/day20.html">
Expedition Log</a>
<H2>21 Sept. Starbuck Island </H2>

<P>
Starbuck is a small uninhabited island, located 5 deg. 38 min.
S and 155 deg. 55 min. W or about 105 nautical miles SSW or Malden
Island. The highest elevation is only 8 to 10 feet.  Today, the
only indication that humans have occupied the tiny island is 
evidence
of phosphate mining in the late 1800's and a British-built 
warning
beacon.  During the nesting season, sooty terns are found there
in large numbers.  We were even lucky enough to spot several 
large
green turtles as our Zodiacs approached the rugged shoreline in
search of a safe landing site.  While high breaking waves and
strong shore currents prevented landing, we were given the 
opportunity
to dive both with feeding Manta rays and very inquisitive white
and black-tip reef sharks!
<P>

Expedition Log</a>

<H2>22 Sept. Vostok Island</H2>

<P>
Aside from the occasional camp of a passing fisherman, Vostok
is today uninhabited.  In prior years it has been sporadically
worked for guano.  Measuring 1/2 mile  by 1/2 mile, the island
is a nesting site for fairy terns and brown noddies as well as
great frigatebirds and boobies.  Around the island, 
coral-encrusted
drop-offs are home to hundreds of species of brilliantly colored
tropical reef fish.

<H2>23 Sept. Caroline Atoll</H2>

<P>
Indescribably beautiful are only words for the 22 islets strung
along a coral reef that stretches for 6 nautical miles that 
making
up Caroline atoll.  Some of the islets rise almost 20 feet above
sea level, and are overgrown with coconut palms, pandanus and
other coral reef vegetation.  Although uninhabited today, 
Polynesians
once made this their home.  We plan a visit to several 
archaeological
sites that exhibit temple graves and platforms.  A Zodiac 
expedition
to the many small islets gave incredible views of the red-footed
booby, geat and lesser frigatebirds, black noodies, white terns,
and reef herons.  Land explorations not only revealed scarlet
red hermit crabs and  large coconut crabs but several unique 
abandoned
camps; one containing a hand-dug fresh-water well lined with 
coral
from the nearby reefs.

<H2>24 Sept. Flint Island</H2>

<P>
Flint island, although originally settled between 1872 and 1934,
is today uninhabited.  Phosphates were mined in the late 1800's.
 The island, 3 miles long by 1/2 mile wide, was once planted with
30,000 coconut trees and the result is that today it is richly
wooded with palms and entirely surrounded by an abandoned reef.
 There is currently some talk of perhaps starting pearl farms
on the island but it is indeed an inhospitable place.  Due to
its small size and unique shape, there is no lee making landing
extremely difficult.  After the Chief Mate of the World 
Discoverer
flipped not one but two of our Mk V Zodiacs in approaching to
land, we declined further attempts and surveyed this island at
a distance through high powered binoculars.  It was indeed an
adventure!

<H2>24b Sept. Mataiva Island</H2>

<P>
After crossing the International Dateline and a passage of 274
nautical miles from elusive Flint Island, we arrived at this 
coconut
palm covered paradise.  The first European too discover this 
atoll
was the famous Russian explorer Bellingshausen on 30th July 1820.
 Palua, the only village, is situated at the northwest side of
the island.  Being Sunday we would enter in time to attend native
church services and then dive it's crystal clear waters.

<H2>25 Sept. Bora Bora</H2>

<P>
&quot;The lagoon.....was a crystal blue, the beaches were 
dazzling
white, and ever on the outer reef the spray leaped mountainously
into the air.&quot; James Michener, <I>Return to Paradise<B> 
</B></I>Michener's description could not be more appropriate in
describing Bora Bora.  The main island is about 5 miles from 
north
to south with the two outstanding features being Mt. Pahia, a
double peak of 2,025' and 2,159&quot; Mt. Otemanu at 2,386&quot;.
 A barrier reef encircles the lagoon with only one pass, 
Teavanui,
large enough for the World Discoverer to enter.  Today we will
anchor near the main town of Vaitape and visit its population
of 2,500 citizens and  millions of underwater reef dwellers.

Expedition Log</a>
 
<H2>26 Sept. Moorea</H2>

<P>
Moorea vies with Bora Bora for the title of Polynesia's most 
beautiful
island.  Craggy peaks overlooking the two fjord-like bays on the
north coast are covered with lush vegetation and occasional 
waterfalls.
 On the eastern and western coasts are views up splendid river
valleys toward the rugged interior, which is actually an immense,
eroded crater surrounded by needles of lava pointed toward the
sky.  The island's highest mountain, Mt. Tyohivea, stretches 
nearly
4,000 feet above sea level, making it a spectacular landmark on
this small, triangular island that measures only about 8 miles
on 2 sides and 10 miles across the top.  Moorea is twice as old
as our next port of call, Tahiti.

<H2>27 Sept. Papeete, Tahiti</H2>

<P>
Tahiti is about 4000 miles from Los Angeles and about 2,790 miles
from our departure port of Honolulu.  Tahiti having a total land
area of about 400 square miles, is the largest of the 14 Society
Islands which have a total land area of 636 square miles.  Tahiti
is shaped like an hour glass made up of two extinct volcanic 
domes
connected by a low narrow isthmus. Its main urban area Papeete
which has a population of about 140,000.  Papeete streets swarm
with all sorts of vehicles, including sports cars, seeming 
thousands
of motorbikes and &quot;les Trucks&quot;, the islands cheap and
picturesque public transportation.

<h4>Seabird Observations</h4>

	Numerous seabirds, shorebirds and migrants were seen.  On 
Cooper-Meng island over 160,000 birds were previously estimated, 
most of them Sooty Terns.  These birds blanket the entire runway. 




 
Heavy rains in prior year have caused high chick mortality.  
Terns were nesting at our arrival.  We estimated the total number 





of birds to be in excess of 300,000. 14 other species were seen.
<img src="tern.gif" align=right>

<h4>Marine Observations</h4>

	Observations were made on the fish populations and include 
these:
Several Black-Tip reef sharks were seen in the waters close to 
shore, often in extremely shallow water.  Gray reef sharks were 
also observed.  A high resolution underwater video system was 
used and used to document coral types and condition, invertebrate 





populations and to a lesser degree fish populations. By playing 
back the recorded underwater video, accurate scientific 
description of the encountered marine life was possible.
	The water was crystal clear, estimated visibility even in the 
shallow areas was far in excess of 100 feet and water temperature 





was and extremely comfortable 82
degrees(F). A large percentage of the 
huge corals were dead as a result of heavy grazing by the 
abundant fish population, sand scouring by heavy storms, and the 
effects of El Nino type conditions.  Approximately 30 species of 
fish were observed.  Numerous invertebrates were recorded 
including several corals, 4 different species of sea cucumbers, 
over a dozen 
<i>Tridacna</i> (giant)clams and a nudibranch, genus 
<i>Phyllidia</i>.

The observed corals were typical south Pacific species.  They 
included elkhorn coral, razor coral, staghorn coral, lettuce 
coral, plate coral and several species of soft corals.
	Two green turtles were observed, both underwater by the dive 
team.  In addition, the land expedition found a single track 
indicating a turtle nesting site.  A solitary Manta Ray was also 
reported.

<h4>Terrestrial Observations</h4>

	The most numerous mammal, present on all islands was the black 
rat, <i>Rattus rattus
</i>.  Previous studies have indicated population 
densities of up to 90 rats per hectare.  
	Small geckos (unidentified species) were reported from various 
terrestrial sites, usually associated with downed wood or on 
standing tree trunks.  Coconut crabs were much in evidence.  
Maximum size is apparently more than 20 kilograms.  Coconut crabs 





do fare well on inhabited islands; in American Samoa they are 
designated a protected species.</p>

<body bgcolor="#d8d8bf" text="#2f4f4f"><p align="center"><h2>CoralQuest</h2><h3>An Interactive Learning Adventure Live from French Polynesia</h3></p>
This is the CoralQuest Proposal.<br>  If you are interested in participating please contact <a href="mailto:huntley@host1.saddleback.cc.ca.us">Dr. Tony Huntley.</a></p>
<b>Abstract</b></p>
<p>This unique interactive Internet learning experience began on 30 May 1996. Six coral atolls in remote regions of eastern French Polynesia will be visited. Data concerning water temperature and chemistry, and coral abundance and diversity using transect methods will be collected, in addition, underwater pictures taken of each study site, with close-ups for species identification.  These will be transmitted via INMARSAT modem to our web site at Saddleback College for access by students in several elementary and secondary schools. These students will be in contact with the field researcher via e-mail.  In addition, students will have access to several scientific facilitators nationwide, via e-mail.   It is our goal to have the students develop and direct their own projects. This project was designed to allow flexibility for its use by the classroom teacher. There will be two visits to each of the islands, thus students may be able to increase their number of measurements,  refine hypotheses, or propose new experiments, or teachers  choose the trip which best fits their curriculum. </p>


<b>Background</b></p>

	<p>Recently, President Clinton and Vice President Gore announced a $2 billion five-year Technology Literacy program and challenged state and local governments and private sector corporations to ensure our students the technological education they so desperately need.</p>


	His program suggested four main agenda:

	<dd>1. Teacher training and support
	<dd>2. Development of engaging on-line learning programs
	<dd>3. Student and teacher access to modern computers
	<dd>4. Interconnection of every classroom to the Internet</p>

	<p>As educators in California, we are doubly challenged.  We must fast make up the gap in our basic science education, and bring California elementary, middle and secondary students from the bottom ten to the top ten percent nationwide in science and math skills, as well as respond to the Presidents national mission to bring about these technological agenda by the year 2000.</p>

	<p>This project directly fills the second presidential agenda, as a captivating learning porogram conducting in an exciting distant place.  Further, the project will allow development of science and math skills at several levels.</p>

<b>Technological Expertise</b></p>

Professors Joe Valencic and Tony Huntley have developed and presented on the world wide web three projects over the last six months.  Each of these projects featured a different region of the world, as well as marked advances in the technological aspect of each.  The first , Lost Atolls of the South Pacific, demonstrated that a web based adventure could excite and stimulate the interest of our students.  The next, Antarctica, Voyage to the Bottom of the World, utilized INMARSAT technology to transmit pictures and text for incorporation in a website.  The final project, Undersea Classroom: SCUBA Dana Point, witnessed the incorporation of pictures and narrative from a live, interactive, underwater lecture into an almost live website.  This project merited selection as one of 100 to be incorporated into the 24 hours in Cyberspace program.</p>

<b>The Research Sites and Vessel Arrangements</b></p>

	<p>In October of 1995, Dr. Huntley visited each of the islands to be used in this project.  As a result, we can be confident of our ability to find appropriate research sites for the proposed projects.  Transportation to the site will be provided by Society Expeditions, aboard their vessel M/V World Discoverer.  This ship offers a unique set of opportunities for this project.  In addition to the basic travel and logistical arrangements, the World Discoverer has a fleet of Zodiac inflatable crafts for travel to and from the research sites, experienced drivers for these crafts, a staff of experienced divers, and INMARSAT communications system onboard for completion of the data link between the United States sites and the ship. Costs associated with this portion of the project are nominal, as the scientist for the GOAL project will travel onboard the World Discoverer as a scientific lecturer.  In addition, it is anticipated that passengers on the World Discoverer will become involved in many phases of the shipboard and remote site portions of this project.  This will include reading e-mail from the students, and  measuring and photographing corals and related organisms in the field.</p>

<b>Participating Schools</b></p>

	Interest in participation in this project has been high.  We anticipate enrollment of ten schools for this project.  These schools will include high schools, middle schools and one elementary school. We envision future projects connected to many more schools. For this project, each school must have internet access.  For those schools without servers or e-mail capabilities, we will provide an electronic mailbox on the project server at Saddleback College.</p>

<b>Scientific Facilitators and Their Roles</b></p>

	Scientific facilitators will be chosen from a broad number of scientific disciplines.  These facilitators will advise students on scientific methodology, experimental design, data collection methods and data analysis.  These interactions will take place via e-mail.  The use of the advisors will be at the discretion of the classroom teacher. Each of the facilitators will have an e-mail account on the Saddleback College server for their use in this project.</p>

<b>Field Methods</b></p>

	Upon arrival at an island, researchers will decide upon sites that best meet the needs of the project.  Time at each site is necessarily limited by the ships schedule, thus we must anticipate measurements to take no more than 2 hours at each site.</p>
	A basic set of measurements will taken at each study site. These are outlined below.  Further measurements may be suggested by the students.   Students (and their teachers) will be advised of the equipment available for these studies.</p>

<b>	The Basic Measurement Set</b></p>

	1. Initial Site Photographs and Video. This photographs and video sequences will document site location with respect to land and also show compass headings from the start and end of the transect lkine to key landmarks.</p>

	2. Position and Map Data. The exact altitude and longitude of the site and its position on nautical chart will be recorded.</p>

	3. Water Chemistry, Color, Temperature.  The following water chemistry measurement will be made from water drawn at approximately 1 meter depth over the study site:</p>

<dd>a. Salinity.  Total salinity in ppt measure by Knudsen Mohr titration method.

<dd>b. pH. Measured using narrow range sea water test kit.

<dd>c. Total Dissolved Oxygen.  Total dissolved oxygen in ppm will be determined using Winkler titration method.

<dd>d. Water color. Standard Forel color scale will used.

<dd>e. Temperature.  Water temperature will be measured at a depth of 1 m and 5 m over the study sites.</p>

	4. Wave direction, period and height.  These parameters will be estimated from the beach above each study site.</p>

	5. Transects and Quadrat Photographs.  Permanent 100 m transects lines will be established at each site, including depth information. The starting point of each transect will be marked by day-glo polyurethane stakes epoxy embdedded into dead coral or rock. 1/4 m quadrat measurements will be made at randomly determined distances along the right or left side of the transect line.  For each quadrat a wide angle full-frame underwater video sequence will be taken.  Including, close-up video of each of the dominant species, and any rare or exciting species.  The field researcher will also estimate total cover by major species on each quadrat.</p>

<b>The Project Web Site</b></p>

	During the experimentation phase, the CoralQuest website on the project server at Saddleback College will display daily data and position updates for use by the participating students.  At the  conclusion of the field portion of the project, student findings, in the form of scientific papers will be published on the CoralQuest website.  These papers will form the basis for future studies in this geographic region as well as elsewhere.</p>

<H3>The Equipment Page</H3>
<BIG>In the field we use about 40 kg of equipment.  Consider the excess baggage charge on that!!! A 586-90mhz laptop with 16MB of RAM and 800 mb hard disk provide the primary data link.  An internal PCMCIA 28.8 bps modem is used to connect via telephone/data line to a Saturn3 INMARSAT telecommunications system.  Webpages designed in the field are sent via FTP to the web server at Saddleback College.</P>

<P>All photography is done with a Sony KX-V1 Hi-8 video camera.  For underwater use, the camera is placed in a Quest Underwater housing.  Pictures are snapped from video using the Snappy video snapshot tool.  Images are them sized and converted into JPEG format using Adobe Photoshop.  </P>

Details on the collection of scientific data are described in the <A HREF="http://propose.html">project proposal</A>.  <BR>

<h4>17APR1996</h4> <img src="18apr02.jpg" align=left width=40%>Dr. John Loret, who is travelling with us (you'll hear lots more about him later), travelled with Thor Heyerdahl on one of his voyages.  Dr. Loret, past president of the Exploer's Club, has brought with him Thor Hyerdahl's Explorer's Club flag.  The same one that Heyerdahl flew on his <i>Kon Tiki</i> voyage.  The flag is fragile, so instead of flying it, we have it on display on one of the bulletin boards.  Here's a picture of that flag. (Ybarra students: A prize for the best essay, one page or less, about Thor Heyerdahl and his pacific voyages.) 

<h4>17APR1996</h4><img src="18apr01.jpg" align=right width=40%>Meet GeoDolphin, the idea of two students in Michigan.  Katie and Laura sent "Geo" to Dr. Sylia Earle (via National Geographic Magazine).  Dr. Earle is carrying "Geo" with her and taking pictures along the way.  So far "Geo" has been down to the bottom of the ocean, in several coutries, and now aboard the M/V World Discoverer. Here's a picture of "Geo" with Dr. Earle's daughter, Elizabeth.</p><br><p>

Today I met Pania Warren on Pitcairn Island.  Heres a message from her to the students at Ybarra School in Walnut California:</p>

Hi, my name is Pania Warren. Im nine years old.
I live on Pitcairn Island with my friends Sarah, Natasha, Tara, Joe and Cameron. Its a lot of fun there. We go around the island and play, and go for a swim and thats rather fun.  In school we study math and art, and we have drawing competitions.
Pitcairn Island is in the south pacific ocean in between three other islands:
Henderson, Oeno and Ducie.</p>

Dr. John Loret is the past president of the Explorers Club.  He is also a marine biologist. Today he collected plankton from the open ocean using a special net.  The net is cone shaped and made of very small mesh fabric.  The floating organisms are collected on a small jar at end of the net.  We looked at the plankton under a microscope and used a camera to take these pictures of plankton. The ships position was 24 21.2S, 13201.6W . The time was 09:28. The ocean depth at this site was 4000m. The photic depth was 100m. Plankton were taken in vertical samples from  two depth ranges: 0 - 60m, and 60 - 120m.</p>

<TITLE>29 MAR 1996- LA to Tahiti</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<H3>29 MAR 1996</H3>



18:16	Well here we go again... I've made it to LAX.  This morning was hectic.  I stopped at Ybarra School to pick up letters.  Unlike the letter of passage upon which the last few scenes of Casablanca hinge, these letters, perhaps 100 in number are headed for some students on Pukarua.  The students at Ybarra wrote them with great care, to their French Polynesian counterparts.  They hope that the Pukarua school will respond with similar letters, which I may carry back at the end of this odyssey.  I hope that Ybarra wont mind if I quote a few passages from their letters.</P><P>
Most letters ask about life in French Polynesia:</P><P>

	 Hi!  How are you?  Do you like living in Polynesia?  What kinds of games do you play?  What subjects do you study in school?  Do you get report cards?  I school hard there?</P><P>

Dear boy,</P><P>

	How are you today?  I'm Anthony.  I have black hair and brown eyes.  I go to Ybarra School   in the  United States of America.  What do you look like?  I am twelve years old and in the sixth grade. How many kids are there in your family?</P><P>

Dear Teacher,</P><P>

	Hello, how are you?  My name is Brian.  I live in the United States of America.  I am 11 years old and in the sixth grade.  I have two questions to ask you.  What do you look like?  What do you teach?</P><P>

Some students even wrote their letters in French (quite a cosmpolitan group at Ybarra, non?):</P><P>

Cher Etudiant,</P><P>

	Comment allez-vous?  Je m'appele Marc. Je suis en 6 re anne aux Etats-Unis.  J'ai 11 ans.  Que faits-vous pour vous distraire?  Est-que vous roulez  vlo?  Avez-vous des freres et souers?  Comment vous-appelez vous?</P><P>

18:45  Boarding call.  The Air New Zealand 747 will take off at 19:30 for Papeete.  The flight should take just under eight hours. </P>

<TITLE>30 MAR 1996- Bora Bora</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<H3>30 MAR 1996</H3>
<P>02:01 (PST)	Somewhere over the Pacific.  The moon is about 3/4 and shining over the ocean.
 Why is flying so physically exhausting?  Is it the high carbo, high salt food, or the low pressure?
We are cruising at 9,400m, the temperature outside is -39 degrees C.  We will arrive in about and hour and one half.</P><P>

2:17 (local time)  I'm here.  This is Papeete.  It is a warm 29 degrees C with humidity around 95%.  Kind of like Florida, definitely balmy.  There is a 6:40 flight to Bora Bora.  I think that's the one I'm supposed to be on, but Tahiti is like Hawaii-- things run on a different, slower clock.  We will see!</P><P>

5:20	Leaving via Air Tahiti for Bora Bora.</P><P>

6:30	Arrive Bora Bora.  This island is stunning.  A huge, 2000 ft volcanic pluton emerges from the main island.  The airport is on one of the outer islands.  The airport landing strip was originally built by the American armed forces during the Second World War.  After landing, you are transported by boat to the dock at the main island.  The sun rose from behind the volcanic mountain, coloring the mist shrouded peaks.</P><P>
	 A large coral reef surrounds these islands.  The World Discover entered the lagoon at 7:30, and a zodiac docked.  A short time later we toured the island by bus.  A simple, well made two lane highway rings the entire island.  There are three major villages on this island of 2500 people. Almost all habitation appears along the extreme coastal edge of the island.   There are many hotels on this island, the biggest being the Club Med compound.
</P><P>
13:00	We snorkel in the main lagoon.  This gives us a chance to check out our camera and the housing.  The biological diversity in the lagoon is low.  Fire coral is present, several other species including staghorn coral, all in water depths of about 3 to 10 meters. There was a large amount of algae growth in the lagoon, in addition the coral bleaching was evident.  </P><P>

<TITLE>31 MAR 1996- MATAIVA</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<H3>31 MAR 1996</H3>
0700	After breakfast I worked on the web pages.  Today we will visit Mataiva (or MataHiva on some maps).  I have still have not made  a modem connection with the Saddleback server.</P><P>

1000	Today there will be a lecture by Dr. Robert Suggs.  Dr. Suggs is here with a group from the Smithsonian Museum.  They are studying the anthropology of the Tuamotus and Marquesas.  He will talk on the three unique cultures of the area, that of the Tuamotus and Marquesas, as well as Tahiti.</P><P>

1200	We have arrived at Mataiva Atoll. Here are some facts:</P><P>

Position:  15 S, 148 30 W</P><P>

Size: small oval shaped atoll, 5 miles (10 km) long, 3 miles (5.5 km) wide, almost complete coral ring is 200-1500 m wide</P><P>

Lagoon: average depth is 8m, with coral formations making navigation difficult.  There is only one pass into the lagoon, thus the ring is almost complete, and water within the lagoon is not well oxygenated and cloudy.  The lagoon has deep phosphate deposits.</P><P>

European discovery by Bellingshausen in 1820</P><P>



Copra and fishing are the major means of employment.  Fish from Mataiva are ships out by air almost daily.  As much as two metric tons of fish are taken per week.  The fish from Mataiva are well known and sold throughout Polynesia.<P>

The phosphate deposits within the lagoon are a point of major concern.  The French want to extract approximately 10 million tons of ore, over a 10 to 15 year period.  The islanders oppose this, and have posted signs indicating their protest.</P><P>

Prior to the late 1940's, Mataiva was uninhabited.  Since that time, human impact has greatly affected the ecology.  Once proposed as a seabird and turtle refuge, now few birds and turtles breed on the atoll.</P><P>

Hurricane damage in 1982-83 caused damage to outer coral reef which can still be seen while diving.</P><P>

1400	We snorkel on the reef immediately off the beach from the small runway.  Coral densities seem high, with only a small amount of bleaching.  The fish population is moderate.  Fish species seen included 9 species of surgeonfishes, 3 species of unicornfishes, 6 species of parrotfishes, 3 wrasses, 13 species of butterflyfishes, one squirrelfish and 1 goatfish.</P><P>

Cam and Kay Kepler, our ornithologists and botanists, saw several species of birds on the atoll while we were snorkeling.  These included the Blue Lorikeet, which has not been reported from this island before!</P><P>
<H4>Birds:</H4> Tahiti Petrel,  Red-Footed Booby,  Great Frigatebird,  Fairy Tern,  Brown Noddy,  Pacific Reef-Heron,  Wandering Tattler,  Rock Dove,  Tuamotu Reed-Warbler,  Black-Winged Petrel,  Pacific Golden-Plover,  Great Crested Tern,  Blue(Tahitian) Lorikeet</P><P>
<H4>
Marine Fish:</H4> Blue Jack,  Pompano,  Threadfin,  Bristle Toothed Surgeonfish,  Zebra Surgeonfish,  Red-Spotted Surgeonfish,  Gendarme Fish,  Bleeker's Surgeonfish,  Yellow-Spotted Surgeonfish,  Blue-Spotted Grouper,  Multicolored Handfish,  Red Snapper,  Tropical Porgie,  Tricolored Fusilier,  Meadow Parrotfish,  Napoleonfish,  Six-Barred Wrasse,  Paradisefish,  Javanese Moray,  Needlefish,  Clear Picasso, Triggerfish,  Armoured Soldierfish,  Black-Tip Soldierfish, Non-Spotted Goatfish,  Saddle Butterflyfish,  Ornate Butterflyfish,  Red-Striped Butterflyfish,  Bennett's Butterflyfish,  Long Bill Butterflyfish,  Featherfin Bullfish,  Bannerfish,  Red Angelfish,  Moorish Idol,  Convict Damselfish,  Blue Damselfish,  Blue-Green Puller,  Clownfish,  Stingray,  White-Tip Reef Shark,  Grey-Reef Shark </P><P>



1815	At the evening recap Kay relates a native myth on the origin of the coconut:</P><P>

	Two young Polynesians, Tuna and Tiare, were, as so many young people are, deeply in love. Tuna was a tall, dark extremely handsome boy.  Tiare was a small girl with long black hair and large eyes almost as black as basalt. Unfortunately Tuna and Tiare were from different castes within their tribe.  So, as you might expect, they were forbidden to see each other. Their island had other problems, perhaps greater than those of Tuna and Tiare.  For some time they had had no rain.  Without water the plants would not grow and the people would die.  All of the men in village set out in canoes to find new plants and water.  Many weeks later most of the men returned, carrying with them water and some plants.  Soon after, it began to rain, and the village returned to normal.  Normal, except for Tiare.  She spent most of her days on the shore, looking out to sea, hoping for the return of Tuna.</P><P> One day, while she was sitting on the shore,  she heard a voice call to her. Tiare, it said, I'm down here.  She looked down and saw an eel in a tidepool.  The eel spoke to her Tiare, it's me, Tuna, your love. You cannot be Tuna, she said, Tuna is out at sea. No, really it's me, look closely, the eel said. So she looked closely and carefully scrutinized the eel face.  It did look a bit like Tuna.  Tiare, you must do something for our people, the eel-that-was-once-Tuna said, If you will do this our people will never suffer from drought or hunger again.  Tiare listened carefully to what he said, for within her short lifetime alone there had been many droughts.  You must cut off my head and bury it above the tideline.  And then you must water that spot every day, and soon a tree will grow.  In the nut from that tree you will see my face.  And that nut will provide food and water for our people for all time and never again will they suffer from drought.  </P><P>So Tiare did what she was told.  Every day she watered the spot where she buried the eel's head and soon, just as he had said, a tree sprouted and grew.  It grew tall and then some large nutlike fruits formed. Then one day one of the nuts fell from the tree.  Tiare picked it up and pulled back the hairs from the end of it and there, just as she had been told were a pair of eyes,  Tuna's eyes. Below the eyes were a mouth.  She held the nut in her hands and saw the face of her love, Tuna.  His beard surrounded his eyes and his mouth.  And the nut, when opened was full of water and the flesh of the nut provided food.  Just as Tuna had promised, never again would the village be without water or food.  </P><P>Even today we can see Tuna's face in the coconut, proving his love for Tiare and his entire village.  He left in search of water and returned with the coconut whose water and flesh provide nourishment, whose fibers are made into fishing line and rope, and whose leaves can be woven into baskets or used as thatch to provide protection from the rain.  </P>

<BODY><H3>1 April 1996</H3>
<img align=right src="17apr01.jpg">
0800	Approaching the island of Fakarava.  We are in sight of the this large atoll, almost 33 nm long and 15 nm wide.  On the north west end of the atoll is a pass into the lagoon.</P><P>
	
1100	We enter the village at Rotoava.  This is the only village on the island.  The villages greet us and set up shop under a tree, selling black pearls and some other crafts.</P><P>

	Facts about this atoll.</P><P>

	Position:  1620 S  14535 W	</P><P>

Fakarava is the second largest atoll in the Tuamotus, which are comprised of 69 islands strung out in two lines over a 1200 km long path.  There may have been two separate hot spots which generated the Tuamotus.  The entire group varied in age from 12 to 20 million years.</P><P>

European discovery credited to Bellingshausen on 16 JULY 1820.</P><P>

Population is about 150.  Pearl farming and copra are the major industries on this island.</P><P>  

	
	The lagoon has many large coral heads, and we snorkel at one of these.</P><P>

<TITLE>2 APRIL 1996- Raroia</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<img align=right src="17apr03.jpg">

<H3>2 April 1996</H3>

<P>0730	We had been told that we should wake up early enough to watch the ship pass through the narrow channel into the lagoon at Raroia.  This is easily the narrowest and most difficult pass that the Captain has to navigate on our trip.  We enter the lagoon through this narrow pass on the northwest side.  The entry is indeed exciting, with some rapid turns and backing.  We set anchor in the north end of the lagoon and leave for a quick look at the northern motus via zodiac.</P><P>

0930	We snorkel from the beach and on a coral head in the lagoon.</P><P>

1200	We reposition the ship south, near the village of Garumaoa.</P><P>
	<H4>Some Facts:</H4>
	<P>Position: 1605 S Lat and 14225 W Long</P><P>

	Raroia is a fairly large coral atoll at twenty one miles long and nine miles wide.</P><P>  
	It has an oval shape and consists of several small islets, with one major islet on the west end of the atoll. </P><P> 

	Raroia is known for, amongst other things, being the spot where Thor Heyerdal's raft, the Kon Tiki, landed after traveling four thousand miles and one hundred and three days at sea after having left from South America.  Heyerdal was attempting to test his hypothesis that Polynesia was colonized having from South America.  This idea is currently not very popular.</P><P>
  
1300	Upon landing we were greeted on the pier by some of the best, and youngest, dancers we have seen so far on our trip.  We were given leis and were then directed to a thatched hut nearby were we found array impressive foods.  We enjoyed coconuts, two kinds of fish, meats, lemons and other tasty treats. </P><P>

<TITLE>3 APRIL 1996- AT SEA</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY><H3>3 April 1996</H3>
April 3rd</p><p>
	After a long day at Raroia, a relaxing day at sea was well appreciated by all.  One of the lectures given today was about coral reef distribution and diversity.  In his  lecture, Rick Nemeth spoke in detail detail about the nature of coral reefs.  Coral reefs occur in clear, warm, near-shore marine waters in temperatures between 20 and 27 degrees and occur at depths of up to one hundred meters.  Corals first appeared 300 million years ago.  Plate tectonics and the formation of polar ice caps are largely responsible for the current distribution of of reef building corals.</p><p>

<TITLE>4 APRIL 1996 - Hiva Oa</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY><H3>4 April 1996</H3>


0800	This morning we dropped anchor just off the southern coast of Hiva Oa.  This is the first of the high islands of the Marquesas that we will visit.  Clouds shrouded the  tops of some of the island peaks, creating an overall mysterious effect.  We will go ashore at Atuona, a large, protected harbor here in the Marquesas.  This anchorage is a popular one, with over 25 small yachts hooked here.  This island is heavily wooded and very fertile.  The town of Atuona has several stores, a hotel, and is quite popular with sailors from around the world.  Atuona is also the burial place of French impressionist painter Paul Gauguin and Belgian cabaret singer Jacques Brel.</p><p>

	The island is 23 miles long and 10 miles wide.</p><p><p align="center"><img src="hivaoa1.jpg"  width=80%></p>

	The population is 6,800.</p><p>

	We go ashore and travel into the town.  We are treated to polynesian dancing by a group from the other side of this island (the town we will visit this afternoon).  Bob Suggs, the expert on Marquesan archaeology, assures us that the dances we see are really in the traditional style.</p><p>
	We do not snorkel or dive here, there are many things to see ashore.</p><p>
1330	The ship has repositioned at PuaMau.  After we disembarked the ship for the second time today, we were immediatly wisked away by trucks and jeeps up to Meae Takaii, where several tikis have been restored. <img src="tiki.jpg" align=left> The principle altar for the valley stands here.  This altar was constructed in 1500 AD and was in use until its destruction in the 1800s by missionaries.  On the highest platform of the altar stand five tikis all made from volcanic stone.  One of the tikis is named Takai, and stands 2.35 metershigh--the largest tiki in the Marquesas.  Other platforms on the altar had more tikis and polishing stones.  These stones  would be used to sharpen their axes and other tools. In a cliff next to the altar are several burial caves.</p><p>
1730 We return to the ship with fruit and coconut fronds to be used for a BBQ served on the pool deck underneath the stars.  A fitting end to a fabulous day.</p><p>

<BODY><H3>5 April 1996</H3>



<p>0600	We awoke this morning to find that we were already anchored off of the island of Fatu Hiva.  The ship sat in  the Bay of Virgins.  This is perhaps the most stunning landscape on the entire planet.  Huge volcanic spires rise in the foreground, while high, lush-green cliffs form a huge natural amphitheater.  Fatu Hiva is the most luxuriant of the Marquesas. Wispy clouds played along the tops of the highest peaks, where almost everyone was shocked to see packs of wild goats ably running.</p><p> <img src="fatuhiva.jpg" align=middle>
<h3>Some FatuHiva Facts:</h3></p><p>

Fatu Hiva is a relatively new (2 million year old) high, volcanic island.</p><p>

It is 8 miles long by 4 miles wide and approximately 80 square miles in area.</p><p>

The highest point is Mt Tauaoho, 3,150 ft (1000m)</p><p>

European discovery was by Mendaa in 1595.</p><p>

Hanavave is the village at the Bay of Virgins on the west side of the island. It is surrounded by high volcanic pinnacles.</p><p>

Omoa, another village, is about 4 miles to the south, also on the west side of the island.</p><p>

The island was covered by lush vegetation, in part due to the high rainfall. Today, the long history of goats, pigs, horses and introduction have altered the plant communities significantly.</p><p>

Few of the original native birds are still present, however, the spectacular Ultramarine Lorikeet, White-Capped Fruit Dove, Marquesas Swiftlet and Marquesas Reed Warbler are certainly worth looking for.</p><p>

Thor Heyerdahl lived on Fatu Hiva from 1937-38, prior to his Kon Tiki and other adventures.</p><p>

Crafts include tapa (bark) cloth paintings and carvings from miro wood.</p><p>



0730	We go ashore and are greeted with flower and leaf head leis.  It is raining lightly.  Some of the passengers take the long (4 mile) hike up to a waterfall.  Most stay in the village of Hanavave and look at the tapa cloth paintings and Miro wood carvings.</p><p>

0900 Snorkeling near the Bay of Virgins was not terribly exciting.</p><p>

<h4>Birds:</h4> White-Tailed Tropicbird  Red-Footed Booby  Brown Booby  Lesser Frigates  Pacific Reef-Heron  Blue-Gray Noddy  Brown Noddy  Black Noddy  Lesser Fairy-Tern  White-Capped Fruit-Dove  Marquesas Reed-Warbler  Chestnut-Breasted Mannikin</p><p>

<h4>Marine Fish:</h4> Blue Jack  Blue-Lined Sea Perch  Tropical Porgie  Fire Dartfish

0700	After two days in the Marquesas, we returned to the Tuamotus.  However, things had changed and the seas had begun to pick up. As we neared Puka Puka the officers and staff began to worry about our landing. As we approached the island, we were greeted by a group of Bottle-nosed dolphins.
They were first sighted about a hundred yards off of the bow, but they quickly closed the gap and came right up to the ship.  We stood out on the bow and watched as the dolphins jumped and spun all about. There were adult females with calves, and at least two adult males, a total of twenty animals.  They played around the ship for about ten minutes.</p><p>

0830 The scout party set out to assess the landing conditions on the atoll.  The only way for our Zodiacs to penetrate the coral reef that surrounds the island is to navigate a narrow channel that has been blasted through the reef.  This channel is only about ten feet wide and when the surf is strong, as it was today, it crashes through the tiny channel, runs into a concrete pier and then rebounds back into the channel. Here it collides with the incoming surf creating a white-water nightmare.  The decision was made not to land.  We do, however, snorkel along the outside margin of the reef.</p><p>

0730 We arrive at Puka Rua.	We have experienced the same problems that we had yesterday at Puka Puka.  The scout party set out to assess landing conditions and found a channel in the coral similar to the one at Puka Puka filled with watery chaos.  No landings  could be attempted and the scout party returned to the ship.</p><p>

0900	 Edmundo Edwards spoke on the history of the island of Mangareva and the Gambier group (well be there tomorrow). Little is known about the original Polynesians of this island group.  However, their language was similar to the language spoken on Easter Island.  This could imply a common origin for the peoples of these islands.</p><p>
	The first European to sight Mangareva was a privateer named Davis.  Not to long after this, French missionaries were sent to the island to convert the natives.  The first group of missionaries left after a year because they were unable to "free the natives from their traditional religious practices.  However, not long after the first missionaries left, a priest named Pere Laval was sent.  He was much more successful than his predecessors.  After a few years he had won the support of one of the tribal leaders, and together they converted the masses, ultimately destroying the traditional altars and tikis that had been used for generations.</p><p>
	With the presence of Pere Laval,  he island was completely transformed into a tyrannical religious state. The population which numbered over 5000 when Laval arrived dropped to less than 500 in ten years.  Laval commanded the construction of a huge cathedral (it holds 1000) on Mangareva and he construction of tens of other churches and small chapels.  His church police force was ruthless and punishment was swift. Eventually, the church and the French government removed Laval and he was charged and brought to trial. The cathedral now stands as a monument to this period in the history of Mangareva.

<h4>The Climate and Oceanographic Setting</h4>

The climate of the atoll is equatorial, hot and very rainy.   In 
general it has unfavorable weather and is the only island in its 
latitude where fresh westerlies occur.  A tropical front hovers 
in the vicinity of the island and is caused by the meeting of the 





NE and SE tradewinds.  In general NE trades prevail with an 
average velocity of about 10 knots.  There are frequent squalls 
of short duration and occasional wind up to 22 knots, but
<img src="atolls.gif" align=right> 
typhoons are infrequent.
	The tidal rise at Palmyra Atoll is about 0.6m. No tidal range 
was observed during our visit which permitted use of a short 
gangway at sidegate level for those wishing to explore the land 
area on foot.

	Rainfall is heavy here, from 10 to 100 inches per year; however 
at rare time it may reach 300 inches per year.  Rain occurs 
almost daily; heavy squalls come up suddenly from the SW, but 
generally there are few sever storms.  While our visit was free 
of rain, a light mist started at the time of our departure (1500 
hrs).  In short, we had exceptional weather and sea conditions 
for our brief expeditionary visit.

	Water temperature was measured at 82 degrees F, however, no 
further oceanographic measurements were made.

<p><h2>15 Sept:
Palmyra Atoll</h2> Arrived Palmyra atoll.  Conditions at sea 
during 



our
three day trip were
unusually calm, sea state 2.  This made the journey quite 
pleasant
as the MV World Discoverer steamed along at 12.5 knots.  We have 
a
distinguished crew of naturalists aboard.  Bill Everett, 
expedition
leader and bird expert is in charge, Ron McPeak is the divemaster 






and
fish and algae specialist, I am in charge of the invertebrates, 
especially
coral and reef ecology.  In addition we have tow archeologists 
from
Easter Island, Christian and Edmundo, aboard to investigate
the
cultural history associated with each of the islands we visit.


<image src="palmyra.gif" align=middle hspace=100>
Palmyra atoll is located in Polynesia
in the North Pacific Ocean, 1600 km south-southwest of Honolulu 
(Lat.
5 deg 53 min N, Long. 162 deg 5 min W).  It has a land area of 
about
12 square miles, which is about 20 times the size of the mall in 
Washington
D.C.  This uninhabited atoll encloses three separate lagoons and 
has
a coastline of about 14.5 km.  The atoll consists of several 
small
islets lying on a barrier reef.  The reef surrounding Palmyra is 
2.5
km long east to west and 4 km at its widest point.</p>

<h4>The Expedition</h4><img src="atolls.gif" align=right>
	We traveled to Palmyra Atoll, via the M/V World Discoverer to 
observe the wildlife resources and identify sensitive populations 



and habitats.  Our investigations are referenced to a previous 
survey via the NOAA vessel R/V Townsend Cromwell.
	We arrived prior to dawn, and at 0600 h proceed into the narrow 
channel that opens into the lagoon, which is several km wide.  
Our captain had previously navigated the ship though  this lagoon 



entrance and was familiar with docking the vessel at an abandoned 



military seawall.  As with his previous docking, palm trees were 
used to moor the ship.
	Upon entering the narrow channel, which was dredged prior to 
W.W.II, the captain deployed two Zodiacs to mark the passage 
width so he could maneuver the World Discoverer in the waters
that were at times less than 12 fathoms.  Birding and diving 
parties left the ship.

<h4>Landing</h4>
<img src="zodiac.gif" align=middle>
	<p>Palmyra is a spectacular atoll consisting of 27 islands.  
Islands in the northern portion could be reached on foot from the 



moored ship.  The evidence of military activity on these islands 
was clear, with a large central trash collection area present as 
well.  Eastern and southern islands were reached by Zodiac 
inflatables.
	At the time of our visit there were no inhabitants on Palmyra, 
however, a caretaker, Roger Lexstrait, living on a yacht 
(COUSOUR), arrived shortly after mooring.  He indicated the best 
diving and birding sites as well as inviting us to his home-- 
where he keeps two pet coconut crabs, each weighing over 10 
pounds! Roger was a totally charming island hermit who won the 
hearts of every passenger he spoke to.  At our departure the 
kitchen staff presented him with an enormous "CARE" package 
consisting of a wide variety of staples, including his favorite, 
German chocolate.</p>

<H4>Alvin Brightbill</H4>
Turbo 10er: Music professor Alvin Brightbill was hailed as a hero 
after answering a desperate call for hlep from jazz legend Dave 
Brubeck and Marita Phillips-Thornburgh, director of Cantori Domino, an 
LA-based choral organization. When the tenor soloist scheduled to 
perform Brubeck's "The Gates of Justice" lost his voice, Professor 
Brightbill agreed to step in. He learned the 50-minute score on a 
Thursday, rehearsed Friday and Saturday, and brought the house down 
Sunday afternoon. Bravo.

Touring Artist: The Oakland Museum in northern California is mounting 
a touring exhibition of approximately 30 works by Art Professor John 
Cederquist. The museum has secured several major grants, including one 
from the National Endowment for the Arts, for this retrospective look 
at the furniture-based sculptural objects created by Professor 
Cederquist between 1980 and 1995. A 120-page color catalog, including 
an essay by noted art critic Arthur Danto, will accompany the 
exhibition, which will open in Oakland in the spring of 1997, then 
travel to museums throughout the United States.

his debut as a recording artist. He's putting the finishing touches on 
his first CD,  "The Renaissance Piano," which features works of the 
15th-17th centuries by composers like John Bull, Peter Phillips, 
William Byrd, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, and Josquin des Prez. Mark 
Schiffelbein, general manager of the college's radio and television 
stations, is the recording engineer. The album is due out in the fall.
<P>
<H4>Lynn Wells</H4>
New Author: Speech/Theatre Arts professor Lynn Wells has penned the 
book and lyrics for a high-spirited musical about love and life 
entitled "Catalina." Her collaborator on the project is composer 
Richard Abraham, one of the college's associate faculty members. The 
musical received its first staged reading this summer to a 
by-invitation-only audience.
<P>
<H4>Barry Silverman</H4>
Ole: Maestro Barry Silverman and the Saddleback Symphony Orchestra 
entertained dignitaries and guests last spring at a dinner/dance 
commemorating Mission Viejo's 30 years as a community, the 150th 
anniversary of the signing of the Rancho Ca&ntilde;ada de los Aliso and 
Rancho Niguel land grants, and the centennial of El Toro Memorial 
Park.
<P>
<H4>David Pecoraro</H4>
Party Animal: Theatre Arts Production Manager David Pecoraro and a 
colleague have rented the L.A. Coliseum, where they will throw a West 
Coast bash ringing out the old millennium and welcoming in the new. 
And David knows how to throw parties-he staged the half-time 
extravaganza for Superbowl XVII, the Glory of Easter at the Crystal 
Cathedral, and the closing ceremonies of the Lake Placid Winter 
Olympics, and designed an austral borealis for the penguins at Sea 
World in San Diego.
<P>
<H4>Wally Huntoon</H4>
Wally's World: Theatre Arts' super set designer, Wally Huntoon, won a 
coveted "Robby" award, given in recognition of distinguished 
achievement in Southern California theater, for his "A Little Night 
Music" scenic design for the Moonlight Theatre in Vista, beating out 
those big, flashy L.A. productions of "Beauty and the Beast" and "Miss 
Saigon." He also designed a visitor's pavilion for the Summer Olympics 
in Atlanta, and is creating a pirate ship which will be moored at 
Denver's Elitch Gardens.

</font>he vast white Antarctic continent dominates the southern 
hemisphere. Coldest, highest and most inhospitable habitat on 
earth, it makes up almost one tenth of the planet's surface and 
is surrounded entirely by the cold, deep circumpolar ocean. In 
geography, geology, biology and history the Antarctic is like no 
other land: no trees, no flowers, no indigenous population, no 
large land animals... For centuries it resisted human efforts to 
conquer its mysteries. Even today it remains one of the last wild 


places on earth, few if any of us will ever see it
in person...</p><p>
On November 22 Professor Joe Valencic of Saddleback College 

<img src="map.gif" align=left>departed for an 
exciting and incredible 
Antarctic adventure. He carried with him an array of 
<a href="technol.html">technology</a>
 to permit transmission of live sequential video back to the 
Marine Science laboratory at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo, 


California. This website was the first to record an expedition 
such
as this, with
 first-ever transmission of live video over 
telephone links from the  bottom
of the world.

</p><p>
The images: ice, penguins, and  
seals, as well as  
<a href="logindex.html">Joes Log</a>
 were updated
regularly,
with live

<h2>The Technology</h2>

<big><p>
On past expeditions we have relied on transcription of telephone 
messages, faxes and computer modem transmission.  This time we 
wanted to go for the gusto.  Live action video from the 
Antarctic.  Well folks its not quite as easy as it sounds!  Just 






about the only site that has data satellite coverage is the 
American Base at McMurdo, and our ship was going to be in the 
region of Palmer Peninsula.  Then we discovered the
<a href="http://metaverse.com/grammy/casio/index.html"> Casio
</a> video 
phone device.  It will transmit, over normal phone lines, 
standard 
duplex audio and a video frame once every 3.5 seconds. The
Casio Company loaned us two the their beta units for this
project.  The
ship, like all expedition cruise vessels has INMARSAT
telephone capability, but would the Casio devices work
over INMARSAT? At this point we called 
<a href="http://www.magec.com/satellite.html">Magnavox
Electronic Systems</a>, one of
the largest sattelite aommunication companies in the world.
  After half a day of testing, we found that Casio's
video could be transmitted over high speed telephone sattelite
transmission channels.  And well, its 
not Hollywood, but we were in business with Live Sequential Video 






for an interactive link to our laboratory at Saddleback College!
</p>



<h3>
Other Equipment</h3>


	<p>In the field Joe has a Macintosh Powerbook modified with two 
high capacity NiCad battery packs (which are rigged to power up 
the video camera as well).  Our video camera is a HiBand 8mm 
palmcorder equipped with wireless mike. An underwater housing for 






the video camera protects it in wet environments and may provide 
footage from under the surface, as well.  Joe also carries Canon 
35mm cameras and lenses.</p>

	
<p>At Saddleback College, Tony uses a 486-66 equipped with Snappy 






video snapshot  to capture frames
directly from Joes live broadcasts.  
All transmissions are also
recorded directly onto VHS tape, and 
additionally a tripod-mounted VHS camera records the session from 





the 
students perspective.  Text and pictures are then copied to our 
website.</p></big>

Discoverer, where I am but one of 6 invited 
scientists/naturalists. Not only will I share the experiences of 
my past four expeditions to Antarctica, but we plan to use 
cutting edge technology to provide live audio and video 
broadcasts from remote locations around Antarctica to our Marine 
Science classes at Saddleback College!  In the classroom, Dr. 
Tony Huntley will downlink the received INMARSAT A signals via 
standard telephone connections using the hybrid VideoPhone 
prototypes loaned to us by Casio Corporation for ihis interactive

</font>he vast white Antarctic continent dominates the southern 
hemisphere. Coldest, highest and most inhospitable habitat on 
earth, it makes up almost one tenth of the planet's surface and 
is surrounded entirely by the cold, deep circumpolar ocean. In 
geography, geology, biology and history the Antarctic is like no 
other land: no trees, no flowers, no indigenous population, no 
large land animals... For centuries it resisted human efforts to

<h3>WEDNESDAY, NOV 22, 1995</h3>



<big>6:20 AM  Ive been up for three hours, packing and repacking 



all 
of the equipment for this expedition.  Although this will be my 
fifth expedition to this pristine and yet most hostile area, I 
think of the Antarctic as the ultimate white laboratory; its cold 
hiding and protecting a myriad of secrets.

I departed Orange County airport at 6:55 and arrived at Miami 11 
hours later.  Then boarded an Air Ladeco flight to Santiago, 
Chile.  The 8 hour flight was truly an experience, equal perhaps 
to the pleasure of a root canal.  The depressing thought I had as 




we landed was of the two arduous flight yet to come.  Air Ladeco 
was the last of my big-league planes in this trek to meet the M/V 




World Discoverer in Port Stanley, Falkland Islands.

I measure conventional air flights not in mile, but in meals 
served and movies watched.  But now my travel yardstick must 
change because on charter or military flights a different set of 
rules applies...

<h3>THURSDAY, NOV 23, 1995</h3>



<big>
7:05 a.m.  I arrived in Santiago, picked up my baggage and 
proceeded several hundred yards to the domestic terminal
and my connecting 

Air Ladeco flight to Puenta Arenas.  The airport was considerably 


improved since my last visit, but this time my sightseeing would 
be limited to looking out of the small aircraft as it picked up 
altitude heading south toward Patagonia.  At 2 p.m. local time, 
flight 345 touched down and taxied to the small terminal 
building. </p><p> 

Arriving Puenta Arenas, Chile</p>
<p>
Puenta Arenas, at 53 degrees South latitude, is situated on the 
Strait of Magellan where the foothill forests of the southern 
Andes meet the grasslands of Patagonia.  Once a penal settlement 
for political exiles, it is now a bustling industrial town with 
industries like shipping, fishing and mineral exploitation 
gradually replacing traditional livestock farming.  Local 
drilling platforms supply 50% of Chile's oil and 100% of its 
liquid gas.</p>  
<p>
Puenta Arenas has a built-in cleaning system courtesy of Mother 
Nature.  Locals will tell you in all seriousness that litter is 
swept away by the cold, fickle winds that blow off the Strait of 
Magellan.  These same bitter winds entice albatross and giant 
petrels to soar within sight of town.  There is a small colony of 


Magellanic penguins; however, their numbers have  declined
due to human activity and foxes.</p><p>

True to form, Mother Nature's vacuum cleaner was in full 
operation when we arrived with winds in excess of 40 knots.  Our 
Boeing 707 was being highly buffeted by the turbulence, bouncing 
passengers like they were on a triple dip roller coaster.  
Landing produced a roar of cheers accompanied by a round of 
applause.  We arrived in Puenta Arenas safely, but I could 
imagine what these winds would do to our tiny twin engine Otter 
during the last leg of our journey to the Falklands.</p><p>

No sooner had I and of my five traveling companions claimed our 
baggage for loading onto the twin Otter,
than we were showing our exit 
documents and having our passports stamped for departure.</p> 
<p>Our
twin Otter had 14 small seats, but this was luxurious, since
there were only six of us onboard.  
 Within 

45 minutes we were airborne once again on our last leg to the 
Falklands.  With
brisk winds were on our tail, our 
British pilot announced that he anticipated a three-hour, rather 
than standard four-hour flight. Peering out the window I could
see the huge southern ocean with white streaks indicating 40
knot winds blowing the tops off of wave crests.  Finally what
started only as a gray smudge on the horizon, became
the Falkland Islands.  Our pilot descended so that we could
see the details of this treeless, barren country.  The small
islands were fringed with intricate coves, white sand beaches
and rocky promontories. </p><p> 

Clearing customs was done quickly
and within 15 minutes we were whisked
by Land Rover to our hotel, the
Upland Goose. After more than 36 hours in 
transit, I finally arrived at my Antarctica departure point; 
tomorrow
we would board the <b><i>MV World Discoverer</i></b>.</p>

<h3>FRIDAY, NOV 24 1995</h3>

<big>
Port Stanley, Falklands</p><p>

Of the world's 17 species of penguins, five nest in the 
Falklands, with their nesting season beginning in late September 
(early in the austral spring) and extending into February (late 
into the austral summer).  Our November arrival was perfect 
timing to see many with eggs in the nest.  The Falklands are 
indeed unique since it is the only civilized area of the world 
where you can actually live among Gentoo, Rockhopper, Magellanic, 
King and Macaroni Penguins.</p><img src="petrel.gif"><p>

Each species of penguin has its own preferred territorial niche.  
The Magellanics use areas where the soil is soft enough to burrow 
into or where they can excavate their burrows.  Rockhoppers, as 
their name implies
, prefer rocky headlands and cliffs overlooking 
the sea, The Gentoos choose flatlands and gentle slopes, some far 
back from the sea and reached by time-worn trails.</p><p>

Living near a Gentoo colony on East Falkland is a colony of 
several hundred King penguins.  Although originally abundant, 
this species was slaughtered and exterminated by whalers and 
sealers greedy for their oil and skins.  Fortunately these 
magnificent birds, the most colorful of the world's penguins, are 
surviving.</p><p>

Our destination from Port Stanley was Volunteer Point where we 
anticipated a Zodiac landing on a remote beach to observe a large 
colony of both King and Gentoo Penguins.  A radio call from the 
scout Zodiac broke the bad news.  A large swell was breaking 
onshore making any type of landing impossible.  We used a back up 
plan which was to run the Zodiacs into shore as close as possible 
just outside the breaking surf zone, then run parallel along the 
beach observing the local birds and penguins.  The plan worked 
and we were treated with a great show of "porpoising" penguins 
all around our Zodiacs.</p></big>

<h3>SATURDAY, NOV 25 1995</h3>

<big>

 Cruising the Falklands</p><p>

Sunrise was at 04:49, but after my two day bout with jet lag I 
slept in until 6 a.m.  Dressing in double layers of waterproof 
gear in  anticipation of a wet landing with our Zodiacs, I went 
to the aft lounge of the <i>World Discoverer
</i> for a quick breakfast 
shared with the other onboard scientists.  Our morning 
destination, Carcass Island in the Falklands, would offer a rich 
variety of wildlife ... was that an understatement!<p></p>

We left the beach landing area to explore more of the uplands 
where approximately 50 species of birds were identified.  These 
included the nestling Black-crowed Night Heron, oyster catchers, 
and, my favorite, the Upland Goose.  In about two miles, we 
entered a Gentoo Penguin colony with approximately 350 birds.  
Most were incubating eggs, however several proud parents 
displayed clutches of two juveniles to our cameras.  We were very 
cautious not to approach too closely since several large Skua 
birds, predators and scavengers were anxiously awaiting a Gentoo 
Penguin parent letting down its guard so the nest could be 
robbed.<p></p>

Pulling anchor at 1600 hours, (4 p.m.), our next destination in 
Antarctica, a mere 676 nautical miles away.  By 2000 hours (8 
p.m.), we would be in open sea, entering the famous Drake 
Passage.  This was a time for both mental and physical 
preparation for "ocean motion" was inevitable.  I recalled the 
passage 12 years earlier on the Unikted
States Coast Guard icebreaker, <i>Polar Star</i>, 
where virtually the entire crew was so seasick they could not 
leave their cabins.  I was fortunately not prone to motion 
sickness, possibly since I lived on my own research vessel, the 
<i>R/V Quest
</i>, for over a dozen years.  It would be interesting to 
see if I retained this immunity.  I certainly hoped so.</p>

<big>
<b>Crossing the Drake Passage.</b>
Wandering Albatross!, came the cry from the stern of the World 
Discoverer.  It was 0600 hours, and I had barely finished my 
first cup of mocha Java, that special blend of 1/2 the ships 
potent coffee and 1/2 thick, dark cocoa.  I was looking at the 
worlds largest sea bird, some with wingspans as large as 12 
feet. It towered over its smaller relatives, the Gray-beaked and 
Black-browed Albatross who were also following in our wake.  All 
the albatrosses  dwarfed the Storm Petrels, smallest of the 
worlds sea birds, and the more common Cape Pigeons, who are not 
really pigeons at all, but petrels.</p><p>

So just why do birds such as the Wandering Albatross follow ships 
when they can travel anywhere they want for stretches up to a 
year at a time, traveling a thousand or more miles, returning to 
land only to breed and bring food to their young?  Layered in 
wool sweaters and my red expedition parka, I ask the expert 
standing next to me on the stern of the World Discoverer.  
Richard Filby, a British seabird guru and veteran of ten 
Antarctic birding expeditions, gave me two answers, food and 
curiosity, simple as that.  We marveled at the gliding and 
soaring ability of the Wandering Albatross in the force 4 winds, 
but it is those blistering winds that the birds really love.</p><p>

More than 350 million birds arrive at their nesting grounds in 
the Antarctic each summer, and then, as winter approaches, take 
off to their mysterious hideaways at sea where they spend about 
90% of their lives.  They travel in the Palmer Peninsula region, 
to which we are headed. Scientists have noted 22 species of birds 
in this area, 11 of which breed on the nearby islands.  Penguins 
dominate these Antarctic populations, making up 50% of the total 
bird population. Other species include cormorants, gulls, terns, 
petrels and skuas.  Skuas, one of the main molesters of young 
penguins, may live up to 70 years.</p><p>

We were now 208 nautical miles from Cape Horn and well into the 
infamous Drake Passage, about 1/3 of our way to Antarctica.  The 
motion of the ship was a nice pleasant rocking thanks to the very 
moderate seas.  A westerly wind was blowing at a gentle force 4 
or about 11 to 16 knots producing about 5 foot waves.  I went to 
bridge to check sea conditions with Captain Oliver Kruess.  The 
inclinometer which measures the ships roll varied slowly between 
plus and minus eight degrees. Captain Oliver Kruess had a smile 
on his face, King Neptune has been good to us so far, he said, 
not like the 30 to 40 foot waves that  i have experienced during 
other passages in the Drake.  During such conditions the 
inclinometer has measured ships roll at over 30 degrees!</p><p>

Our satellite Global Positioning System, GPS. continuously 
provides position updates.  Our current position is Latitude 54 
degrees south and Longitude 60 degrees west: four time zones thus 
4 hours earlier than local California time (PST).  Walking 
outside to the bridge wing, the air was a refreshing 41 degrees 
F,(6 degrees C).  At our present course of 159 degrees true and 
speed of 12.4 knots, we  could reach our first Antarctic landfall 
by tomorrow evening, providing the weather continues in Drake 
Lake fashion! </p><p> 

But now for a little history...
Francis Drake, the infamous English explorer and buccaneer, was 
born in Devon of humble parents, and by age 13 was voyaging to 
the West Indies.  During the years 1577-1580, he sailed around 
the world (the first Englishman to do so) plundering  Spanish 
ships and charting new territory as he went.  On September 6th 
1577, Drake cleared the Straight of Magellan, but the following 
day a severe storm came up.  It drove Drakes ship, the Golden 
Hind, south to 57 degrees.  Here he reached the convergence of 
the Antarctic and the Pacific Oceans.</p><p>

Drakes nephew, Francis Fletcher, describes their falling in 
with the uttermost part of land towards the South Pole without 
which there is no main nor island to be seen to the Southwards; 
but the Atlantic Ocean and the South Sea meet in a passage... 
This proved that Terra de Fuego was not part of <i>Terra Australia 
Incognita</i>, though mapmakers refused to accept this fact for many 
more years.</p><p>

In early evening the <i>World Discoverer</i> crossed the Antarctic 
Convergence, a zone of upwelling where frigid Antarctic seawater 
sinks beneath the warmer waters from the north.  Within minutes 
water temperatures can plunge from 10 degrees F to well below 
zero.  This was verified at exactly 1930, 7:30 pm, when the first 
mate reported a temperature drop at the ships seawater intakes.  
At these lower temperatures the ships fresh water maing system 
cannot operate, thus the captain informed us that water rationing 
would be in effect for our remaining stay in Antarctica.<p></p>  
	To my surprise the ships engine room provided a wealth of 
scientific information.  Several hours earlier when cleaning the 
seawater intake filters, the chief engineer brought a bowl of 
lobster krill topside.  These brilliant red crustaceans are a 
close relative of the Antarctic krill, <i>Euphausia superba</i>,   but  
have long lobster like  pinchers and a strong under-curve tail.  
This was certainly one food source of our sea bird following.</p><p>

Due to the very cold Antarctic summer , the Southern Hemisphere 
circulation is meteorologically stronger that that of the 
Northern Hemisphere.  The Southern Circumpolar Westerly winds 
remain strong throughout the year.  This creates the Brave 
Westerlies of sailing fame, lying between 40 and 60 degrees 
south latitude, along the route for early clipper ships.  Seas 
driven by winds may reach incredible proportions, thus the 
latitudes connected with Drakes passage are nicknamed the 
Roaring 40s and 50s. If gale force winds and mountainous seas 
were not enough, floating glacial ice also presents a danger to 
mariners.</p><p>

In past times, the amount of floating glacial ice in the Southern 
Ocean was much greater than at present, possibly contributing to 
the decline of clipper ships and the development of steam 
navigation.  Early ships logs record periods when enormous 
quantities of ice were encountered, some as large as 40 miles 
long and over 300 feet high. Today satellite, optical and 
infrared instruments provide almost instantaneous ice and sea 
information.  The Falkland Island Penguin News reported that an 
iceberg the size of Jersey was heading for shipping lanes.  The 
British Antarctic Survey reported that this 82 square mile block 
of ice broke away from a section which fell off the Larson Ice 
Shelf and  floated 300 miles northeast.  It is now slowly moving 
northward towards the tip of Argentina, as we continue our

0440 I arrived in the aft lounge and to my amazement saw 10 red 
parka-clad adventurers outside on the stern peering through their 
binoculars at an awaking sky teeming with soaring seabirds.  
Its a narrow window available to observe unusual sea birds that 
tend to concentrate around the convergence zone, came the 
muffled  comment from an unidentified  observer.  That particular 
bird is the Light-mantled Sooty Albatross, which is a beautiful 
bird with a white eye-ring, however it is not really interested 
in following the ships as are the other sea bird species.  It 
glides past the 
<i><b>World Discovers</b></i> stern, making a grandstand 
appearance, then within a short period disappears over the 
horizon.  Within the convergence zone and onward to Antarctica we 
will find seabirds that feed on krill while those outside and 
nearer to the Falklands use squid as their primary  diet.</p><p>

While different species of squid live in the waters around the 
Falklands and in the Drake Passage, it is  <i><b>Loligo</b>
</i>  that is most 
important.  Seabirds such as the graceful Wandering Albatross are 
now in competition with man for this resource.  World demand for 
squid from the Southwest Atlantic has literally exploded in the 
recent past, with current catches more than 500 times what they 
were 20 years ago.  Mangus George, fisheries scientist for the 
Falklands, reports that commercial daily catches range from a 
high of 30 million, to the present 12 million on a good day, 
representing an annual market value over $10 million.  To me, as 
I watch three different species of albatross that rely heavily on 
squid as their main food , I can only wonder if such heavy 
commercial  fishing  can significantly impact the populations of 
these majestic sea birds.</p><p>

We have arrived in Antarctica!  Land was first sighted at 1900 
hours.  Our destination and first Zodiac launch point was 
Elephant Island to view its namesake inhabitants, the southern 
elephant seals. Elephant Island is best known for its connection 
with Sir Ernest Shackletons  <i><b>Endurance</b>
</i>  expedition of 1914-1916. 
 On April 15, 1916, Shackleton and 27 men landed on Elephant 
Island after the Endurance was crushed by ice pack.  Nine days 
later Shackleton and five men set out for South Georgia Island in 
their 22-foot  lifeboat, to seek help.  The remaining men stayed 
on Elephant Island, surviving on seals and penguins until 
Shackleton returned to rescue them 128 days later.  All survived, 
a tale of heroism unequaled in the history of Antarctic 
exploration.

<h3>Tuesday, November 28, 1995</h3>



<big>
If I wanted nice warm, sunny weather, I would have stayed in 
southern California!, I humorously quipped to the Englishman 
standing next to me on the stern of the <i><b>World Discoverer</b>
</i>.  The 
weather enroute to Penguin Island was unbelievable with calm 
seas, practically no wind, and near tropical 33 degrees F 
temperatures!  The sun blazed above the horizon at 0331, two 
hours ago!  Returning from Elephant Island by Zodiac at 10 PM, we 
swapped stories of the Wedell and Elephant seals observed as we 
downed a few cups of hot bullion from the galley.  Despite 
turning in near midnight, practically everyone was on deck with 
cameras capturing the incredible aqua blue color associated with 
the huge icebergs passing less than 100 feet from the World 
Discoverer.</p><p>

Elephant Island not only had two species of seals, but several 
large colonies of Chinstrap Penguins, and both Gentoo and 
Macaroni Penguins were spotted in isolated areas.  I sat down on 
a rocky ledge about 15 feet from the colony, the closest 
recommended distance, so that the breeding penguins would not be 
disturbed.  Because it was so late in the evening, the light was 
too poor for photographs, so I focused my attention on their 
courtship behavior and nest exchange ceremonies.  Most of the 
Chinstraps had eggs in a nest which was little more than a 
depression surrounded by hundreds of ice-cube sized rocks.  
Nesting practically on the waters edge, they had little distance 
to travel to enter the water and feed on krill.  It was easy to 
verify their krill diet not only from the distinctive smell of 
the colony, but also from several isolated areas of regurgitated 
krill.  Penguins, as well as most other Antarctic animals and 
birds, rely on krill as their main food source.</p><p>

It was almost 13 years ago to the day that I took my first icy 
plunge into the 28 degree F waters off Palmer Research station in 
Antarctica to test the underwater video equipment and biological 
sampling equipment I had built for a krill research project 
funded by the National Science Foundation.  I was working with 4 
other diving scientists whose common goal was to observe and 
document first hand the underwater behavior of krill.  Our diving 
research would take us throughout the Palmer Peninsula area of 
Antarctic where we would log dozens of blue water dives with 
the evasive krill.  Blue water diving, where no bottom reference 
is available, requires divers to be connected via a trapeze of 
lines to a near-surface safety diver.</p><p>

After my diving experiences with krill, I agree with biologist, 
David Campbell, author of the Crystal Desert, that swarms of 
krill are among the greatest biological phenomena on earth.  
They are the planktonic equivalents of...the migration of 
wildebeest and zebras across the Serengeti.  Krill swarms with 
densities of 20,000 or more krill per square meter, are akin to a 
school of locusts darkening the overhead sky.  Recently, the RV 
Melville measured a swarm 58 miles square and 600 feet deep, 
containing an estimated 10-40 billion pounds of krill.  But our 
job, as diving scientists, was to try to unravel many of the 
biological mysteries of krill that were necessary to manage a 
potentially emerging fishery.
</p><p>

The name krill, which comes from a Norwegian word meaning both 
small fish or whale food, includes about 85 species of 
crustaceans.  The superb krill:  
<i><b>Euphausia superba</b></i>, or the 
Antarctic krill, is the key stepping stone in the food chain 
between microscopic plants called diatoms, and giant whales, the 
largest creatures on earth.</p><p>

Recent research by Dr. Robin Ross and her husband, Dr. Langdon 
Quetin, of the University of California, Santa Barbara, revealed 
several startling facts.  First, krill could live up to11 years 
in the lab and at least 5 years in the wild, which was a much 
longer than the two years previously estimated.  Second, females 
may release eggs as often as once a week during the short 
Antarctic summer, not just once a year.  These researchers have 
also shed light on the question of where krill go in the winter.  
Rather than hibernate at the ocean bottom, as previously 
believed, they lead a vigorous life on the underside of the ice.  
Krill larvae take refuge in the ices nooks and crannies and 
adult krill move under the icepack to feed on algae.</p><p>

In the open ocean, krill use their long antennae, big eyes, and 
vigorous swimming legs to go after food.  It was once thought 
that they preferred only small diatoms, but it has now been 
discovered that their preferences include small animal plankton 
as well.</p><p>

Twenty five years ago, krill were regarded as the last 
unexplained fishery and the magical species that would save 
millions of the worlds protein starved humans.  In response to 
over-fishing for krill, a new convention was formed, its 
intention being to enforce an ecosystem approach to 
conservation by treating all marine life south of the convergence 
as a single system, rather than a collection of individuals.  
Over-harvesting of krill would have a catastrophic effect on the 
Antarctic ecosystem, so limits were imposed on the catch.  The 
Soviet Union and Japan had been harvesting almost 500 million 
tons per year, but that amount was lowered to only 300,000 tons 
in 1994.  (By comparison, the total annual world catch of all 
marine animals is less than 100 million tons).  World stock 
estimates of krill have been put as high as 7 billion tons.</p><p> 

As a rich source of protein, krill are on a par with steak, but 
at a fraction of the cost.  Once touted as an inexpensive food 
source, processing costs proved to be quite high since krill 
spoil rapidly and the desirability of krill as a direct food 
source is doubtful.  Krill collected in nets onboard our 
Antarctic research vessel were thrown into an egg omelette that, 
Ill admit, was not the best Ive ever tasted.  However, when 
freeze dried into a white, tasteless, odorless powder, Krill 
Protein Concentrate, KPC, it is a more usable product.  Also, the 
industry shows promise in using chiton from krill shells to 
manufacturer polymers.  So, why the catch decrease?  In part, it 
is due to both the breakup of the Soviet Union and new medical 
studies.  In small doses, about a milligram per day, fluoride 
helps combat tooth decay.  Krill concentrate the fluoride in 
seawater in their shells at over 1000 milligrams per pound.  
However, anything over 10 milligrams of fluoride per day in 
humans can deform bones, prevent growth and suppress fertility.  
New peeling technologies which remove the tail can minimize 
fluoride.  Unfortunately, as the desirability of krill increases, 
new problems for their populations may arise.  If man becomes 
another major predator of krill, the result may be the collapse 
of the





entire Antarctic ecosystem, not just a single fishery.</p><p>

A bottle of the finest French champagne onboard will be awarded 
to the person spotting the first large iceberg! announces 
Captain Kruess yesterday from the bridge PA system.  At about 60 
degrees south latitude, one was spotted and the champagne was 
awarded by the Captain.  I would have guessed this location since 
several scientific reports have documented the calving 
of giant new icebergs from the neighboring Larsen ice shelf.  
Now, less than 16 hours after the first spotting, we were in a 
proverbial sea of giant icebergs!  British Antarctic Survey 
scientist, David Vaughn, reported that the Antarctic Peninsula 
has had a mean temperature rise of 4 degrees F since 1945.  He 
cant say whether its a natural local fluctuation or whether 
something is happening globally. But its significance could be 
quite important. </p><p>

The West Antarctic ice sheet is grounded on rock below sea level. 
 If the sheet thins, it simply could slide off the rock shelf and 
float out to sea.  That thinning alone would raise world sea 
level directly by an estimated 16 feet.  More dramatically, 
disintegration of the East Antarctic ice sheet would raise sea 
level by almost 200 feet!</p><p>

Most peoples view of the Antarctic as a giant ice cube is not 
far wrong, since it is covered by an ice sheet containing 90 
percent of the ice and 70 percent of the earths fresh water.  On 
the peninsulas coast, where the World Discoverer will visit, 
five ice streams several thousand feet thick flow faster than 
those in the rest of Antarctica.  These ice streams, perched atop 
water-saturated mud, if sufficiently heated as a result of global 
warming, may slide into the Antarctic Polar current, not only 
raising sea level, but certainly bringing a bottle of champagne 
to the first observing it!</p><p>

What an absolutely incredible day!  The first scout Zodiac 
verified near perfect landing conditions at both Turret Point on 
King George Island and the adjacent Penguin Island.  Four types 
of penguins were observed:  Adelie, Gentoo, Macaroni and even the 
evasive King, largest of those found. 
Even though they look quite similar, both human an other penguins 
can tell the species apart. This fact is probably much more 
important to the penguins since it eliminates wasted time and 
energy.  
The research ornithologists and neophyte bird watchers, like 
myself, had a field day.  The Giant Petrel, Blue-eyed Shag and 
Kelp Gull were nesting.  More common species like the Skua, 
Antarctic Tern and Sheathbill were abundant.  Of particular 
interest is the Giant Southern Petrel which has evolved a unique 
defense mechanism not unlike that of the skunk.  If 



approached too closely, it will spit out an extremely pungent oil 
whose rank odor stays in clothes for weeks.  I was told of a 
research report on petrel tagging where a forward-approaching 
decoy researcher with an umbrella was sent towards the bird to 
deflect the smelly oil, while a second researcher sneaked up from 
the rear to tag the bird!</p><p> 

Entertainment, during a wonderful Italian pasta buffet served in 
the Marco Polo dining room, was provided by both Humpback and 
Minke whales frolicking off our starboard side.</p><p>

At 1545 hours, I departed in a Zodiac on a tour around Admiralty 
Bay and past the Lange glacier.  An hour later, the Zodiac was 
beached at the Brazilian Research Station, Ferraz.  This is an 
active research station that has a wide variety of on-going 
research projects that deal with ecology, marine mammals, 
penguins and glaciers.  They will dine with us tonight onboard 
the <i><b>World Discoverer</b></i>.</p><p>

Antarctica is a continent that absolutely defies literary 
superlatives.  Although its physical proportions are 
mathematically calculable in every respect, it defies image 
quantification.  It is a seamless land where white meets white: 
the horizon dissolves so that snow and sky appear as one.  Its 
austere beauty is unspoiled by neon, billboards or searchlights.  
Its chiseled monochrome features depict the brazen reality of a 
pristine yet desolated land mass. </p><p>

Antarctica is today very similar to that of North America and 
Europe a mere million years ago.  Buried under a thick covering 
of snow and ice with only the mountain peaks protruding, our 
civilized northern hemisphere emerged with the rise of global 
temperatures and the melting of continental ice.  Only 
Antarctica, still glaciated as in the Pleistocene, can be 
observed as it existed millennia ago when our own species was  
evolving.  Due to extremely cold temperatures, nothing decomposes 
or deteriorates here, it just freezes or becomes mummified.  
Thus, in the frontier of Antarctica, triumph and death are 
inseparable companions whose epic chronologies are preserved only 
by the cold.</p><p>

The lure of Antarctica, that mystical southern continent, has 
challenged civilized man for over 2,500 years.  Ancient Greek 
scholars theorized its existence based on the concept of symmetry 
long before Mediterranean mariners ventured past the Straights of 
Gibraltar.  Even early Polynesian legends told of a white land to 
the south. Yet it was the last of the continents to be discovered 
by man.  Although Bartholemew Diaz and his crew were the first to 
feel the breath of Antarctica in 1488 when they passed the 
southern tip of Africa, it was not until 1895 that man first 
stepped ashore on the Antarctic mainland.  Since then, volumes 
have been written on the arduous and sometimes tragic expeditions 
and adventures of bold explorers.  While the early part of this 
century was characterized by competitive exploration, the latter 
half of this century will be remembered as a time of cooperative 
science.  Scientists world over agree that Antarctica plays a 
pivotal role in understanding global phenomena despite the fact 
that we still know less about Antarctic topography than about the 
surface of the moon. </p><p> 







Genetic evidence suggests that the human species originated in 
one place and spread over the earth.  Now,
only recently has 
this long, slow migration reached the last frontier of the 
planet, the seventh continent, Antarctica.  The
lights of scientific research 
stations now show through the polar darkness ushering in a new 
age of cooperative exploration and research.  The hospitality 
shown during our visit to the Brazilian Research Station, Ferraz, 
certainly proved this to be the case.

<h3>Wednesday, November 29, 1995</h3>



<big>
I have good news and bad news, reported Captain Kruess from the 
bridge of the <i><b>World Discoverer</b>
</i>.  The good news is that we will 
be stopping at three unique landing spots tomorrow, the bad news 
is that to make this possible, breakfast will be served at 4:30 
A.M.!  Our landings were scheduled for the South Shetland group, 
the largest archipelago in Antarctica which forms a chain of 11 
main islands and many smaller ones, almost 335 miles in length.  
In common with other islands of the region, this group has a 
history of exploitation by sealers and whalers.  Today, the South 
Shetlands are the home of research stations maintained by several 
countries.</p><p>

True to his word, the captain dropped anchor  at 4:15 AM on the 
southwestern side of Roberts Island, an area never before visited 
by the <i><b>World Discoverer</b>
</i>.  Our position, lat. 62.5 deg S, long. 
59.5 deg W, put us directly in front of an easily accessible, 
protected cove shared by colonies of chinstrap penguins and 
harems of elephant seals.  The last reported landing on this 
island was 1987 to establish a navigation marker and conduct a 
penguin survey.  At that time, 2,400 pairs of penguins were 
sited.  Our count showed 22 Gentoo nests and approximately 800 
Chinstraps.</p><p>

We counted 54 elephant seals, many 4-5 year olds, posturing with 
each other for dominance with deep, bellowing groans and chest 
shoving.  There were also numerous 2 month old elephant seal pups 
who had just completed weaning.  Early birth in the austral 
season gives them a head start for maximum feeding before the 
long winter months set in.  One pup, dead at birth, was devoured 
down to the bones by the predatory skua birds.  A single Weddel 
seal and an Antarctic fur seal were also spotted.  Although there 
are 9 different species of fur seals, the Antarctic fur seal has 
made the most dramatic comeback since early sealers nearly made 
the species extinct.  In the 1920s, there were fewer than 200 
reported, now recovered to over a million.</p><p>

Promptly at 0800, the anchor was raised and we sailed to Altcho 
Island, a 1 1/2 hour cruise to the east.  Here we observed an 
incredible number of nesting chinstraps and gentoo penguins.  
Nesting sites were on virtually every area of the island not 
covered by snow.  Most penguins were already beginning their 30 
plus days of incubation.  Many in their first year as adults were 
still building rock nests, often stealing pebbles from their 
neighbors.  The squawking, head-bobbing displays of courtship 
soon gave way to mating to insure egg laying and chick rearing in 
the short, Antarctic summer season.</p><p>

The biology of Altcho Island was matched only by its incredible 
geology and spectacular vistas.  The elevated view over the huge 
bay with its fairy-castles of dark, jutting rocks and blue-tinged 
icebergs should be counted as one of the true wonders of the 
world.  The breathtaking view from the 600 foot summit equals 
that of the Grand Canyon or the Ngaro Ngaro crater in Tanzania. 
Altcho Bay is indeed the Antarctic Garden of Eden.</p><p>

Leaving Altcho, our next destination was Half Moon Island to view 
Weddel seals basking on the beach and a fine rookery of the 
Blue-eyed Shag.  The shag, technically a cormorant, still had 
their elongated head plumes which remain through courtship, but 
are lost by molt after the young hatch.  They croak softly during 
courtship, but hiss loudly when disturbed by a too close 
observer.  And in Antarctica, a hiss is like a kiss goodbye and
a call to a 
your bunk for a good nights rest before landing at the next 
destination, which for us is Hanna Point and Deception Island.

<h3>Thursday, November 30, 1995</h3>



<big>
Our first stop this morning was Hannah Point on the south shore 
of Livingston Island, where colonies of Blue-eyed Shags, Gentoo 
and Chinstrap Penguins as well as Southern Elephant Seals were 
found.  We were very cautious to give wide berth to the group of 
9 elephant seals at the top of the ridge adjacent to a sheer 40 
foot drop off.  Last season, it was reported that a frightened  
elephant seal plunged over the cliff to his death.  No suicidal 
seals were observed on our landing, although one charged through 
the Chinstrap rookery and nearly went over a researchers 
backpack.  As the lumbering elephant seal passed through the 
rookery, it almost crushed a nesting Gentoo who stood ground 
valiantly protecting its egg-laden nest.

A shore landing was also made 1 mile to the east to view a 
museum of fossils that revealed a previously much warmer 
Antarctica.  Numerous 4 to 5 week old  elephant seals, fat from 
long periods of nursing, were now abandoned by their mothers as 
has been done for thousands of years.  The pups cautiously 
approached us with sad looks as if to say, Are you my mom?  It 
was now their time to call upon inborn traits to forage for 
themselves and insure survival.

Despite a slight rolling swell, we made a Zodiac landing at Baily 
Head on the west end of Livingston Island where there is a colony 
of over 250,000 Chinstrap Penguins.  We observed them marching in 
columns between their 1/2 mile inland nesting grounds in the 
remnants of the sides of a volcano and to the shore below.  It 
reminded us of a traffic jam on Interstate 405 in California 
without the stop and go!  Departing from shore, a rogue swell 
crashed over the back of our Zodiac showering us with frigid, 28 
degree Antarctic water!

Later, we arrived in an area of active volcanism.  Deception 
Island experienced its last eruption in 1970.  Three research 
stations were affected by the activity, and two were destroyed.  
At 1545 in the afternoon, the <i><b>World Discoverer
</b></i> passed through the 
impressive Neptunes Bellows, the gateway to Port Foster.  The 
icy cliffs of the gateway were a startling contrast to the sheet 
of fractured ice covering the ocean surface.  Neptunes Bellows 
is the entrance to the cauldera, an area created in the center of 
the volcanos cone.  On the side of the cauldera is a U shaped 
window, where one can see inside the cauldera from the icy waters 
on the outside.  The shore landing was smooth and we observed old 
whaling buildings, a former British research station, and an 
abandoned airplane.  Those of us who felt hearty, hiked to the 
top of the hill to look down into a smaller cauldera of a volcano 
then continued down the hill across a geothermal beach area where 
we warmed our feet and finally walked up the side of rocky cliffs 
into Neptunes window.

At 1900, the <i><b>World Discoverer
</b></i> moved towards Pendulum Cove, the 
site of the hot springs, where, weather permitting, we had 
planned to take a dip and become official members of the elite 
Deception Island Hot Tub Club. Heavy ice pack, however, blocked 
the entrance to this unique thermal cove, so we were unable to 
have our Antarctic swim.  Captain Krusse entertained all onboard 
by taking the ship through some of the solid ice pack in dramatic 
demonstration of the ships ice breaking capabilities.  The steel 
hull reverberated the sound of the crushing ice as the ship 
pitched up and down over the ice pack slicing an ever widening 
passage, resembling the trail left by a plow clearing a snowy 
roadway.

<h3>Friday, December 1, 1995</h3>



<big>

It was the light refracting and reflecting through sculptured 
icebergs that created breathtaking sights on a one hour Zodiac 
tour through Mikkelsen Harbor, (lat. 64 degrees S and long. 61 
degrees W).  The harbor is really a very small bay surrounded by 
the glacier ice cliffs of Trinity Island.  Passing next to huge 
glaciers, hundreds of feet high, we could see the folding of 
layers of sediment in the pristine white ice matrix, making 
almost lace-like patterns. After the tour, in which we got our 
first glimpse of the Antarctic continent located a mere 6 
nautical miles to the south, we headed for a shore landing site.  
This site was a small, unnamed rock island just south of Trinity 
Island within Mikkelson Harbor.  Covered by a recent snowfall, we 
used shovels to carve steps to form a crude walkway.  On the 
island, about a half mile in diameter, we walked among 
alternasting groups of Weddell Seals and colonies of Gentoo 
Penguins with spectacular vistas in all directions.</p><p>

There are two distinctive man-made landmarks at this site.  
First, a radar reflector and visual tower erected by the 
Argentines at the islands 55 foot summit.  About 75 nesting 
Gentoos were observed here, nearly buried by the recent heavy 
snow.  Refusing to leave their nests, most of which contained at 
least one egg, they steadfastly maintained their vigil of 
incubation with only their beaks remaining above snow level.</p><p>  

The second major landmark was an Argentinean refuge hut built in 
1953.  As with the radar tower, nesting Gentoos were also 
abundant here.  However, these birds had the advantage of nesting 
in the lee of the hut. The scenery was fantastic.  The offshore 
waters were crystal clear and we could easily make out the rocky 
bottom down to 15 feet or more.  The recent snow covered much of 
the beach area, burying both an old whaling boat and several 
whale skeletons reported to be here.</p><p>

Returning to the ship, an entire pod of Minke Whales was spotted 
directly off the starboard bow; they kept us alert and 
entertained as we traveled slowly through the uncharted waters.  
The warm weather and bright skies made viewing the penguin 
covered icebergs and watching a large group of penguins leaping 
in and out of the water, a pure delight.  We had sea state zero, 
dead calm, wich is incredibly unusual for the Antarctic.  We 
passed close by a small iceberg, referred to as a growler, with a 
rare, solitary Antarctic Petrel perched atop.</p><p>

By mid-afternoon, we arrived at a group of  islets known as the 
Hydrurga Rocks, lat 64-10 S and long 61-50W.  Temperatures soared 
to 39 degrees F without any wind, which allowed us to shed at 
least two layers of protective clothing.  The surrounding scenery 
of nearby Two Hummock Island, located 1 mile to the east, was 
truly spectacular.  Its dual 669 foot peaks resembled a 
miniature, snow-covered version of  my college namesake, 
Saddleback Mountain.  Our Zodiac excursion permitted ice flow 
views of Chinstrap Penguins, Blue-eyed Shags and some of the most 
delicately sculptured icebergs I had ever seen.</p><p>

We later arrived at Portal Point marked by a survey hut 
constructed in 1956 by the Falkland Island Dependencies Survey as 
a base for dog sledding expeditions along the Antarctica 
Peninsula.  It was so named because the Point was a rare gateway 
onto the icecap plateau.  We had an opportunity to explore the 
hut and surroundings and climb onto the glacier behind it.  We 
have officially stepped foot onto the Antarctic Continent!  
Tomorrow we travel to Paradise Bay.

<h3>Saturday, December 2, 1995</h3>



<big>


Sunrise:  0249   At 0700, Captain Kruess, at light force 2 winds, 

maneuvered the World Discoverer into Errera Channel between Ronge 

and Cuverville Islands.  By selecting this spot, we could visit 
both islands, each with an abundance of wildlife and breathtaking 

vistas of cascading glaciers from huge mountains.  Cuverville 
Island, famous for its penguin freeways, has an elaborate network 

of interconnecting paths and trails leading from scattered 
snow-free nesting sites to the waters edge.  At Ronge Island, 
(Lat 64-40S, Lo 62-40W), having trudged through thigh-high snow, 
we found incredible photo opportunities from large numbers of 
nesting Gentoo Penguins against the backdrop of Mount Tennant, a 
pyramidal peak 2,257 feet high with steep sides.</p><p>


At 2030-2230, we visited Paradise Bay and the Argentinean 
Research Station, Almirante Brown.  Years ago, an Argentine 
doctor, who refused to be left on the base, set it ablaze as the 
supply ship was leaving so he would be taken back home!  In our 
short stay, we climbed the high peaks beyond the base and used 
our red expedition parkas or plastic liners to slide down the 
hillside.  Many of us took advantage of the Zodiacs to float 
among the icebergs and chunks of pack ice.  As the light snow 
subsided and the fog lifted, a massive glacier became visible 
with its many hues of blue.  Tidal action had carved many caves 
near the water level.  We could clearly see the cracks in the ice 

where part of the glacier would break of to form new icebergs.

<h3>Sunday, December 3, 1995</h3>



<big>
 

It was 0650 and we had been sailing through the 7 mile long 
Lemaire Channel for about 15 minutes when I heard, Killer Whale 
on stern.  The whale showed its long, slender dorsal fin and 
white saddle body markings before it sounded, vanished into the 
icy, narrow channel.  This waterway, one of the most spectacular 
landmarks on the Antarctic Peninsula, is often called Kodak Gap 

because of its photographic scenery.  On either side of this 
natural channel, precipitous peaks rise dramatically to over 
1,000 meters.  We were privileged, not just for spotting our 
third different species of whale, but to have this spectacular 
channel clear of ice.  The calving of the glaciers bordering 
Lemaire is liable to fill the channel with small bergs and bergy 
bits.  A passenger aboard the converted Russia research vessel, 
the Akademik Ioffi, reported that it could not enter the channel 
the previous day or stop at Paradise Bay due to changing ice 
conditions.</p><p>

Our last stop on the Antarctic continent was Petterman Island.  
In 1909, Dr. Charcot wintered here in a small inlet named Port 
Circumcision.  Being our last stop, I donned a very formal tuxedo 

with tails and top hat, both to humor my shipmates and see the 
penguins reactions.  It was interesting that the penguins would 
permit the red parka clad explorers to approach much closer than 
myself before becoming alarmed, so, indeed, I may have been 
viewed as a giant black and white threat!</p><p>

Within minutes of our shore landing, staff scientist/lecturer, 
Dr. Cam Kepler, spotted a tiny midge on an associates parka.  In 

this simple sighting, we had the opportunity to view 100% of the 
insects found on the entire continent of Antarctica!  Life on the 

icy fringes is indeed hard.  With less than 2% of the continent 
exposed and even that mostly inhospitable vertical rock faces, 
terrestrial life is restricted to various species of lichens and 
moss.  Antarctica is indeed a marine based ecosystem.  This was 
further verified as we observed penguins swimming in the crystal 
clear waters of the bay and a small, friendly Weddell Seal 
frolicking in the ice floes.</p><p>

Entering a nearby refuge hut, we found a 3-stringed guitar, 
various multi-lingual books and an original journal dating back 
almost 40 years.  A 1952 journal entry told of three Brits who 
skied from nearby Faraday Station but were trapped in the hut 
several months due to the changing ice conditions.  The account 
details both their arduous stay and the eventual departure; 
however, no word was ever heard from them again.  We thought of 
this as a lead Zodiac forged a path through large fragments of 
pack ice to return to the World Discoverer which was itself 
maneuvering by bow thruster to keep the sidegate ice-free for our 

return.</p><p>

These same changing ice conditions in August caused the U.S. 
Palmer Station supply ship, Polar Duke, to become stuck in a 10 
to 15 foot thick pressure ridge of ice for 5 weeks.  Unable to 
reach Palmer Station, they returned to Chile to double load 
cargo and scientists for a second try which was successful.</p>
<p>

At 1130, we reached our southernmost point of the journey, Lat 65 

degrees, 12.2 minutes, only 1607.8 nautical miles from the South 
Pole, the absolute bottom of the world!  Again, Killer Whales 
were spotted, this time one smaller whale and two larger ones, 
possibly males.  With the French Passage closed due to heavy pack 

ice, as would be expected this early in the season, we turned 
then retraced our path through the Lemaire Channel, west to the 
Bismark Strait and set course 355 degrees passing within 10 miles 

of Palmer Station, the U.S. Research base on the western end of 
Anvers Island.  For the next two days, we again would be at the 
mercy of the Drake Passage before our next port of call, Ushuaia, 

Chile.

<center><b>I. THE PROBLEM</b></center>
<p>

<b><u>Introduction</u></b><p>

     The term <i>senus communis</i> in Cicero's time meant that all the
senses, such as seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, and
touch, were translated equally into each other. It was the
Latin definition of man in a healthy natural state, when
physical and psychic energy were constant and distributed in
a balanced way to all sense areas<p>

     . . . . Western man thinks with only one part of his brain
and starves the rest of it. By neglecting ear culture, which
is too diffuse for the categorical hierarchies of the left
side of the brain, he has locked himself into a position
where only linear conceptualization is acceptable. . . . The
constraints of Western logic are tied to our sense of
sequential relationships--logic made visual.(McLuhan &amp;
Powers, 1989, p. 37-39)<p>

<p>

     All of life is an amalgamation and internalization of
external stimuli, acting as a catalyst which produces a new
awareness, a learning experience. Education and its constructs
are on-going and important to life itself; they must keep pace;
they must assimilate new paradigm shifts; they must address the
whole experience.  <p>

     Peters (1987), Attali (1991), Dizard (1989) and others claim
that it is the Age of Information. The most pervasive tool of
this new age is the computer. The computer, and its micro-chip
technology, are thought to have revolutionized all areas of life
from industry and education to cognitive development and social
interaction.  As society seeks to have a population of life-long
learners, the computer appears to be a critical component for
fulfilling this lofty goal. <p>

     Emerging from the days of the Industrial Age, American
society found that purposeful machines simplified tasks and made
the mundane tasks of life both easier and faster to accomplish. 
At no time during the Industrial Age was a machine created that
was multi-tasking and also multi-purpose.  The computer is just
such a machine.  Like the one-room schoolhouse, which taught a
full complement of subjects to students of various ages and skill
levels, the computer is multi-tasking and more than simply a text
processor.  The computer can organize, select, and present
multiple sensory components.  <p>

     The multimedia computer offers another level of sensory
experience. Multimedia technology can bring a new sense of
"reality" into the classroom, thus transforming the educational
arena and instructional environment into that one-room
schoolhouse of a simpler time. Today's higher education system,
especially at the community college level, is challenged by a
diverse student body entering classes with varying degrees of
preparedness.  A single class may contain students whose skill
levels range from extremely prepared to those who are under or
unprepared for academic rigors.  Therefore, the metaphor of the
one-room schoolhouse prevails, as instructors are faced with
teaching a variety of students of varying skill levels.  <p>

     Traditional  instruction,  what  Axelrod  (1973)  calls  the
"content-centered style" and Laurillard (1987)  calls the
"didactic model," is characterized by the instructor who presents
information via lectures.  This lecture model currently dominates
undergraduate education in the United States.<p>

       <u>A Nation At Risk</u>, the 1973 assessment of the educational
system, documented serious deficiencies in the way America
educates people in our society.  Almost 20 years later there is
little reason for optimism. High drop-out rates, illiteracy and
lack of commitment are regularly encountered in educational
institutions throughout the United States.  What is true in
education is reflected in industry.  Over 20 percent of assembly
line workers at a major  U.S. auto manufacturer  could not read
their instruction manuals. Additionally, a major technology
company found that 80 percent of job applicants were unable to
pass a fifth-grade math test (Braun, 1991).<p>

     The traditional approach to instruction poses particular
problems for students with minority ethnic or racial backgrounds. 
These students bring with them the challenges of cultural
transition, economic disadvantage and often a native language
other than English.  Already, in California, New York, and
Florida, the majority of K-12 students belong to a racial or
ethnic "minority" (Fjeldstad, 1991). <p>

     Many reflective observers argue that traditional educational
approaches are not working.  Glick (1990) points out that
traditional instruction focuses on what the teacher does. 
However, a healthy paradigm shift is now occurring that takes
into account the needs, skill level and preparation of the
student. In this view, it is not what the teacher does but what
the student does that results in learning. These shifts in
thinking are analogous to and in line with paradigm shifts
occurring in other social sciences.  In the area of
communication, for instance, the traditional communication model
followed a one-dimensional, linear path that focused on the
speaker as the most important element of a communication
transaction.  The speaker gave a message to an audience. That
model is diagramed in figure 1. <p>
Speaker
        Message
        Audience
<center>Figure 1</center>
<p>

However, the current thinking is that this model is too
simplistic and does not take into account the perceptual
sophistication and experience of the audience.  Its similarities
to the lecture-centered education model and the domination of the
instructor over the other elements are patent.  <p>

     More contemporary communication models examine a variety of
variables that influence the outcome of the communication
transaction.  Among those variables are the audience, the channel
the message takes (written, spoken word in a face-to-face
setting, the printed word in a print setting, the spoken word in
an electronic setting i.e. mass media or the electronic setting
via the computer), the context in which the communication occurs,
the message itself, and the setting or environment.  Audience
feedback to the speaker is also extremely important in assessing
success or failure (Hanna and Gibson, 1989; Gronbeck, German,
Ehninger and Monroe, 1992). Figure 2 is a diagram of this model<hr>

<p>

     As the demand for more effective communication increases,
some innovative educators and school districts are experimenting
with nontraditional approaches  in the facilitation of student
learning. These approaches often mirror newer global
communication models which include the use of computers and
multimedia technology.   Bork (1987),  for example, believes that
"Computers are going to become the dominant delivery system for
education.  That is, more people will learn, in the future, more
things from computers than any other way of learning" (p.3).  <p>

     The power of the computer is best seen in its multimedia
configuration which includes an integration of multiple media --
text,  graphics,  sound,  animation and video -- into a coherent
educational or training module.  If the adage that people retain
about 20 percent of what they hear, 40 percent of what they see
and hear, and 75 percent of what they see, hear, <i>and</i> do is
correct, then  multimedia  delivered  instruction  should  lead 
to  better retention of material than traditionally delivered
instruction. Evidence is accumulating from industry and
educational institutions that multimedia can indeed transform
student learning (e.g., Kahn, 1992; Janson, 1992).<p>

     What is it about multimedia computer applications that can
actively engage the minds of students where traditional
instruction cannot? It is, in a word: inter-activity. Or, as
Kozma and Johnston (1991) write, the power of the computer lies
in "its ability to employ a wide range of symbols and to operate
on symbolic expressions in powerful ways, for these are the
capabilities that most closely correspond to human cognitive and
social behavior" (p. 12).  Multimedia instruction has an
unmatched potential to foster inter-activity through its wide
range of symbol systems (the way information is symbolized, such
as audio linguistic or graphical). Additionally, the learner has
control over the pacing and sequencing of the material.
Multimedia interactive tutorials are useful in that they foster
student learning and retention in the ways specified in Gagne's
(1985) research on the factors that promote optimum learning. 
Gagne's research identifies the following, all of which
underscore the importance of student involvement with
instructional material: attention, selective perception,
rehearsal,  semantic encoding, retrieval, response organization
and corrective feedback. The interactive multimedia tutorial
offers the potential to employ all these processes. <p>

<p>

<b><u>Background</b></u><p>

     American education continues to be characterized by an
endless duplication of stereotypical classrooms, each containing
30 to 40 students, all day, every day, where students are
required to sit in neat rows of chairs which may be bolted to the
floor so that all eyes are fixed on the teacher who dominates all
activities. The educational system is pragmatic; its purpose is
to make Americans self-sufficient and better producers for
society. As Mayhew puts it,<p>

     Colleges and universities are not churches, clinics, nor
even parents.  They are devices by which a limited number of
skills, insights, and points of view are committed to the
young in the belief that possession of these somehow aids
the individual to become a more skilled worker."  (Mayhew,
1968, p.21)<p>

<p>

Even a cursory examination of human nature and its dependent
environment, however shows that this view is contrary to the
norm.  This unnatural, structured educational environment may
affect our health and mental well-being.  It does not cultivate
an open and inquiring mind, nor an understanding of complex
inter-related concepts, sensitive insights or creativity.<p>

     Its [Chickering's work's] fundamental assumption is that
colleges and universities will be educationally effective
only if they reach students `where they live,' only if they
connect significantly with these concerns of central
importance to their students.  Civil rights, the draft,
managing violence, conflict, interpersonal relationships,
sexuality and religious orientation, balancing short run
hedonism against restraint and self-discipline in the
service of long-run satisfactions--these issues are the
primary concern of the young adult (Chickering, 1972, p.3).<p>

<p>

     In 1968, the Committee for Economic Development (CED) came
to the conclusion that the future of schools depended on whether
educational policy and practice can overcome a strong,
conservative resistance to change.  In the proliferation of
change in today's global world with its new emerging
technologies, it appears that the inhabitants of this planet must
widen their views. Schools need to reevaluate even the most well
established of institutional and instructional patterns if they
are to produce meaningful and quality education.   According to
H. G. Shane (1986), everyone needs to develop "educated
foresight," the ability to understand the variety and the nature
of the rapidly germinating techno-social climates of the present
and future.  The realms of administration and supervision will be
modified in several significant ways.  Primarily, the physical
settings and educational resources of schools will need to change
in order to accommodate a student body encompassing an age range
from early childhood through adulthood.  In addition, curricula
structures and administrative policies will be needed that match
this new, expanded school population, and teachers will have to
adapt to information age expectations and increased global
sensitivity. According to Senge (1990),<p>

     In many ways the greatest promise of the systems perspective
is the unification of knowledge across all fields--for these
same archetypes recur in biology, psychology, and finally
therapy; in economics, political science, and ecology; as
well as in management (p.94). <p>

<p>

     Innovation is solidly grounded in learning theory. 
Theoretical principles suggest that the varying of stimuli
enhances learning, or, in less abstract terms, individual
learning is promoted through variations in instructional
techniques and settings.  Innovation suggests that students must
be prepared to face more complex and critical choices. 
Traditional models of instruction are stressful.  With the
advancement of information technology, not only are educational
goals changing, but the methods of instruction and administration
are in a state of flux.  Thus, what is needed is new ways to
educate, new ways to present information, new ways to organize
the curriculum and new ways to get students involved.  <p>

<p>

<b>CHAOS Theory on Learning</b><p>

     Currently, education and learning theory in the United
States reflects Newton's theory of a clockwork, linear world. 
From the time of Newton, the prevalent view was of a world that
was completely understandable.  There were laws to govern all
physical science, and repetition and predictability were the
norm.  Everything had its place, and with these laws one could
predict the fluctuation of tides, the trajectory of a rocket ship
and the growth of a plant. This lead to great comfort in the
belief that everything was in, or could be placed in, its own
little box.  The emergence of chaos theory challenged this linear
philosophy. Subsequently many traditional beliefs needed
reevaluation.  In her book, <u>Mountains Are Not Triangles</u>, Simon
(1993) lists traditional linear educational beliefs. Included in
this list are:<p>

<p>

               (1) If you know where you are, and where you have been, then
you will know where you are going.  <p>

     (2) If something works well, more of the same works better.  <p>

     (3) If something has a negative effect, less of it is
better.  <p>

     (4) Systems are dependent, closed, and best when in
equilibrium.  They can be understood in isolation--all
elements of the world are not so interconnected that one can
ignore outside influences (p.10).  <p>

<p>

     Simon, moreover, goes on to list "Chaosophies" which prevail
in the new science:  <p>

               (1)  In many systems we know within certain boundaries what
is possible, but not what is likely.  <p>

               (2)  What you can know about a system, and what is important
to know, is the shape of the whole, how it develops and
changes, or how it compares to another system.  <p>

               (3)  Systems are continually evolving.  Evolution is chaos
with feedback.  <p>

               (4)  Physical and lawful does not mean predictable and
controllable or completely knowable.  <p>

               (5)  Order is hidden in complexity (p.11).  <p>

     Visual imagery allows us to see connections, loop processes,
interactions, networks, etc.  The more complex the situation the
more appropriate a pictorial representation.  These and many
other precepts suggesting a new relative nature to what we
believed to be linear and finite are at the root of chaos theory
and the understanding of fractals and attractors.<p>

     The structures of 17th century science appears to no longer
work in the 20th century.  Newtonian science suggests that in the
social arena the secret of the specific organization or
administration will reveal itself at some time in the future
after careful and studious empirical investigation.  All will be
explained in time.  A new understanding seems to be awakening
among theorists like Wheatley that suggests there is a world of
wonder out there that is a place for the unsure, for a freedom of
not knowing, and that this might be even more exciting and even
more accurate than the empirical truth of knowing.  The paradigms
of institutional and organizational design developed from without
may not be the ones that will yield new insights. Instead, as
Wheatley (1992) writes:  <p>

     [T]he new physics cogently explains that there is no
objective reality out there waiting to reveal its secrets. 
There are no recipes or formulae, no checklists or advice,
that describe reality.  There is only what we create through
our engagement with others and with events (p.7).  <p>

<p>

     If educational institutions exist in a world that is
subjective and full of complex interactions and feedback. Then
the old paradigm of Newtonian empirical and inductive science,
which encompassed the model of knowing an educational institution
or administrative structure by the careful investigation and
understanding of its parts, may be of little value. Newtonian
science extracted from the physical and imposed on humanity
states according to Minsky (1986) that: "Objects obey simple
laws. When any object moves or changes, we can usually account
for it in terms of other objects pushing it, or else of gravity
or wind (p. 287). Minsky goes on to distinguish this predictable,
linear world from the one that includes humanity:<p>

     We also live in a social realm of persons, families, and
companies; those entities appear to be ruled by quite
different kinds of causes and laws.  Whenever a person moves
or changes, we look for signs of intentions, ambitions,
infatuations, promises, threats, and the like--none of which
could affect a brick (p. 287).<p>

<p>

     In the new science, investigation looks at the system as a
whole.  There is a new schema, one of relationships and
connections, of constant and dynamic flux, a relationship that
does not lend itself to simple cause and effect as is dictated by
Newtonian law. Briggs and Peat (1989) emphasis this new schema: <p>

     Nature controlled by human thought is the essence of the
reductionist dream...the orientation that treats each system
as mechanical, made of parts and isolatable from other
systems, has given rise to a technology so powerful that it
dominates the world....Against this trend arises the young
science of chaos, wholeness, and change--a new insistence on
the interrelationship of things, an awareness of the
essential unpredictability of nature and of the
uncertainties in our scientific descriptions (p. 201).<p>

<p>

     As Wheatley (1992) explains, disorder is always considered a
nemesis in educational, institutional structure. However, such
disorder: <p>

     can play a critical role in giving birth to new, higher
forms of order.  As we leave behind our machine models and
look more deeply into the dynamics of living systems, we
begin to glimpse an entirely new way of understanding
fluctuations, disorder, and change (p. 11).  <p>

<p>

     From this acceptance of disorder and the relationship
between order and disorder, we get a glimpse of chaos theory. 
Maybe fact and empirical science are not the end all.  Maybe
relationships should define our existence.  Not only is fuzzy
logic, which rejects the empirical proof structure, an acceptable
construct, but it may be representative of the universe.  <p>

     Empirical science asks us to observe and measure. In the
science of quantum physics matter constructs a relationship with
the observer and changes to meet the preconceived constructs of
that observation.  Objectivity deteriorates and we come to the
realization that observation and study of isolated and distinct
elements within the whole, unrelated to the observer, is an
anomaly.<p>

     The implication of these new theories to the educational
system is mammoth.  Educational institutions can no longer
support isolationist principles.  Hierarchical structures
suggesting that decisions are made based on facts and empirical
provable data which stand resolute and free from any
relationships that might corrupt its infrastructure are not in
harmony with current philosophical understandings.  No person, no
thought, no curriculum is an island divorced from each other,
their observers or the environment. Each administrator,
professor, student or thought is inter-connected, inter-related
to all others in time and space.  Senge (1990) crystallizes this
view by stating:  "Reality is made up of circles, but we see
straight lines. Herein lies the beginning of our limitations as
systems thinkers" (p. 86). <p>

     With the advent of empirical science and  Newtonian theory,
the prevailing world view was that of scientific objectivity. 
All things acted and reacted by determined cause, and if our
concern was one of gaining a deeper understanding of human
nature, the classic models of traditional physics were the
foundation of any such investigation. The machine motif was
brought to bear.  Any concern, any element, any relationship
which could not be empirically proven was suspect and therefore
cast aside. Quantum physics questions the Newtonian order of
cause and effect.  The world of electrons, photons, protons, and
nuclei is not a world of static permanent and explainable matter,
but one of location, wave, energy, particle, and mass. Most
importantly, it is a world whose constituents respond to one
another and to their surroundings.  The new definitions are not
of matter, not of things, but of relationships and patterns of
connectivity.  Taking it a step further, it is not only the
patterns of the relationships of these atomic particles, it is
their relationship to their environment, and their environment
presupposes an observer.  Educational models need  to be designed
which encompass the complexity of the world as viewed through
these new philosophical lenses.<p>

<p>

<b>Non-Linear Computing</b><p>

     Even a cursory examination of the universe demonstrates that
the world is mostly non-linear, that it is not made up solely of
black and white images.  Shades of meaning exist which cannot
totally be described, categorized, and departmentalized by
artificial constructs such as mathematical symbols, legal
systems, and binary coding.  In a Newtonian, reductionist world,
the solution to a linear equation allows the solver to generalize
other solutions, i.e., to make predictions.  <p>

     Though we tend to think of the computer as crisp and
precise, ironically the computer model with its roiling
images of feedback and chaos has become a symbol of the leap
the new turbulence science is taking--subordinating
scientists' traditional concern with prediction, control,
and the analysis of parts to a new concern for the way the
unpredictable whole of things moves."  (Briggs &amp; Peat, 1989,
p. 15)<p>

<p>

Non-linear equations model chaos and flow from disorder to order
and back to disorder, as complex events unfold.  Many researchers
believe that non-linear is the closest to what can be considered
the real world (Michael Bansky, Ian Stewart, John Briggs,
Bertrand Kosko, etc.), and that prediction within any system
determined by "initial conditions" is virtually impossible.
Accepting this principle, administrative analysis of cause and
effect and the search for precision and predictability appear
fruitless. <p>

     A key difference between linear and non-linear systems is
feedback.  Feedback is the looping back of reactions based upon
the original stimulus. In education, it is understood that
positive feedback helps the learning cycle. Tell the student the
right answer immediately to reinforce the correct answer. Efforts
are made to ensure that the student always has access to the
correct answer to ensure that an incorrect answer is never
reinforced by internalizing it in an unchallenged state. In the
planning that results from the analysis of current and past
statistics, feedback from differing atmospheres, sensitivities
and understanding can be examined in order to obtain a holistic,
non-fragmented picture. In chaos theory, feedback relates most
specifically to this wholeness, to a cycle of interaction between
systems that are inexorably tied to each other. These are systems
that administrations have ignored in the past primarily because
of the difficulty in scientifically relating them, one to
another. In a linear world, each system and subsystem can be
divided and subdivided into smaller parts and analyzed, with
certain assumptions and predictions made.  In the non-linear
world, subdivision and analysis is impossible, or at least
impractical, as each system must be thought of as related to, and
affected by, each other system.  The effect of one system on
another may be slight, but an effect does exist. As Briggs and
Peat (1989) write: <p>

     these new scientists are crossing the boundaries of
scientific disciplines:  mathematicians are studying
biological systems, physicists are taking on problems in
neurophysiology; neurophysiologist are boning up on
mathematics.  Often their common tool is the computer.  With
it the researchers of chaos iterate equations like chemists
combining reagents; colors and shapes representing numbers
simmer, congeal, and crackle on the terminal screens (p.
14).<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<b>Logic of the Whole</b><p>

     In the area of fuzzy thinking, a group of scientists
operating mostly under the precepts of chaos theory have been
struck by the arbitrary bivalence, the black and white, the
either/or, of man-made knowledge.<p>

     Yet in much of our science, math, logic, and culture we have
assumed a world of black and whites that does not change. 
Every statement is true or false.  Every molecule in the
cosmos belongs to your finger or not.  Every law, statute,
and club rule applies to you or not.  The digital computer,
with its high-speed binary strings of ones and zeros, stands
as the emblem of the black and white and its triumph over
the scientific mind (Kosko, 1993, p. 5).<p>

<p>

These scientists suggest that math and virtually all scientific
investigation are merely polarized categorizations of the real
world.  The computer is seen here as the epitome of this
polarization--the computer that deals exclusively with the binary
zeros and ones. Newtonian science and reductionism attempt to
polarize everything, thus reducing each system to its smallest
subsystem or particle for the purpose of divining new laws and
predicting future consequences.  The language of science is one
of bivalence or polarization, yet the natural world of sense
perception is one of multivalence, of shades of gray, of stages
in between.<p>

     The computer, the epitome of this bivalent construct, has up
until recently failed to assume the role of an artificial
intelligence.  The computer programmed to examine this polarized
universe is unable to duplicate the actions of the human mind,
for it has been constructed for, or at least tricked by
scientists into, speaking a binary language. <p>

     The lead has been taken by the Japanese in the last few
years where computer experts and scientists have been programming
the computer to be less precise, less binary. These new
instructions command a computer that is fuzzy in its rules of
information. This new approach has improved the computer's
ability to think.  In fact, subsets are now being programmed that
will enable computers to adapt or learn as new data is being
assimilated.  The intelligent machines of the future will change
the way we educate our students, and more specifically, the
teaching aids that we use. Interactive multi-media sensations
that react to ecological systems will be in vogue. Situations
will occur in which the learner's reactions to the information to
be learned will alter those first base reactions.  This then
becomes a total feedback loop.<p>

     Computers, although originally a tool of bivalent science,
will through their tremendous processing speed be able to
"understand" the whole, not as parts factored in but as
intelligent feedback loops. The computer as it emerges as a tool
of "fuzzy logic" will assume the role of great communicator, the
administrative element that seems to be able to assimilate the
whole, and more importantly, to disseminate it and then refashion
it as "change" appears, this time as a friend to spark a new
direction -- Chaos -- that is really order out of disorder, Chaos
that may first require these educational bastions of knowledge to
admit their disorder.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Computer Information, Processing and Learning</b></u><p>

     Looking at information from the perspective of a symbolic
interactionist society of learners, we see a dynamic web of
communication with information as the central element.
Individuals assign to or create meaning in information through
their interactions and reactions.  Using this precept within
society, certain communication assumptions appear.  Societal
members have a shared system of meaning.  They share assumptions,
understandings, and actions.  A situation that arises where
meaning and understanding are not shared creates tension.  The
exception and the necessity for negotiation and feedback is to
establish a commonality--a new societal meaning.  Over time,
symbols evolve within society that take on a common, agreed-upon
meaning.  Consensus exists and ambiguity, negotiation, and
feedback are no longer necessary.  Individuals communicate using
shared and common meanings understood by all. These individuals
rely on varied communication techniques to understand the shared
definition through verbal language, non-verbal body language and
other social cues.  Within the concept of processing information,
a common understanding of what that information is can only exist
if communication is shared and there is a hierarchy of
communication channels employed within society. <p>

     Communication is further complicated by contextual
determinants such as distance and time pressure, accessibility of
media technology and even symbolic meanings, which may transcend
the explicit message itself. People living in different countries
may have different cultural experiences that blur or change
meaning. All these factors contribute to the understandability or
lack of common understanding of the message.  <p>

     In this new age of cellular telephones, faxes, video-tele
conferencing and electronic mail, new elements have been added to
the battery of communication systems.  New concerns are emerging
as to the appropriate media by which various types of messages
can be communicated most effectively. As Naisbitt and Aburdene
(1990) see it,<p>

     ... we are in the process of creating a society that is an
elaborate array of information feedback systems, the very
structure of the biological organism.  Furthermore, we are
poised on the threshold of a great era of biotechnology
(p.257).<p>

<b><p>

Abstract Communication</b><p>

     Information is the central concept of understanding human
communication.  Every time something is described, concepts are
abstracted from detailed perception.  Common examples of such
abstract concepts are: color, size, day, or even things like
"treeness."  If we talk about the color of an object, we are
talking of a commonly held concept and theory that the specific
color tells us something about the object of discussion. <p>

     Information is often understood as a part of that sphere of
electronic engineering and specifically of signal transmission
which boils human communication down to signal encoding,
transmission, and decoding.  Information must be separated from
the concept of data and from the state of not having information. 
The definition of information should not be limited to the
written word, but should include information which is based on
raw data, evidence of other natures, quotation, examples,
statistics, and facts.  Information can be spoken or written, and
may include other elements which communicate emotion and
intention such as body language.  Information can also be thought
of in terms of uncertainty, that is, its function to clear up
uncertainty.  It can be categorized by its distinguishing
characteristics and  can be thought of as a factor that
enlightens and orders one's experiences. Most would agree that
information brings with it control and power.  <p>

<p>

<b>The Binary Switch</b><p>

     As denoted above, the concept of information is not a simple
one.  And as the world of information technology evolves, newer
concepts and explanations of information will be presented in
metaphors related to electronic data processing and signal
transmission devices, the computer, the modem, and
telecommunications.  If we go back to Shannon's mathematical
theory of communications (1948-1949), we see that there are two
elements which elucidate these electronic metaphors.  Shannon's
thesis:<p>

     showed how relationships in abstract logic can be expressed
by a series of "binary switches."  (A binary switch has two
values or states such as on and off, open or closed, true or
false.)  As a practical consequence of Shannon's work, any
process that can be described in logical form can be
performed by a digital computer (Ritchie, 1991, p. 6).<p>

<p>

     Can we then take these theorems which apply to the technical
process of encoding and signal transmission and expand them to
the concepts of information, or even to the more relevant
questions of meaning and effectiveness?  Because computer
technology currently functions as a binary translator and can
only "understand" the on-off, zero-one binary switch, it is
difficult to understand how it can relate to the meaning and
effectiveness of information.  <p>

     If we examine this binary machine, however, we see that in
fact with the vast storage capabilities of the computer and its
speed of calculation, these simple binary tasks can be multiplied
and through processes--millions of them per second--logical
interpretation, meaning, and even an artificial intelligence
become less mysterious and more understandable.  Consider a
single binary function, a zero or a one, and a deck of cards with
a single binary switch.  One can determine the color of the card,
whether red or a black.  A second binary switch or designation
gives us the ability within the colors red or black to determine
whether the suit is a diamond or heart for red, or in the case of
black, a spade or a club.  In other words, within two binary
switches, something like a zero-one or a one-one or a zero-zero
or a one-zero, we can designate the color and suit of a
particular card.  The common language in modern personal computer
technology provides eight "bits" or binary switches to produce a
"byte," and a byte made up of these eight zeros or ones through a
standardization process can stand for any upper or lower case
character, numbers and punctuation marks.  With processing speeds
of millions of binary functions per second, it's easy to see that
this signal encoding and decoding can occur very rapidly, more
rapidly than the same signal encoding and decoding processes in
the single human brain.<p>

 <p>

<b>Not Just a Machine<p>

</b> Radio and television frequencies and now telecomputing are
carrying these encoded signals but seem free from culture,
borders and boundaries. They have helped achieve Marshal
McLuhan's "global village" where people belong to a larger global
system or organization and are no longer encased by geographical
boundaries. Ideas, concepts, knowledge and information pass
freely, instantaneously and simultaneously:<p>

     Electronic communications and television render borders
porous.  Traditional notions of national sovereignty are
increasingly irrelevant.  The FAX machine and the
videocassette make it possible to pierce the veil of state
censorship (Attali, 1991, p.35).<p>

<p>

     Most of the current concentration on the computer focuses on
what the computer can do for us, the computer as a tool; but, in
this information age, we must go beyond this understanding and
look at the "subjective computer," the one that invades our
social lives, our organizations, even the psychological
development of the human mind -- "the computer as it affects the
way that we think, especially the way we think about ourselves"
(Turkle, 1985, p. 13).  <p>

     A more open positioning of the computer sees it as a
partner, an inanimate object that seems to take on animate
qualities and develop relationships.  If we look at Rorschach's
images, we see that they take on many different forms.  The
computer, too, assumes many different configurations, shapes, and
meanings.  What the computer provides for the individual is often
what the individual puts into the computer.  It speaks the
language of the individual communicating with it.<p>

<p>

<b>Newer Media Technologies</b><p>

     As awareness of videotext, tele-text, on-line databases and
interactive disk technology has grown, curriculum and research
initiatives are required in the newer media technologies, among
them journalism, mass media, communication, library, information
studies, computer science, advertising and marketing. As sources
of information become more accessible, all disciplines are
finding a need to conduct global research without leaving the
office.<p>

     Pool (1983) predicts that networked computers will be the
printing presses of the 21st century, but points out that if they
are not free of public control, the constitutional protection now
given to<p>

     non-electronical mechanical presses, lecture halls, and man-
carried sheets of paper may become no more than a quaint
anachronism, a sort of Hyde Park where a few eccentrics can
gather while the major policy debates take place elsewhere
(p. 149). <p>

<p>

New legal, moral and ethical concerns, as well as organizational
and social ones, are vying to dominate this age of
telecommunication and its increased access to, and proliferation
of, information.<p>

     Currently many instructors, especially in the social
sciences, appear to be adhering to traditional lecture methods of
instruction that are essentially no longer effective.  Audio
Visual Association reports have shown that there is a 51 percent
increase in learning and 82 percent increase in retention when
more than one method of presentation is used during the teaching
process (Peterson, White and Stephan, 1984, p. 85).  Interactive
multimedia computer tutorials are designed to appeal to the
auditory, visual, and kinesthetic senses.  With more than one
sense engaged, the multimedia learning process fosters increased
learning and retention statistics, as documented in the Kahn and
the Janson studies (1992) cited above.  There are many
interactive tutorials (McDermott and Combs, 1991; Smith and
Jones, 1991; and Coffin and Thurnau, 1991) that offer the
advantage of self-paced learning and multi-sensory presentation
in the areas of computer applications programs such as Windows,
WordPerfect, and Microsoft Excel, but very few have appeared in
art history, psychology, or speech, to name just a few subjects. 
The most high-tech, multi-source and educationally advanced
learning aids in many humanities classes seem to be overheads and
slide projectors--20-year-old technology--and as mentioned
previously, the old methods are not working.  <p>

     The life condition of the day is one of a constant and
continuous barrage of messages from artificial stimuli.  "The
overload of information in modern society means that even the
most brilliant and well-informed members can store only a small
portion of the society's culture." (Ornstein and Ehrlich, 1989,
p.64) We live in a world of television and Nintendo.  The slow-paced, linear, simplistic,
one-dimensional media presentations of
the past cannot compete for the contemporary students' attention.
They are boring, and the learner used to high sensory impact will
soon lose interest.<p>

     A large and growing body of research exists to substantiate
the claim that computer-delivered instruction increases student
learning.  Consistent with other research results, Niemiec &amp;
Walberg (1987), and Kulik and Kulik (1987), reported the results
of a meta-analysis of 199 comparative studies, 101 of which were
conducted in colleges and universities.   The authors write that 
each  of  the  199  studies  analyzed  "was  a  controlled,
quantitative  study  that  met  our  predefined  standards  for
methodological adequacy" (p.4).  The conclusions reached by Kulik
and Kulik include the following:<p>

     1.   Students learned more in classes in which computer
assisted instruction (CAI) was used. The outcome measurement
instrument studied was examination scores which increased an
average of 0.31 standard deviations.<p>

     2.   Students exposed to CAI learned the material with less
instructional time. The average reduction of instructional time
in the 28 studies that measured this variable was 32 percent.<p>

     3.  Students in a CAI environment responded more favorably
on affective  measures  relative  to  controls.    Attitude
toward instruction scores increased by 0.28 standard deviations
in the CAI environment.<p>

     Unlike traditional instruction, which is based on
sequentially laid out books and lecture material, well-designed
multimedia instruction allows for greater flexibility and
accommodates different student learning styles.  For example,
more intellectually sophisticated students have the ability to
skip over basic definitions and examples  to  pursue  multimedia 
material  that  challenges  and stimulates their skill and
knowledge level.  Students with less academic preparation work
through the material differently,  pausing for definitions and
examples in a pictorial, visual or auditory format. There are few
other means of instruction which enable each student to learn at
a rate commensurate with his/her ability level. <p>

      Administrators and educators are alarmed at the high
drop-out rates of students.  While a variety of solutions to the
retention problem have been proposed, there is consensus that
"business as usual" is simply not promoting student learning at
acceptable levels.  Is there any reason to think that providing
multimedia instruction can improve retention and increase student
learning?   Evidence  from  private  industry  and  educational
institutions is beginning to show dramatic improvements when
multimedia  is  used.         McDermott and Combs (1991) engaged
disinterested, at-risk students in a variety of multimedia
projects and succeeded in halting the students' cycle of failure. 
Smith and Jones (1991) have used multimedia to teach college
chemistry and report superior student performance and decreased
institutional costs relative to traditionally taught classes.
Coffin and Thurnau (1991) have shown how multimedia instruction
can be used to more effectively teach foreign languages by
creating a cultural context for language instruction.<p>

     While instructors often attempt to individualize instruction
to maximize each student's learning opportunities, the reality is
that classroom instructors are often asked to  provide
instruction to an extremely heterogenous student population. 
With highly interactive multimedia resources, however, each
student might be  afforded  the  opportunity  to  review  course
materials in a computer lab setting in which review, practice,
corrective feedback and further instruction can be accomplished
at the student's own pace.  The interactive element built into
multimedia instruction encourages, even requires that the student
become an active participant in her/his learning process.<p>

     A prototype multimedia tutorial blending technical knowledge
and expertise of multimedia design with an expertise in
curriculum design and subject area knowledge is needed in the
classroom today. <p>

<p>

<b><u>Statement of the Problem</u></b><p>

     Today's computers, enhanced with multimedia interactive
tutorials, can improve a student's learning by offering
information geared to multiple learning styles. Computer
multimedia tutorials have infinite patience and possess the
ability to allow students to learn in a supportive visual,
kinesthetic and auditory environment. Additionally, multimedia
tutorials can provide classroom assistance to professors by
enabling them to demonstrate abstract techniques or theory that
traditionally have been difficult to convey.<p>

     Computers, especially multimedia computers, can enhance
learning by creating a more realistic and appealing presentation
of virtually any subject matter. Although the benefits of such a
magnificent tool have been well documented it appears that this
resource has been sorely underutilized. It is imperative that a
friendly, easy-to-use prototype or example of a multimedia
interactive tutorial be developed within a non-technological
framework.  Such a prototype can demonstrate the remarkable
capabilities and potential of this new educational media so that
educators will be encouraged to take full advantage of today's
technology, and to prepare students to understand and participate
in the ever-changing technological world. <p>

<p>

<b><u>Purpose</u></b><p>

     The purpose of an interactive multimedia computer tutorial
is to provide a sensory stimulating, visually, orally and
kinesthetically appealing, high-tech teaching aid.  The American
educational system, impacted by the short attention span of many
students and students' desire for entertainment-type teaching
aids, requires a tool that can keep pace in the world of high-tech, multi-stimuli competition. 
Expertise needs to be packaged
in a new way for the stimuli-awakened and sophisticated student
of the Information Age. The model developed herein provides such
a tool, a multimedia teaching aid.<p>

     The multimedia prototype developed in this study can  be
brought into the classroom and projected onto a large screen with
an LCD panel and overhead projector. This adds sensory
stimulation to the learning environment. In addition, the
multimedia prototype can be placed in a computer lab or learning
resource center to allow students to work through the material at
their own pace, and to choose the areas which they feel they need
to study, not those prescribed for them in the traditional non-interactive, linear-type lecture class.
The multimedia  model can
be distributed to interested faculty to allow them to experiment
with a novel approach to teaching using "nontraditional" forms of
instruction.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Theoretical Base</u></b><p>

     The production of a multimedia model within a specific, non-computer oriented subject
area is a significant step in bringing
a technically deficient educational system into the information
and communication age. U.S. schools have been losing ground for
over a decade in world competition (<u>Nation At Risk</u>, 1973) and a
revitalization of educational methodology would be instrumental
in reversing that trend. Such a revitalization would have to take
into account the new awareness of quantum theory, chaos models,
other new sciences and the non-linear nature of this new age. 
Not only is a non-linear approach to education inefficient, but
the slow-paced, orderly building block progression of previous
generations assumed a more stable and less dramatically changing
cosmos of perception. "The constraints of Western logic are tied
to our sense of sequential relationships--logic made visual"
(McLuhan and Powers, 1989, p.39). Today, society is constantly
bombarded by high-impact television and video game images so that
assimilation of information is no longer a question of the
progressive accumulation of more detailed and related
information, but rather a bombarding of Chaotic sensory images
which are often too numerous to process. It is not the gathering
of information but the sorting through and elimination of
information that will most likely characterize future educational
models. Surveying this information explosion, Senge (1990) points
out that "Perhaps for the first time in history, humankind has
the capacity to create far more information than anyone can
absorb" (p.69).          <p>

     Education in the United States still focuses on older
educational models of linear progression, whereas our competition
from Taiwan and Korea provides predominantly high-impact audio
visual perception.  Today's students need a medium that can
compete with the glamour of sensory engagement representative of
Hollywood, combined with the information base relevant to the
curriculum at hand.<p>

Information must be presented in such a way that it can be
randomly selected if educators are to provide a more "real world"
,non-linear interface that allows the learner to find his or her
own level and area of interest.  If the expected results are
substantiated, this model will provide an avenue of greater
student access to such high-tech learning aids, which would, in
turn, increase the percentage of student learning and retention.
If such tools as tutorial models or prototypes are not developed
now, the emergence of modern, high-tech and competitively
appealing learning aids could fall even farther behind the times,
and our schools may continue to pale in the wake of the advanced
techniques of the burgeoning Pacific Rim nations.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Nature of the Study</b></u><p>

     This case study utilizes developmental and descriptive
research methods in the creation and evaluation of a prototype
multimedia computerized tutorial. This tutorial is designed to
meet the needs already established by a multimedia consortium of
community colleges in a large city in the southwestern United
States. These needs adhere closely to the computer software
design precepts set forth in Dick and Careys' work <u>The Systematic
Design of Instruction</u> (1985) as delineated below. <p>

     The grounding precepts or technical framework for the
development of this multimedia prototype took the form of the
following seven developmental stages:  (1) the establishment of
educational goals; (2) the creation of performance objectives;
(3) the development of an instructional strategy; (4) the
collection and assembly of instructional materials; (5) a
formative evaluation, for the purpose of rebuilding the program;
(6) the revision of the working program; and, finally, (7) a
summative evaluation, to evaluate the finished product and how
well it satisfies the initial  objectives.<p>

     The multimedia tutorial created here, the Journalism in
Education Multimedia Model (JEMM), provides independent
instruction to journalism and desktop publishing students in the
areas of layout and design. The tutorial is self-paced and allows
students access to the content area information. The tutorial
includes 26 areas of study: The philosophy of design, the history
of design, special concerns regarding newspaper design, layout
configurations of center, off-center, oblique and grid as well as
layout balance issues of unity, harmony, related patterns and eye
movement. Under dominant visual elements the precepts of
contrast, white space, large text, ornaments, big initial
characters and boxes and sidebars as well as other considerations
such as column width, numbers, newspaper or format size, headers,
rulers, captions and slugs. The final areas of tutorial
instruction center around design aids.<p>

     JEMM was placed in an open computer lab for easy access by
the students. The computer program or tutorial is self-paced and
involves the presentation of information through screens of text
and related graphic representations. There is in addition a
section for the testing of the layout and design concepts
presented and the establishment of immediate feedback information
in order to facilitate extensive review in each area of study.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Hypothesis</b></u><p>

     It is appropriate here to quote McLuhan and Powers' (1989)
discussion of an earlier development in the progression of
learning techniques:<p>

     Luria's observations provide an understanding of how the
written alphabet, with it's lineal structure, was able to
create the conditions conducive to the development of
Western science, technology, and rationality.<p>

          The alphabet separated and isolated visual space from
the many other kinds of sensory space involved in the senses
of smell, touch, kinesthesia, and acoustics. Abstract visual
space is lineal, homogeneous, connected, and static.
(McLuhan and Powers, 1989, p.59)<p>

<p>

     Can a learning module be constructed that provides a clear,
concise curricular lesson that is visually and auditorially
stimulating, increases the learning and retention of community
college students in a liberal arts course, and is accessible to
faculty and students with minimum computer abilities?  If so,
such a multimedia tutorial prototype could serve as a model for
other non-technical courses. <p>

     Would such a learning tool have merit as an aid to
instruction?  Could it offer greater access to subject
information and explanation for which no specialized course or
subject area specialist is available?  Finally, could such a
multimedia tutorial provide needed, but currently unavailable,
instruction in a variety of subject areas?<p>

     The researcher tested the claim that the JEMM tutorial would
result in a significant gain of knowledge while taking less time
to complete the course module. <p>

<p>

<b><u>Definition of Terms</u></b><p>

     For clearer comprehension of the issues central to this
dissertation, it is imperative to have a common understanding of
key terms.  For the purposes of this study:<p>

sound, diagrams and text.<p>

<u>Hypermedia</u>. The combination of information storage and retrieval
aspects of hyperlinking technology which allows people to learn
more naturally by linking theory to application rather than
moving sequentially from one item to the next, with multimedia
elements such as pictures, videos, <u>Interactive Multimedia</u>. A
computer technology that links information from multiple sources
and enables the user to interact directly with the program
content typically interactive multimedia can contain some
combination of text, line drawings, maps and graphs, animated
graphics, voice narration, music, and full-color, full-motion
video clips.<p>

<u>Interactive System</u>.  A system in which the student or learner is
required to provide feedback or interaction.<p>

<u>JEMM (Journalism in Education Multimedia Model)</u>.  A multimedia
prototype consisting of an amalgamation of screens, aids and
navigational buttons into which text, graphics and audio in a
specific subject area have been placed.<p>

<u>Multimedia</u>.  In a computer tutorial, any learning tool using more
than one form of sensory input or type of input such as still
graphics, animation, video, music and speech.<p>

<u>Prototype (or model)</u>.  Used interchangeably in referring to
constructs, tools or first examples to be viewed as patterns for
the future development of similar multimedia, stand-alone
computerized tutorial.<p>

<u>Self-paced</u>.  The ability of the learner or student to access a
learning tool at the time, place, rate, and speed that is best
suited to that individual's time constraints, learning style, and
skills.<p>

<u>Teaching Aid</u>.  Any object, module, program or tool that can
assist the instructor in the presentation of a desired
curriculum.<p>

<u>Tutorial</u>.  A lesson or group of lessons consisting of a short or
modified curriculum presenting information to a prospective
learner.<p>

<u>Virtual Reality</u>.  A computer generated artificial environment in
which related audio-visual stimuli are simulated by the computer
to create a sense of involvement with the artificial environment.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Assumptions</u></b><p>

     For the purposes of this study, it is assumed that education
is the foundation of a progressive western society, and that
education is the most important element of any society that looks
to improve its own existence.  It is assumed that education is a
lifelong pursuit and involves both observable, scientific,
empirical evidence and that of an intangible nature, as well as
evidence that cannot be proven empirically or that seems
irrelevant and/or chaotic in nature.<p>

     The researcher's predisposition toward computer technology
may skew the importance placed on the utilization of a computer
and high-tech media to further educational aspirations in all
disciplines. It is felt that the computer's ability to provide
random access (non-linear) information, its multimedia
capabilities, and its versatility make it uniquely suited as a
superior educational tool.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Scope and Limitations</u></b><p>

     The major precept of this study is that interactive
multimedia tutorials are more effective than traditional lecture-based instruction. These high-tech
teaching aids are critical to
education today, and critical for educators to compete with the
barrage of high-tech audio-visual stimulation from the outside
world.  Tools which encompass modern audio-visual images that
replace or augment text-based instruction, studies have shown,
increase both learning and retention (Peterson, White and
Stephan, 1984, p. 85).  By providing a "user-friendly" product
that can serve as a lecture aid for demonstration in the
classroom, as well as a self-paced tutorial in the lab
environment, there is increased likelihood that instructors will
invest themselves in the use of such technological aids.  With
the apparent deficiencies of traditionally structured linear
teaching methodologies and with the emergence of a more engaging
chaotic, non-linear sensory inputs, it seems logical that
traditional educational models be replaced by more sophisticated
means of instruction.<p>

     The design, construction, analysis and measurement of this
new prototype was guided by concepts proposed by a consortium of
community college multimedia experts.  This consortium includes
faculty and administrators chosen as participants in a major
grant program from the eight community colleges in a large
southwestern city. They were selected because of their interest
and expertise in producing advanced technology based (multimedia)
course modules for non-technological disciplines at their
schools. The standards for construction were established through
the research of Dick and Carry published as <u>Curriculum Design in
Technology</u> (1985). The Dick and Carry framework looks for the
establishment of a primary goal, of procedural objectives and
intermediate skills, the development of an instructional
strategy, the gathering and assimilation of instructional
materials, a formative evaluation, structural and content
revision and, finally, a summative evaluation.  The model was
limited to a course in journalism and may not yield the same
result if similar models are created for other non-technological
courses.<p>

<p>

<p>

<center><b>II. LITERATURE REVIEW</b></center>
<p>

<p>

<b><u>Organization of the Review</b></u><p>

     The literature review will contain a select sample of books,
journals and magazine articles as well as computer software and
multimedia educational projects. Many areas of educational
development will be examined.  Computer learning in all its
forms, but particularly CAI (computer aided instruction) and CEI
(computer enhanced instruction), will be examined, and all the
various learning styles scrutinized.  Curriculum design,
especially in the creation of learning software, multi-sense
learning, and non-linear learning will be explored.  Some of the
works examined will delve into the way we perceive and process
information in order to more fully understand the role computers
play in the processing of information and how pervasive a change
this new schema really is. Other studies will be examined that
address the United States' slipping position in education on the
international scene, the effects of television and computerized
games on traditional learning models as well as the emergence of
new, non-linear educational learning styles. <p>

     The literature varies greatly in type and volume depending
on the topic. The literature review is divided into eight main
areas of concern: (1) literature dealing with the paradigm shift
in the way people react to external stimuli and the processing of
information and how this shift in perception affects society and
the future; (2) the administrative concern with computing in the
institution and as a curricular item; (3) the relationship of the
electronic processing of the computer to the neuro processing
patterns of the mind; (4) the educational alternative approaches 
that propose non-linear processing and multi sensory stimulation
-- right brain not left brain; (5) the curriculum design concerns
that affect educational software development; (6)  books and
articles on layout and design principals, especially as they
relate to newspapers, the course subject matter of the prototype
multimedia project being developed; (7) papers and books
concerned with multimedia as it relates to systems or paradigm
shift in educational delivery; and (8) works dealing with and
examples of educational multimedia tutorials that point the way
to the successful creation of a multimedia prototype.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Information Processing, Society And The Future</b></u><p>

     Tom Peter's <i>Thriving on Chaos</i> (1987) deals with the new age
paradigm shifts, especially as seen in corporate America. 
<i>Thriving on Chaos</i> delineates a new social and organizational
structure that appears to be void of order, of a chaotic nature
and less Newtonian and linear. It is Peter's understanding that
society has to become more adept at handling a world in constant
flux if we are to propel ourselves into the next social age.  <p>

     Like <i>Thriving on Chaos</i>, Margaret Wheatley's <i>Leadership and
the New Science</i> (1992) is an exploration of this new, changing
social world and organizational order from a management point of
view.  Wheatley delves into quantum physics, fractals, Chaos
theory and other varied relational precepts in her effort to
explore why the old paradigms of Newtonian scientific
exploration, are no longer valid for society today.<p>

     Jacques Attali, as President Mitterand of France's Special
Adviser, observed the world economic situation in Europe and
abroad from a different perspective.  The book <i>Millennium</i> (1991)
is a futuristic look at the end of the century and how the global
marketplace, the microcomputer, and biotechnology are altering
our sense of being or identity, our understanding of what is
stable or real and propelling people into  a 21st century nomadic
existence.<p>

     Stan Davis and Bill Davidson's <i>2020 Vision</i> (1991) is a
powerful look at where the technology of today will lead us in
the next 25 years.  The dominance of the Pacific Rim countries,
the waning electronics industry and the emergence of optical
technology, the establishment of NREN and Internet and all forms
of telecommunication are inexorably altering and shrinking the
world community. The world now has a "value added" economic base
in which the product often takes second billing to the
information, hype, mass communication and processing that
supports it.  <p>

<i>  Megatrends</i> (1986) and <i>Megatrends 2000</i> (1990) have been with
us for over a decade now, and John Naisbitt's look at the
emergence of free market socialism, the Renaissance of the arts,
cultural nationalism, the rise of the Pacific Rim countries,
women's place in leadership, a new age of biological advancement,
and the shift back to the individual in the coming century are
some of the more powerful trends that this book explores.<p>

     Peter Senge's <i>The Fifth Discipline</i> (1990) is a new approach
to viewing education as a whole, a framework for seeing
interrelationships rather than individual elements, for seeing
patterns of change rather than linear or static snapshots of
micro-cosmic parts.  Senge sees people as active participants in
the shaping of their own reality, in creating their own future
rather than reacting to one.  We are faced with the capacity to
create more information than it's possible for the human mind to
absorb.  We have positioned ourselves for greater interdependency
than ever in the past, and change is occurring, even
accelerating, faster than we are able to keep pace.  These are
"systemic breakdowns" and they are resulting in things like ozone
depletion, global warming, and the international drug trade. 
With the unification of knowledge across all fields, and an
understanding of a more simple and elegant underlying
organization, a systems approach is necessary for our survival. <p>

<i>  Turbulent mirror</i> (1989) is the turbulent mirror of Alice in
Wonderland, the vehicle used by Briggs and Peat to examine Chaos
Theory and its historical, mythological and scientific
foundations. This work cleverly exposes the going into chaos
(order to disorder) in the first four chapters and then decreases
the chapter numbers back to zero and finally a forward as it
discusses disorder to order. The limitations of the linear nature
of institutional learning are discussed<p>

     Kosko's <i>Fuzzy thinking; The new science of fuzzy logic</i> (1993)
is a penetrating examination of a major paradigm shift that is
taking place in the areas of science, technology and philosophy.
Kosko challenges the knowledge base of math and science and its
bivalent, black and white, either/or categorization of all
things. The world is multi dimensional and full of gray but
reductionist science constantly tries to boil every variance,
every shade of gray down to its "rounded off" black or white. <p>

     James Gleick's <i>Chaos: Making a new science</i> (1987) records
the birth of a new science. This is a new way of seeing order and
pattern where formerly there was only the random, erratic,
unpredictable and chaotic. This book chronicles the inner
conflicts and frustrations that scientists have had with
unexplained, seemingly random events and shows how the emerging
quantum physics and chaos theory have appeared as a new
revelation.  <p>

<p>

<b><u>Computing Technology: Administrative Concerns</u></b><p>

     The articles in this section of the literature review
address computerization from a different perspective, the
administrative outlook. The acceptance of this new technology is
necessary for the funding to be made available, for the
opportunity to be afforded to the faculty to participate and
ultimately for the students to benefit.<p>

     Andrew Barbour's "Office Romance: Why Administrators are
Hooked on Technology" (1987) is a survey of 328 educators to
determine trends in administrative computing. Barbour shows that
most administrators have microcomputers, and the most popular use
of computers is for keeping student records. Hardware and
peripheral equipment currently used and being considered for
purchase are described, and budget information is also presented.<p>

     Harry P. Bluhm's  "Administrative Uses of Computers in the
Schools" (1987) is intended for school administrators, and
provides a comprehensive account of how computer information
systems can enable administrators at both middle and top
management levels to manage the educational enterprise. It can be
used as a textbook in an educational administration course
emphasizing computer technology in education, as an introduction
to the nature and scope of administrative computing, and as a
resource book for school officials. Part one introduces the
reader to the purpose and benefits of a computer information
system, computer competencies for administrators, and the stages
and types of growth a computer system undergoes before it attains
maturity. Part two discusses how the computer can be a management
tool for instructional applications such as computer managed
instruction and computer assisted testing, and for instructional
support applications in the administrative office such as
business operations, grade reporting, attendance accounting,
scheduling, and standardized test scoring. Part three addresses
software issues and choices confronting school officials
regarding instructional and instructional support computer
applications. Major issues discussed include software evaluation
and selection, user training, costs, piracy, and the security of
data files. The merits of general purpose, task specific, and
integrated software applications are examined. Part four outlines
the role of district or school computer policy in managing
computer resources. Policy analysis is applied to such issues as
computer acquisition, maintenance, location, and networking.
Appended are a glossary of computer terminology, references,
support resources, and an index.<p>

     Don Doucette's "The Community College and the Computer:
Behind Widespread Integration into Instruction" (1990) is a
discussion of the unique features and benefits of community
colleges and highlights the integration of computers into
instructional practice in these institutions. Topics discussed
include instructional computing; academic software; faculty
workloads; academic administration; standardization of
instructional materials; technological orientation; and
relationships with business and industry.<p>

     Virginia Garland's "Computers in 2001: Preparing Educational
Administrators" (1990) describes results of a computer use survey
of 210 graduate programs in educational administration throughout
the United States and Canada. Highlights include specific types
of computer hardware used in the past, types that are expected to
be used in the future, computer lab access, and implications for
resource allocations for microcomputers.                          
     Harold Miller's "An Administrator's Manual for the Use of
Microcomputers in the Schools" (1988) provides school
administrators with the basic information they need to understand
the potential of the microcomputer as an educational tool in
today's schools. It covers the general operating principles for
microcomputers, describes the hardware, discusses the principles
of programming and the programs available, and introduces
computer vocabulary. After an introductory overview, two chapters
are devoted to the role of school administrators and the uses
they can make of microcomputers in the school offices. Chapter 4
addresses academic and societal uses of microcomputers, while
chapter 5 addresses the evaluation of educational software, on
the premise that administrators must be involved in the
development of instructional programs involving microcomputers.
Chapters 6 and 7 explain the basic operating principles of
microcomputers in simple, concise terms. Also included are a
brief explanation of computer language and binary mathematics, a
discussion of various input and output devices, and criteria for
evaluating and selecting hardware. Four specific machines are
compared to illustrate application of these selection criteria.
The last section includes reports on representative uses of
microcomputers already found in schools across the country. Also
included are summaries of the various forms of computer
educational literature, some representative conference
activities, and assistance available from academic and business
institutions. Appended are the following: (1) a list of
additional resources for computer users; (2) a discussion of
important points for administrators when installing their
programs; (3) specific instructions for using prepared programs
and an introduction to BASIC; and (4) a short sample of a simple
program.<p>

     Bruce A. Peseau's "Integrating Microcomputing into
Preparation Programs" (1986) presents an example of a course
syllabus that integrates the use of microcomputers and contains a
strong recommendation that administrators become specialists in
microcomputing in their preparatory programs. Computers'
dramatically reduced costs, in combination with increased power,
has made them easily available in the form of microcomputers.
Administrators should have an understanding of the potential and
processes involved in order to attain institutional objectives
through institutional research  analysis and evaluation of the
complex variables in a system's operation. As Peseau points out, <p>

     Faculty in administrator preparation programs must reexamine
curricula to identify appropriate areas where microcomputers
will assist in developing administrators to become more
skilled and effective. The course syllabus provided for
resource management illustrates the scope and sequence of
content, software used, the reading file, assignments and
course requirements, and criteria for evaluation. (p.31)<p>

<p>

 The course syllabus and lists of software for the Apple II or
IIc and for the IBM PC comprise three-fourths of the document.<p>

     Patricia Sturdivant's "Planning and Training for a New
Educational Delivery System" (1986) outlines how the Houston
Independent School District established a Department of
Technology that successfully implemented a computer-based
curriculum in the school system. The department developed
policies, planned for short and long term needs, and provided
training, administrative support, and staff incentives.<p>

     Marc S. Tucker's "The Turning Point: Telecommunications and
Higher Education" (1983) reports on the expanded role of
telecommunications in education, especially the computer networks
that are developing on college campuses such as the University of
Minnesota and Carnegie Mellon University. The book discusses how
the growing importance of telecommunications will affect policy
in the management of higher education.  <p>

     G. Zhelev's "Principles and Approaches to the Use of Video
Computer Technologies in the Planning and Management of
Education" (1990) explores the planning and management of
educational systems which have been examined widely in the last
decades despite the lack of a standard research method and a
unified underlying theory. Research based on quantitative
analysis yields data that may be processed using the graphic
capabilities of computers. The combination of numerical data and
computer graphics results in a visual, realistic presentation of
scientific results. New computer software must be developed that
will facilitate information analysis and visual presentation.
Interactive video is an example of a video computer technology
that provides quick access to visual information, computer
organization and control over database information, and use of
that information. Qualitative information may be represented
quantitatively by using a functional statistical model made up of
factor and graph models. The information is then in a form that
is easily assimilated by educational administrators, teachers,
and scientists.<p>

<b><u>The Computer And The Mind</b></u><p>

     Marvin Minsky's <i>Society of the Mind</i> (1986) delves into the
neural networks of our brain to try to explain the physiological
constructs of perception, thought processes, and logic.  Minsky
argues that what we perceive and are able to store in our brain
is that core of information or sensory data from which we draw
our thoughts and build conclusions.<p>

     Mark Von Wodtke's <i>Mind over Media</i> (1993) begins by talking
about mental images--how our mind acts and reacts while thinking--and then discusses the new
electronic media and how it fosters a
culture in which viewing replaces acting.  The book progresses to
a discussion of the "renaissance" in electronic media and areas
of media space, mapping or interpreting this space, setting up
information environments, flow-charting or diagramming how our
minds work and how information is exchanged or transferred within
media space.  The key topics examined are how we perceive, how we
think and how we act.  These are scrutinized from the differing
viewpoints of visualization, the creative process, the
utilization of computers within that process and the adaptation
of that process into specific disciplines such as art,
architecture, and engineering.<p>

<i>  </i>William Allman's <i>Apprentices of Wonder</i> (1989) is a book
about man's neural network and how psychologists, physicists,
computer scientists, and philosophers have redefined its
"electronic rumblings" (1992) and "metaphysical rantings." (1992) 
Allman helps in understanding the electronic and metaphysical
workings of the mind and in explaining contemporary research into
how computer technology might emulate human signal processing and
lead to artificial intelligence.  <p>

     Robert Ornstein and Paul Ehrlich's <i>New World, New Mind</i> looks
at the global crisis facing the new high-tech, faster-paced
culture of today.  The authors, experts in psychology, biology,
and population studies, look at how people's minds are programmed
to respond to quick, sudden changes as they differ from the
necessary survival instincts of an earlier age. They discuss how
this preconditioning is not serving us well in a world of all-pervasive changes and new threats to
survival such as the AIDS
epidemic and the greenhouse effect. <p>

     Sherry Turkle's <i>The Second Self</i> (1985) examines the place
computers hold within our understanding of self.  Turkle examines
the personal and biological terminology surrounding the computer
technology and, interestingly, the relation of computers from a
psychological point of view to children in their efforts to
examine the universe.  This book explores the computer as an
"object-to-think-with" (1992) and its emergence as a not-so
"artificial intelligence." (1992)  <i>The Second Self</i> (1985)
examines the computer and its relationship to mankind from a
psychological and philosophical perspective.  <p>

     <i>The Age of Intelligent Machines</i> (1990) by Raymond Kurzwell
also discusses artificial intelligence. Kurzwell looks at the
philosophical and mathematical roots of 21st century computers,
how they operate or are programmed to emulate mankind, and the
social, ethical, economic and philosophical implications of that
emulation.<p>

     Philip Johnson-Laird's <i>The Computer and the Mind: An
Introduction to Cognitive Science</i> (1988) affords a thorough and
penetrating look at the mind and how it works, and does it
without delving too deeply into the terms of neuropsycsiology and
artificial intelligence. Stress is placed on the symbolic
instruction as in computer programming codes and he is able to
relate these to cognitive theory as it relates both to the mind
and the artificial intelligence, the computer. The theoretical
base of  Johnson-Laird's work is that to consider <p>

     the skeptical denial of a world independent of language and
thought... is the study of finite individual minds, and it
assumes that there is a physical world in space and time,
and that mental processes enable people to perceive that
world, to have thoughts and feelings, and to be aware of
themselves... Science proceeds by making simplifying
assumptions about the world, and by explaining the remaining
idealized picture. Any scientific theory, as far as we know,
can be modeled in a computer program. Whether that program
embodies the phenomenon in question is quite a different
matter (p. 387).<p>

<b><u>Electronic Pathways, Communication and Education</b></u><p>

     Jerome Aumente <i>(1987), Marilyn Bohl (1990), and Dizard
(1989) all deal in one way or another with how we process
information.  <p>

     </i>Aumente (1987) approaches information processing from a mass
communication point of view. This book is an insightful look at
the new sources of online text and video text that are available
and how this new availability is altering the way we interact
with on-line information.<p>

     Bohl <i>(1990) examines the computer's place within the linear
world of business.  This book explores all phases of computer
usage within the realm of business and the re-evaluates how the
computer and its allied telecommunication technologies are
changing the linear processing of information into a kind of
processing that is all-at-once and dynamic. <p>

     </i>Chickering (1969) examines the pragmatic educational
structure and how it prepares the worker for complex technical
job skills that the new age electronics is ushering in. 
Chickering's concern is that little or no educational emphasis is
being placed on preparing people to live in the technically-complex society that has been
generated.  Are we the slaves or
masters of the new systems that we are establishing?  Chickering
attempts to shift the emphasis away from the individual to all
mankind, away from the product to the system.  <p>

<i>  </i>Pool (1983), imagines a world in which high speed and
intercontinental information processing has freed humanity from
the confines of an economy that runs on paper.  Pool's work gives
structure to the international networking conglomerates that are
being constructed today and how they link with telecommunications
advancements. The author posits that even wireless
telecommunications will provide unlimited information access for
anyone, anytime, anywhere.<p>

     Dizard (1989) examines the political and economic
positioning of women today, and how the advancement of new
information age technology will be involved in the production and
distribution of ideas, not things.  Using AT&amp;T and IBM as a base,
Dizard examines how these industry giants will meet new domestic
and international competition in the development of smart
computers, high capacity communication satellites, and electronic
networks.      <i>       Communications of Tomorrow</i> (1982),
edited by Edward Cornish, is a collection of articles relating to
the expanded telecommunication world in terms of mass media and
the inter-networking of business, research, and academia.  Such
articles as "One World, One Language," (1992) "The Human Side of
Tomorrow's Communications," (1992) and "The Search for Self-Knowing Enters a New Era"
(1992) are concerned with the more
human elements of technological change, while articles on "The
Micro-Electronic Revolution," (1992) "The Information Economy: 
Exploiting an Infinite Resource," (1992) and "Libraries in 2010: 
the Information Brokers" (1992) are more technical in their
approach.<p>

          McLuhan and Powers' <i>Global village</i> (1989) sets out the
argument that today's users of technology are caught between two
very different ways of perceiving the world. On the one hand
there is "visual space"--the linear, quantitative mode of
perception that is characteristic of the Western world; on the
other hand there is "acoustic space"-- the holistic, qualitative
reasoning of the East, toward which all of the latest
technologies are pushing us.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Curriculum Design For Courseware</b></u><p>

     <i>Instructional Designs for Micro-Computer Courseware</i> (1988)
is a large collection of current articles dealing specifically
with instructional design in the area of computer software. 
David Jonassen, the editor, has amassed a great deal of
information about the basic structure and design of courseware.
He also explores how to make such courseware interactive and how
to design software that is more intelligent, responsive, and
better at presentation and interactive tutoring.  <p>

     Dick and Carey (1985) highlights the instructional design
process.  Their book focuses on identifying the initial goal,
needs assessment, conducting instructional analysis, the
production of entry level behaviors, and performance objectives
and criterion-referenced test items.  The design process,
according to the authors, should proceed from instructional
strategy to a decision as to the appropriate materials to be used
to a formative evaluation, the revision of the instructional
materials, and, finally, summative evaluation.  This is a classic
work in software design.<p>

<b><p>

<u>Journalistic Layout And Design</b></u><p>

     Visual Editing (1990), by Howard Finberg and Bruce Itule, is
an effective guide for journalism students into the art, theory,
and design of the graphics of newspaper layout.  This book
discusses and demonstrates the various schools of thought on the
proper use of informational graphics, photographs, and
illustrations within newspaper design and presents examples of
the pros and cons of various layout structures. <p>

      <i>Publication Design</i> (1991) by Roy Nelson uses magazine and
newspaper layouts to show how text can be used to heighten the
artistic appeal of the layout and design.<p>

     Nelson's strength lies more in contemporary and overall
design than in an historical approach to newspaper layout. 
Artistically attractive and not-so-attractive examples are
presented for comparison in visual editing.  <p>

     <i>Layout Design and Typography for the Desktop Publisher</i>,
(1991) by Gerald and Myrna Silver, is a text-based reference work
that plies the typographer's trade in stressing typeface, point
and pica considerations for readability as well as for graphic
impact.  <p>

     Among the design books available for journalists or
journalism students, Tom Harrower's <i>The Newspaper Designer's
Handbook</i> (1989), is a practical, nuts and bolts work that leads
one step by step through all the major design elements.  Little
emphasis is placed on design theory, philosophy or history, but
the book is chock full of true-life concerns for the newspaper
designer or editor, among them the proper use of headlines and
cutlines, dominant photographs on a page, how to half-tone and
crop photographs, what makes a good photograph, photo spread
layouts, design elements that are "risky business," (1992) and
how to handle bylines, credit lines, rule lines, and shadow
boxes.  Virtually every element of the newspaper page is covered. 
<p>

     Roger Black's <i>Desktop Design Power</i> (1991) is a book mainly
interested in pizzazz--in creating a visual image through text
and graphics.  The principles of good artistic layout and design
are covered, and there is an excellent history of publishing
industry styles and design concerns.  There is, however, little
of practical use for the would-be designer.<p>

     <i>The Desktop Publishing Bible</i> (1987), edited by James
Stockford, is a hands-on book designed specifically for desktop
publishing.  Using Ventura and Pagemaker publishing software as
examples, the work provides much useful information about the
type of equipment, monitors, printers, and computers that are
needed to produce quality desktop publishing. Some insightful
information about the techniques of layout construction on the PC
and Mac is also included.<p>

     Manousos' and Tilden's <i>The Professional Look: The Complete
Guide to Desktop Publishing</i> (1990) presents an overview of every
aspect of desktop publishing from the right computer hardware to
what kind of software and printers to use. The researchers
provide tips on the artwork, typeface, layout, design, and color
used in professional-looking desktop publishing; however, this
book focuses as much on the message as on the median of design. 
Every aspect of design is addressed, and a clear understanding of
some of the philosophical issues of design is expressed. <p>

<b><p>

<u>Multimedia and Education</b></u><p>

     Martin Solomon's "What's Wrong With Multimedia and Higher
Education?" (1994) discusses three revolutions in technology and
higher education--television, the microcomputer and multimedia--and the failure of each of these
to bring the world into the
classroom. According to Solomon, the primary reason for this
failure is that faculty members are unwilling to invest time in
innovation in the classroom. The second mitigating factor given
is the financial outlay required for high-tech multimedia
materials; the third is the multitude of different platforms:
Macintosh, IBM, etc.. The fourth is the lack of multimedia-trained faculty able to construct
multimedia tutorials. The last
mitigating factor is the time required to convert a classroom
lecture module into an interactive multimedia tutorial. <p>

     Delclos and Hartman's "The Impact of an Interactive
Multimedia on the Quality of Learning in Educational Psychology:
An Exploratory Study" (1993) uses a problem-solving approach to
the concepts of situated cognition and anchored instruction in an
interactive multimedia learning environment. A classroom analysis
produced by the students who participated in the course compared
those in the course to those who took a traditional course on the
same material. The findings were that students from the
multimedia course used more research and theory to support their
analyses and integrated their presentations of observation and
theory better than those in the traditional course. <p>

     Tropea and Rothermel's "Proposal: Scalability in Multimedia
Architecture" (1994) and Ben Davis's "Looking and Learning
Through Computers" (1993) deal with the concept of distributed
computing. Tropea and Rothermel maintain that for multimedia to
succeed in education "it must grow out of its closed box and
enter the age of distributed computing...{where} some sound and
image resources can be included on an application's main program
CD, an array of supplementary resources would be stored in a
technologically and legally accessible format in a different
location." (p. 85) This article looks at the pedagogical
implications of scalable multimedia using a backbone of networked
computers with multiple peripheral resources bringing multimedia
to a large number of students all at one time.<p>

     R.G. Kanning's "What Multimedia Can Do In Our Classrooms"
(1994) addresses multimedia as a breakthrough in learning aids
because "it allows the user to be an active participant rather
than a spectator." (p. 40) Kanning also discusses the drawbacks
found in his middle school environment, which include the ease of
use of the new technology and how the individual teachers can
integrate this new teaching aid into their curriculum. Paul
Peter's "Technology, Scholarship, and the Humanities" (1993)
reports on an invitational conference held in Irvine California
and it addresses the enthusiasm for working toward the
establishment of information technology within the humanities.
Initiative recommendations included the formation of national
collaborative effort to mobilize support for this new technology,
the creation of a ten million volume distributed digital
humanities library, the development of model collaborative
projects, workshops and fellowships, and the exchange of
electronic information setting new standards in the scholarly
community for the description and communication of primary
materials in libraries, archives and museums. <p>

     "Motivating Faculties to Use Multimedia as a Lecture Tool"
by Martha Sammons (1994) sees higher education lagging  behind
primary and secondary education in incorporating multimedia into
both teaching and learning. The reluctance in higher education
seems to revolve around a deficiency in equipment, time, and
knowledge. Sammons sees the administration as a key element in
the support of faculty to provide not only the financial support
to ensure that equipment is available, but also the support staff
knowledgeable in multimedia, and the release time necessary for
teachers to develop multimedia modules for their curriculum. <p>

     Brockenbrough Allen's "Multiplicity of Media: Changing
Paradigms For Working and Learning in Multimedia Environments"
(1994) discusses an evolution of multimedia design from a first
generation storyboard - computer text implementation to a more
molded approach where the individual traces visual and auditory
channels. The third generation looks at the interweaving of the
smallest packets of information assigned to the different
modalities of sensing. This interweaving of sense images forms an
environment more closely allied to the non-artificial world.
Allen states that <p>

     What makes media objects quite different from messages
conveyed by  "AV" channels is that media objects contain
data structures that allow them to send messages to each
other. In the newer forms of multimedia, then, what the
learner sees on the screen is not streams of messages
conveys through multiple channels but rather an environment
in which the media objects communicate with each other
through invisible software "channels." (p. 34)<p>

<p>

Through the creation of this new environment, Allen sees a
Constructivist emphasis where a supportive environment is created
in which the learner can  interpret a simulated reality in order
to better understand that reality. In "From the Lagging to the
Leading Edge" Hancock and Betts (1994) take a cursory look at
modern technology and what works and doesn't work. From
calculators to distance education, drill and practice to laser
video discs, microcomputer-based labs to telecommunication,
Hancock and Betts see that as the forerunners of the new
educational technology, such as computerized adaptive testing,
text to speech, voice-mail and interactive multimedia. In their
discussion of future opportunities in technology broad-banded
networks, groupware, pen-based computers, speech to text, virtual
reality and wireless connectivity are presented as potential
areas of educational expansion.<p>

     Maisie Mcadoo's "Equity: Has Technology Bridged the Gap?"
(1994) looks at a number of issues that deal with the have's and
the have not's of computing technology: the concern for access
versus use, which is often related to racial minorities; the
gender issue of computers and technology being a male-dominated
interest and field; and computers at home as a socio-economic
issue.<p>

     Scott A. Shamp's "A Primer on Choosing the Medium for
Multimedia" (1993), discusses videodisc and videotape basic
needs, software development and user workstation issues,
appropriate applications for the different audio/visual storage
media, counter vs. time code VCRs, and implications of the
technologies for student development.<p>

     Peter E. Kneedler's article, "California Adopts Multimedia
Science Program" (1993), describes the evolution of "Science
2000," a non-textbook program adopted by the California State
Board of Education for seventh grade science. Kneedler discusses
ways the program might be integrated into the classroom and
describes science classrooms utilizing the program.<p>

     Carol Klenow's "Teaching Problem Solving? Tap into
Technology" (1993) examines the use of computers, strategies for
using packaged software and the use of multimedia in the
elementary school classroom. Information on tele-communication
software and examples of its use are also provided. The article
includes addresses and phone numbers for acquiring product
information.<p>

     Charles G. Boody's "New Tools for Music Education" (1992)
discusses the technologies of compact discs and laser discs. 
Boody describes how such technologies can help teachers in the
music classroom.  He suggests that the new music computer
technology enables students to examine music by listening to it,
rather than by using notation or other abstraction of the sounds. 
Boody goes on to suggest ideas for using multimedia for teaching
music.<p>

     Chandra Bhushan Sharma's article "Teaching Foreign
Literature through Multimedia" (1993) contains a discussion of
teaching literature through multimedia and argues that simpler
techniques explaining visual symbols such as illustrations,
annotation of texts with commentaries, explanations, word
meanings, and maps are not sufficient for conveying the message
in culturally displaced (i.e., foreign language) texts.<p>

     John Scully's "Reforming Learning" (1993) references
multimedia and how it allows for individualized learning and the
demonstration of complex or dynamic concepts. Multimedia tools
such as QuickTime and HyperCard are being used to customize
presentations.  Scully provides three examples to suggest how
multimedia is working in classrooms.<p>

     William Gates' "The Promise of Multimedia" (1993) suggests
that multimedia software stimulates learning paths by offering
information through pictures, written text, sound, animation, and
video. Multimedia computing is a powerful tool for educators to
use to develop lessons and materials. Cites schools where
learning is treated as a dynamic, multisensory experience.<p>

     Raymond P. Farley's "Classrooms of the Future" (1993) 
discusses a New Jersey high school district that built four
prototype classrooms to measure the impact of new technology and
telecommunication tools on instruction, assess alternative
instructional strategies, and determine the training and
development needs of the staff.<p>

     Turner and  Dipinto's article "Students as Hypermedia
Authors: Themes Emerging from a Qualitative Study" (1992) is a
study of seventh grade students who used hypermedia software, a
graphics scanner, and a videodisc player to create multimedia
research reports for science. Topics addressed include skill
development, student and teacher opinions on time spent learning
the software, student interactions, how students organized
information, content specific learning, and the writing process.<p>

     Terry Curtis' "Learning about Learning with ISDN" (1993)
discusses the Chico, California schools that adopted multimedia
distance learning using ISDN (integrated services digital
network) to resolve a serious problem: the shortage of well-qualified science and math teachers.
Problems encountered with
using the equipment included audio signal difficulties, user
unfriendly conferencing equipment, stationary cameras, inadequate
display screens, and over reliance on one way lectures.<p>

     Andrew Trotter's "Wired for Learning" (1993) talks of
telephone cables connecting virtually every U.S. home, school,
and work place that will soon comprise national integrated
services digital network allowing two-way video communication and
fast data transfer on a mass scale at affordable prices.
Families, educators, and at home workers will have routine access
to video conferencing, distance learning, and other home
services.  The article explains technology and its multimedia
instruction potential.<p>

     Nancy Scali's "A Multimedia Study of Africa by Young
Children (Literature, Writing, and Art)" (1993) describes
numerous ways in which a multimedia study of Africa provides rich
opportunities for students to combine art, writing, literature,
and social studies.<p>

     Jacobsen and Bilan's "Traditional Native Storytelling Using
Computer Based Multimedia" (1993) describes a 4-day outdoor
summer workshop for nine Native Canadians, ages ten to 17, which
focused on traditional Native storytelling.  The authors note
that the students learned to use computer based multimedia and
published interactive multimedia versions of their Native
stories.<p>

     Linda Benafel's "Portfolio Assessment of Literature Based
Multimedia Presentations" (1993) discusses the use of portfolios
to document high school students' explorations of literature as
they create and present multimedia projects.<p>

     Peterson and Sellers' "Student Motivation and Learning
Styles in a Multimedia Learning Environment" (1992) discusses the
beginning to implementation of a multimedia teaching and learning
component in the teacher education curriculum of the University
of Wyoming (Laramie).  A pilot study was conducted in the summer
of 1992 to attempt to identify teaching and learning issues
related to computer enhanced multimedia instructional platforms.
Subjects were seven middle school or junior high school students
attending a 3-week course to acquaint students with the
application of multimedia tools to specific learning outcomes.
Presentations developed by the students involved use of computer
software as well as video and audio editing, image scanning, and
digitalized video imaging.  According to the authors, "A
formative evaluation of the project was based on student
experience, motivation, and expectations with regard to the
learning environment" (p. 17).  Student learning style was
ascertained at the beginning of the workshop. Three students
worked alone, and four worked in pairs. The study was not of
sufficient size to answer questions about the efficacy of the
multimedia learning stations, but it does highlight difficulties
in cooperative learning caused when students have different
learning styles. Student learning styles should be a
consideration in the formation of cooperative teams.<p>

     Vuong G. Thuy's "High Tech for Effective ESL/Family Literacy
Instruction: Final Report" (1992) describes a pilot project
utilizing computers, CD ROM drives, and software to implement a
combined English as a Second Language and Family Literacy
curriculum for limited English proficient (LEP) adults.  The
program is intended for teachers, tutors, volunteers, and program
directors who may be interested in using high tech for their own
ESL/Family Literacy Programs. The project examined four software
packages produced by two companies to see if they could have a
significant and positive impact on the attainment of English
language skills by adult LEP students. Two groups of refugee and
immigrant adult students were studied. Each group received 6
hours of instruction per week for 15 weeks. The experimental
group (N=15) received two hours of instruction per week on the
material contained in the software; the control group (N=15) was
taught the same material in printed form without the use of
computers. Pre-tests and post-tests were administered to each
group. An analysis of the data indicates that both groups did
markedly better on the post-test, but that the experimental group
predictably improved more than the control group.<p>

relative to conventional instruction. Each of the stages of the
agenda is described, i.e., needs assessment; logic modelling;
five stages of formative evaluation (monitoring, systematic
review using formal criteria, presentation features analysis,
open ended expert review, and informal field testing); beta
testing of the product; and summative evaluation (formal field
tests and controlled tests). The various stages in the agenda are
illustrated by references to a recently completed pilot project, <p>

professional teaching standards of the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics (p.87).<p>

<p>

     Richard A. Schwier's  "A Taxonomy of Interaction for
Instructional Multimedia" (1992) rejects the hardware based
"levels of interaction" made popular in interactive video
literature to describe human machine interaction in favor of a
new taxonomy of learner media interaction based on the type of
cognitive engagement experienced by learners. Interaction can be
described on three levels, based on the quality of the
interaction. A reactive interaction is a response to presented
stimuli, such as an answer to a specific question. Proactive
interaction emphasizes learner construction and generative
activity. The learner goes beyond selecting or responding to
existing structures and begins to generate unique constructions
and elaborations beyond designer imposed rules. Mutual
interaction is characterized by artificial intelligence or
virtual reality designs in which the learner and system are
mutually adaptive, each capable of changing based on encounters
with the other. Reactive, proactive, and mutual interactivity can
be described at five functional levels: confirmation, pacing,
navigation, inquiry, and elaboration. The transactions (mechanics
of how interaction is accomplished) can also be described in
terms of their functions and levels of interactivity. Although
several transactions can be employed at all levels of
interaction, as interaction reaches for higher levels of
engagement with learners, generative transactions are required.
One of the major implications this taxonomy carries for
instructional design, the author points out, relates to learner
control:<p>

     As levels of interaction are ascended by the instructional
developer and reflected in the design of interaction, the
amount of control abdicated to the learner changes. At the
reactive level, the instructional developer retains almost
complete control over the content, its presentation,
sequence, and level of practice (p.121). <p>

<p>

While research in the area of learner control is relatively new,
some tentative advice is available from the literature. Inherent
in this emerging literature is the concept of learner control, an
issue which will occupy a central position in multimedia research
during this decade.      <p>

     "Multimedia in Industry and Education: A Decision Model for
Design," (1992) by Reynolds and Ehrlich, present a decision
making model that uses a systematic approach to design; has as a
driving force the needs and goals of a particular learning
situation and is derived from traditional instructional system
design models such as those of Kemp, Dick &amp; Carey, and
Romiszowski.  In addition, the article addresses the potential
impact of the model as a delivery system/learning tool. Presented
in the form of a puzzle, <p>

     the model is a series of eight interlocking pieces
representing: (1) learner characteristics; (2) topics and
tasks  content or task analysis; (3) objectives; (4)
performance assessment  occurring in four levels of
reaction, learning, changes, and long term results; (5)
instructional activities; (6) media/delivery systems 
integration of instructional design and media/delivery
systems; (7) resources; (8) the central piece, the analysis
phase, which defines the needs and goals of the situation
(p. 87).<p>

<p>

The process represented in the model is modified by continuous
revision and evaluation, for which an instrument called Checklist
for Multimedia Design has been developed suggests questions that
the instructional design team should ask. A Project Task Timeline
has also developed that defines the roles and responsibilities of
team members and lists tasks that should be completed in the
design phase. Appendix "B" illustrates the model.<p>

Learning from the Past" (1992) explains how educators and
decision makers need to see evidence regarding the instructional
effectiveness of multimedia in order to integrate it into the
educational processes. The main purposes of this paper are: (1)
to identify and discuss the main criticisms of media research,
including research format, characteristics, results, and
recommendations made between the 1950s and early 1970s and
between the mid-1970s and the present, including the aptitude
treatment interaction approach; (2) to discuss the state of
current interactive video simulation research in the light of
criticisms being made; and (3) to identify the most important
points that need to be considered by media researchers in order
to avoid making similar mistakes in the future, particularly in
the areas of cognitive and attitudinal effectiveness and the
theoretical basis of the design of interactive video simulations.
The authors suggest that educators should abandon the task of
trying to prove the effectiveness of multimedia simulations in
comparison to other technologies and concentrate on exploring
their potential in relation to learning tasks and learner
characteristics.<p>

     "Considerations in Evaluating Metacognition in Interactive
Hypermedia/Multimedia Instruction" (1992) by Ward Cates defines
metacognition as the set of skills and strategies one uses in
monitoring and modifying how one learns. This paper addresses
ways in which interactive hypermedia/multimedia instructional
programs might enhance the metacognitive abilities of the
learners who use them. It begins by identifying key issues and
approaches to metacognition, including the internal and external
structures of hypermedia/multimedia products. External structure
is described as the ways in which the product assists the learner
in gaining access to and making use of the nodes in the product
(the internal structure). Strategies for supplying external
structure are suggested. Devices for measuring the effectiveness
of methods by which metacognitive activities are stimulated,
exercised, and developed are discussed, including journal
entries, progress logs, transaction shell data, oral discussion,
and learner created materials. Specific metacognitive skills are
then examined under six broad headings: Task Analysis, Goal
Setting, Strategic Action, Cognitive Load, Persistence and
Responsibility, and Metacognitive Growth. Within each heading,
specific metacognitive skills that might enhance learners' use of
hypermedia/multimedia instructional products are examined. For
each skill, the paper examines two approaches that
hypermedia/multimedia products have used or might use to
encourage the development of that skill. The paper next addresses
what types of data one might expect to find as evidence of the
operation of that skill. Along the way, issues of import in
identifying, testing, and evaluating learner metacognition are
discussed. <p>

     Min Liu's "Hypermedia Assisted Instruction and Second
Language Learning: A Semantic Network Based Approach" (1992) 
examines a hypermedia learning environment from a semantic
network basis and the application of such an environment to
second language learning. (A semantic network is defined as a
conceptual representation of knowledge in human memory).  The
author concludes that, <p>

     a semantic network based hypermedia learning environment,
grounded in levels of processing theory and modes of
learning theory, seems to be particularly appropriate for
second language learning, as it provides not only a vivid
and natural environment for the accumulation of the facts of
a second/foreign language, but also tools to synthesize and
integrate the new knowledge, and reconstruct the existing
knowledge (p.41).<p>

<p>

     Boone and Higgins' "Multimedia. TAM Topical Guide #1" (1992)
examines educational multimedia and hypermedia systems, which
integrate computer generated text and graphics with full motion
video and stereo sound. These systems dominate much discussion
about the future of computer use in education. This guide brings
together the thoughts, ideas, and experience of elementary school
students, classroom teachers, administrators, university based
teacher educators, and educational researchers who have several
years of experience with multimedia/hypermedia hardware and
software. The guide's eight articles attempt to provide a
composite profile of what can be expected from the technology and
what the technology requires from those who want to use it,
particularly with special needs students. The guide addresses
instructional design of multimedia/hypermedia materials,
classroom management, teacher and student training, equipment
acquisition, student perceptions, teacher perceptions, and
administrative perspectives. Articles include: "Teacher Training
in Multimedia: Content Enhancements and Considerations for
Instruction" (Cheryl Wissick); "Envisioning, Acquiring, and
Running a Multimedia Lab in Your Classroom" (Karen Perlbachs);
"Building a Hypermedia Classroom Unit" (Susan McGrath); "Using a

     C. David Taylor's "Choosing a Display Format for
Instructional Multimedia: Two Screens vs. One" (1992) discusses
the factors involved in making decisions about a multimedia
display system. Theoretical factors, including gaining and
holding learner attention, specific attention getting devices,
encoding and retrieval of information by learners, and
presentation of information are considered. Ways that video is
associated with computer displays are then reviewed, including
managed versus integrated and digital versus analog video. Two
prototypical trade-offs in multimedia design information, versus
time and convenience versus quality, are described in order to
provide a framework for the kinds of choices necessary when
developing multimedia courseware. Constraints in several specific
areas are addressed, including resolution, image size, color
depth, speed, and data rate and bandwidth. Practical
considerations that determine the actual configuration of a
workstation or a group of workstations are also discussed, with
emphasis on the choice between single screen and two screen
systems. The final section presents a case study which outlines
the decision making process in designing a multimedia workstation
for a plant biology laboratory; prioritized system requirements
and the system configuration are described.<p>

     In "Alternate Methods for Conducting Formative Evaluations
of Interactive Instructional Technologies," (1992) Wilhelmina
Savenye argues that formative evaluation of instruction, which is
generally agreed to be critical for effective instruction in any
medium, is even more crucial when the instruction is to be
delivered by interactive technologies such as computers,
interactive video, hypermedia, or the various forms of
interactive multimedia systems. Savenye's paper discusses
formative evaluation as a formal step in instructional
development models, noting that the models rarely specify where
in the process such evaluation should take place. The
foundational assumptions and biases of the paper are then
discussed, including the current controversy over qualitative and
quantitative research and various issues involved in selecting
the research methods to be used. Several types of data collection
and analysis methods that can be used to answer important
questions concerned with interactive instructional technologies
are considered, and the use of a method that is appropriate to
answer the particular evaluation questions involved is advocated.
A discussion of the benefits of considering alternate methods of
formative evaluation introduces a review of the results of
evaluations of the overall effectiveness of interactive
technology based instructional programs, primarily computer
assisted instruction and interactive video. An overview of
planning and conducting formative evaluations as an ongoing
process through all phases of design and development is then
presented. Multiple methods for collecting and analyzing data are
also reviewed, with emphasis on the selection of appropriate
methods. Suggestions for reporting the results and a summary of
some of the major considerations in conducting formative
evaluations conclude this paper.<p>

     Pina and Savenye's "Beyond Computer Literacy: How Can
Teacher Educators Help Teachers Use Interactive Multimedia?"
(1992) provides a definition of interactive multimedia and
explains why it is of interest to teachers and trainers, how it
is produced and utilized, and how the role of teachers may be
changed. It also offers recommendations for teacher trainers.
Multimedia is defined as the combination of technologies such as
computer text, video, audio, graphics, and animation, and it is
argued that,<p>

     multimedia technologies offer unique opportunities to
learners to access information by selecting highlighted
words or icons. Choice of a word or icon enables the learner
to select the order in which lessons are presented, skip
unneeded lessons, access help screens, repeat a particular
lesson, receive additional examples, or take a test. This
ability to link items of related information in a non linear
fashion is known as hypermedia (p.133).<p>

<p>

It is noted that use of multimedia technology provides the
opportunity for learning experiences that would otherwise be
difficult for teachers to incorporate, such as computer
simulations of dangerous chemical reactions and computer software
that allows medical students to practice life and death
procedures without harm to real patients. The authors' research
indicates that the use of multimedia technology results in
significant changes in the teacher's role due to the increase in
learner controlled instruction. They recommend that teachers
receive appropriate training in the use of multimedia
technologies and their applications in the classroom. <p>

<b><u>Multimedia - How To</b></u><p>

     <i>Learning with Interactive Multimedia</i> by Ambron and Hooper
(1990) is in part a how-to book on the construction of multimedia
projects and scripting.  The base language used is Macintosh's
Hypercard, and the slant is definitely toward the construction of
Hypercard stacks that have the ability to utilize animation and
full-motion video and audio.  The work is presented from a
teacher's point of view and demonstrates screen construction and
some of the layout and design principles that work within basic
educational courseware design.  Key considerations such as not
placing too much text per screen, and the navigational buttons
being placed in the same area on each screen for familiarity, are
addressed. The interactive nature of the software is stressed,
although the technical information about multimedia is a little
outdated, this is still a useful work.<p>

     Microsoft's <i>Multimedia Programmer's Workbook</i> (1991) is a
reference book which immerses the reader in the mysteries of
introducing multimedia to computer educational software.  This
work is a hands-on introduction into the installation of and use
of audio, video, CD-ROM, and animation techniques within software
projects, with actual scripting code to implement the techniques
discussed.<p>

     Nicholas Wulfekuhle's "Selecting a Hypermedia Authoring
Program for CBT" (1994) discusses three criteria for learner
control in hypermedia. This approach allows the user to
concentrate on the content, needs to be user-friendly, and have
on-line help. Wulfekuhle then turns to the criteria of
information processing, discussing the ability to add audio and
visual elements, accessibility of compatible hardware, the
ability to use multimedia items with ease, the ease of control or
navigation, the capability to import a variety of visuals,
command language complexity, the ability to rate comprehension
and performance, and the ability to determine a correlation
between the amount learned and the ability to produce.<p>

     Linda Tway's <i>Welcome to Multimedia</i> (1992) discusses the
hardware and software requirements for multimedia, it describes
and has CD-ROM examples of multimedia toolbooks that allow you to
create your own graphics, animation, sound, and link them
together. In addition to the how-to elements of this work, Tway
has included an extensive list of commercially available
multimedia resources. <p>

     Badgett and Sandler's <i>Creating Multimedia  On Your PC</i> (1994)
is a book of software authoring systems and instructions to help
construct multimedia presentations. This work is full of expert
advice, as well as design tips, and includes a CD-ROM of the IBM
Ultramedia Tools Series with presentation examples from Asymetrix
Toolbook, Macromedia's Action, Fractal Design's Fractal Painter,
ZSoft, their Photofinish and IBM's Storyboard Live.<p>

      <i>The CD-ROM Book</i> by Bosak and Sloman (1993) explores the
realm of multimedia with startling examples of entertainment
clips, multimedia presentations, and virtual reality. This book
however delves more deeply into CD-ROM technology and how it has
opened up the multimedia market. Each chapter describes a
different form or utilization of CD-ROM technology, everything
from multimedia to networking to education, copyright laws,
portability, video, and the future. <p>

<center><b>III. METHODOLOGY</b> </center>
<p>

<p>

<b>Case Study</b><p>

     Case study research is a qualitative or naturalistic method,
yet it encompasses a variety of perspectives. According to
Merriman (1984) "A case study can test theory or build theory,
incorporate random or purposeful sampling, and includes
quantitative and qualitative data" (P. 2). In fact, case study is
one of the most widely used recent paradigms within the area of
education for social science and requires an inordinant
commitment on the part of the researcher. Yin (1984) agrees: "The
demands of a case study on a person's intellect, ego, and
emotions are far greater than any other research strategy" (p.
56). <p>

The methodology within case study <p>

     is phenomenon or social unit such as an individual, group,
institution, or community....[A] case study tends to be
concerned with investigating many, if not all, variables in
a single unit.  By concentrating upon a single phenomenon or
entity ("the case"), this approach seeks to uncover the
interplay of significant factors, that is, characteristic of
the phenomenon" (Merriman, 1984, pp.95-96).  <p>

<p>

     This particular case study concerns the design of a
computerized multimedia tutorial. Computerization in general has
become of considerable assistance in such areas as: note taking
on portables out in the field; amassing information in relational
databases such as frequency of response and in observing
behavioral patterns and general characteristics. The researcher
gathered data through methods of observation, interview, data
analysis, testing and evaluation to determine the efficacy of the
researcher designed computerized multimedia tutorial model. A
concern of the tutorial, but more particularly of the case study
surrounding it is that, as Pearson points out, "All the disparate
elements have to be transformed into a meaningful whole" (p. 8).
It is the amalgamation of all the sense input data that when
properly synthesized helps to reshape and reform the whole of the
tutorial being studied.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Methodology</b></u> <p>

     The research methodology for this computerized tutorial
study is predominantly the case study although other qualitative
and quantitative methodologies were employed.  The amount of
control and the researcher's desire to fully determine the
efficacy of a multimedia project were the determining factors in
selecting this methodology. This multimedia tutorial prototype,
or model, the focus is on a particular program. Here, the case
study method provides a rich description of the tutorial, its
"how to," its moorings and its place in twentieth-century
education. The method, additionally, is heuristic in that it
illuminates a deeper understanding of how interactive tutorial
education functions. The heuristic approach according to Pearson,
"seeks holistic description, analysis, and interpretation--to
uncover and display the interplay of significant factors that is
characteristic of the phenomenon" (Pearson, 1991, p. 2). It is
also inductive in that concepts and generalizations emerged that
helped establish multimedia as a future leader in all forms of
education and training.<p>

<u><b><p>

Population</b></u><p>

     The target population for this multimedia tutorial is
community college students enrolled in journalism and desktop
publishing classes which focus on issues of layout and design,
especially in the genres of newspaper and magazine.<p>

     This teaching module is designed to be incorporated into
current introductory journalism and desktop publishing classes.
The module examines layout and design and key aspects of the
publishing business and other factors to foster understanding of
how to construct a quality publications that is both highly
readable and graphically exciting. As a basic concept of
publishing, this module of instruction is a necessary component
for any introductory journalism or desktop publishing class. It
emphasizes key concepts that make newspapers or magazines
appealing and help them to sell the information that they
contain. The researcher is currently an instructor at the
community college level in these disciplines. <p>

<p>

<b>Formative Evaluation</b><p>

     Formative evaluation is the process instructors use to
obtain data in order to revise their instruction to make it more
efficient and effective. The emphasis in the process is on the
collection of data.<p>

     There are three basic phases of the formative evaluation
after a prototype is created: first, a "one-to-one" or clinical
evaluation by select students and specialists in the contact
area.  Next, a "small-group" evaluation is conducted of eight to
twenty randomly selected students of the target population.
Finally, there is a "field trial" with twenty or more target
population students. The emphasis in this phase is on testing in
a "real world", classroom situation.<p>

     The one-to-one or clinical evaluation stage is designed to
remove the most obvious flaws -- problems such as the program not
running on the computer or the content being way above the
students abilities, and to get initial user reactions. The
researcher worked individually with three members of the target
population. One learner was selected who is above average in
ability, one average, and one below average. "Average" is defined
as a student of community college entry level competency in
reading and writing skills with little or no proficiency with the
computer. The students were selected in the above and below
average categories to help the researcher determine if the
multimedia tutorial would prove helpful to a full spectrum of
students, the cross- section of the normal community college
class. The learners were encouraged to relax and were convinced
that it was legitimate to be critical of what is presented to
them. This was an interactive process where the researcher was
read directions and screens of text along with the student and
discussed the what and the how of that which was presented. This
interaction occurred with one learner at a time; all comments and
suggestions made by the individual learners were noted. <p>

     The purpose of the small-group evaluation is to evaluate the
changes made following the one-to-one stage, and to identify any
remaining problems. This stage also helped the researcher
determine if instructions could be comprehended without the
researcher-designer being present to interpret or clarify the
instructions. A group of twelve randomly selected learners,
representative of the community college target population. The
researcher used a non-random sample to assure that at least one
representative of each type of subgroup that exists in the target
population, i.e., low, average and high achievement students,
minorities, computer literates and illiterates, males and females
and younger as well as mature learners who are or have been
enrolled in journalism or desktop publishing community college
classes was included in the small group.<p>

     Basic administration procedures at this stage differed
sharply from those used in the one-to-one phase. The evaluator
explained to the subjects that the materials they were about to
use were still in development and that the researcher wanted
feedback. The researcher intervened as little as possible from
that point on. An attitude questionnaire was administered to
obtain the learners reactions. See Appendix "D" for a copy of the
instrument.<p>

     In the field trial stage the researcher tried to create a
learning situation that closely emulated the lab environment
where the tutorial would be used. Its purpose was to evaluate the
changes made after the small group stage, and to see if the
instruction could be used in the setting for which it was
intended. Upon successful completion of this stage, the stand
alone multimedia model would be ready to use. In this phase, the
researcher-designer did not play a role in the implementation of
the instruction. The instructions appeared to be clear enough to
be easily understood and followed.<p>

     The formative evaluation (the one-on-one testing of the
tutorial model) utilized a content area specialist, who is the
faculty adviser to a community college newspaper, and selected
students from the researcher's previous computer, desktop
publishing, and journalism classes. In order to test this module
fully, two students who demonstrated superior ability with the
computer were used and two were chosen who appeared to have
marginal proficiency or experience dealing and interacting with
new computer software. Using this sample of convenience, the
researcher was able to determine how students of varying computer
sophistication would likely interface with the information in the
model.  This group served as a pilot group to determine the
validity and clarity of the completed model.<p>

     The "small-group" subjects came from a similar population as
the pilot group, but the evaluation was structured as a group
session. In the "small-group" session there was as little
intervention by the researcher to insure that the students could
properly access the tutorial on their own. This was to determine
if the changes made to the model were adequate. <p>

     The "field trial" subjects consisted of students in an
introductory class in journalism. This class was selected solely
on the instructor's willingness to have her students participate
in the study. Thus, the students were selected by their
membership in this course. <p>

<p>

<b>Summative Evaluation</b><p>

     The major function of a formative evaluation is to collect
data and information in order to improve an instructional course
or activity. At some time, however, one needs to decide if the
new instruction is effective. To resolve that issue one often
uses a summative evaluation.<p>

     A summative evaluation may be defined as the design,
collection, and interpretation of data and information for a
given set of instructions for the purpose of determining the
value or worth of those instructions. This researcher provided
the instructional materials JEMM (the multimedia tutorial), a set
of criterion-referenced assessment instruments, and pre and post
tests, for the tutorial. The researcher as summative evaluator
then arranged for an instructor not involved in the design
process to use the instructional materials with students in a
community college desktop publishing class.  The next step was to
test these students to establish their entry level skills and
their knowledge of the intended instruction material -- the
pretest. After the students had an opportunity to work the
multimedia tutorial for a one-hour period a post test was given
to determine the learners' level of achievement. A visual
analogue attitude questionnaire was also administered to measure
learners' reactions to the content, materials, and the process
(see appendix "D").<p>

     Though the procedures are similar, the purpose of the
formative evaluation is to provide data for further revision of
the instruction, while the purpose of a summative evaluation is
to determine the value of the presented materials for a defined
target group or a particular target setting or both.<p>

     This researcher was also interested in comparing the
effectiveness of JEMM to a more traditional set of instructional
materials and presentation models, among them lectures, overheads
and handouts.<p>

     In the comparison of this multimedia tutorial with these
other learning materials, a whole group of ancillary questions
was asked, such as:<p>

     a. What are the comparative costs of materials and
supporting hardware?<p>

     b. How much time do the learners need to complete the module
of instruction?<p>

     c. Is special instructor training required?<p>

     d. Are their any side effects to using the multimedia
tutorial?<p>

     e. What are the long-term effects of this type of self-paced
instruction?<p>

     f. Will the content materials be rendered quickly
out-of-date and require costly revision?<p>

  <p>

<u><b>Statistical Hypothesis</b></u><p>

     The researcher was trying to determine if students who use
JEMM will learn layout and design faster and with a higher level
of retention than those who learn the material through standard
textbook and lecture methods of instruction.<p>

<p>

<b><u>The Model</b></u><p>

     As Griffin (1991), Bergman and Moore (1990), and others
point out, developing multimedia instructional materials is a
complex undertaking.  Computer-delivered multimedia instruction
is a new and innovative phenomenon requiring sophisticated
computer equipment, authoring (programming) software and
personnel to design and implement its construction.  Appendix "A"
contains a full description of the computer hardware and software
utilized in the construction of this multimedia model, JEMM.<p>

     The researcher created an interactive multimedia course
module containing multiple screens into which text and graphic
material were placed.  This model is composed of straight text
screens, interactive screens, and a number of different
variations which enable the participating learner to explore a
variety of interactive materials.  The screens resemble forms or
pages in a book.  Some pages are for text, some are for pictures
and some are for a combination of text and pictures.  Other pages
contain questions and answers with appropriate feedback links to
further study. Some pages allow the user to interact with a
combination of audio, animation and video.  <p>

     The independent variables in this procedure are the design
elements themselves.  These include: the type of screens used,
the number of words of text per page, the varying interactive
nature of the content areas, the utilization of video and audio,
the interspersed use of animation, as well as the use of multiple
windows, navigation buttons, color, configuration and screen
window sizes.  <p>

     All screens except the introduction and instruction screens
contain a limited number of navigational buttons (four) to help
the learner move within the tutorial. These buttons give the
student the choice as to whether to process the information
linearly with the "Next" and "Back" buttons, or on a need to
explore basis, or when certain deficiency areas need to be
addressed, by using the "Topics" button. An "End" button affords
immediate exit capabilities. The navigation buttons were placed
in the same relative position on all appropriate pages, lower
left, to insure ease of interface and consistency (figure 3). <p>

<p>

<p>

It is important to simplify the navigational choices available to
the learner.  Ambron and Hooper (1990) refer to  this "reduction
of cognitive load" by stating that "Text was placed in framed
areas called 'windows' that allow the user to access additional
text on the topic by using a mouse to manipulate the window
scroll bar on the right of each text screen (p. 127).<p>

     Instructions for design exercise screens appear in the upper
left of the screen and relate to the full page newspaper examples
to the right of the screen (figure 4). Ambron and Hooper (1990)
address this issue of choice.<p>

     Many known and proposed methods exist for ameliorating
cognitive load in hypermedia systems. ...A popular method is
information hiding, reducing the choices visible to the user
by hiding less-used options in the form of a menu... The
controls that are exposed are the more commonly used short-range navigation options. (p.
128)<p>

     Color  visualization and contrast are other elements that
are addressed in the creation of the JEMM model. Soft, neutral,
non-threatening and consistent background colors were chosen with
highly-contrasting text for visualization. "The difference
between color and pseudo-color is a major topic when scientific
visualization is discussed. Does red mean "hot" or "danger?" The
answer is not always intuitive!" (Ambron and Hooper, 1990,  p.
107). Color, however, is not the only issue in an appealing
presentation screen. How clever the screen appears becomes a key
issue: not only how cluttered is the screen with different
images, navigational buttons and text vying for attention, but
how cluttered is it with information. Each individual learning
point should be isolated to individual or multiple screens. Too
much information on a page or screen confuses the observer, and
in lieu of trying to comprehend the mess of different and varying
information they must often turn the page or access a new screen
of information. Badgett and Sandler (1994) address this problem:<p>

     As you work on placement of the various elements on a screen
keep these ideas in mind: each screen or slide should
address a single concept or idea. In general, a simple
design is best. The viewer must be able to digest each
screen quickly and easily. For text screens, six lines are
generally the maximum. Choose a color appropriate to the
mood you want to convey. Avoid using too many colors ( five
colors per screen maximum) (pp.87-88). <p>

<p>

     This tutorial model incorporates animation to impart
movement and stress how the eye moves when reading. In a
newspaper or magazine the placement of the graphic images, 
pictures or information graphics become the key areas on which
the eye is attracted. By controlling the placement, size and
intensity of these pictures one can draw the observer's eye from
one area to another in a controlled manner, helping him or her
observe the content in the most desirable way. As Tway (1992)
points out "Animation is most effective when it illustrates a
movement that is difficult to describe in words or with a still
image" (p. 107). See figure 6 and visualize the tutorial drawing
a circle around first one dominant visual element, then over to
another, and another around the page.   <p>

     The researcher-established design elements were gleaned from
graphic arts instructional texts and from personal knowledge as
to what this student population finds most stimulating and
appealing.  The researcher adheres to established curriculum
design and desktop publishing considerations gathered from varied
external computer, art and design source materials, among them
Finberg and Itule (1990), Nelson (1991), Silver and Silver (1991)
and Harrow (1989), as well as precepts based on considerable
familiarity with layout and design concepts gathered from
teaching design courses for many years.  <p>

     Upon completion, the model was reviewed by members of the
multimedia consortium and a representative sample of community
college students.  The pilot group was asked to check for
adherence to the constructs of the program, to the varied and
proper presentation of the material and to the proper use of each 
media and design element.  See the formative evaluation in
appendix "D."<p>

<p>

<b><u>Procedure</u></b><p>

     The JEMM tutorial was administered by the researcher for
formative evaluation by three different methods. 
Chronologically, the first exposure of the tutorial for
evaluation was to the multimedia consortium members, and access
to the multimedia tutorial was sought at a meeting of primary
community college contacts in a multimedia lab setting at one of
the researcher's companion institutions.  After a one-hour
meeting to discuss the implementation of multimedia throughout
the eight-member consortium campuses, the Layout and Design
Multimedia Tutorial was presented on ten IBM Model 70's.  Six of
the seven members of the consortium were present and sat down in
front of appropriately-configured machines.  Since the software
had been loaded onto the machines, this stage was omitted;
however: the tutorial is to be accessed through a menu option for
Network Open Lab usage.  The only instructions presented by the
researcher were to access the tutorial and spend between 30 and
45 minutes working through some of the text content areas and
design exercises.  The evaluation participants were told that at
the conclusion of the 45-minute period, a four-page validity
scale evaluation form would be filled out by each participant. 
Participants were not to evaluate the content area, since none of
them had expertise or interest within the journalism or desktop
publishing areas, but were to evaluate the instructions and ease
of use.  The purpose of this formative evaluation stage was to
make any necessary improvements to the tutorial before further
evaluation.<p>

     The second phase of the formative evaluation was a one-on-one and group evaluations,
where three students in the one-on-one
and six students in the small group were chosen from the
researcher's previous desktop publishing and journalism classes
to participate in further formative evaluation.  In the one-on-one section, each student was invited
to the Faculty Resource
Center housing the researcher's multimedia computer and asked to
spend 30 to 45 minutes working through the tutorial.  Again the
tutorial was loaded onto the machine and ready for access by the
student, whereas in the future the tutorial would be a menu
selection off of the main or subsequent level menu on a campus
network lab.  The population for the one-on-one evaluation was
two females and one male, and four females and two males in the
small group evaluation.  This sex differentiation was chosen to
correlate with the normal composition of journalism and desktop
publishing community college classes.  All students evaluating
the tutorial were between the ages of 21 and 45, again
representing the community college mix.  Instructions similar in
nature to those given to the multimedia consortium group were
administered, and an evaluation of form was filled out
immediately following the students' active exposure to the
tutorial.<p>

     The large group formative evaluation occurred in the
researcher's classroom in a community college adult education
desktop publishing class held in the Spring of 1994.  The
population was comprised of 23 students chosen by their
participation in the Introduction to Desktop Publishing spring
term class.  The students signed the consent form and were given
one hour to work through the content area and exercises of the
multimedia tutorial.  The population was 71 percent female and of
varying ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds.  The instructions
were administered to the large group in a written form with the
same information given to the multimedia consortium, one-on-one,
and small group evaluation participants, with one addition.  The
addition was that no help would be provided in accessing or
navigating through the program by the researcher, in an effort to
determine whether the tutorial would stand by itself and be
readily and easily accessible.  All students were requested to
stay on the computers for the full one hour, which was calculated
by the researcher to be less than one-third of the time needed to
complete all the tutorial and design exercises, and the
participants were also asked to answer all questions to help the
researcher evaluate the tutorial.  Since this was an ongoing
class held by the researcher for the research participants, the
issue of grades and positive or negative response was brought up. 
All participants were assured that honest negative or positive
responses were requested and that no part of the hour and a half
long tutorial work or evaluation would be part of a grade.<p>

IV. ANALYSIS OF DATA</b><p>

</center>
<p>

<b>Presentation and Analysis of Formative Evaluation Data</b><p>

     For the express purpose of reworking and improving JEMM, a
reaction to, and an understanding of the prototype model was a
necessary part of the creation process. Each question of the
formative evaluation instrument was rated on a "visual analog"
scale to elicit a less binary and more natural and free response.
The "visual analogue" scale is similar to the "Likert" scale
except instead of having 5 distinct points of a continuum by
which to make a rating  there is a 5 centimeter line anywhere
along which a mark can be placed to represent the acceptance or
rejection of the position. The use of a continuum without
distinct rating points allows the respondent greater latitude or
freedom in expressing a thought, feeling or position, a more real
world, multivalent response.  The rationale behind the questions
and the response is as follows:<p>

     The first question, "Did you understand that in the tutorial
you were going to learn about layout principles and design
techniques used to create a newspaper?" was asked to establish
the level of understanding present among the sampling of the
intent of the tutorial. A mean visual analog rating of .95 was
determined suggesting a firm understanding of what the learning
topic was and this researcher feels that no changes in the
introductory instructions or tutorial screens were necessary.<p>

     Question two, "Is layout and design for desktop publishing
an interesting topic to you?" was included to help determine
whether only those highly motivated by topical interest would
work the tutorial successfully and be insightful as to possible
improvements. A mean rating of .68 was obtained coupled with
suggestions for improvement. <p>

     The third question which was designed to define the sampling
was, "Did you know about newspaper design and layout before you
interacted with this multi-media tutorial?" A mean of .43 was
obtained suggesting a low respondent awareness. <p>

     The fourth question, "How would you rate your level of
computer proficiency?" was included to measure the students ease
with the computer. The mean of .61 was informing the researcher
that the subjects had a slightly above average sample in computer
knowledge. Further examination of the individual evaluation forms
revealed a wide range of responses as to the sample's computer
expertise. This additional information assured the researcher
that even unskilled computer operators could navigate the
tutorial.<p>

     The fifth question, "Were the introductory instructions easy
to understand?" addressed the tutorial itself.  A mean of .86
indicated a basic understanding of how to operate the tutorial,
so a change in the tutorial instructions does not appear
necessary. <p>

     "How interesting did you think the multi-media tutorial
was?", question number 6, explored the issue of whether JEMM was
appealing to the sample and whether or not multimedia made the
topic and the contents more stimulating. A mean of .91 suggested
that the overall appearance stimulated interest. <p>

     The seventh question "Was it easy to move from topic to
topic in this multi-media tutorial?" garnered a mean rating of
.62.  The researcher concluded that better navigational control
was necessary and added a "topics" button to the background of
each screen, allowing the user to go back to the table of
contents screen and choose any section or screen at will.  In
contrast, in the initial JEMM model the "next" for the next page
or the "back" button to go back one page or screen were the only
navigational aides available forcing a sequential or linear
progression throughout the tutorial. The students did not
appreciate the forced linear progression. They wished to use JEMM
to bolster knowledge of areas they felt weak in so skipping
around through the tutorial, a "Topics" button the could get them
to the Table of Contents and from there to any area of interest
was important. <p>

     The eighth question "Did you find the screen layout
attractive?" yielded a mean score of .74.  The positioning of the
text windows, buttons and examples on different tutorial pages
appeared to be properly laid out, however the screen colors were
dull. By brightening the screen colors and changing the
background screen to a lighter color seemed to improve the
attractiveness. Three respondents who had marked question eight
particularly low were asked to re-evaluate the "attractiveness"
and they felt there had been a considerable improvement.<p>

     "Did each topic make you want to learn more?" was question
number 9.  With a mean rating of .88 the researcher may assume
that the content area of the individual topics within the
tutorial are sufficiently captivating to retain the interest of
most of the respondents accessing the tutorial. Therefore no
alteration regarding content is necessary. <p>

     A mean rating of .96 to the question "Did each topic make
you want to learn more?" is more than sufficient as a
confirmation that the textual content and manner of presentation
were sufficiently interesting and/or exciting to elicit a desire
for more.  <p>

     "Was the subject matter easy to understand?" addressed  the
issue of text content area enhanced by graphics and animation.
The mean score of .93 appeared to confirm that the graphic and
animation enhanced the text and made it more easily understood.  <p>

     When asked, "Did you feel the screens were too crowded with
information, just right, or not enough there?" the sampling
responded with a mean of .36, indicating an overcrowding of
information.  This prompted the researcher to  make the screens
less crowded by putting less information on each page.  A text
screen with scroll bars to access additional information was
still utilized in some instances.<p>

     To question 13, "Were there any words, terms, or language
problems using this tutorial?" the respondents rating was a mean
of .26. A low analog reading here indicates that there were few
problems with language. New journalism jargon such as
"nameplate", "sidebar", "slug", "lift-out quote" and "promos"
were introduced in the content area of the tutorial and these
words appeared to be the only language problems.<p>

     Question 14, "Would you have preferred more photos,
diagrams, and examples within the tutorial?" obtained a mean
rating of .89 which indicated a desire for more graphic
representation.  More examples were subsequently added
specifically in the topic areas of liftout quotes, slugs, and eye
movement where no graphic representations existed in the original
version. <p>

     "Did the tutorial seem prejudiced in any way?" was designed
to address any bias found by the sample within JEMM.  A .10
rating suggested that this issue did not need to be addressed in
the re-work of the model. The low or negative rating to this
question implied that bias did not exist. <p>

     Question 16, "Did you enjoy working through this interactive
tutorial?" again addressed an overall feeling of ease and
pleasure with the experience, as opposed to more negative
connotations such as work or frustration.  The mean value of .93
on the visual analog rating implies that this format was
enjoyable.<p>

     Question 17, "Did the feedback references help you?"
referred to the answer screens in the design exercise section
this section provided information as to why an answer was correct
or what was wrong if an incorrect answer was chosen.  This
section also provided information about where to look in the
tutorial to find the correct answer. A mean value of .83 suggests
that the feedback was relatively complete.<p>

     The question, "Did the navigation system used to move
between pages work for you?" was designed to gain information
about the simple next and back navigational buttons on all of the
introductory screens of the JEMM tutorial.  These are simple
navigational aids that have been used successfully in the past
and the mean score of .97 seems to indicate that they functioned
properly for the vast majority of the sample. <p>

     Question 19, "Was the text in the scrollable windows a help
or a hindrance to you?" acquired a mean of .53 positioning on the
analog scale, indicating to the researcher that there was
ambivalence or mixed opinions as to the advantages or
disadvantages of text that could be scrolled within individual
windows in the tutorial.  No changes were made other than what
was previously mentioned regarding these scrollable windows. <p>

     A mean of .40 for question 20, "Were the video sequences
clear and bright?" suggests that the sample was not appreciative
of a non-professionally produced video. No commercial video clips
were available for the sequences within JEMM, so these clips had
to be shot by the researcher.  A lack of quality equipment
severely hampered brightness, quality and resolution of the video
shot. New equipment has since been obtained with which to re-shoot the video sequences and that
will be accomplished.  The
researcher understands that this is an important area in which to
capture and retain the learner's attention and interest.  <p>

     Question 21, "Did the graphics and animation segments seem
to amplify the lessons being taught?" was designed to poll the
sample on the importance of this graphic element. The sample
responded with a .95 mean value which indicated a great interest
and satisfaction with this mode of learning. <p>

     The last question of the formative evaluation, "Do you think
there were enough design exercises?" brought a mean of .67.  The
researcher feels there is a need for improvement.  A matching
headline typeface exercise and a lift-out quote exercise would
add valuable learning opportunities for students.<p>

          After collecting, tabulating and analyzing the
formative evaluations, this researcher revised the multimedia
tutorial to incorporate the suggestions of the sample into the
final product design.  Randomly captured graphic representations
of the screens from JEMM that were revised according to the
results of the pilot study formative evaluations appear in
appendix "B" as still images, screens or pages randomly chosen
from the tutorial.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Presentation  and Analysis of Test Data</b></u><p>

     The subjects of this study were 23 desktop publishing
students from San Diego County in southern California.  The
subjects were administered the JEMM tutorial pre and post tests,
a standard journalism desktop publishing instrument used by the
department.<p>

     All the respondents answered all questions on the JEMM tests
and the pre and post test results for all 31 questions were
reported in the graph with the deviations encountered. The pre
and post tests were administered to investigate the effectiveness
of the JEMM tutorial upon learning basic journalism and desktop
publishing layout and design skills. Each pair of scores, the
pretest and post test scores, are matched for one particular
question for all 23 students who attained either the correct
score or the incorrect score.<p>

     At the s=0.05 level of significance, the researcher tested
the claim that the JEMM tutorial would result in a significant
gain of knowledge. The values from the JEMM tutorial pre and post
test were used.  The mean pretest value was: m=43.19 percent,
with a standard deviation of s=3.6. The mean post test value
was: m=60.03 with a standard deviation of s=3.4.<p>

     Since the involved populations were normally distributed a
paired t-test was performed. Since each pair of scores matched
for one particular person it was concluded that the values are
dependent. The differences computed were the post test minus the
pre test. If JEMM was effective, it would be expected that the
pre test would be significantly lower than the post test. The
null hypothesis H0:<i>md</i>&lt;0 and the alternate hypothesis H1: <i>md</i>&gt;0. 
The test statistic t=24.1 was computed. With 3 degrees of
freedom, the critical t=1.69 was determined. A Right-tailed test
at s=0.05 with (n-1) degrees of freedom.<p>

     Since the test t falls well within the critical region, the
null hypothesis was rejected, and the researcher concluded that
there was a statistically significant difference between the pre
and post test and JEMM seems to be an effective model for
teaching newspaper layout and design.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Greater Efficiency</b></u><p>

     To determine if this interactive multimedia presentation of
information was more efficient than traditional methods of
teaching the same content area, the researcher discovered that
the average community college journalism and desktop publishing
student takes 4.5 hours of lecture and 3 hours of home study to
assimilate the subject matter at a minimal level of competency. 
The researcher claims that JEMM will decrease the average lecture
and study time necessary for the assimilation of this
information.  <p>

     To test this claim, the researcher sampled 23 community
college students (n=23) who have been using JEMM and found that
the mean average of this group is 5.6.  However, since the
standard deviation of the population is 0.76, this could indicate
that the sample students are just within normal boundaries.  <p>

     Statistical hypothesis testing was used to determine if the
sample mean score of 5.6 represents a statistically significant
decrease from the population mean of 6.0, or if the difference is
more likely due to chance variation in assimilation time
reported.<p>

     A paired t test was used to substantiate the claim that the
students using JEMM took less time to absorb the material. The t
value of 1.94 was computed, and at the s=0.05 level of
significance it was determined that the students exposed to JEMM
had absorbed the information in significantly less time.<p>

<center><b>V. SOCIAL IMPACT</b></center>
<p>

<p>

<b><u>Long-Range Consequences</u></b><p>

     Humanity in the United States and around the world will most
likely become more fractured and immersed in sensory stimuli
overload.  In this world, teachers who have not invested in new
media teaching structures will find themselves struggling to keep
the attention and interest of their students. Kanning (1994) puts
the same thought in a more optimistic light: <p>

     As educators create effective uses for multi-media
technology, imagination will be the only limit.  Parents,
educators, administrators, and school board members need to
become familiar with multi-media so they can begin to take
advantage of its endless possibilities" (p.44).<p>

<p>

Instructors who do not integrate self-paced multimedia into the
classrooms and learning labs will be further behind than those
who use this new medium, making them less effective educators. 
Providing instructors who may lack the technical skills to
develop interactive multimedia tutorials with a prototype might
facilitate the adoption of new media tools.  Therefore it is
important to provide the design point that can lead others to
become more comfortable in using this new technology in the
educational arena. It is the researcher's hope that by providing
a multimedia interactive tutorial prototype, instructors will be
encouraged to explore these new methods of teaching, and thus
increase student learning.  For the students, a side benefit is
that such technology will help prepare them to more fully
participate in the high-tech world that is constantly being
constructed.<p>

     It is also the researcher's hope that new models for
tutorial learning will be constructed that are more closely
attuned to our natural ingestion of data through sense
perception. These new tutorials might better represent real world
experience and therefore stimulate even greater learning
experiences.  <p>

     One long-term impact of the use of this prototype is the
fostering of multimedia presentations, especially in non-technical discipline areas; such
presentations will have a direct
impact on the quality of education at every level. Multimedia may
become a standard method of instruction: its strength lies in its
ability to simulate life situations while engaging the senses.
Multimedia interactive tutorials allow students to put themselves
in real-life decision-making situations while providing immediate
graphic feedback that allows learners to see, feel, hear, and
experience the ramifications of their decisions in an
unprecedented way. Learning via multimedia interactive tutorials
is specific, whereas traditional classroom lecture-type learning
is more abstract and cannot involve students in the consequences
of their decisions as can multimedia.  Thus multimedia makes
learning real. As multimedia expands, retention and instructional
quality will most likely improve due to the "real life" nature
and sensory stimulation of the medium.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Future of Multimedia</b></u><p>

  Multimedia itself has changed into a dynamic and a virtual
environment that more closely emulates that of mankind. If the
new paradigms of education are non-linear and holistic, then the
first generation multi-media of story board screens, computer
text and separate but distinct audio and visual tracts will give
way to "Second-generation multimedia architectures [that] make it
hard to define or trace channels that are neatly aligned with
human audition and vision because they encode data in binary
form" (Allen, 1994, p.33). That holistic totality to which
multimedia aspires suggests a complete environment in which each
piece presented communicates with another in a symbiotic fashion.
This is as opposed to the current audio-visual channels, each
processing and presenting their own data structures, each sending
their own bullets of information to capture the perceiver's
attention. Allen (1994) contrasts second-generation multimedia
systems with " Third generation [multimedia] systems [that] make
it almost impossible to trace separate information flows because
they utilize dedicated microprocessors that constantly inter-leave small packets of information
assigned to various
modalities" (p.33).<p>

   The success of the newer interactive multimedia models as
agents of education will depend on how closely they emulate our
own perceptive and cognitive processes. What one knows is based
on the perception of a physical or social experience as
understood by the mind; what the mind then produces is a model, a
construct, an encoding that can then be used to explain or infer
the original perception or phenomena back to the external world.
The reality that we build, the model that is constructed in the
mind, is a whole not made up of the unique pieces of perception
but a whole that is greater than the individual elements. Tropea
and Rothermal (1994) conclude that "There is much to recommend a
design philosophy that could indulge students' curiosity with
multiple, branching program flows and rich networks of
connections among disparate materials" (p. 84). What multimedia
delivers is the actual amalgamation or wholeness of what the
western world has constantly seen as "disparate materials."  For
the constructivist, holism and not individual parts should foster
learning environments rather than instructional sequences. "They
[constructivists] do not seek to pre-determine a sequence of 
instruction or a prescribed set of activities and thought
processes by the learner, rather they seek to provide a
supportive environment in which the learner can interpret at
least a simulated reality in order to better understand that
reality (Allen, 1994, p.35).  Morden (1994) states that in using
Crossroads to the World, a multimedia, interactive tutorial, "my
students are still learning the same information as in their
textbooks -- but in a more engaging way. They are involved, they
are planning, they are creating. The promise of technology is so
powerful! It is part of an authentic learning experience because
it is part of real life, <i>now</i>!" (p.38).<p>

   The future of education is in multimedia, it is in a new sense
of wholeness, a new lack of predictability, a new non-linear,
multivalent experience.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Educational Impact</b></u><p>

   If multimedia can implement the paradigm shift to non-linear
learning, and if, as it appears, this is a direction that is
successful (Brandt, 1994; Hancock and Betts, 1984; Fitzgerald and
Olson, 1993; Peck and Dorricott, 1994), then why is it not being
embraced and endorsed more fervently? Soloman (1994) reports
that, "Richard Cyert, president of Carnegie Mellon University
complains that we teach classes today the same way as our
ancestors, without innovation or change" (p.81). If there is a
general understanding within educational institutions that
multimedia is a new avenue of great potential then why are these
institutions imposing a traditional linear model on their
students. Solomon suggests that there have been three
technological revolutions in the last twenty years: the
television, the computer, and now multimedia, and all three were
touted as the technology that would change the "very foundations
of education."  All three have so far failed to spark such wide-
reaching change. Why? Mcadoo (1994) feels that it is an equity
issue, the haves and the have nots.  Peters (1994) reports from
the Technology, Scholarship, and the Humanities Invitational
Conference in Irvine, California that lack of information and
collaborative efforts seems to be the chief deterrent while
Hannafin and Savenye (1993) see the teachers' reaction to the
micro-computer as "just another failed invention" (p. 27)  and
that their is another unwanted pedagogical shift in role of the
teacher who does integrate micro-computers into their classrooms.
Solomon (1994) addresses the unwanted shift in how teachers view
their role by noting that<p>

     A primary reason for these failures is the culture of higher
education.  In virtually all research institutions and large
universities, faculty do not feel they have time to devote
to serious innovation in the classroom.  For one thing, they
have been doing quite well, thank you, without these
innovations (p. 82).<p>

<p>

    Sammons (1994) suggests however that there are motivational
strategies educational institutions might implement that would
stimulate the adoption of these new multimedia techniques. One
important counter measure Sammons recommends to increase
multimedia utilization is to, "make equipment readily available,
provide time to design material, provide solid support, training
and assessment materials" (pp. 89-90). <p>

    If multimedia is to succeed as a forerunner of a new
educational model, many of the deterrents must be eliminated.
Only when educators see the futility in utilizing the traditional
linear models will they come to true understanding of the power
of the new media. As that occurs educators will demand increased
funds, increased access to multimedia technology and authoring
systems, textbook suppliers will see it as an ancillary product
to enhance their particular text until it will be available in
most every classroom, presenting a more realistic understanding 
of a concept or precept that is of the "real world" which has in
the past been translated into a linear, bivalent string and then
must be re-conceptualized by the learner's mind back into
reality.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Conclusion</b></u><p>

     With the creation of this interactive multimedia tutorial as
a prototype, educators, especially in the Humanities and other
non-computer related disciplines who might not have access to
these new teaching technologies; will be able to offer their
students a vastly more captivating look at the ever-changing
world that surrounds them.<p>

    The future for multimedia is in educators understanding its
revolutionary value and overcoming the obstacles of time,
availability of equipment and funding, but it will never become
fully integrated into the educational system until it can
infiltrate the computing super-highways, the LAN networks. Tropea
and Rothermal assert that,<p>

     For multimedia to realize its potential in education, it
must grow out of its closed box and enter the age of
distributed computing...while some sound and imagery sources
can be included on an applications main program CD, an array
of supplementary resources would be stored in a
technologically and legally accessible format in a different
location...as far as miles away...large network systems" (p.
85).<p>

<p>

<b><u>Limitations</u></b><p>

     This study has addressed the construction of an interactive
multimedia tutorial, JEMM, to be part of a non-technical
journalism curriculum.  A formative evaluation was performed by
journalism and desktop publishing students to provided feedback
to the researcher so that constructive refinements might be made
to improve the tutorial by offering a class of desktop publishing
students a pretest in newspaper layout and design followed by
exposure to the tutorial and a post-test.  Several areas of this
case study exhibit limitations.  <p>

     The first limitation of this study is the lack of
generalizability.  The results are not generalizable outside of
the particular sample because it is a convenience sample, not a
random sample.  As discussed in Chapter 3, neither the formative
nor summative evaluation respondents were randomly selected.  <p>

     Second, the possibility of interviewer bias exists.  The
researcher performed the testing and was aware of the research
hypothesis being tested.  This bias could be eliminated if
students from other instructors' classes from other campuses
could be assembled as part of the sample.  If the students were
unaware of the purpose, you would have a "blind" test; if the
person <u>administering</u> the test were also unaware, you would have a
"double-blind" test.<p>

     Third, the formative evaluation field trial, an introductory
journalism class, was made up of a limited number of students--six--most of whom had higher
levels of computer skills than a
more random sampling might have possessed.  A larger class size
with a larger variance in computer skills might have provided
more satisfactory formative results.  <p>

     Fourth, the limited availability of proper high-tech
equipment needed to run the JEMM tutorial made it difficult to
administer to large groups of respondents simultaneously. Thus,
the convenience sample and not a random sample.  The limited
equipment availability tended to keep the sample size smaller
than the researcher would have liked.<p>

     Fifth, the novelty of such a multimedia tutorial was
limiting in that the respondents were generally not familiar with
using such tutorials.  Therefore students seemed more tenuous
when working through the tutorial.<p>

<p>

<p>

<b><u>Recommendations for Future Research</b></u><p>

     The researcher has found that the JEMM multimedia
interactive tutorial appears to enhance learning and decrease the
amount of hours necessary to achieve proficiency within the
content area.  Adapting this model to other curricular areas in
journalism as well as other humanities courses might possibly
foster the same types of successful learning.  It is therefore
suggested that other interactive multimedia tutorials be
constructed in other curricular areas of journalism as well as
other humanities courses to determine whether this paradigm shift
in learning method might prove as rewarding as the JEMM model.<p>

     As other interactive multi-media tutorials are developed, it
would be helpful if more research is done on how the interactive
environment fosters increased learning over the more traditional
lecture or T.V. presentation distance learning models.<p>

     The first recommendation that comes out of this research is
the need to collect more qualitative data.  The instruments used
in the formative evaluation of this study certainly were adequate
for measuring areas of concern for improvement of the tutorial;
however, some of the most interesting information was gathered
after the evaluation was administered as the respondents felt
more relaxed to talk about their experience with JEMM.  As other
tutorials are constructed and larger respondent samples are
amassed, more qualitative feedback can be gathered that will help
establish a set of construction criteria that will make the
multi-media tutorials even better learning aids.  Such areas as
color combinations, use of multiple screen images, what topics
are more demonstrable with video, animation, or still image
graphics, are areas that could use additional research.<p>

     The second recommendation is that the proper use of
multimedia tutorials be studied.  At present there is little
equipment in our educational institutions that would enable
teachers to provide multimedia demonstration and/or self-paced
tutorial sessions.  Teachers themselves are unaware of how
effective this paradigm shift is in increased learning and
retention and they are hesitant to vary the traditional lecture
and blackboard approaches that have served them well in the past. 
It is recommended that schools invest in multimedia equipment, at
least initially in presentation equipment that can be used by the
instructors for whole class demonstrations. It is also
recommended that training sessions be established for teachers
and instructors enlightening them to the fruits of this new
learning; and that educational institutions make it important and
rewarding to participate in experimentation in the construction
of these interactive multimedia tutorials to enhance and empower
their lesson plans.<p>

Multimedia Equipment</b><p>

     Multimedia has to be understood as the intertwining of
different forms of media for the purpose of creating a more
natural and powerful presentation.  In the case of computer
multimedia, we are looking at combining the elements of text,
sound and graphics.  The element of graphics may include anything
from clip or line art to animation, still photographs or full-motion video.<p>

     In the IBM arena, full multimedia involvement requires an
expensive investment in hardware and software.  Because graphics
and sound require large quantities of data space storage and the
reproduction requires that data to be processed in real time, it
is necessary that the machine's processor be relatively hearty. <p>

     The computer constructed for the purpose of creating this
tutorial used a 486 processor running at 66 megahertz speed. The
Pentium processor would have been selected but it was not
available at the time of construction. At the higher end of the
spectrum, the 486 DX-50 and DX2-66's or the new Pentium, have a
local bus version available. The local bus architecture gives
greater through put of data (with the proper video and 
controller cards) to operate at higher speeds.  The researcher's
486 takes advantage of the local bus architecture.<p>

     Due to the large quantity of data being stored, especially
if audio and video are not being stored on external sourses such
as CD-ROM drives or video disks, a substantial hard drive is a
necessity. Multimedia machines are common today with 300 to 500
megabyte hard drives;  however, the researcher's machine is
equipped with over two gigabytes of storage space.  <p>

     In order to reference this capacity one must consider that
200 pages of double spaced text takes approximately 250 kilobytes
of disk space. <u>War and Peace</u> could fit in under two megabytes. On
the same storage media, it would take approximately the same two
megabytes to store one 8X10 color photograph, one ten-second
sound (wave) file or five seconds of full motion video.<p>

     A hard drive takes care of the permanent storage of  the
programs and data files--but to get that information to the main
processor requires RAM memory. RAM is the memory the processor
uses for temporary storage while processing the data.  When
equipping a multimedia computer with RAM memory, eight megabytes
is the absolute minimum and 16 to 32 megabytes is preferable. The
research machine has 20 megabytes.<p>

     The video element, monitor and supporting computer card,
requires considerable resolution in order to achive graphic or
video realism. A twenty inch monitor capable of producing
1280X1024 pixtals or dots of resolution was chosen.  A video
computer card with the same capabilities was installed that could
utilize the local bus computer architecture for speed. The video
card was equipped with two megabytes of additional memory which
enables it to store the most commonly used pixtals.<p>

     In addition to the basic computer, the researcher added a
sound card. The most common card and the most appropriate for
running varied types of software is the Pro-Audio Spectrum made
by Media Vision.  Since the multimedia work on this tutorial was
not to involve a large number of sound clips or the midi
interface with true CD quality music sampling, a card like the
Multi-Sound by Turtle Beach was not necessary.  Software was
packaged with the sound card that allowed it to interface (talk
to) the authoring system (programming language) used by the
researcher. Rather than adding amplified speakers the researcher
hooked the computer to a stereo system which provided exceptional
results in sound reproduction.<p>

     This basic computer would have been sufficient if the
tutorial was to rely solely on the use of graphics, animation,
clip art and/or still photography images.  Full motion video,
however, requires a source for the video or the digitalizing of
the video; that is, rendering it such that it can be stored in
digital format on the hard drive rather than in the analog format
of the VCR.  One way to approach full-motion video is through the
use of a laser disk player, such as any of the Pioneer series,
and a board in the computer that controls its operation, such as
IBM's Motion Card.  The newer technology is AVI (Audio Visual
Interleaf), and it has recently become available through
Microsoft's Video for Windows. To take full advantage of this AVI
format, the researcher secured an Intel video capture/playback
card.  This product was able capture video from any external
source such as a VCR, cable TV, still video camera or the
standard video camera onto the hard drive of the computer.  It
also made it possible to edit the video sequences or clips and
place them into the multimedia project.  This appeared to be the
least expensive of the video options in terms of external
equipment, but did require a substantial hard drive for storage.<p>

     An increasingly important accessory for multimedia is the
CD-ROM drive.  By adding CD technology, the researcher had access
to video clips and audio files that were imported into the
multimedia project.  The researcher secured a JVC mastering CD-ROM drive which provided the
possibility of pressing a CD-ROM
disk (maximum capacity of 650 megabytes) from the Toolbook
program files and the sound and video files stored on the hard
drive.<p>

     In addition to the hardware considerations discussed thus
far, there were software considerations.  In the IBM area,
multimedia almost requires that Windows be the platform of
choice, as it seems to be the best of the Graphic User Interface
(GUI) platforms and the one for which most other software is
written.  To the Windows base, Toolbook 1.53, a multimedia
construction package, was added.  This is the software that
allowed the researcher to author or write the multimedia program. 
Some standard programs like Microsoft Word for Windows 2.0,
WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows or CorelDraw Version 3.0 were also
necessary so that text and graphics could be manipulated and
inserted into the multimedia project. <p>

Philosophy</b></u><p>

     It must first be understood that the reason or purpose for
all newspaper layout and design is to communicate information to
the reader.  Just getting words to the paper is not enough today. 
People are bombarded with printed matter in the form of junk mail
and memos on a daily basis at the office and they are at the same
time bombarded with high-tech images in the form of movies,
television, and graphic representations that jump out and command
attention.  It therefore is the purpose of design and layout to
structure words and visual elements in such a way that they
communicate most effectively to the reader who, in today's world,
has a constant flow of written information in front of him or
her.  The newspaper in today's world is competing with more
graphically oriented presentations, such as T.V. news and
editorials, that talk to the reader on more than the intellectual
level of the written word.<p>

<p>

<u><b>Design History</b></u><p>

     In the early days of the 19th Century, journals, newspapers
and periodicals looked like books.  The first newspapers were
text driven and utilized very small type.  By the end of the
century, <u>Harper's Weekly</u> and <u>Leslie's Illustrated</u> (these were
picture magazines), used mechanically engraved photographs.  By
the early 1920's <u>The New Yorker</u> came into existence, and to this
day has retained its very dry, highly concentrated text motif,
only broken by the occasional hilarious cartoon.  The reader
reaction to <u>The New Yorker</u> is: "If nothing else is going on, the
writing must be good!"  <p>

     By the '30s, this high concentration of text was changing.
An example of this style today would be <u>The Wall Street Journal</u>.
But in general with the introduction of movies and other high
speed graphic bombardment, magazines started to stress the
picture motif, and newspapers had whole picture sections.  A new
idea appeared:  the "photo story."  During the '40s and '50s, the
introduction of photolithographic offset printing opened up a
whole new arena of magazine and newspaper production.  Anything
that could exist on a two-dimensional sheet of paper could be
reproduced in newspaper or magazine format.  If you could write
it, draw it, photograph it, or typeset it, you could reproduce
it; and with the aid of the Exacto knife, each piece could be
moved around.  A new era of design blossomed.  In the '60s and
'70s, T.V. replaced the magazine as a photojournalistic purveyor
of information, and the magazine role seemed to be the one more
narrowly focused on specific topics.  Newspapers had to vie with
TV and radio to provide current and general news to the public.
Layout became synonymous with systematic constructivist design
principles; pages were divided into rectangular units and
arranged according to a grid.<p>

     By the end of the '80s, desktop publishing had appeared on
the scene, freeing printed matter from a more classic design. 
For over 500 years, people had worked with the physical
constraints of typesetting lead, and these physical constraints
have created an enduring print aesthetic.  The new technology has
changed this, but the aesthetic and the tradition have remained
in the minds of the reader.  Today, virtually anything can be
done on the printed page and, in fact, the sure sign of a new
newspaper or magazine entering the market and the energetic use
of desktop publishing freedoms is a newspaper where this classic
print aesthetic has been broken. (See figure 11, this text is in
the scroll window in the center of the screen.)<p>

<p>

<b><u>Design</b></u><p>

     One important element of design is design pattern.  This is
the visual style used to present news and features on a day-to-day basis.  It is not news itself, but
the way in which the news
articles and visual elements are presented.  This affects
everything from the typefaces, the size and positioning of
headlines, to the style of photography.  One newspaper, for
example, might have a large photograph or a collage of
photographs dominating the top section of the front page and be
very soft or light on articles.<p>

     The second element of design structure contains a number of
elements, the most important of which is typography:  the style
and arrangement of type on the page.  When we refer to
typography, we are talking about the readability of the type on
the page and what character it portrays, the unspoken link
between the newspaper and its readers.  The language of
typography is that of size and character as well as of style.  A
headline might be referred to as a 32 point type at a 20 pica
column width, or three and one-half inches.   Under the style of
type, there are hundreds of different typefaces.  The most common
ones for newspapers are <u>Times,</u> <u>Century,</u> <u>Bookman,</u>
<u>Garamond,</u>
<u>Helvetica,</u> and <u>Franklin Gothic.</u>  Some of these are Serif faces,
those which have a fine cross-stroke at the top and bottom of the
lower-case characters (This lettering was designed to be
reminiscent of Medieval scribes using a broad pen to create their
letters); others are sans-Serif, which are characters without the
cross-strokes.  Within the typeface, such as <u>Times</u>, which is a
Serif typeface, there are different densities or weights to the
typefaces, such as light, medium, bold, extra-bold, or ultra, as
well as condensed or extended, which vary the look.  Within these
same typefaces, there are also variations in point size (the
height of the characters).  Most newspapers are set in eight and
one-half to ten point type, and often they have extra leading
(pronounced leding) which is the white space between each line of
type.  Adding to the variance and intricacy of the typographic
language are additional readability factors, such as the optimum
width of the column and the color of the type.  For best
readability, a column width should be 14 pica or two and one-third inches.  Type set in less than
six pica column widths is
more difficult to read because of the rapid shifting of the eye
from one line to the next, as is type set in 18 pica width, where
additional concentration is necessary to stay on the right line
while addressing an often-confusing newspaper.  Added to these
elements, there are other typographic treatments which can have a
negative effect on readability.  They are reverse type (white
type on a dark or black background) and overprinting (where the
type is printed over some other graphic or picture with a
variance in background shading).  Color is another element more
recently added to the variations in typography, but one should be
aware that black type on a white or light background is most
readable.  Dark type on a dark background or light type on a
light background decrease readability.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Newspaper Design Considerations</b></u><p>

     A Newspaper Advertising Bureau Study on newspapers between
the years 1983 and 1987 indicated that 82 percent had altered
their design through the use of different typefaces, and/or the
use of graphics, color, or layout.  These changes were felt
necessary by the editors to change to a more modern look or to
capture a greater market or increase reader satisfaction.  It
should be noted, however, that to change the content or look of a
paper too drastically or rapidly often has the reverse effect. 
The redesign of a newspaper must start with the philosophy of the
newspaper.  Will  the newspaper concentrate on sensational issues
and have big headlines and lots of color?  Is a classic look more
in line with in-depth editorials and a more conservative outlook? 
There are many issues to be resolved before one can approach the
design element.  For instance, if one was approaching a more
conservative readership, one might design the newspaper with a
distinct set of hierarchy and proportion, keeping a major story
at the top of the page, lesser stories progressing down each
page.  In an effort to be more conservative, the character of the
newspaper might be understated:  no sensationalism, limited use
of color splashes, etc.  A typical serif typeface such as <u>Roman,</u>
<u>Times Roman,</u> or New Times Roman would be adopted.  Another
consideration might be the traffic on the page:  are there a
number of stories, a number of information elements, a number of
pictures or graphics that keep the reader's eye moving, keep the
reader interested in seeking more information?  Possibly this is
attuned to the more aggressive readership of today--people not as
interested in reading a long editorial treatment of a story, but
rather culled out facts, to get a quick synopsis of the main
points.  Vertical movement is of course important--not only the
concentration of where the eye moves down the paper, what areas
it picks up and concentrates on, but also the movement from the
upper left corner to the lower right so that the entire paper can
be scanned and no elements are lost.  Symmetry must be
considered, especially in a more conservative newspaper where
quiet elegance is sought.  The improper interjection of color
spots or large graphics that don't lead the reader's eye
movements or are not properly balanced can be distracting.  And,
finally, the consistency throughout the paper from section to
section and page to page and also from issue to issue is
important.  The reader needs to gain a sense of comfort that a
particular format will be encountered at the same spot and in the
same way day in and day out.<p>

     Readership studies have shown that readers want more
consistency and organization, that when familiar with a
newspaper, they don't necessarily read the first page first, and
that advertisements are indeed an important element of any
commercial newspaper.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Layout</b></u><p>

     How does one then take these design goals, these philosophic
understandings, and make them work in the layout or editing
process where the stories, the photographs, the headlines, and
the graphics are placed on the individual page?  A number of
considerations must be adhered to.  First, these design goals,
the philosophy of the paper, must be adhered to in every headline
that is laid down and every story that is placed in a particular
place on the page.  Second, the basic rules of layout must be
adhered to.  Readers must be comfortable.  They are asked to read
this newspaper, to spend time with it, and that becomes a more
difficult task as inconsistency and confusion present themselves
on the page.  Third, in most commercial newspapers the element of
uniqueness rises to become important in the layout of the design. 
There is a constant effort on the part of the editors and the
design team to lay out the newspaper in such a way that it not
only conforms with the other elements but becomes a unique
statement that it is different from other newspapers.<p>

     Well, what are these elements of layout that control the
process?  Probably the most universal is that the front page has
the main news, the lead stories and a listing of what might
follow.  Remember, every section has a front page, and these
interior sections should follow the same format.  Element two of
layout design demands that every page have autonomy in and of
itself and that it flow properly from the top to the bottom.  The
caveat here is that interior spreads, for instance pages two and
three, are often treated by readers as a single unit.  On the
front page, the top half (that which comes above the fold when
the newspaper is folded and in the newsstands) is called "above
the fold."  This is the most visible and important section of the
newspaper, for it is what everyone sees if they look briefly at
the newspaper.  And, of course, one of the elements found on all
newspapers in the above the fold front section is the name plate
and banner of the newspaper designating the name of the
newspaper, the date, and other important generic information. 
Traditionally, the top story of the day is placed in the upper
right hand corner and the top visual on the left; however, there
is no hard and fast rule to that effect.  Other items that might
be found above the fold would be an index of other key stories or
elements within the newspaper.  In most cases, the front page
above the fold should remain fairly consistent from day to day. 
On the front page as well as inside pages, the top headline or
banner headline should be the largest, and stories of
progressively less importance should have lesser-size headlines
going down the page.  Each page should have a folio line at the
top designating the page number and date.  In some newspapers,
different types of headlines are used.  A deck headline is one
that runs under the main headline.  A hammer is a one- or two-word callout that is placed next to
or above the main headline
and set in a heavy typeset.  A kicker is a two- to five-word
summary of the story that runs above the main headline but in
most cases is set in a smaller point size.  These three types of
special headline maintain varied degrees of popularity and have
gone in and out of vogue over the years.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Dominant Visual Elements</b></u><p>

     Most newspapers today feature large graphic illustrations,
maps, or other visual elements on virtually every page of the
newspaper.  Whenever a visual element is used above the fold,
normally in the a corner, it is considered the dominant element
of the page.  On the front page, this is usually a photograph
pertaining to the dominant story and is large enough to dominate
the page.  Spot color is also used as the dominant visual
element; a headline in color or a screen of a text or photograph
or graphics using color draw a reader's attention to that area
first.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Balance</b></u><p>

     Traditional editors have used a balanced approach where
everything that appears on the right side of the page will also
appear on the left side of the page, but this is less in fashion
today.  A second type of layout is the "brace" layout where one
story dominates the page.  A quadrant layout utilizes a page
split into four equal and equally dominant quarters.  A circus
layout allows any number of variant typefaces, pictures, and spot
colors to invade the layout; and a modular layout requires a
rectangular rather than square dog leg or ragged shaped news
elements to be used.  All of these layout designs have been used
effectively through the years, and they all beg the question of
symmetry.  The traditional balanced and modular designs are
symmetrical newspapers, normally divided into some number of
parts and equally balanced.  In the asymmetric approach, some of
the boxes of text or news items are of different shapes, some
even dog-legged and, in most instances, they are only controlled
by their rated importance on the page.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Column Widths</b></u><p>

     Today most newspapers use five or six column formats with
each column being 12 to 15 pica in width.  Between each column
there is a gutter, a white space or column rule that separates
the text of one column from another.  These white spaces or rules
are normally less than one pica in width.  The standard width of
the columns, as mentioned earlier, is 14 pica, and the variance
of too narrow or too wide a column seems to tire the reader and
decrease the comfort level.<p>

<p>

<b><u>White space</b></u><p>

     The white space area in a newspaper adds to an uncluttered
look and helps focus the attention on those headlines or those
visuals that are surrounded by the white space.  The white space
becomes a layout design item itself, and there are a few rules
regarding the use of white space area and the design elements
that it surrounds.  First, you must treat it as an element on the
page like the other <p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>

typographic and visual elements; you must plan for its existence. 
Second, generally, it is most effective used on the outside edges
of a page.  Third, white space should be used in unequal elements
and they should not be small elements of white space, but larger
in size.  And, similar to other visual elements, small size
visuals or small size photographs, graphics, headlines, or white
space elements do not provide the effect that larger, more open
and airy ones do.  Fourth, a variation in the shape of the
graphic elements, be it white space, a photograph, or a graphic,
adds to the design element. Figure 12 shows an example of trapped
white space that appears as a screen after the textual
discussion.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Numbers</b></u><p>

     How many graphic elements, stories, headlines, and how much
white space should be used per page is open to conjecture, and
exceptions to the rule are numerous.  A minimum that might be
suggested would be two visual elements (photographs, graphs,
graphics), with one being above the fold and one below, and no
less than four stories.  It is important to realize, however,
that the exceptions are numerous and effective.  Variety is an
important element.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Newspaper Size</b></u><p>

     A broadsheet newspaper typically is 21 1/2 inches long by 13
inches wide.  Tabloids, on the other hand, are 13 inches by 11
inches.  When doing the layout for a tabloid, less material will
fit on a page; most tabloid front pages offer major headlines,
possibly a single large visual element, and callouts or teasers
for what is to follow.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Design Aids</b></u><p>

     In an effort to provide the best layout possible, many
studies have been done to follow the reader's eye movement.  In a
1988 issue of <u>The Chronicles</u>, eye tracking research findings were
presented and included:  (1) in a broadsheet, readers scan the
top half and bottom half of section fronts without folding the
page; (2) in papers they are familiar with, readers tend to
process more headlines than photos; in unfamiliar papers, they
tend to process equal amounts;  (3) readers typically process a
page from left to right; (4) inside facing pages are typically
viewed as one unit; (5) readers make note of about half of all
section-front photographs and one-fourth of inside-page
photographs; (6) banner headlines continue to be the most likely
entry point; (7) regular readers appear to ignore promotion boxes
more than do readers who have never seen the paper before.<p>

<p>

<b><u>Design Exercises</b></u><p>

(1)  Take the elements on the left, and lay out a front page in
the white space on the right hand side of the computer screen. 
Click on each headline, story block, graphic, sidebar, banner,
nameplate, etc., and drag them over to the white page, releasing
the mouse button when they are properly placed on the page.  From
the sizes of the headlines and the size and strengths of the
photos or graphics, can you tell what needs to be above the fold
versus below the fold?  <p>

(2)  Evaluate the next three successive pages for dominant visual
elements.  Where are they on the page?  Why are they dominant? 
What changes might you suggest?  Answer blocks are provided on
the right side of each newspaper page.<p>

(3)  On this above the fold newspaper page, click on any area of
the newspaper and in the text box that appears, type the letter
corresponding to the appropriate description of this graphic
layout item.<p>

     (a)  dateline       (g)  banner    <p>

     (b)  byline         (h)  index     <p>

     (c)  cutline        (i)  deck <p>

     (d)  tint box       (j)  reefer or promo box <p>

     (e)  spot color     (k)  nameplate or flag        <p>

     (f)  summary box         <p>

(4)  Compare and contrast the use of headshots versus portraits
in conjunction with a story.  When should just the face be used,
and when should a portrait?  Click on the appropriate headshot or
portrait and drag each into the block provided in the newspaper
to provide the most appropriate and sensitive continuity.<p>

(5)  Move one of the headlines on the left side of the page into
the banner headline spot on the front page of the newspaper. 
Think of the considerations regarding the size, typeface, and
page integrity when making your decision.<p>

<H2>Biographical Information</H2> 
<ul>
<H3>I grew up in Seattle, and practiced law there for over 20
years after getting a BA in History at Stanford University, serving
two years' active duty as an officer in the US Navy, and earning my
JD at Harvard Law School.<BR><BR>

Then I started teaching lawrelated courses parttime at
community colleges, and discovered that my true love was teaching. 
In 1989 I decided to switch careers, and the best job available in
my area of expertise was here at Saddleback College.  So I moved to
Mission Viejo to join this faculty as a fulltime professor for
Fall Semester 1989.  Best decision I've ever made.<BR><BR>

I teach Business Law (LGL/BUS 12A), Legal Environment of
Business (LGL/BUS 14), and legal research and writing courses in
the Legal Assisting Program.  I'm also Chair of the Legal Studies
Department.  I'd be happy to answer your questions about these
courses and programs.<BR><BR>

(But you won't be able to reach me from midJune, 1996, to the
end of July, 1997, because I'll be on sabbatical in Zagreb,
Croatia.  There I'll be coordinating the Croatian activities of the
Central and East European Law Initiative (CEELI), a program of the
American Bar Association that provides free consulting services by
American legal experts who assist the former communist countries in
reforming their legal systems.).<H3>

<H2>Biographical Information</H2> 
<ul>

<H4>I obtained my A.A. degree in Business Administration from East Los Angeles Junior College; my B.S. degree in Business Education from the University of California, Los Angeles; and my M.A. degree in Education from California State University, Los Angeles.
<BR><BR>
I taught Business Education on the high school level for 11 years.  I was one of the original faculty when Saddleback opened in 1968.  I have taught many computer courses including Introduction to Computer Information Systems, BASIC, COBOL, and FORTRAN programming, Microsoft Works, Microsoft Word, LOTUS (both DOS and WINDOWS versions), and the Professional Series (Write File, Graph, and Plan).  
<BR><BR>
I have authored many lab manuals and study guides which have been published for many of the classes I have taught--including word processing spreadsheets, and integrated software.
<BR><BR>
After teaching at Saddleback for 27 years, I retired in May, 1995 at which time I received the Computer Information Management Recognition Award for Distinguished Contributions.
<BR><BR>
I am currently teaching computer classes part-time as an Associate Faculty member.  As I love teaching and working with my students, I hope to continue teaching part-time for a long time.<H4>

<BR><BR><BR>
<H2>Biographical Information</H2> 
<ul>
<li><H2>EDUCATION<H2>
<H4> My four undergraduate education years were spent at California State Polytechnic
 University at Pomona (Cal Poly), and received my B.S. Degree in Business
 Administration in 1964.  I earned a Standard Secondary Teaching Credential in
 Business Education and Speech at California State University at Los Angeles in 1966.
 My M.A. Degree in Speech-Communication was received from San Jose State
 University in 1976. 1 was awarded a California Community College Credential in
 Technologies and Applied Sciences in 1983.
<H4>
<hr size=8 align =center width=75%>

<li><H2>EMPLOYMENT<H2>
<H4> I taught high school speech and debate and coached forensics at Riverside
 Polytechnic High School from 1966-1969. After moving to Monterey             County in
 Northern California, I taught high school speech, coached the forensic       team, and
 taught typing and business mathematics at Alisal High School in Salinas,    California
 from 1969-1979.        Having taken community college courses in computer
 programming at Hartnell College in Salinas and at Cabrillo College           in Aptos,
 California, I was fortunate to begin a new career in contract programming, which led
 to a full-time employment position as a Programmer/Analyst for Mountain Fuel
 Supply Company in Salt Lake City, Utah from 1979-1981.  Upon returning to
 California to be near my mother, who was being treated for terminal cancer, I started
 work at Hughes Aircraft Company in Fullerton, California, later transferred to the
 Long Beach office of Hughes.  While at Hughes, (1981-1984) 1 was responsible for
 the user-application hot-line, provided new-hire training classes, preparing the
 materials and teaching the courses.  I also continued computer program development,
 primarily generated programs in a Fourth Generation Language.<H4>
<hr size=8 align =center width=75%>

<li><H2>SADDLEBACK COLLEGE<H2>
<H4>Saddleback College provided an opportunity for me to do what I love the most--to
 teach!  I've been at Saddleback College as a Professor of Computer Information
 Management, Business Science Division, since Fall 1984.  My primary assignment is
 that of instruction in the IMC (Information Management Center), but I generally
 teach at least one class per semester, usually CIM IA (Introduction to Computer
 Information Systems), I believe one of my assets to my students is my practical,
 hands-on industry background training, coupled with my prior and current teaching
 experiences.    I am also a very enthusiastic instructor, approachable, understanding,
 and determined to help my students have a positive learning experience.  On occasion
 I have been known to bring my skills as a magician to the classroom.</H4>

<li><H2>MAGIC IS MY HOBBY<H2>
<H4>   I am an active member of the Academy of Magical Arts, better known publicly as
 the Hollywood Magic Castle; a member of the IBM (International Brotherhood of
 Magicians)- and a member of SAM (Society of American Magicians).  I am available
 to perform magic at parties, banquets, receptions, etc.  My specialty is close-up and
 stand-up parlor magic for adults to children ages eight and on up.  I find that very
 young children don't have sufficient experience with the real world to discern illusion
 from reality.</H4><BR><BR>

<li><H2>PERSONAL BACKGROUND</H2>
<H4> I have been married to the same wonderful wife since 1969 and have three children
 ("My three sons"), born 1976, 1990, and 1992.

<p><b>Assignment Requirements</b></p>



<ul>

<li>Turn in assignments at the beginning of the class on the date due.

&quot;Beginning&quot; means before lecture starts. For students who cannot

attend class on the day assignments are due, assignments may be turned

in EARLY in a file cabinet provided in the IMC (Room BGS-205). Note: I

will pick these up on my way to class the day they are due. Assignments

put in the file after that time will be graded late. Be sure to put the

assignments in the proper drawer; there is one for assignments being turned

in, and one for assignments being returned, as well as one for handouts.

Note that there are folders in these drawers for different professors and

classes. Assignments put in the wrong drawer or folder cannot be treated

received on time. If assignments come in after lecture starts, the policy

labelled &quot;Late Assignments&quot; will be followed.</li>



<li>An assignment will not be accepted in parts.	 For Example: 	Turning

in two hardcopies of an assignment on Tuesday, and turning in more hardcopies

of the same assignment on Wednesday or on Thursday).</li>



<li>All assignments on known days of absence will be due before the absence.

This includes all athletic trips or forensic or music activities or class

field trips.</li>



<li>All assignments must be secured and be attached to a properly filled-out

cover sheet.</li>

</ul>



<p></p>



<p><b>Late Assignments </b></p>



<ul>

<li>	Due dates are shown on this syllabus. Late assignments cannot receive

more than 8 points. No credit will be given for assignments which are received

later than one week after the due date . </li>



<li>	Extra credit must be turned in on the due date. No extra credit points

will be awarded after the due date. </li>



<li>Assignment Warning</li>



<li>	No course grade higher than a &quot;C&quot; may be earned if any of

the ten (10) application software assignments has not been completed.</li>

</ul>



<p></p>



<h3><a name="computers">COMPUTERS TO BE USED</a></h3>



<p>	All assignments must be completed using an IBM or compatible microcomputer.

Students may use the computers in the Information Management Center (IMC)

Room BGS-205. The IMC is usually open during the hours classes are in session;

however, the hours may vary from one semester to the next, depending on

budget constraints. Students should check the sign posted on the front

door of the IMC at the start of the term and make a note of the exact hours

of operation for that term. The IMC hours are: 9:00a - 10:00p (Monday -Thursday);

9:00a - 7:00p (Frdays); 8:00a - 5:00 p (Saturdays). Students having access

to IBM or compatible microcomputers at home or work may use them.</p>



<p>	When you registered for this course, you were also required to enroll

in a computer lab section that meets on specific days and times. Please

note that you may use the lab anytime it is open, as long as there are

computers available, and as long as you don't deprive anyone else the use

of the computer who may be scheduled for that time-slot.</p>



<p>	You need not go to the lab until you have been given assignments in

class.</p>

<H2>Biographical Information</H2>

<UL>
<H2>EDUCATION</H2>

<H2> </H2>

<H4>My love for office work started in a &quot;Steel City&quot; high school
and continued to grow while I attended Indiana State University. After
receiving a Masters degree in Business Education, it was time to move to
a big city--Los Angeles. Doing a tour of duty in a local high school drove
me back to school to acquire credentials for elementary education, counseling
and administrative services. </H4>

<H4>
<HR size=8 align =center width=75%><BR>
</H4>

<H2>INSTRUCTOR EXPERIENCE</H2>

<H2> </H2>

<H4>Computers have been a part of my life since the mid 1970's when I began
a college teaching career at Santa Ana College. This has been an eventful
experience that never stops changing. On a monthly basis there is more
to learn and add to current knowledge. Assisting adult in their effort
to gain vocational skills is an enjoyable adventure that everyone thinks
is so easy. It's not! Trying to diagnosis what buttons students touch to
cause havoc on a computer takes a great deal of experience, knowledge,
and patience. Sharing my knowledge and experience with students is truly
a joy. </H4>

<H4>
<HR size=8 align =center width=75%><BR>
</H4>

<H2>PERSONAL DATA:</H2>

<H2> </H2>

<H4>Living in Mission Viejo for the past 23 years makes me feel like a
native resident. My sons were born and raised with many of the 20 to 60
year old Saddleback students. You will find me friendly, very easy to talk
with and always available to assist you in your effort to learn the software
we teach.<BR>
<BR>
Normally I would tell you tostop by to see me in the Business/General Studies
Building on the 2nd floor, 202. During the Spring of 1996 I will be on
a study leave and not available to share any learning experiences with
you. Look for me in June. </H4>

<H2>Biographical Information</H2> 
<p>
<ul>
<li><H2>EDUCATION<H2>
<H3>Received my B.S. and Secondary Teaching Credential from Cal State University at Los Angeles in Home Economics and Art.  I began my teaching as a substitute in Green Bay, WI. and then Alhambra, CA.  In 1975 I started taking business classes at Saddleback when, in 1987, I was offered a teaching position in the Business Science Division.  In 1992, I completed a Masters program in Computer Training and Learning from Nova University, Fort Lauderdale, FL.<H3>
<hr size=8 align =center width=75%>
<br>

<li>Class Information<br>
<H3>My goal here at Saddleback is to provide each student with a good learning environment so the student can take advantage of the full capacity of the software package outside of class.  This in hopes that the student will be able to obtain a job, secure a better job, upgrade skills, or transfer to a university  If the student just wants to learn for the sake of learning, that's OK too!<BR><BR>

Presently I teach students to use Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows in three 8-week classes (CIM 216A:  Beginning Spreadsheets, CIM 216B:  Intermediate Spreadsheets, and CIM 216C:  Advanced Spreadsheets).  For the beginning class, I highly suggest that each student come to class with some prior knowledge of computers and Windows to make for a more pleasurable learning experience.  Each week the student will attend 3 hours of lecture and then spend 3 hours in the lab completing the homework.  The lab provides computers and the lab instructors are able to help when a student encounters a problem.<BR><BR>
Both the CIM 216A and CIM 216B classes are suggested for anyone who will create spreadsheets from scratch, will do data input, or plan to transfer to a 4-year university.  <H3>

</OL>

<H4>ASSIGNMENTS AND TESTS:</H4>

<OL>
<LI>There will be lectures to clarify certain areas, elaborate on and supplement
some topics, explain approaches and techniques, and respond to questions
from students.</LI>

<LI>The Socratic Method will be employed which is a questioning technique
between student and instructor which will be utilized to facilitate the
learning process. The object is to fine tune your analytical abilities.</LI>

<LI>Students must complete all reading assignments before class and be
prepared to analyze, in class, the judicial decisions and chapter-end discussion
questions and case problems set forth in the assigned reading.</LI>

<LI>Various cases are assigned for analysis and discussion. The success
of case discussion depends upon the active participation of each student.
This involves communication, not only from instructor to students, but
more importantly, between individual students and from student to instructor.</LI>

<LI>Each student will submit written answers to twelve case problems, approximately
one per week, and will be called on from time to time to present some of
those answers in class. Each case problem will be worth 20 points, resulting
in a total of 240 points.</LI>

<LI>There will be three exams. Each exam will be worth 120 points. Exams
will cover material from both the textbook and lecture. The professor will
not lecture on all details which will be included in the exams. Quizzes
may be given from time to time as the need arises.</LI>

<LI>A class project will be assigned approximately one third of the way
through the course. This written project will worth 200 points. Content,
presentation, grammar, spelling and accurate response to the assignment
given will all contribute to the project's grade. Therefore, the maximum
possible points for this course is 800.</LI>

<LI>Participation in class discussions is encouraged. Mature and alert
contributions to these discussions will constitute an important part of
the final grade. It will not lower a student's final grade and may be taken
into account in borderline cases to raise the final grade. </LI>
</OL>

<H4>POLICIES AND PROCEDURES:</H4>

<P>No makeup exams will be permitted except in cases of major medical or
family emergency, in which case the student must contact the professor
immediately and make arrangements. Students are responsible for knowing
all pertinent information contained in the Saddleback College Catalog and
Class Schedules.<BR>
<BR>
</P>

<H5>Records Information:</H5>

<P>Last day for dropping class without &quot;W&quot; or signing up for
Credit/No Credit is 09/20/96. Last day to drop a class with a &quot;W&quot;
grade is 11/13/96. It is the student's responsibility to drop a course.
The professor will not document a &quot;W&quot; unless the student follows
the required procedure. A grade of &quot;F&quot; will be given for undocumented
dropouts.</P>

<P>According to the official Policies and Procedures of Saddleback College,
&quot;cheating or plagiarism in connection with an academic program&quot;
is prohibited and students &quot;may be disciplined...for the following
cause.&quot; In the rare instance that a student in this course cheats
or plagiarizes material, that student will receive a grade of &quot;F&quot;
for this course. Plagiarism is defined as copying from a written source
verbatim without putting the material in quotes and citing the source.
Included is the presentation of work copied from another student as your
own.</P>

<P>The attached schedule is subject to change. You are responsible for
keeping up with any assignment or schedule change. </P>

<H4>GENERAL COMMENTS:</H4>

<P>Attendance Policy - Payment and time expended for this course suggests
that you want value in return. The old truism applies --- what you get
depends on what you put in. Reading alone is not sufficient but must be
supplemented with class participation, or at least listening. Active listening
also contributes to the success of the class. Attendance is vital to the
class, and your grade for class participation will be a reflection of your
attendance as well as your participation.</P>

<P>Statement on English Language Proficiency - In the evaluation of all
academic exercises, the quality of English will be considered. Students
are expected to use English that is grammatically correct and logically
sound. Failure to meet such standards may result in a lowered grade.</P>

<P>Academic Integrity - All students have an inherent responsibility to
uphold the principles of academic integrity, and to support each other
and the faculty in maintaining a classroom atmosphere that is conducive
to orderly and honest conduct.<BR>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT SIZE=+3>RICHARD P. A. LEWIS </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#914B1F"><FONT SIZE=+4>FAQS </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How long have you been teaching? </FONT></B></P>

<P>A. I first taught English to private students in Barcelona, Spain in
1972 before taking a teacher training course at Liverpool University, UK.
In 1977 I taught Physics, Chemistry and Natural Science to high school
students in the dock-lands of South London, UK. My first full time position
in California was in 1986 as an instructor at the Orange County Marine
Institute (OCMI) where I taught Marine Biology, Maritime History and Chaparral
Ecology. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Why did you come to America and settle in Orange
County? </FONT></B></P>

<P>A. In 1983, on a visit to friends in Seal Beach, I visited OCMI, and
was attracted by what I saw as its mission teaching students about the
marine environment, particularly the Gray Whales. The location and climate
were very attractive when compared with south London. I arrived in south
Orange County in 1985. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Why did you decide to go to Law School? </FONT></B></P>

<P>A. I was taking general education courses at Saddleback College with
a view to obtaining a academic qualifications recognized in California,
I was considering CSU Fullerton at the time, when I saw a Western State
University College of Law flyer. Believing a Law degree would enhance my
career as an administrator at OCMI, I applied and was accepted in 1989.
</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. What areas of law does your practice focus on? </FONT></B></P>

<P>A. Since opening my own practice in 1993, I have focused on Business
Law and Real Estate Law. With this in mind, I am a member of the Orange
County Bar Association (OCBA) Business and Commercial Law, and Real Estate
Law sections. </P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Would you advise a &quot;returning student&quot;
to go to law school? </FONT></B></P>

<P>A. When considering the dramatic step of attending law school, I believe
it is important to consider the effect such a decision will have on the
following: Your family - the time commitment is severe! Your current employer
- there may be no place for a budding attorney in the firm you currently
work for. </P>

<P>Your present financial situation - tuition is very expensive. Your need
for income during school - there is likely to be a conflict between work
and school, no matter how &quot;understanding&quot; your boss is and the
average law clerk earns $7 an hour if you are lucky </P>

<P>Your income after school - here in Orange County there are too many
lawyers chasing too few jobs and the situation is unlikely to change in
the near future, say 10 years , so expecting to repay student loans from
a salary is optimistic. If you have someone to bankroll you for say 5 years
while you establish your own practice this may not be a problem for you.
</P>

<P>Your personality - if you like challenges for their own sake, go for
it, it is one of the toughest things you can do, and on acceptance to the
Bar, you join an elite group, sharing the potential to guide society few
as other professions can. . </P>

<title>Manhattan College: WHAT'S A JASPER?</title>
<meta name="CreatedBy" content="WP Internet Publisher 6.1">

<body>
<h1>WHAT'S A JASPER?</h1>

<H3><img src="/icons/brjasper.jpg" alt="Brother Jasper" align="middle">Brother Jasper</H3>
<p>

<p>

The unique nickname of Manhattan College's athletic teams, the Jaspers, comes from one of the
College's most memorable figures, Brother Jasper of Mary, F:S.C., who served at the College in
the late l9th century.<p>

<p>

One of the greatest achievements of Brother Jasper was that he brought the then little-known sport of baseball to Manhattan College and became the team's first coach. Since Brother was also the Prefect of Discipline, he supervised the student fans at Manhattan College baseball games while also directing the team itself.<p>

 <p>

During one particularly warm and humid day when Manhattan College was playing a semi-pro
baseball team called the Metropolitans, Brother Jasper noticed the Manhattan students were
becoming restless and edgy as Manhattan came to bat in the seventh inning of a close game. To
relieve the tension, Brother Jasper called time-out and told the students to stand up and stretch for
a few minutes until the game resumed.<p>

 <p>

Since the College annually played the New York Giants in the late 1880s and into the 1890s at the
old Polo Grounds, the Manhattan College practice of the "seventh inning stretch" spread into the
major leagues, where it has now become a time-honored custom practiced by millions of fans
annually. <p>

</b><h2><center>IMPORTANT INFORMATION</h2>
</center>
This Catalogue contains the general information necessary for those seeking
admission into the programs offered by the Graduate Division of Manhattan
College. It presents the curricular requirements for the various Master degrees.<p>

Applicants should be aware that the courses listed under each program are not
offered every year but are offered in a cycle over a five year period, the time
allotted for the completion of all requirements for the degree.<p>

Because the majority of students matriculating for the degree are attending
part-time (confer the enrollment statistics at the end of this catalogue), it is
impossible to indicate the academic session when each course is expected to be
offered. However, a separate printed schedule is published approximately two
months in advance of every session (fall, spring, summer) detailing which courses
are to be offered, the days, times, rooms and professors.<p>

The College reserves the right to withdraw or modify any of the courses, costs or
programs listed in this catalogue, to cancel any course or program for which it
deems registration insufficient, usually less than ten registrants, to make any
other changes which it considers necessary or desirable.<p>

<h3><center>NOTICE</h3>
</center>
Students are ultimately responsible for knowing the policies of the Graduate Division and observing all the
regulations which affect their academic status. This catalogue is effective September 1, 1995 until August 31, 1997.
Ordinarily, students are obligated to fulfill the requirements for a degree as stated in the catalogue effective at the
time of their beginning a graduate program.<p>

<p>

<h3><center>TITLE IX OF THE EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF
1972</h3>
<h3>PROHIBITING SEX DISCRIMINATION IN
EDUCATION</h3>
</center>
<p>

Manhattan College does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its educational programs or activities, and is
required by Title IX Regulations for the Educational Amendments of 1972 and Part 86 of the Regulations of
the Department of Health, Education and Welfare not to so discriminate. This requirement not to discriminate
in educational programs and activities extends to employment therein.<p>

<p>

<h3><center>REHABILITATION ACT OF 1973</h3>
</center>
Manhattan College does not discriminate on the basis of handicap against any qualified handicapped persons,
by excluding them from participation in, denying them the benefits of any college program or activity, or
otherwise subjecting them to discrimination.<p>

<p>

Inquiries about admissions on all programs should be addressed to:<p>

</center>
<p>

	 <b>A</b>n organizations overall success and economic prosperity depend on trust. A

<h3><i>The Ethics Strategy Group</i></h3>
<p>

	The Manhattan College Center for Professional Ethics provides conferences and
resources to assist professionals in the public and private sectors. This service
embodies the Manhattan College tradition of quality education, values and
principles. The College is committed to the continuing education of its own larger
community--its graduates--as well as the regional professional community. The focus
of this commitment is to assist professionals in practice with the many and
diverse ethical issues they face. To take on such a task is to offer the
practical, problem-oriented education that is a noted characteristic of Manhattan
College. It is likewise, a tradition rooted in the educational philosophy and
practice of John Baptist de La Salle, founder of the Brothers of the Christian
Schools.<p>

	To accomplish this aim, the Center offers the services of the Ethics Strategy
Group (ESG) composed of educators and practitioners, all specialists with an
expertise in education, ethics, law, as well as private and public sector
management. This group will<p>

<p>


<ul>
  <li><i>Assist individuals and organizations in resolving ethical dilemmas by offering
options that maintain and enhance the integrity of the person and the larger
group.</li>
</ul>
<p>


<ul>
  <li>Develop custom-designed training programs and conferences to enhance sensitivity
to ethical standards in an organization.</i></li>
</ul>

<i>The Center for Professional Ethics: Response to Change</i></h3>
<p>

	Change is a hallmark of modern professional life. Automated industries, corporate
downsizing, global financial systems, the worldwide web and the internet, genetic
engineering, and the struggle for equality by women and minorities have raised
profound ethical questions. Such transformations brought about by advances in
science and technology, work specialization, and social evolution have created a
crisis in values. In response to developments such as these, Manhattan College
established the Center for Professional Ethics in 1984.<p>

	Focusing explicitly on professional ethics, the Center is founded on a general
concern for values and ethics. Specific problems facing practitioners in business,
finance, education, engineering, law, medicine, nursing and other professions
occupy a significant place in the work of the Center. Consequently, issues such
as professional identity and responsibility, the rights of patients, institutional
and corporate responsibility, and the interaction between private and public
sectors are raised. On a more fundamental level, the justification for ethical
inquiry, as well as the enduring questions of meaning and purpose for the
individual and society are also explored.<p>

	Located in New York City, the Center draws upon the expertise of the academic,
business, engineering, finance, legal and medical communities in the metropolitan
area, as well as the resources provided by the administration, faculty, alumni and
alumnae of Manhattan College. <p>

<h2><center>Welcome Back</a></h2>
</center>
This summer was a hectic one for the Computer Center.  As many of you know, the campus network was
upgraded and expanded to enable the College to deploy data services to the students in the residence halls
this fall.  <b>Yes, students can now connect their own networkable desktop or notebook computers directly
to the campus network via a high speed data link similar to that found in the computer labs and faculty
offices.</b>  Additional hardware, including three file servers, was also purchased and installed to support this
"ResNet" initiative.  Check the Web: <a href="http://www.manhattan.edu/resnet">http://www.manhattan.edu/resnet</a> for current status.<p>

A summer edition of <i>THE JASPER NET </i>newsletter (published for faculty and staff) detailing most of the
network changes, was mailed to faculty at their homes in early July.  Copies were also circulated to all College
offices for distribution internally.  Much of our network expansion work was still in progress at that time - and
still continues today!<p>

This issue of Computer Center News is intended to provide information on Academic Computing issues.<p>

<a name="Official Name for Campus Network"><HR WIDTH=80%><A HREF="#Index">Go up to index</A><p>

<p>

<h2><center>Official Name for Campus Network</a></h2>
</center>
<p>

This summer Manhattan College's campus network was officially named <b>JasperNet</b>.<p>

<p>

<a name="Class Directories"><HR WIDTH=80%><A HREF="#Index">Go up to index</A> <h3></h3>
<h2><center>Class Directories</a></h2>
</center>
Over the past few years, many faculty have begun utilizing class directories as a mechanism for making class
materials available to students.  Upon request, an instructor is provided with a class directory on the G drive of
the file server where the NetWare account is located.  There are two files servers for faculty/staff accounts: one
(formerly MCS1) serves staff and classrooms / labs on the lower campus; the other (formerly MCS2) serves
staff and classrooms / labs on the lower campus.  <b>Students accessing the network from classrooms / labs
in the Research and Learning Center can "read" from Class Directories of Instructors with offices on
the lower campus.  The arrangement for the upper campus works similarly, with the appropriate
directories available to students in the DeLasalle Labs. <p>

</b>Due to network software licensing restrictions and other considerations, we are currently unable to make class
directories on one file server available to ALL OTHER NETWORK APPLICATION FILE SERVERS on the
expanded network.  Therefore,<b> a student must be in a location which directly accesses the instructor's
file server in order to use such files.</b><p>

We are investigating ways to best expand this service in the future.  Unfortunately, time has not permitted us
to put a new mechanism in place for the Fall semester.<p>

There are currently several other methods available to instructors for "delivering" class materials.  These
methods are more general and do not require that  students be physically located on campus to access the
material.  One way is by using Pegasus Mail's Distribution List and Attachment Features.  Another is via
Manhattan College's World Wide Web server <a href="http://www.manhattan.edu">(http://www.manhattan.edu)</a> - some instructors have
courseware here.  You can find a listing of these at <a href="http://www.manhattan.edu/courses/on-line/index.html">http://www.manhattan.edu/courses/on-line/index.html</a>.<p>

<h3><i><center></i></h3>
</center>

<table border width=100% cellpadding=5>
<tr><td><h3><center>Accessing Class Directories</h3>
<tr><td></center>
Students wishing to access class directories of instructors with offices in the
upper campus <b><i>MUST</i></b> access them from one of the public labs in the upper
campus (DLS).  Students wishing to access those of instructors with offices in
the lower campus <b><i>MUST</i></b> access them from one of the public labs in the lower
campus (RLC).<p>

If you wish to work with these files at another location, download the files to your
own floppy.</table>

<p>

<a name="Student E-Mail Accounts"><A HREF="#Index">Go up to index</A><p>

<h2><center>Student E-Mail Accounts</a></h2>
</center>
NetWare E-Mail Accounts for students new to Manhattan College will be available during the week of
September 16.  New accounts, as well as those for returning students who never picked up their accounts, can
be picked up in RLC Room 101 weekdays between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m.  After hours, please
contact the Student Consultant in RLC Room 103.<p>

<p>

<a name="POP Mail Services"><HR WIDTH=80%><A HREF="#Index">Go up to index</A><p>

<h2><center>POP Mail Services</a></h2>
</center>
We are proud to announce the availability of POP (Post Office Protocol) mail services to students, faculty, and
staff with NetWare e-mail accounts.  POP mail services will enable e-mail accounts to be accessed from
outside the Novell portion of the JasperNet network.  These services will be especially useful to NetWare e-mail
users whose computers are not completely compatible with the Novell network (e.g., Windows95, MacOS,
OS/2), and for users who wish to access their accounts from off-campus.<p>

<h3><strong>To use POP mail services, your applications software must be
configured with the following settings:</strong></h3>
<p>

<pre>	<b>Mail Server Names:</b>
		POP Mail Server:	<b>pop03.manhattan.edu</b>
		SMTP Mail Server:	<b>smtp.manhattan.edu</b>
	<b>POP Usernames</b> (the complete NetWare NDS UserName and Context must
be specified):
		Staff/faculty:		<b>&lt;username&gt;.mc</b>
		Students:		<b>&lt;username&gt;.student.mc</b>
</pre>
Applications which support the POP mail protocol include Pegasus Mail, Netscape
Navigator, PINE, and Eudora.<p>

<p>

<a name="Setting Web Browser Preferences"><HR WIDTH=80%><A HREF="#Index">Go up to index</A><p>

<h2><center>Setting Web Browser Preferences</a></h2>
</center>
<center></center>
<p>

In order to use certain features of Web browsers, you may need to specify Preferences inside the browser.  
Preferences are typically specified in the <b>Options</b> menu, and may vary from browser to browser and even from
version to version of the same browser.<p>

<p>

<pre><b>E-Mail:  </b>To use e-mail, you must first specify your <b>Identity</b> and <b>Mail
Server</b>.

<b>	Netscape:</b>	Select<b> Mail and News Preferences...</b>
			For <b>Server Preferences</b>, specify <i><b>Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server</b></i> as
				 <b>smtp.manhattan.edu</b>
			For<b> <i>Identity</i></b>, provide your <b>name</b> and <b>e-mail address</b>.

<b>	Mosaic:</b>		Select <b>Preferences...</b>
			Enter the above information in the <b>Services</b> section.

<b>News:</b>  To use news, you must first specify a news server.

	Manhattan College's News (NNTP) Server is
		<b>nntp.manhattan.edu</b>
</pre>
<p>

<pre><b>Helper Applications:</b>  If you need to specify a telnet client or another
network application as a "Helper", here's how to find the application:

	Locate the icon in the appropriate network Windows program group.
	Highlight the icon, then select
	<b>Properties...</b> from the Program Manager <b>File</b> menu.
	The location of the application will be listed in the dialog box.
</pre>
<p>

<i><b>NOTE:</b>  If you are having trouble accessing MC's WWW homepage, change the name of the Startup
homepage location from <b>www.mancol.edu </b>to <b>www.manhattan.edu</b> in the browser's<b> Preferences</b>.<p>

<p>

</i><a name="Windows - Monitor Screen"><HR WIDTH=80%><A HREF="#Index">Go up to index</A></a><p>

<i><p>

<h2><center>Having Trouble with Windows Not Fitting
in Your Monitor Screen?</i></h2>
</center>
Unfortunately, we were not able to complete our network Windows
updates when the network operating system was upgraded this summer. 
Network Windows is currently set-up for VGA mode, and accounts
which previously used SVGA setups are inconsistent with this mode. 
As a result, you may not be able to completely view some of the
"bigger" windows/ dialog boxes used in a few applications.  We plan
to resolve this configuration inconsistency as soon as scheduling
permits. <p>

In the meantime, here's <strong>how to move a window or dialog box using
your keyboard</strong>:<p>

If the Control-menu box is not visible (the Control-menu box is the
little box in the upper left corner of the window), use
ALT+SPACEBAR to bring it up.  Select <b>Move</b> from the pop-up menu:
click on it with the mouse; or use the arrow keys to scroll the
list for <b>Move</b>, and press the ENTER key.<p>

If you have done the above properly, the mouse pointer will change
from a single-sided arrow to a four-sided pointer, indicating that
you can move the window in any of 4 directions.  Use the arrow keys
to position the window so that you will be able to see the part of
the window previously missing from your view  - as you move the
window, you will start to see a<i> shadow of the new window position.</i> 
When you have the outline of the new window position where you want
it, use the ENTER key to anchor it there, or click with the mouse.<p>

<p>

<a name="Network Windows Update Plans"><HR WIDTH=80%><A HREF="#Index">Go up to index</A><i><p>

</i><h2><center>AND FINALLY ...</a></h2>
</center>
<p>

Yes, an updated version of network Windows will be released within the next few weeks.  <b>Please note that all
Network application .ini files, will be deleted and replaced.</b>  The exact dates for the update will be posted
to the NetWare login screen.<p>

<h2><a name="General Information">General Information</a></h2>
<h3><a name="The Mission of Manhattan College">The Mission of Manhattan College</a></h3>
At its quarterly meeting of October 23, 1990, The Board of Trustees of Manhattan College
adopted the following statement of Mission:
  <blockquote>Manhattan College, overlooking Van Cortlandt Park in Riverdale, is a private, independent
institution of higher learning which embraces qualified men and women of all faiths, races
and ethnic backgrounds. Established in 1853, the College is founded upon the Lasallian
Catholic tradition of excellence in teaching, respect for individual dignity, and commitment
to social justice, inspired by the innovator of modern pedagogy, John Baptist de La Salle.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>The mission of Manhattan College is to provide a contemporary, person-centered
educational experience characterized by high academic standards, reflection on values and
principles, and preparation for a life-long career. This is achieved in two ways: by offering
students programs which integrate a broad liberal education with concentration in specific
disciplines in the arts and sciences or with professional preparation in business, education
and engineering; and by nurturing a caring, pluralistic campus community.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>The learning experience at Manhattan College is enriched by cooperative programs with
other institutions, by postgraduate professional programs and by capitalizing on its location
on the edge of the cultural center and global marketplace that is New York City.
  </blockquote>
<h3><a name="Historical Note">Historical Note</a></h3>
Manhattan College dates its founding from May 1853 when the school, originally established by
the Brothers of the Christian Schools in 1848, moved from Canal Street in lower Manhattan to
what was then known as the Manhattanville section of New York City at 131st Street and
Broadway. In the ten years from 1853 to 1863, the school changed rapidly, adding college-level
courses in 1859 and first using the name Manhattan College in 1861. A Board of Trustees
composed of ten laymen and eight Brothers of the Christian Schools was assembled in 1862 to
petition the Board of Regents and the Legislature of the State of New York to charter a collegiate
institution named Manhattan College. The charter to establish Manhattan College was approved
by the Legislature and issued by the Board of Regents on April 2, 1863. The first catalog of the
newly chartered College stated its goals as follows:
  <blockquote>The <a name="object">object</a> of this institution is to afford the youth of our country the means of acquiring the
highest grade of education attained in the best American universities or colleges. While the
conductors mean that the classical languages shall be thoroughly studied, they have resolved
to give a prominence to the higher mathematics and natural sciences not hitherto received in
any similar institution in this country; thus combining the advantages of a first-class College
and Polytechnic Institute.
  </blockquote>

<p>Thus, in its origins, Manhattan College was an unusual institution. It combined in its sponsoring
Board of Trustees both secular independent members and representatives of the religious teaching
Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools. It also combined in a single collegiate institution
excellence in the traditional liberal arts and sciences and excellence in professional and technical
education.

<p>In 1923, the College moved to its present location in the Riverdale neighborhood of New York
City, bordered by the Hudson River and Van Cortlandt Park where it is able to offer access to the
cultural, educational, business and entertainment opportunities of the City as well as a
self-contained campus environment.

<p>The College continues to realize the objectives stated in its first catalog by maintaining a full range
of programs in the liberal arts and sciences joined with professional programs in engineering,
business, and education. The quality of the undergraduate programs has been demonstrated by the
College's record as one of the nation's leading undergraduate sources of doctorates in the arts,
sciences, engineering and education, and recognized by the establishment of chapters of such
prestigious honor societies as Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and Tau Beta Pi. Similarly, Standard &amp;
Poors ranks the Manhattan College School of Business among the leading undergraduate sources
of managerial and financial leadership in the nation. The College participates in the Consortium of
Liberal Arts Colleges, an organization of the nation's leading research colleges, and in the New
York Cluster of seven colleges and universities supported by the Pew Charitable Trusts for
undergraduate science education (Barnard, Colgate, Cornell, Hamilton, Manhattan, St. Lawrence
and Union).

<p>From its beginning, Manhattan College paid particular attention to educating first-generation
college students, and was an early proponent of access to minority students, establishing special
scholarship funds for minority students as early as 1938. Currently, over 26% of the student body
are from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds.

<p>The College became <a name="coeducational">coeducational</a> and accepted its first women undergraduate students in 1973.
Prior to that date, the College had established a cooperative program with the neighboring
College of Mount Saint Vincent which permitted cross-registration and the merging of academic
departments. Currently, women number 44% of the full-time undergraduate student body, 

<p>With the opening of the East Hill Residence Hall in 1990, the College is able to maintain an even
balance between residential and commuting students.

<p>Currently, the College has a student body of approximately 3,125: 2,600 undergraduates (2,350
full-time and 250 part-time) and 525 graduate students. The student-faculty ratio is thirteen to
one.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Recognition and Membership">Recognition and Membership</a></h3>
Manhattan College is chartered and empowered to confer academic degrees by the University of
the State of New York.

<p>It is <a name="Accreditation">accredited</a> by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. The College is
approved by the American Chemical Society for the professional training of chemists and by the
Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation of the American Medical Association
for the professional training of nuclear medicine technologists.

<p>The programs in Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical
Engineering are accredited at the basic level by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.

<p>The College is a member of the Association of American Colleges, the American Council on
Education, the Institute of International Education, the National Catholic Educational
Association, the Association of Urban Universities, the Association of Governing Boards of
Universities and Colleges, the American Association of University Women, the American Society
for Engineering Education, Middle Atlantic Association of Colleges of Business Administration,
the  American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, Association of Continuing Higher
Education, the National Association of College and University Summer Sessions, American
Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, the College Entrance Examination Board, and the
National Commission for Cooperative Education.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Location">Location</a></h3>
The College is situated along Manhattan College Parkway on the heights above Van Cortlandt
Park (242nd Street and Broadway) in the Riverdale section of New York City. It is a short
distance from the 242nd Street station of the Broadway Seventh Avenue Subway, and can be
easily reached from any part of the metropolitan or suburban areas. The exit of the Henry Hudson
Parkway (West Side Highway) located at 239th Street several blocks to the west of the College
puts the campus within easy reach of New Jersey. The College is also within easy commuting
distance from Long Island and Westchester and Rockland counties because of its proximity to the
New York State Thruway and the Major Deegan Expressway (exit at Van Cortlandt Park South
or West 240th Street).

<address>Manhattan College 1996-1997 Undergraduate Catalog</address>
<h2><a name="Admission">Admission</a></h2>
Application for admission to Manhattan College may be made using the application form available
from the Manhattan College Admission Center, by using the College Board's Expan Software or
the College View Software.  These applications are available in many guidance offices along  with
the Common Application Form on paper and on disk.  The Common Application is distributed by
the National Association of Secondary School Principals (NASSP).  In reviewing applications for
admission, the following items are considered by the Committee on Admissions.
<h3><a name="Freshman Admission">Freshman Admission</a></h3>
<strong>1) High School Subjects and Performance</strong>

<p>Most emphasis is placed upon what subjects a student has taken and grades earned in those
subjects in light of their intended field of study. What a student has done in high school in most
cases is a very good indicator of how well he or she will succeed in college.

<p>All applicants must offer a minimum of 16 units in academic subjects which should include the
following:
<pre><strong>				Required		Recommended
				Units*			Units
</strong>	English			4			4
	Modern or
	Classical Language	2			3
	Science (Lab Sciences)	2			3
	Mathematics**		3			4
	Social Studies		3			3
	Electives		2

</pre>

<p>*At the discretion of the Committee on Admissions, quantitative requirements may be modified
for applicants with strong records who show promise of doing well in college work.

<p>** This includes algebra, geometry, intermediate algebra/trigonometry (sequence 1,11 and 111).<br>


<p><strong>2) SAT or ACT Scores</strong>

<p>Only one of these examinations is required, with SAT preferred. Scores on these examinations are
not considered to be definitive but they do give an indication of a student's potential.

<p><strong>3) School Recommendation</strong>

<p>Grades and test scores alone do not adequately evaluate a student's chances for college success.
Therefore, recommendations from people who have known the applicant are important in the
admission process.

<p><strong>4) Schools</strong> can vary greatly in the preparation of their students. Some schools are much more
highly competitive than others. The Admission Committee therefore takes this into consideration
when a student's record is reviewed.

<p><strong>5) Personal Statement.</strong> Applicants are required to write a short essay (not to exceed 300 words)
expressing their career objective.

<p><strong>6) The General Equivalency Diploma (G.E.D.)</strong> is accepted in lieu of a high school diploma for
admission to some programs of the College.
<h4><a name="Campus Visit">Campus Visit</a></h4>
A visit to the Manhattan campus is strongly recommended to all prospective students. By calling
the College in advance, (1&#173;800&#173;MC2XCEL), the student can arrange to have an interview with a
member of the admissions staff, have a tour of the campus, sit in on classes, speak with faculty
and visit with other students. A visit with parents and friends can provide the student with a
wealth of information about the given College and also help the student to make an intelligent
choice in selecting a college. Tours are given Monday through Friday at 11:15 a.m., 12:30 a.m.
and 2:30 p.m.
<h4><a name="Early Decision">Early Decision</a></h4>
To superior high school seniors who have selected Manhattan College as their first choice, the
College offers an Early Decision Program. The Admissions Committee assumes that all students
who apply under this program will accept an offer of admission, provided it includes adequate
financial aid if such is needed. Students interested in Early Decision must have all application
material, including high school transcript and test scores, at the Admission Center by November
15, and will be notified of a decision by January 1.

<p>Early Decision candidates may file applications for regular admission to other colleges, but upon
notification of acceptance to Manhattan these applications must be withdrawn immediately and a
non&#173;refundable tuition deposit must be submitted.

<p>A personal interview is strongly recommended of all Early Decision candidates and should be
arranged well in advance of application to the College.

<p>Should the Admissions Committee be unable to grant acceptance as an Early Decision candidate,
the application will be deferred and given full consideration as a regular admission candidate.
<h4><a name="Scholarship Applicants">Scholarship Applicants</a></h4>
All freshman applicants seeking academic scholarships must have their application for admission
on file by February 1<sup>st</sup>.
<h4><a name="Early Admission">Early Admission</a></h4>
Manhattan will accept for enrollment any well qualified student upon completion of the junior
year. Such a student must present the usual credentials and qualifications for admission.
<h4><a name="Notification of Admission">Notification of Admission</a></h4>
Applications and F.A.F. S. A. will be reviewed on a "modified rolling admissions basis." When a
student has filed a completed application (high school record, College Board scores and
recommendation) with the Admission Center, the committee will act upon it. The first
notifications of acceptances are mailed on February 1. Before a decision is made many students
will be asked to submit copies of their senior grades in January. All acceptances are contingent
upon the successful completion of the senior year.

<p>Accepted students who have a copy of a F. A F. S. A. on file in the Financial Aid Office by March
1<sup>st</sup> will be notified of the financial aid they will receive.<br>

<h4><a name="Transfer Admission">Transfer Admission</a></h4>
1)  With an Associate Degree (A.A. or A.S.)
  <blockquote>Students who apply for transfer into the same curriculum with an A.A. or A.S. degree are
granted full junior status. They must submit items 2b, 2c, 2d and 2e listed below.<br>

  </blockquote>

<p>2)  Students who are transferring without an associate degree or with an A.A.S. degree must
submit:
  <blockquote>a) a high school transcript if less than three semesters of college work has been completed,<br>
b) official college transcripts,<br>
c) a list of courses presently being taken,<br>
d) college catalogs from all institutions previously attended,<br>
e) financial aid transcripts from all collegiate institutions previously attended (even if you
only took one or two courses while in high school).
  </blockquote>

<p>With this information the Admission Committee will make a preliminary evaluation of a student's
record. The applicant will be notified of acceptance or rejection. He/she will also be informed of
the number of transfer credits granted. Ordinarily transfer students must earn fifty percent (50%)
of the credit for graduation at Manhattan College. "P" grades may be accepted for credit but only
if they represent a "C" or better as defined by the regulations of the institution of origin. All of the
above credentials must be on file in the Admissions Center before an application is reviewed for
admission. All acceptances for students who have work in progress at another college or
university are conditional upon successful completion of work in progress without withdrawals
and with a minimum index of 2.50. Transfer Articulation Agreements do exist with a number of
two&#173;year colleges, i.e., Rockland Community College, Westchester Community College, Nassau
Community College, Hudson Valley Community College, Bergen Community College, and
Morris Community College.
<h4><a name="Readmit Students">Readmit Students</a></h4>
Any student who unofficially or officially withdrew from the College must be readmitted through
the Admission Center. Credits earned at other institutions since last attending Manhattan College
will be evaluated according to existing school policies.

<p>Students returning after an <strong>official leave of absence will be readmitted </strong>by the Dean's Office that
initially granted the leave. Only students making satisfactory progress will be granted an official
leave of absence. Students transferring to another school within the College must first seek
clearance from the original Dean.
<h4><a name="Veterans">Veterans</a></h4>
Any veteran who has not attended college since being discharged from the service and who has a
high school or General Equivalency Diploma (G.E.D.) and has been satisfactorily interviewed by
an admissions counselor is eligible for admission to Manhattan. Special tutoring is available and
every effort is made to work out a program of study which meets the student's potential.
Advanced standing will be granted in appropriate circumstances after consideration of previous
college work. 

<p>The Office of the Vice President for Student Life, located in Memorial Hall, is responsible for
arranging any V.A. benefits. Veterans should bring a copy of their DD 214 form to the office with
their letter of acceptance. The eligibility for the V.A. benefits is for the semester or session for
which they are in attendance. To continue to be eligible for these benefits in subsequent semesters,
veterans must report to the Office of the Vice President for Student Life to renew the certification
of attendance at the beginning of each semester for which they are registered.

<p>The following information is important:
  <blockquote>a. Veterans are paid benefits for actual credit hours in attendance. Twelve semester hours is
considered full time for V.A. benefits.<br>

  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>b. Any change of status -- withdrawing from a course, non&#173;attendance in a particular
semester, failure to register for a subsequent semester -- must be reported by the student to
the Vice President for Student Life immediately.
  </blockquote>
<h4><a name="Advanced Placement">Advanced Placement</a></h4>
Students who have successfully taken one or more of the Advanced Placement Tests of the
College Entrance Examination Board may ask for advanced placement and/or credit. The Dean of
the School to which application is made will decide on the amount of credit to be granted and the
college course or courses that may be omitted in place of the Advanced Placement Tests.

<p>Scores of 3, 4 or 5 are required for such action. The decision to grant advanced placement and/or
credit is based on such other factors as the Advanced Placement's equivalence to the content of
courses in the College's curricula and the applicability of the area of advanced study to the
prescribed or elective requirements of the program in which the student is enrolled.

<p>Advanced placement and/or credit action is taken only if the student has specifically requested
such consideration and has submitted official score reports from the College Board. No grades are
assigned to courses credited.

<p>At times, students with an Advanced Placement score of 3 who intend to major in the area where
they have taken an Advanced Placement course, or who are required to take upper&#173;division
courses in the same area, will be advised to repeat the college's course rather than to accept
Advanced Placement credit. This advice is based upon the college's past experience with such
students, and applies especially to students pursuing upper&#173;division courses in the natural
sciences.
<h4><a name="Programs of Credit by Examination">Programs of Credit by Examination</a></h4>
Manhattan College is a participant in the New York State College Proficiency Examination
Program and subscribes to its policy of credit by examination regardless of the individual's
background or formal preparation. Manhattan also participates in the College Level Examination
Program (CLEP) of the College Board. Students wishing to take CLEP examinations for possible
college credit, may arrange to do so through any CLEP administration center. Currently enrolled
students must first seek the approval of their academic dean, before arranging to take the
examination. When the examination grade is available, the academic dean will determine whether
or not appropriate college credit may be granted.

<p>Prospective students -- those beginning their college education for the first time, and transfer
students from other colleges who have taken either the Proficiency Examination or CLEP -- must
request credit at the time that they apply for admission to the college, and must submit, as early as
possible, an official report of scores from the New York State Education Department or from the
College Board. In the case of transfer students who previously received credit from other
colleges, Manhattan reserves the right to reevaluate such credit.

<p>Manhattan College follows the recommendation of the Commission on Educational Credit and
Credentials of the American Council on Education in accepting the College Board CLEP
examination for awarding credit on the general and subject examinations as follows:
<h4><a name="CLEP General Examinations">CLEP General Examinations</a></h4>
These examinations are designed to reflect the general education requirements that ordinarily are
met in a student's first two years of college. The scores are reported as scaled scores using a range
from 200 to 800. Manhattan's minimum acceptable scores and the credit awarded for each
examination are:
<pre><strong>				Minimum Score for	Number of
General Examinations		Awarding Credit		Semester Hours
</strong>English Composition			570			6
Mathematics				460			6
Humanities				460			6
Natural Sciences			460			6
Social Sciences and History		460			6

</pre>
<h4><a name="CLEP Subject Examinations">CLEP Subject Examinations</a></h4>
These examinations are designed to reflect the more specific knowledge which a student may have
acquired in a particular subject area (e.g. someone well&#173;versed in accounting principles, through
on&#173;the&#173;job training, might do well on the SUBJECT EXAMINATION in Introductory
Accounting). The scores for these examinations are reported as scaled scores ranging from 20 to
80. Following are the examinations which Manhattan will accept for credit, the minimum
acceptable scores and the number of credits allowed for each examination:
<pre>

</pre>

<p>Credit by examination will be awarded only for courses in consonance with the prescribed or
elective courses applicable to the degree. Such credit is awarded and will be so identified on the
student's record after he/she has registered and is attending class. The academic dean concerned
determines courses which are equivalent to the examinations taken.

<p>Total credit by examination to entering, as well as to enrolled students, in this or other programs
in which the college participates may not exceed one&#173;fourth of the total number of credit hours
normally required for the degree. No grades are assigned to courses credited.

<h4><a name="Student Status">Student Status</a></h4>
Qualified persons may be admitted to either matriculated or non&#173;matriculated status.

<p><strong>1) Matriculated Students:</strong> these are persons who have completed the equivalent of a regular
college preparatory program in high school or beyond and who meet the normal entrance
requirements of the program for which they have applied. They are considered to be candidates
for a Manhattan College degree in the program for which they are enrolled at the college. In order
to be matriculated, applicants must present to the Admissions Center an application for admission
with all supporting documents to indicate that they are qualified for matriculation to the college.
Only the Admission Center of the college can allow applicants to matriculate.

<p><strong>2) Non&#173;matriculated Students:</strong> these are qualified persons following one or more regular
courses, but not intending to earn a degree at Manhattan College. Applicants who wish to attend
as non&#173;matriculated students must apply to the Admission Center and present evidence that they
conform to the requirements for admission. In exceptional circumstances, the Committee on
Admissions may invite a candidate who does not qualify for matriculated status to enter the
college as a non&#173;matriculated student on probation for a limited period of time. In this time, the
student must demonstrate adequate preparation and motivation to pursue the program of studies
for which he/she has applied. Non&#173;matriculated students may not continue for more than 33
credits at Manhattan College. The student's program will be prescribed by the Dean of the school
in which the student will be registered. Qualified non&#173;matriculated students who wish to pursue
more then 33 credits at Manhattan must apply to the Admission Center for matriculation after
they have demonstrated their qualification to do so.

<p>Non&#173;matriculated students may fall into either of the following categories:
  <blockquote>
  </blockquote>

<p><strong>A) Non&#173;degree Students:</strong> students who are matriculated at another institution and wish to
follow a course or courses for credit at Manhattan College. All such students must present to the
Admission Center official correspondence noting good standing, together with an authorization to
follow courses from a responsible official of the college at which they are matriculated.

<p><strong>B) Non&#173;credit Students:</strong> persons auditing one or more courses with the clear understanding that
no college credit will be earned. All persons must apply to the Admission Center and present
evidence that they are qualified to follow the courses which they request.
<h4><a name="Foreign Students">Foreign Students</a></h4>
Manhattan College requires applicants for admission whose native language is not English to take
the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Ordinarily students who achieve a score of
520 on the TOEFL are acceptable for admission. However, if the score falls below 550 the
applicant will be assigned to an English as a Second Language Course. To apply for this test,
write to: Test of English as a Foreign Language, Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New
Jersey, 08540 U.S.A.

<p>In addition, the College also encourages and at times requires candidates to take the Scholastic
Aptitude Test (SAT). Transcripts submitted for admission must be official and must be translated
into English. Applicants should contact World Education Services Inc., P.O. Box 745, Old
Chelsea Station, New York, New York 10011 for a course by course evaluation of credits and
have it submitted to Manhattan College. Foreign student applications for the freshman class must
be on file by January 31, and transfer applications by March 1.

<p>Prior to an I&#173;20 form being sent to an accepted student, the accepted applicant must submit a
letter of credit with a United States Bank and a certified check from an American bank in the
amount of one semester's tuition. If the student is accepted as a resident student at Manhattan
College a certified check from an American bank covering the cost for one semester of room and
board fees must be submitted to the Admission Center.

<h3><a name="Manhattan College/College of Mount Saint Vincent Program">Manhattan College/College of Mount Saint Vincent Program</a></h3>
In 1964 Manhattan College inaugurated an interinstitutional program with the College of Mount
Saint Vincent broadening opportunities for students at both colleges through sharing of facilities,
programs of study, and professional faculties. The Biology, Chemistry, Modern Foreign
Languages, Mathematics and Computer Science, Psychology and Sociology Departments of both
institutions have joined, and close cooperation has been effected in English, Fine Arts, Special
Education and Religious Studies. Shuttle bus service is provided by the two colleges for students
who regularly travel back and forth between campuses for various courses. A program of joint
social and cultural activities is sponsored by both colleges.

<p>Students entering Arts, Science, and Education may expect to take some of their courses at the
College of Mount Saint Vincent. All Chemistry courses are taught at Manhattan College and most
Biology offerings are given at Mount Saint Vincent. Students at either college may apply to take
courses at either institution, provided the registered course is consonant with the curriculum for
which they are registered. Manhattan students register at Manhattan for all courses which they
will take at Mount Saint Vincent.

<p>At the present time, this cooperative program includes such shared facilities as the library,
computer center, laboratories, and offices.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Validation Program">Validation Program</a></h3>
The Validation Program is designed to serve students whose high school record and/or SAT
scores indicate that they may not be fully prepared to matriculate in the degree program of their
choice, but whose credentials indicate an ability to meet the challenges of a college education.
Students in the Validation Program will be assigned to special counselors and will receive a
special orientation program.  In their first semester they will be assigned only four courses.

<p>Validation students attaining an index of 2.50 or better at the end of the first semester will be
matriculated in the program of their choice and may elect a maximum of five courses in their
second semester.  Students interested in matriculating in Engineering programs should elect
Physics 101 in their second semester.  Students interested in matriculating in Business programs
should elect Economics 201.

<p>At the end of the first year students achieving a cumulative index of 2.00 or better on completion
of 24 credits or more will be placed in a degree program.  Attendance at special sessions may be
required to fulfill credit requirements.  Students whose cumulative index is below 2.00 will be
reviewed for continuation.

<p>Students in the Validation Program are assigned advisers by the Director of Academic Support
Services.  In addition, they must attend regularly scheduled guidance sessions.  Tutorial assistance
is provided.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Specialized Resource Center"><a href="http://www.manhattan.edu/sprscent/srchome.html">Specialized Resource Center</a></a></h3>
The Specialized Resource Center (SRC) serves all students with special needs including
individuals with temporary disabilities, such as those resulting from injury or surgery.  Staffed by a
director, a Coordinator, as well as a Learning Disabilities Specialist, the SRC is a resource for
students, faculty and the college at large.  Use of services is <em>voluntary, strictly confidential and
without fee.  </em>

<p>The mission of the center is to ensure educational opportunity for all students with special needs
by providing access to full participation in campus life.  This is accomplished by assisting students
in arranging individualized support services.

<p>A <em>sampling </em>of auxiliary aids and/or academic adjustments offered by the SRC for students
providing appropriate documentation based on their individual needs for no fee include: Priority
registration; priority seating; alternative testing environments; readers, note takers and scribes;
access to adaptive technology; books on tape, and; liaison with faculty and other college
departments. 

<p>TDD telephone number is 718-862-7885.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Enhanced Fee-Based Learning Disabilities Program">Enhanced Fee-Based Learning Disabilities Program</a> </h3>
In addition to complying with section 504 and ADA guidelines, Manhattan College offers a
separate, fee-based program designed to enhance the academic progress of LD students.  Students
enrolling in the LD program receive a multitude of enhanced small group workshops, with a
specially designed three tier fee structure.

<p>Applicants with learning disabilities may not be admitted into the enhanced LD Program prior to
or concurrently with admission into the college.  The college's general admissions committee shall
make all admission decisions.  Students who have been admitted to the College may then apply to
the Enhanced LDProgram.  

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Career Services and Cooperative Education">Career Services and Cooperative Education</a> </h3>
The College maintains an active Career Services and Cooperative Education Center designed to
assist all students in systematically identifying, clarifying and achieving their career goals.

<p>The Center offers individual career counseling which may be enhanced through the use of various
decision making tools such as SIGI PLUS (System of Interactive Guidance and Information). In
addition to individual career counseling, group workshops are offered in the areas of career
exploration, resume writing, interviewing, skills and job search techniques.

<p>A full range of placement services is provided for students seeking full-time, part-time and
summer jobs. For those seniors seeking full-time employment upon graduation, there is an active
campus recruitment program available during the fall and spring semesters. Here, representatives
from several hundred companies/organizations come to campus to interview students for career
opportunities. For those students who choose to continue their studies, graduate school
advisement is available. A credentials file service is offered to support applications to
graduate/professional schools.  The resource library provides information on various career fields
and contains annual reports and literature on many corporations and not-for-profit organizations. 

<p>To ease the transition from college to the world of work, a <strong>Cooperative Education Program</strong> is
available to students who have completed at least three semesters of study and who are in good
academic standing. The Co-op Program gives students the opportunity for a series of meaningful
off-campus work experiences related to their on-campus study and career interests. It
complements and broadens one's education through the practical application of the theoretical
and technical knowledge gained in the classroom.

<p>Manhattan co-ops have had full-time and part-time placements in business, law firms, government
agencies, social service organizations, museums, research laboratories, etc. Cooperative
Education offers students a realistic way to explore and evaluate their interests, skills and career
options while they earn academic credit and an appropriate salary.

<p>All students are encouraged to take advantage of the services of the Center as early as possible in
their college experience.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Aerospace Studies (ROTC)">Aerospace Studies (ROTC)</a></h3>
Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) is conducted at approximately 600 colleges
and universities throughout the United States in order to select and train men and women to
become commissioned officers in the U.S. Air Force.  Most graduates who enter the Air Force
through ROTC are assigned positions consistent with their academic major.  Others, who wish to
do so, may qualify to become pilots and navigators.  Men and women who complete graduation
requirements and the Professional Officer Course (POC) receive commissions and enter active
duty as second lieutenants.   Officers who qualify may take graduate training prior to beginning
their military duties.  Scholarships are available to qualified students.  In addition, qualified
applicants in the fields of Nursing, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Physics, Physical
Therapy, Pharmacology, and Meteorology are in high demand and stand a good chance of
receiving a full scholarship.  For more information about scholarships, please see the Financial
Assistance section of this catalog or call (718) 862-7201.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Four-Year Program</h4>
The Air Force ROTC offers both the four-year and two-year commissioning programs.  The
four-year program consists of the four-semester General Military Course (GMC) and the
four-semester Professional Officer Course (POC).  Students normally start this program as
freshmen but may begin as sophomores by enrolling in both the freshman and sophomore year
classes.  Students not on scholarship may withdraw from the GMC at any time.  Participants in
the POC are selected from qualified volunteer applicants.  An Air Force ROTC-paid, four-week
field training encampment, held at an Air Force base, is required for POC students.  This
requirement is normally completed during the summer between the sophomore and junior years. 
The major areas of study during field training include junior officer training, aircraft and aircrew
orientation, career orientation, survival training, base functions, and the Air Force environment.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Two-Year Program</h4>
The two-year program consists of a paid six-week summer field training encampment and the
four-semester Professional Officer Course.  Participants in this program are selected from
qualified volunteer applicants.  This program is designed for undergraduate and graduate students
with less than three but at least two years remaining at Manhattan College, or other colleges
within the NYC area.  The six-week field training is a prerequisite for the POC.  The major areas
of study at field training are the same as in the four-year program with the addition of the General
Military Course academic curriculum.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="Special Sessions">Special Sessions</a></h4>
The College provides special sessions in January, May, and during the summer.  These special
sessions are scheduled primarily for the benefit of students matriculated at Manhattan College, but
are also open to properly qualified applicants from other accredited institutions. By attending a
special session a student may lighten his/her course load for subsequent periods of instruction,
make up for deficient credits, or elect extra credits to diversify and enrich his/her academic
program. A student may be required to attend a special session if his/her scholastic performance is
poor, or if his/her record contains D or F grades in required, prerequisite or sequential courses. 
The College will normally not accept credits taken at another institution for required, prerequisite
or sequential courses.

<p>All special session courses are the same in the number and length of periods as those described in
the Catalogue for the normal academic semesters. Final examinations will be given in each course.
Members of the regular teaching staff of the College constitute the special session faculty.

<p>Students from other colleges must present written authorization from the Dean or other qualified
official of their college to follow summer courses.

<p>Special sessions are held in January, May, June and July. These short but intensive programs
permit a full- or part-time college student the opportunity to gain additional credits for self
growth, enrichment, and to accelerate the completion of the degree process.

<p>Schedules for special sessions are issued in November and April. The enrollment of a minimum
number of students will be required for offering any course in the intersession or summer session.

<h2><a name="Academic Standards and Procedures">Academic Standards and Procedures</a></h2>
<h3><a name="Requirements for Graduation">Requirements for Graduation</a></h3>
Each student is expected to be familiar with the academic regulations of the College and the
particular requirements for his or her educational program. The student has sole responsibility for
complying with regulations and meeting degree requirements. General academic standards and
regulations are set forth below.

<p>Students should also consult the current <strong>Student Handbook,</strong> which explains College procedures,
disciplinary regulations, residence student life and related matters. This handbook is available in
the Office of the Assistant Dean for Student Programs and the Office of the Director of Residence
Life.

<p>To be eligible for graduation a student must have satisfactorily completed all the courses required
in the program for which he/she is registered. In following his/her program a student must
successfully complete all prerequisite courses before moving to more advanced work. He/she
must obtain a minimum average of C (i.e., a cumulative scholarship index of 2.00, computed
according to the method set forth in the College Catalogue). <strong>Students are personally
responsible for meeting the degree requirements prescribed in the Catalogue at the time
they entered Manhattan College.</strong>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Grades">Grades</a></h3>
In grading, the following symbols are employed:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<table border cellpadding=5 width="100%">
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="3%"><strong>A</strong></td>
<td valign="top" width="96%"><strong>--Excellent.</strong> Indicates achievement that is distinctive and outstanding.</td></tr>

requirement for graduation (minimum grade for all major and minor courses).</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>D</strong></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>--Passing but Unsatisfactory.</strong> Indicates achievement which is below the average level
expected of college students.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>F</strong></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>--Failure.</strong> Indicates inferior scholastic performance or withdrawal from a course without
the permission of the Dean.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>I</strong></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>--Incomplete.</strong> Indicates that some requirement of a course has not been satisfied by the
end of the term. The deadline for completing the course requirements will be the last day of
the fourth week of the following Fall or Spring semester. An Incomplete grade in a January
Intersession must be completed during the immediately following Spring Semester. An
Incomplete grade in a Summer Session must be completed during the following Fall
semester.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>W</strong></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>--Withdrawal.</strong> Indicates withdrawal from a course with permission of the Dean of the
program in which the student is regularly enrolled. <strong>Permission to withdraw from a course
may be granted only by the Dean involved.</strong> The deadline for withdrawal from a course
will be two weeks before the last day of scheduled classes.</td></tr>
<tr>

<td valign="top"><strong>--No Credit.</strong></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><strong>P/F</strong></td>
<td valign="top"><strong>--</strong>In Pass/Fail courses, neither grade influences the grade point average. Credit is awarded
for a P grade; no credit for F.</td></tr></table>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Final grades are given at the end of each semester and at the conclusion of work in the Summer
Session and January Intersession; these grades become part of the official permanent record of
each student in the Registrar's Office. Mid-semester grades are assigned to freshmen and
sophomores to indicate their standing in courses up to that time and to assist the faculty in
affording students necessary guidance; mid-semester grades are not entered on the Registrar's
permanent official records.

<p>Final Grade Reports are sent to the students as soon as possible after the grades have been
reported to the Registrar's Office.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Scholarship Index">Scholarship Index</a></h3>
The scholarship index is determined as follows: 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<table border cellpadding=5 width="87%">
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="top" width="18%"><u>Grade</u></td>
<td align="center" valign="top" width="81%"><u>Quality Points</u></td></tr>

<tr>
<td align="center" valign="top">I/F</td>
<td align="center" valign="top">0.0</td></tr></table>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Quality points are allowed for every college credit attempted.  The total number of quality points
divided by the total number of hours of credit which the student has attempted gives the
cumulative scholarship index.

<p>For all students the cumulative index is computed at the end of each semester; for those who
attend the summer session it is also computed at the end of each session.

<p>To improve his/her index, a student who has earned a grade of "D" or "F" in a course may repeat
the course, at anytime during the student's continuous or non-continuous attendance at
Manhattan. The course must be repeated at Manhattan College. Grades for all attempts will
appear on the student's academic record. Only the grade of the last attempt will be used in
calculating the student's cumulative index for academic standing and graduation. Grades for all
attempts of a course will be used in calculating the student's cumulative index for class rank,
graduation honors, eligibility for institutional scholarships and grants and for honor societies.
Credit for the course will apply only once toward meeting degree requirements.  Students entering
in Fall 1994 and thereafter may exercise this option no more than five times.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Academic Standing">Academic Standing</a></h3>
Students are expected to make satisfactory progress toward a degree. Failure to make satisfactory
progress will lead to probation and/or dismissal. The definition of "satisfactory progress" for New
York State and Federal financial aid programs differs from the College's definition, and is stated
on page 44. By the College's standards, a student is considered to be making satisfactory progress
if at the end of one full year of study (24 to 30 credits) he/she has achieved a cumulative index of
1.80; if at the end of two full years of study (48 to 60 credits) he/she has achieved a cumulative
index of 1.90. Students who have achieved junior or senior status are required to maintain the 2.0
cumulative index required for graduation. Failure to maintain satisfactory progress will lead to
probation. If, after one semester on probation, a student has not achieved the required cumulative
index, he/she is subject to dismissal.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Change of Program">Change of Program</a></h3>
Students wishing to change their degree program to another program at the College should seek
the advice of the Dean or Academic Advisor of the program they wish to enter. Their academic
record will be analyzed to determine which of the completed courses will be applicable to the new
degree program. Their status with respect to degree requirements and cumulative index in the
new degree program (except for class rank, graduation honors, eligibility for institutional
scholarships and grants and for honor societies) will include only those courses accepted as
applicable to the new degree program.  If accepted into the new program, students whose
cumulative index is below that required for satisfactory progress may be placed on extended
probation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="_1_7"></a>Probation</h3>
Students placed on probation for failure to make satisfactory progress may be required to take a
reduced course load and be restricted from participating in College activities.  Students placed on
probation are subject to dismissal if they have not met the standards of satisfactory progress after
one semester on probation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="_1_8"></a>Dismissal </h3>
A student may be dismissed from the College if he/she fails to achieve satisfactory progress within
one semester of being placed on probation or fails to observe the restrictions imposed during
probation.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Examinations">Examinations</a></h3>
A formal examination period is scheduled at the end of the Fall and Spring semesters. Final
examinations are required in some Schools and departments. At the beginning of each semester
each teacher is required to announce whether a final examination for the course will be given, and
likewise will outline all course requirements and indicate the criteria to be used in evaluating the
performance of the students.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Credit Hour">Credit Hour</a></h3>
Usually, in any semester fourteen lecture periods of fifty-five minutes each or fourteen laboratory
periods of two clock hours each normally constitute one credit hour. Any variations from this
ruling are indicated in the catalogue description of a course. Examinations, quizzes, scheduled
field trips and similar course activities are included within the required periods.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Credit for Off-Campus Courses">Credit for Off-Campus Courses</a></h3>
The College will normally not accept credit for off-campus courses to fulfill core or major
requirements, or for prerequisite or sequential course requirements.  Also, students who have
achieved junior or senior status will not be permitted to take courses at two-year junior or
community colleges.  Credit for courses taken at other institutions by matriculated students of
Manhattan College will be recognized under the following conditions:  (1) written permission to
take such courses is obtained in <strong>advance </strong>from the Dean of the student's School, (2) the required
form and transcript are filed with the Registrar and the required fee is paid to the Bursar, (3) the
grade received at the other institution is equivalent to or higher than the Manhattan College grade
of C.  <strong>Grades </strong>earned at other institutions will not be transferred to the student's record at
Manhattan College.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Attendance Policy">Attendance Policy</a></h3>
Students are required to attend all classes for which they are registered, and are responsible for
any absence from classes. They are responsible for fulfilling all course requirements and
completing all course assignments; they will likewise be held accountable for the entire content of
the course.

<p>When a student has four unexcused absences, the teacher will notify the Dean of the School in
which the student is matriculated. The student will be invited to an interview to discuss the reason
behind the absences. The Dean may refer the student to formal counseling to assess underlying
causes, may advise withdrawal from a course, or may issue a letter of warning if a student's
scholastic record is endangered.

<p>If a student is absent from a test or quiz, the teacher is not required to provide a substitute test or
quiz. Students who are absent from a laboratory cannot expect that any special arrangements
(e.g., setting up apparatus) will be made to enable them to complete the laboratory work that they
have missed.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Transcripts">Transcripts</a></h3>
Transcripts must be ordered by letter or in person from the Office of the Registrar. To insure
prompt delivery of the transcript, requests should be made at least one week before the transcript
is desired. The established fee for each transcript is five dollars. No transcript will be issued for
students whose accounts are in arrears.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Honors Program">Honors Program</a></h3>
To encourage the intellectual life of students of outstanding ability, the departments of Manhattan
College provide special offerings to their students. These departmental honors programs may
consist of seminars, tutorials, graduate courses, research programs, student projects and/or a
thesis. Students may apply to participate in these departmental offerings but approval of the
Chairperson of the Department and/or departmental faculty must be given before a student will be
admitted to any phase of the program. Each of these offerings emphasizes independent study
carried on by the students.

<p>Membership in a wide variety of professional and honorary societies may be earned by students of
Manhattan College. These societies include the following:

<a name="Epsilon Sigma Pi Honor Society"><strong>Epsilon Sigma Pi Honor Society</a>.</strong> Membership in this Society is the highest scholastic honor for
which undergraduates of all programs of the College are eligible. Induction into this Society
requires a cumulative scholarship index of 3.40 with no failures, based on all courses taken at
Manhattan College. Students are admitted to the Society upon completion of six semesters of
full-time study, or 92 credits.  Semesters spent in approved programs of foreign study or in such
programs as the Washington Semester will be counted.  Credits for courses taken at another
institution on a transient basis will not be counted.

<p>Students transferring from other institutions will be eligible for induction into Epsilon Sigma Pi if
they earn a cumulative index of 3.40 for six semesters at Manhattan College and have not
received a grade of F at either institution. If they transfer to Manhattan College after their third or
fourth semesters, they will be eligible for induction into Epsilon Sigma Pi at graduation if they
have earned a cumulative index of 3.40 at Manhattan College and 3.40 at their previous
institution(s) and have not received a grade of F at either institution.

<p>Students who are following an accelerated program, which may include advanced placement
credit, are eligible for Epsilon Sigma Pi provided they have completed 92 credits, have earned a
cumulative index of 3.40 at Manhattan College, and have not received a grade of F.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><a name="Deans Honor List">
<p><strong>Dean's Honor List</a>.</strong> Students who complete a minimum of 12 credits in a Fall or Spring semester
with a minimum grade point average of 3.40 with no course failures will be placed on the Dean's
Honor list.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><a name="Graduation With Honor">
<p><strong>Graduation With Honor</a>.</strong> Honors are awarded based on the following cumulative indexes:

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>Transfer students from other institutions are eligible for graduation honors if one half of the
course credits for their degree are earned at Manhattan College. The required index for
graduation honors will be based upon all course credits attempted at Manhattan College.

<p>Students transferring from one program of the College to another are eligible for graduation
honors. In calculating the required index for graduation honors, all course credits attempted at
Manhattan College will be included.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><a name="Student Retention and Placement after Graduation">
<p><strong>Student Retention and Placement after Graduation</a>.</strong> The high academic standards maintained
by the College, changes in students' career plans, or similar reasons sometimes result in students
leaving the College without finishing a degree program. At Manhattan College, 86% of entering
freshmen return for their sophomore year, 80% of this same entering class persist to their junior
year, 76% return as seniors and 70% graduate within six years of entering.  A 70% graduation
rate compares favorably to a national average of only 47% among private colleges.

<p>In an effort to improve retention/graduation rates, Manhattan College provides an extensive
advisement and counselling program which begins before students arrive at the College and
continues throughout their academic careers. (See page 19 for placement after graduation.)

<h3><a name="Bursars Regulations">Bursar's Regulations</a></h3>
An itemized bill is mailed home to the student prior to the start of each semester. For his/her
convenience the student is advised to pay the bill in advance and thus avoid having to come to the
Bursar's Office in person.

<p>All bills are due and payable IN FULL by mid-August for the fall semester and mid-January for
the spring semester. A student who has been awarded grants by any outside agency should
present the bill to the Bursar and write the source and amount of the award granted on the face of
the bill and present proof of the award. If these grants fully cover the total amount of the bill, the
class schedule will be given to the student for admittance to class. If the amount of the grant
partially covers the total bill, the student must pay the remaining part before being permitted to
attend class. 

<p>Manhattan College offers a plan which allows the student to spread the cost of tuition, room and
board, and fees over a series of monthly payments.  To obtain information regarding this plan
contact:  The Bursar, Manhattan College, Miguel Hall 101, Riverdale, NY 10471.

<p>Students who, during a particular academic year, exceed the number of credits listed under the
course requirements in their field of study, will be charged at the per credit tuition rate for the
school in which they are registered. Course requirements for each year by field may be found
beginning on page 70.

<p>Students on full or partial scholarships are not exempt from overcredit charges assessed in the
spring semester if they take credits in excess of those prescribed in a particular academic year for
the regular full-time program outlined in the catalogue.

<p>Students whose accounts are in arrears may be denied registration for a subsequent term and may
not be given a transcript of record.

<p>Please note, changes to a student's academic schedule may:
  <blockquote>a)  result in a recalculation of financial aid for that semester and/or  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>b)  affect student's course load in future semesters, resulting in overcredit charges or
requiring the student to take courses during the summer or intersessions.
  </blockquote>

<p>Beginning July 1, 1995 the college has begun charging interest at the rate of 1% per month, on
any balance past due greater than 30 days.

<p>Students will be responsible for attorney's fees and collection costs (not to exceed 33 1/3% of
delinquent balance) associated with the collection of any amount not paid when due.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>A. Refunds</h3>
1. <strong>No refund </strong>will be granted a student who has attended more than five weeks. A proportionate
refund will be made on tuition according to the following schedule which is applicable to both day
and evening sessions.
<pre>	<strong>Fall and Spring Terms				Refund</strong>
	First Week of Class				100%
	Second Week of Class				80%
	Third Week of Class				60%
	Fourth Week of Class				40%
	Fifth Week of Class				20%
	Sixth Week of Class and After			no refund
</pre>

<p>2. No request for refund will be considered for the Fall Semester until the end of October, and for
the Spring Semester the end of February.

<p>3. Refunds will be based on the date of <strong>official withdrawal.</strong>

<p>4. No refunds are made to full-time students for withdrawal from an individual course.

<p>5. The matriculation fee, application fee, course fees, housing deposits and special fees are not
refundable.

<p>6. Room and board charges will be prorated for the period of actual residence if that is less than
six weeks; for six weeks or more the full semester's charge will be made.

<p>7. A student is required to notify in writing the Office of his/her Dean of:
  <blockquote>a) Any change of address  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>b) Withdrawal from any course (giving date of last attendance)  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>c) Complete withdrawal from the College (giving date of last lecture attended).
  </blockquote>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>B. Refunds for First Time Students</h3>
In accordance with Federal regulations, a separate refund schedule is in force for first time
students. A first time student is a student who: 
  <blockquote>a) has not previously attended at least one class at Manhattan College.  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>b) has not received a refund of 100% of tuition and fees for previous attendance at
Manhattan College.
  </blockquote>

<p>The refund schedule for first time students is as follows:
<pre>	<strong>Fall and Spring Terms				Refund</strong>
	First Week of Class				 100%
	Second Week of Class				 80%
	Third through Ninth Week of Class		 60%

their attendance at Manhattan financially possible.

<p>To this end, the College administers a wide range of scholarship and financial aid programs
designed to enable the student to pursue his/her studies to graduation. The basis of selection is
ability and/or need. Students are advised that program guidelines and funding levels, especially
State and Federal, are subject to change without enough advance notice to be corrected in this
publication.

<p>All financial aid is renewable on a yearly basis provided the student remains eligible; i.e., files the
FAFSA by April 15, is enrolled in a matriculated program, is in good academic standing and
continues to demonstrate need (for need based aid). Please check scholarship requirements listed
under each type of scholarship.

<p>Meeting the complete costs of college, however, usually requires a cooperative effort from several
possible sources of funds: student and family, Manhattan College, state and federal government
agencies and independent sources of aid.  Manhattan College attempts to meet a significant
portion of need but is unable to meet full need due to financial limitations.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Application Procedures</h3>
Students who wish to apply for any type of financial assistance through Manhattan College must
file a Manhattan College Financial Aid Form and the Free Application for Federal Student
Assistance (FAFSA 002758) as early as possible after January 1st preceding the academic year for
which they wish to be considered for aid. The Financial Aid Forms may be obtained from the high
school guidance counselor or Manhattan College Financial Aid Office

<p>The Federal Student Aid Program performs a needs analysis service which computes the family
contribution toward educational costs. Manhattan College then determines financial need based
on the total cost of attendance at the college. The cost of attendance includes tuition and fees,
room and board (even if a student will commute an allowance is given for room and board at
home), books, transportation and personal expenses. The Financial Aid Office deducts the family
contribution as determined by the FAFSA from the Total Cost of Attendance to arrive at a family
financial need. This need is filled with a combination of gift (scholarships and grants from
Manhattan College, federal and state grant programs and outside scholarships), loan (Perkins and
Stafford) and work (College Work Study and Campus employment).

<p>Applicants will be advised through a Financial Aid Award Letter as to what aid they will receive
and what other information is necessary. Award letters are sent out to high school seniors, usually
in late March, on a rolling basis. Students already in attendance will begin to receive their Award
Letters in late June or July.

<p>Students are advised to visit the Financial Aid Office to discuss any changes in family
circumstances. A student should never withdraw from a class or a semester without visiting the
Financial Aid Office to discuss the impact on future financial aid.

financial need. As with all types of grant aid, these awards are renewed annually and adjusted in
line with changes on the FAFSA. These awards are given for a maximum of four years (eight
semesters). Grant recipients must maintain satisfactory academic progress.
<a name="Campus Employment Program">
<p><strong>Campus Employment Program</a>: </strong>Manhattan offers its own campus work program to students
who need employment to meet College expenses. Work opportunities depend upon a student's
qualifications and experience and the hourly rate is based upon the type of work performed.
Full-time students are permitted to work a maximum of fifteen hours a week while classes are in
session and up to thirty-five hours a week during vacation periods and summer months. Students
receiving full tuition and fees scholarships or grants from Manhattan College are ineligible during
any time period when their benefits are in effect. Students must complete a financial aid form to
be eligible for Campus Employment. Students' total aid including campus employment may not
exceed the total cost of attendance.

<p><strong>Athletic Grants:</strong> Manhattan College has available a strictly budgeted fund to offer grants-in-aid
to students who, by the possession of certain athletic skills can add to the community spirit and
morale of the campus. The college firmly states that recipients must come to Manhattan as
students, with their first interest in studies. They must meet the same entrance requirements as
other students and must maintain satisfactory progress. Manhattan adheres to and endorses the
principles and policies of the Eastern College Athletic Conference and the National Collegiate
Athletic Association.

<h3 align="center">ACADEMIC PROGRESS AND PROGRAM PURSUIT FOR NEW
YORK STATE PROGRAMS:</h3>

<h4><strong>FULL-TIME TAP RECIPIENTS:</strong></h4>
It is most important for all undergraduate full-time and part-time aid recipients to realize that a
complete withdrawal from all classes during a particular semester will place the student's financial
aid in suspension. The student will automatically become ineligible for financial aid for the
following semester. If a student is considering withdrawing from all courses, please visit the
Financial Aid Office before you do so.

<p>If you are a full-time undergraduate student receiving TAP or any other New York State grant or
scholarship you must meet the State Education Department's requirements for both satisfactory
academic progress and program pursuit.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Program Pursuit:</strong> means making a passing or failing grade in the following percentages of a
full-time program (which is a minimum of 12 credits per semester). 

<dl>
  <dt><strong>1st Year of TAP Payment-</strong></dt>
    <dd>50% of a full-time program must be completed each semester (6 credits per semester)</dd>
  <dt><strong>2nd Year of TAP Payment-</strong></dt>
    <dd>75% of a full-time program must be completed each semester (9 credits per semester)</dd>
  <dt><strong>3rd and 4th Year of TAP Payment-</strong></dt>
    <dd>100% of a full-time program must be completed each semester (12 credits per semester)</dd>
</dl>

<p>You must meet these program pursuit requirements every semester in order to be eligible to
receive your State aid the following semester.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Satisfactory Academic Progress:</strong> in addition to Program Pursuit requirements you must
complete a certain number of credits each semester with a certain cumulative index to be eligible
for the next semester's award. The following chart outlines what your credits completed and
cumulative index must be in order for you to be eligible for your New York State aid.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>*Note: Only students in five year programs, approved pursuant to section 145-2.7 of the
Regulations, are eligible for more than eight semesters of undergraduate awards.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>A recipient of New York State aid who fails to meet the program pursuit or satisfactory academic
progress requirements in a particular semester may wish to make up the necessary credits or
achieve the required cumulative index by taking credits at his/her own expense in a given
semester. If the student is then in good academic standing for receipt of New York State aid, the
aid will be reinstated the following semester.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>AID FOR PART-TIME STUDY RECIPIENTS:</h4>
Undergraduate students receiving New York State Aid for Part-Time Study (APTS) must also
meet BOTH satisfactory academic progress and program pursuit requirements.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Program Pursuit:</strong> means making a passing or failing grade in the following percentages of a
part-time program (which is a minimum of 6 credits per semester).

<dl>
  <dt><strong>1st Year or APTS Payment-</strong></dt>
    <dd>50% of a part-time program must be completed each semester (3 credits per semester)</dd>
  <dt><strong>2nd Year of APTS Payment-</strong></dt>
    <dd>75% of a part-time program must be completed each semester (4 1/2 credits per
semester)</dd>
  <dt><strong>3rd and all subsequent Years of APTS Payment-</strong></dt>
    <dd>100% of a part-time program must be completed each semester (6 credits per semester)</dd>
</dl>

<p>In order to be eligible for State aid the following semester you must meet the program pursuit
every semester.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Satisfactory Academic Progress:</strong> The student must successfully complete a minimum number of
semester hours of credit with a minimum grade point index according to the same satisfactory
progress chart that is printed in the previous section for full-time undergraduate TAP recipients.
The difference is that part-time APTS recipients are not reviewed every semester for satisfactory
academic progress; rather their academic progress is reviewed in 12 credit increments. Each
accumulation of 12 credits attempted counts for one semester on the full-time chart; an APTS
recipient must meet the academic progress requirements.

<p>A recipient of New York State Aid for Part Time Study who fails to meet the program pursuit or
satisfactory academic progress requirements in a particular semester may wish to make up the
necessary credits or achieve the required cumulative index by pursuing credits at his/her own
expense in a given semester. If this is done and the desired results achieved, the student will be
eligible to receive his/her New York State aid the following semester.

<p><strong>Waivers for Exceptional Circumstances:</strong> A recipient of New York State aid who has a very
good reason for lack of academic progress in a particular semester and can provide
documentation of such unusual circumstances, may request a one-time waiver of the New York
State satisfactory academic progress requirements from the Office of Financial Aid. This form
must be picked up at the Financial Aid Office, evidence of the reason for the waiver presented to
the Dean of your college and ultimately returned to the FAO. This waiver may be used only once
as an undergraduate. If you think you have the grounds for a one-semester waiver, visit the
Financial Aid Office. The waiver will permit you one semester of receipt of your New York State
Aid after you have lost your eligibility. During the waiver semester, you must make up your
academic progress deficiency so that you will be eligible to receive and for the next term.

<p><strong>Transfer Students:</strong> Transfer students and students re-admitted after an absence of at least one
year from college are reviewed for satisfactory academic progress for New York State assistance
on a somewhat different basis. While you must meet the program pursuit requirements based on
the number of New York State award payments you have received, the satisfactory academic
progress requirements you must meet will be based on either the number of state aid payments
you have received or the number of transfer credits awarded to you upon your admission to the
College. Placement on the chart of academic progress will be made based on whichever placement
benefits the student the most. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS:</h4>
<strong>Pell Grant:</strong> This program provides direct grants from the federal government to the
undergraduate student for educational expenses. Pell Grant may be received for a maximum of
five years for full-time undergraduate study. Grants may range in size up to $2340 per year but
not more than one-half of the cost of attendance at a student's chosen school.

<p>To apply a student must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and
send it to the Federal Student Aid Programs. A student may complete the Free Application for
Federal Student Aid if only applying for Federal Funds.

<p><strong>Perkins Loan Program:</strong> Under this program a high school graduate who has been accepted by
Manhattan College is eligible to borrow up to $4500 for the first two years in college and another
$4500 for the last two years. Amounts may vary according to financial need as determined by the
FAFSA.  Perkins loans at Manhattan College are usually given for the first two years only and
range from $500 to $1000 per year. You will be notified by the college if you are chosen to
receive a Perkins loan and will be sent the Perkins loan application to complete. Each Perkins loan
recipient must have an entrance interview with a financial aid counselor.

<p><strong>Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant:</strong> SEOG is funded by the Federal Government
and must be given to the students with the most need. These grants are usually given to the
students who receive Pell grants. No separate application is required.
<a name="College Work Study Program">
<p><strong>College Work Study Program</a>:</strong> A student who has remaining financial need after all grants are
considered may be offered the College Work Study Program. A student may work 10 to 15 hours
a week on campus and receive a paycheck to help defray living costs. During vacation periods it is
possible to work full-time.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p><strong>Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans:</strong> (GSL) Loans are made by participating
commercial and savings banks to students for college expenses. Students may borrow $2625
freshman year, $3500 sophomore year and $5500 for junior and senior years.  Although the loan
may be repaid interest free in advance, repayment at 6.62 interest begins six months after
graduation or termination as half-time student. Up to ten years may be allowed for repayment. 
However, the interest on all loans increases to 10% beginning with the fifth year of repayment. In
order to have the funds in time for fall registration, students are advised to apply by July l5. 
Students are advised that they cannot borrow more than the cost of attendance less the
combination of other financial aid and family contribution as computed as a result of filing the
Financial Aid Form.

<p>Students who take out loans are reminded that they have a responsibility to future college
students to repay those loans. Failure to repay can not only damage a person's credit rating and
lead to legal action, it can also affect the ability of future students to borrow money.

<p>Loan checks are forwarded by the banks to the Bursar's Office. The student will receive a letter
when the check is received. Disbursements are made once in the Fall and once in the Spring. All
borrowers must attend an entrance interview prior to signing their loan checks.

<p><strong>Parent Loans (PLUS):</strong> Parents of dependent undergraduate and graduate students and
independent students may borrow the cost of education minus financial aid.  The amount
borrowed under these programs may not exceed the cost of attendance minus other financial aid,
including Stafford Loans. The interest is a variable rate set annually and fixed at a level equal to
the rate on the 90 day T-Bills plus 3.75%, never to exceed 12%. Repayment of parent loans begin
60 days after the second disbursement. Some deferred payment options may be available. Contact
your lender for details. Interest may be capitalized accordingly, per lenders guidelines.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS </h4>

A Full-time undergraduate student must:
  <blockquote>1. Complete a minimum of 21 credits each school year of enrollment. You may make up
credits during the summer, at your own expense, to establish continued aid eligibility for the
next school year.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>2. You must have a 1.90 Grade Point Average by the end of your first year of college and a
2.00 Grade Point Average by the end of your 2nd year and each successive year to maintain
satisfactory academic progress. You may attempt to achieve the necessary Grade Point
Average through attendance in summer school at your own expense to establish continued
eligibility for aid for the next school year.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>3. Recipients of Manhattan College Scholarships must maintain the necessary GPA as
indicated in the catalog.
  </blockquote>

<p>A Part-time student must:
  <blockquote>1. Complete a minimum of 12 credits each school year of enrollment. A student may make
up credits during the summer at your own expense, to establish continued aid eligibility.
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>2. A student must maintain a 1.90 Grade Point Average by the end of your first year of
college and a 2.00 Grade Point Average by the end of your 2nd year and each successive
year to maintain satisfactory academic progress. You may attain the necessary Grade Point
Average through attendance in summer school at your own expense to establish continued
eligibility for aid for the next school year.
  </blockquote>

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Review policies:</h4>
1. Following each school year the GPA and number of credits earned by each financial aid
recipient will be entered into his/her official student financial aid file.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>2. The following will be considered as credits completed:
  <blockquote>a. "A" through "D" grades  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>b. "P" passing with credit
  </blockquote>

<p>3. The following will not be considered as credits completed:
  <blockquote>a. "F" grades   </blockquote>
  <blockquote>b. "W" withdrawal  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>c. "NC" no credit
  </blockquote>

<p>4. Students who do not complete any credits or who receive a GPA of 0.0 in a particular semester
will be placed on Financial Aid Suspension. This means termination of all financial aid.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Financial Aid Probation:</h4>
In the event that a student fails to meet any of the above criteria (except #4 above) at the end of a
particular school year, the student will be placed on one-semester Financial Aid Probation. A
student in this category may receive financial aid for the upcoming semester, but must complete at
least 9 credits if full-time, or 6 credits if part-time during that semester. Undergraduate students,
full-time and part-time must have a cumulative G.P.A. of 1.90 if a first year student or 2.00 if a
2nd, 3rd or 4th year student. <em>A student may be placed on Financial Aid Probation only once
during undergraduate study. </em>If a student placed on Financial Aid Probation does not complete at
least 9 credits (if full-time) or 6 credits (if part-time) with the appropriate grade point average
during the probationary semester, he/she will be considered making unsatisfactory academic
progress, and will be placed on financial aid suspension. All financial aid for future semesters
would thus be terminated. Once a student is making unsatisfactory academic progress the student
may:
<h4>Appeal of Financial Aid Probation/Suspension:</h4>
1. A student will indicate in writing to the Director of Financial Aid: a) reasons why he/she did not
achieve minimum academic requirements; and b) reasons why he/she should not be placed on
probation or have his/her aid terminated.

<p>2. The Director will review the appeal and determine whether the Financial Aid
Probation/Suspension is justified. The student will be advised, in writing, of the decision.
<h4>Conditions for Reinstatement:</h4>
1. A student pursuing Summer School or regular semester courses, at his/her own expense, to
avoid being placed on financial aid suspension/probation, must inform the Office of Financial Aid
in writing of such action, present proof of completion of such coursework and request review for
continued eligibility.

<p>2. To be able to be reinstated after being placed on Financial Aid suspension, a student must, at
his/her own expense, complete at least 9 credits (if fulltime) or 6 credits (if part-time) with the
necessary grade point average. At that time a student may re-apply, in writing for Financial Aid
for the following semester.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Waiver Provisions:</h4>
The same provision for use of a one-time waiver that exists for New York State Aid recipients is
available for those recipients of federal and/or institutional financial aid. Once again, a waiver
request must be made with good reason; it must be initiated at the Office of Financial Aid,
recommended by the academic Dean and approved by the Financial Aid Office.
Federal/institutional waivers also can be used only ONCE as an undergraduate. For assistance
regarding the use of federal/institutional waivers, please contact the Office of Financial Aid.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>PRIVATE SOURCES OF AID</h4>
Students may be eligible to receive scholarships, grants and loans from professional, religious,
social service, ethnic, union and other organizations to which they or members of their family
belong. Some corporations also offer grants to employees and their children. Interested students
may inquire about these opportunities through the officer in charge of personnel services.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>COST OF ATTENDANCE</h4>

The following is provided to assist in determining approximate costs at Manhattan College and
projected resources. The difference between the two, if any, will be the financial need.

<h2><a name="Student Life">Student Life</a></h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
The College offers a comprehensive program of student personnel services designed to develop
the students' potential for self-guidance in their efforts to achieve success in life as desirable
members of society. Coordination of services and activities is provided principally through the
Office of the Vice President for Student Life.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Campus Ministry">Campus Ministry</a></h3>
At Manhattan College, Campus Ministry primarily serves to assist students in their journey toward
personal, religious, and emotional maturity. Campus Ministry also assists and is assisted by the
members of the Manhattan College community to integrate its apostolic ministry with other
ministries of the local community.

<p>Manhattan College was founded by the Brothers of the Christian School, a religious congregation
begun by Saint John Baptist DeLaSalle which has a tradition of developing Christian values in
youth. Most students of Manhattan College are from a Roman Catholic background and so the
regular worship of the College is within this tradition and takes place every day of the week.
However, other Christians are invited to join at worship.

<p>The staff at the Cornerstone, which is the center for Campus Ministry, are available for personal
counseling. It is our belief that<strong> </strong>it is crucial that our emerging leaders of the Church and society be
exposed to the best of our catholic tradition. Further, the office strives to facilitate the
development of Christian leaders by encouraging members of the faith community to identify their
gifts and to use them for the common good.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Orientation Programs">Orientation Programs</a></h3>
In June, entering new students are expected to participate in a two-day orientation program.  The
goals of this program are to provide an opportunity to meet with academic advisors, register for
fall classes and gain insight into student life on campus.  The program is coordinated by the
Director of Student Activities.  All students are expected to stay on campus overnight.  Parents
are invited to attend sessions planned especially for them.  Additionally, during the beginning of
each semester, workshops and activities are planned to help students gain valuable college and life
skills.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><a name="Faculty Advisory System">
<p><strong>Faculty Advisory System</a>.</strong> The College administers a basic program of formal guidance designed
to meet students' needs for personalized and academic counseling from the time of admission to
graduation. Greatest emphasis is placed on guidance throughout the freshman year, the period
during which the student is most in need of assistance. Every freshman is provided with a Faculty
Advisor from his or her own School.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Counseling and Health Services">Counseling and Health Services</a></h3>
The Counseling Center offers counseling and consulting services to students, faculty, and staff on
a voluntary basis to assist in their academic or employment performance as well as interpersonal
functioning. The Center staff works with a wide range of concerns, including adjustment to
college, resolving conflicts, improving relationships with friends or family, reducing stress, and
concerns about substance abuse.  Group presentations and workshops are offered to the campus
community throughout the academic year.  Referrals are made to community resources as
necessary.  All services of the Counseling Center are confidential, precluding the
acknowledgement of any person's participation in counseling services as well as the content of
sessions without explicit written consent.

<p>The Counseling Center is located in Miguel Hall, Room 501.  Students may stop in the office or
call ahead to make an appointment (718-862-7394). The Center is open weekdays from 9:00 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. with evening appointments available by individual arrangement.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Health Services: The Infirmary">Health Services: The Infirmary</a></h3>
All students are strongly encouraged to have records of health history on file in the College
Infirmary.  The Health Services Office promotes the general health of students by providing
assistance to students to help prevent illnesses and accidents that may interfere with their
academic responsibilities.  The infirmary is a principal component of the Health Services Office,
providing medical services for minor illnesses and injuries.  In addition, the infirmary staff assists
with follow-up medical treatment, coordinates the immunization vaccination records, offers blood
pressure check-ups, makes referrals to off-campus health care providers, and makes available
personal health and nutrition counseling as well as first-aid educational training programs.  For
serious or prolonged illnesses, students are referred to a local hospital or their private physician.

<p>The infirmary is located in the East Hill Student Residence (Room 813) and is staffed by nurses
on weekdays during the academic semesters.  Physicians are regularly available on-campus for
consultations, diagnosis and treatment services.  Students are advised to call the infirmary
(718-862-7217) to secure an appointment with the medical doctors.

<p><strong>Medical Emergencies: </strong>Whenever a medical problem of an emergency nature arises, the Campus
Security Office (718-862-7333) should be contacted immediately. Campus Security responds to
all emergency calls 24-hours a day, notifying the Infirmary or New york City Emergency Medical
Services as appropriate.  While every effort will be made to notify parents or guardians in case of
serious illness or accidents requiring emergency treatment, it is understood and agreed that even
without such notification those concerned give their permission and consent to the College to take
such measures as may be deemed necessary.
<a name="Immunizations">
<p><strong>Immunizations</a>: </strong>New York State Law requires that all full-time as well as part-time students
born after January 1, 1957 submit to the College proof of their immunity against measles, mumps
and rubella.  New York State Law does not allow the College to register students for classes
without this immunization information on file.  Free MMR immunizations are available at the
infirmary (718-862-7217) as well as further detailed information about the immunization
requirements.
<a name="Insurance and Fees">
<p><strong>Insurance and Fees</a>. </strong> Individuals are responsible for medical charges they incur (i.e. ambulance
service, hospital costs, and non-infirmary doctor fees).  The College provides a basic Student
Accident Insurance Plan for all full-time undergraduates upon registration.  An additional
Sickness Insurance Plan is available on a voluntary basis.  Inquiries regarding insurances should be
directed to the Vice President/ Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (718-862-7356).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Specialized Services">Specialized Services</a></h3>
International students can obtain all necessary papers and information regarding procedures
administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service of the United States Department of
Justice from the International Student Advisor. Information and programming designed to aid the
students' adjustment to living and studying in New York City is provided throughout the year.

<p>Veterans benefits information is available in the Office of the Vice President for Student Life.
Each semester recipients of Veterans Administration funds are required to file an Enrollment
Certification in this office, and to report promptly when adding or dropping any courses, as well
as being responsible for any overpayments made by the V.A.

<h3><a name="Student Privacy Rights">Student Privacy Rights</a></h3>
<h4>Background Information</h4>
The primary purpose of The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 is to grant
college students "the right to inspect and review any and all official records, files and data directly
related to them," and generally to deny access by others without written consent of the student
except in limited and specified circumstances.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4>Definitions and Procedures</h4>
Included with the coverage of the Act is any person who is or was enrolled in Manhattan as a
student (including full time and part time undergraduate and graduate students, day and evening).

<p>In compliance with and subject to the provisions of this legislation and the College's Statement on
the Confidentiality of Student Records, the College will make available to each student the
College's official records, files and data falling within the scope of the Act to each student for his
or her personal review and inspection. Specifically excluded from the definition are: personal
notes of teachers, supervisors and administrators which are retained in their possession and are
not accessible to others except substitutes; medical and psychiatric records except that these
records may be reviewed by a physician or other professional of the student's choice; the Parent's
Confidential Statement; letters of recommendation placed in the file before January 1, 1975; and
campus security records.

<p>Students wishing to inspect and review any of their official records and material contained therein
should file a request in writing with the Registrar. Forms for such requests-in-writing will be made
available. All proper requests will be complied with as soon as reasonably possible, but no later
than forty-five days of the date of the request.

<p>A hearing may be requested by a student to insure that his or her records are not inaccurate,
misleading, or otherwise in violation of his or her privacy or other rights, to provide an
opportunity for the correction or deletion of any such inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise
inappropriate data contained therein or to challenge the content thereof. An appropriate hearing
procedure has been established by the College and is included in the Statement of Confidentiality
of Student Records.

<p>The Law prohibits the release of material in a student's file without written consent of the student,
except to officials and teachers of the same school, another school where the student intends to
enroll, and certain state and federal officials.

<p>A copy of the Law and a copy of the Statement is available in the Office of the Registrar and the
Office of the Vice President for Student Life.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Security">Security</a></h3>
The Security Department is charged with the responsibility of enforcing all College security
regulations, including the supervision of all campus parking facilities. There are 36 officers who
conduct foot and vehicle patrols of the campus areas 24 hours a day. Being a component of the
Student Life Division, the Security Department actively supports the stated mission of the College
and accepts its responsibility to employ security measures to ensure that our students enjoy their
years at Manhattan in safety and well being.

<h2><a name="Computer Facilities">Computer Facilities</a></h2>
Nine microcomputer laboratories are located on the Manhattan College campus in the Research
and Learning Center, in DeLaSalle Hall, and in Miguel Hall. These laboratories serve various
segments of the student population. The computers housed in these laboratories include
approximately 200 microcomputers (Dell Pentiums, IBM PS Value Points 486DX, PS/2 model
70s, PS/2 model 50s; Macintosh computers; and IBM RS/6000 model 220 workstations).

<p>The campus PC's (IBM compatible) run under the Microsoft Windows operating system.  They
are networked via Ethernet cabling to several Hewlett Packard file servers using the Novell
NetWare operating system.  The local area networks (LANS) provide file sharing, printing
services, and application programs to students, faculty, and staff.  Network services include
Electronic Mail, as well as Internet and World Wide Web access via TCP/IP applications.
Application programs include several DOS/Windows-based math, statistical, and spreadsheet
packages (Maple, Mathcad, SPSS, Quattro Pro, Lotus 123), compilers (Borland Pascal and C++,
Turbo Pascal and C++, Fortran Workbench), database packages (Dbase IV, Paradox, Lotus
Approach) word processing (WordPerfect, AmiPro), and presentation graphics (Freelance
Graphics), as well as department-specific applications. 

<p>The campus-wide network and computing system is being upgraded to enable the college to
deploy data services to students in the residence halls.  This will allow students to connect their
own networkable desktop or notebook computers directly to the campus network via a high
speed data link similar to that found in the computer labs.

<p>A dedicated Web Server is maintained by the Computer Center.  Manhattan College's address is
http://www.manhattan.edu.  The Computer Center also provides on-line support, documentation,
and other services via their homepage: http://www.manhattan.edu/compcent/comppage.html.

<p>The RS/6000 workstations are networked through NFS and TCP/IP and are also a part of
Internet. The fileserver is an IBM RS/6000 model 350 running the AIX operating system. These
workstations are mainly used for graphics and computer-aided design and analysis.

<p>The laboratories are all equipped for overhead projection and many are used as classrooms during
the day. Portable microcomputers with overhead projection capabilities are used by teachers for
demonstration purposes in other classrooms throughout the campus, many of which now have
links to the school network as well as the Internet.

<p>Manhattan College also has a DEC-VAX 8350 running the VMS operating system with BASIC,
FORTRAN, C, COBOL, Ada, and Pascal compilers. Also available on the VAX are SCSS,
TCP/IP, LYNX, GOPHER and READNEWS. The VAX computer which is linked to the Internet
is housed in the Research and Learning Center (RLC) with terminals across the campus and VAX
line printers in both the RLC and the CIS Labs.

<h2><a name="Libraries">Libraries</a></h2>
The Manhattan College Libraries include the Cardinal Hayes Library, the Grover Hermann
Engineering Library and the Sonntag Library, both in the Leo Engineering Building, and the
Chemistry Library in Hayden Hall. Additionally, Manhattan College students have full access to
the books and journals of the Elizabeth Seton Library of the nearby College of Mount Saint
Vincent.

<p>Manhattan College Libraries provide support for the study, instructional, and research needs of
the students, faculty, and staff of the college.  The combined library facilities of Manhattan
College contain approximately 200,000 volumes, 1,500 journal, magazine, and newspaper
subscriptions as well as additional materials in other formats such as microforms, audiovisuals,
and computer software.  Access to the Libraries' resources is available through PALS, a
cooperative online catalog, which also includes the holding of approximately eighteen academic
and public libraries participating in the regional WALDO consortium.  PALS databases and
selected CD-ROMs can index many periodicals in many fields of study, and a user can very often
procure a full-text copy of an article through the ProQuest document delivery service.  Public
access computers and the libraries homepage offer a gateway to the World Wide Web and other
Internet resources both locally and internationally.  Manhattan College Libraries students and
faculty also have access to the library resources of New York City and Westchester County by
utilizing the interlibrary loan and on-site use arrangements of METRO, a regional library service
network.

<p>The Hayes and Engineering libraries have reference librarians available most hours of service to
assist students in the use of the libraries and resources.

<h2><a name="Arts"><a href="htttp://www.manhattan.edu/arts/arts.html">Arts</a></a></h2>
Since its founding, Manhattan College has sought to broaden the intellectual horizons of its
students and to prepare them for the various professions. Today, Arts continues the College's
tradition through its core curriculum and its sixteen major concentrations. The faculty of Arts
seeks to provide students with skills of analysis and criticism that are central to an understanding
of the contemporary world, to provide the informational base for that understanding, and to
prepare individual men and women with the flexibility essential for effective professional
development in a rapidly changing society.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>The Curriculum</h3>
The faculty of Arts has adopted a program of education that will provide students with the
opportunity for a life of continuing growth and development in the twenty-first century. The core
of the program is entitled THE ROOTS OF LEARNING. Its development was supported by a
generous grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities.

<p>Foundation courses include composition, foreign language, computer science, science, and
mathematics. Students then proceed to studies of the modern age through humanities and the
social sciences. The program is structured to provide a common learning experience for all
students in Arts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="The Core: The Roots of Learning">The Core: The Roots of Learning</a></h3>
The Roots of Learning represents a commitment to an educational program that judiciously
combines content and process. The program seeks to

<ul>
  <li>equip students with the intellectual skills essential to a productive professional life of learning
and leadership;</li>
  <li>inculcate in students the traditions of humanism, the sciences, and the social sciences;</li>
  <li>provide the global perspective essential to living and growing in our ever smaller, but
increasingly complex world; and</li>
  <li>develop critical reasoning and analytical skills through an intensive study of fundamental texts.</li>
</ul>

<p>First-year students enroll in the "Classical Origins of Western Culture" and in the "Global Origins
of U.S. Society." "Classical Origins" is specially designed to engage students in a consideration of
the examined life through readings of Greek, Roman, and related texts, and provides a foundation
for an understanding of the contemporary world.

<p>"Global Origins," through examination of the many peoples that make up U.S. society, is
designed to prepare students for life in an increasingly multicultural society. Reading the literature
of different ethnic groups enables students to imagine the world through the eyes of others. The
course devotes particular attention to the ways in which race, class, gender, and ethnicity affect
both individuals and social structures.

disciplines. Each student in Arts selects a major field of study. It is chosen on the basis of the
individual's interests, educational and career goals, and abilities. Double majors are possible with
careful planning.

<p>In Arts the areas of specialization from which a student selects a major include the following
fields: communications, economics, English, fine arts, government, history, modern foreign
languages (French and Spanish), philosophy, psychology, religious studies and sociology.

<p>In addition, several <a name="interdisciplinary majors">interdisciplinary majors</a> are available to students in Arts. These programs are
designed to enhance a student's knowledge of a particular area of study not easily confined to a
traditional academic department and to help the student develop an ability to address multiple
perspectives. The interdisciplinary programs currently offered in Arts are international studies,
peace studies and urban affairs.

<p>Students wishing to pursue a career in fine arts may do so under a cooperative agreement with the
National Academy of Design School of Fine Arts, 5 East 89th Street, New York, N.Y. This is one
of the finest and oldest art schools in the country dedicated to the training of professional artists.
See p.182 for specific requirements.

<p>Requirements for the major fields are listed under the department or program. Students generally
do not take more than 42 credits in their major without the permission of the Department Chair
and the Dean. There is an 18-credit residency requirement in the major for all transfer students.
Students are encouraged to develop a minor or a cluster.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Minor Fields of Study">Minor Fields of Study</a></h3>
Minors may be earned in most departments of Arts. In each department, the minimum grade
requirements for the minor are the same as those for the major. A minor ordinarily consists of 15 
credits. All courses used to satisfy the requirements for a minor must be taken at Manhattan
College.

<p>Students in Arts may earn a general minor in Business by completing the following five courses:
Economics 201 (Principles and Policies I: Macroeconomics); Finance 306 (Corporate Financial
Management I); Accounting 203 (Elementary Accounting); Marketing 201 (Essentials of
Marketing); and Management 201 (Introduction to Management). 

<p>Students in Arts may also pursue specific minors in Accounting, Computer Information Systems,
Finance, Management, and Marketing in the School of Business and a general Education minor
without state certification in the School of Education.   Students must earn a grade of C or better
in all courses taken for the minor.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Clusters">Clusters</a></h3>
Students in all five schools are invited to use their electives to form a cluster of five courses from
various departments that focus on a common theme. The School of Arts offers clusters in Law,
American Studies, Pan-African Studies, Latin-American and Caribbean Area Studies, Women's
Studies, and Roman Catholic Studies.

<p>Information on the courses and on the requirements are available from the Cluster Coordinators:
Dr. Stephen Leinen (Law); Dr. George Kirsch (American Studies); Dr. Winsome Downie
(Pan-African Studies); Dr. Rosita Marcello (Latin-American and Caribbean Area Studies); Dr.
Mary Ann O'Donnell (Women's Studies); and Br. Robert Berger (Roman Catholic Studies).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Electives">Electives</a></h3>
Most programs in Arts include the opportunity for a student to select particular electives to meet
individual needs. Often elective courses are selected on the basis of their relationship to the
student's major field of study; they also enable students to develop a minor field of study, to
structure a second major, or to explore new areas of knowledge. Electives should not be selected
without serious consideration. Students are advised to consult regularly with their advisors
concerning their electives.

<p>Students may take up to fifteen credits in Business, Education, or Engineering. Any courses taken
in these programs must be approved by the appropriate chairperson in Business, Education, or
Engineering. Students interested in exercising any of these options must consult with the
Academic Advisor in the School of Arts.

<p>Please note: Credits earned in Aerospace Studies may not be used for any degree program in Arts
except Peace Studies. Students may not take more than three credits in health and physical
education courses.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><strong></strong><a name="Student Course Load">Student Course Load</a></h3>
Students may not take more than eighteen credits in the Fall or the Spring semester without the
written approval of the Dean of Arts. Students may not take more than three credits in the
January or May intersession or the summer session without the written approval of the Dean of
Arts.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Bachelor of Science in General Studies">Bachelor of Science in General Studies</a></h3>
The curriculum for the degree program in General Studies is an alternative to the usual
undergraduate curriculum. It features an area of concentration rather than a major, and three areas
of lesser concentration. Consequently, there is less specialization, but opportunity for broader and
more structured general education. This curriculum is designed to meet the educational needs of
special groups of students and requires special advising. Each program provides core
requirements in English, fine arts, history, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, religious studies,
and sociology as a foundation for self-enrichment, appreciation and understanding. The basic core
requires forty-eight credits, including nine credits in religious studies, six of which must be
electives at the 300 and 400 level.

<p>A student will be required to take one area of concentration (a minimum of eighteen credits
beyond the core curriculum) in one of the following areas: economics, English, government,
history, mathematics and computer science, philosophy, psychology, religious studies, and
sociology.

<p>In addition, a student must follow three areas of lesser concentration (a minimum of twelve
credits each beyond the core curriculum) in fields other than the area of greater concentration.
The balance of the program will include electives. A student's program should not include
electives that exceed twenty-four credits in the field of greater concentration or eighteen credits in
the fields of lesser concentration.

<p>Fields of lesser concentration may be selected from the following areas: business, economics,
English, government, history, mathematics and computer science, philosophy, psychology,
religious studies, and sociology.

<p>Students should avail themselves of the services of the Office of the Dean in Arts to ascertain that
all requirements for normal progression in their selected fields of concentration are satisfied.
<h3><a name="Academic Advising">Academic Advising</a></h3>
All freshmen and those sophomores who have not yet declared a major are advised by the
Academic Advisor for the School of Arts. Students who have chosen their major are advised by
the Chairperson of their department or his or her delegate. Transfer students plan their first
semester with the Academic Advisor; validation students are advised by the counselors in the
Validation Program. In addition, Freshmen take First-Year Seminar (LLRN 111), a nine-week
course designed to help students acquire the skills necessary for academic success.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Foreign Study Opportunities">Foreign Study Opportunities</a></h3>
Arts encourages students to broaden their educational horizons by participating in foreign study
programs. In order to participate in such a program, often referred to as a "Junior Year Abroad,"
a student must have a minimum cumulative index of 2.75.

<p>Arts is affiliated with the American Institute for Foreign Study and is also associated with the
Institute for European Study and its campuses world-wide. Foreign study opportunities are
available in many countries.

<p>Further information is available through the Coordinator for International Programs, Professor
Nevart Wanger. All foreign study programs must be approved by the Office of the Dean of Arts
after consultation with the Coordinator for International Programs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Policy for Off-Campus Courses">Policy for Off-Campus Courses</a></h3>
Once a student is admitted to Manhattan College, all major and minor department courses and all
Core Curriculum courses must be taken at Manhattan College. Certain approved non-resident
programs would be exceptions to this requirement. Under unusual circumstances, courses may be
taken at another college, with the approval of the Dean, after consultation with the Chairperson of
a student's major department. When a student achieves Junior status, he or she may not take
off-campus courses at a two-year college.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Honor Societies and Research Opportunities">Honor Societies and Research Opportunities</a></h3>
The faculty of Arts, in order to encourage and reward the development of serious scholarship
among its students, has established on campus a number of national honor societies. Chief among
these are Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi.

<p>Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, is dedicated to the ideal of excellence in scholarship in the
liberal arts and sciences and is widely regarded as a mark of the highest distinction. The
Manhattan College Chapter, the Upsilon of New York, was chartered in 1971. Students elected to
Phi Beta Kappa are chosen from among those students who have achieved general scholastic
excellence.

<p>Sigma Xi is a national honor society founded in 1886 that encourages original research in the pure
and applied sciences. Students are elected to membership on the basis of their accomplishments in
research and their enthusiasm for continued scientific investigation.

<p>In addition, most academic departments sponsor local chapters of national honor societies in their
disciplines. A list of these may be found on p 25.

<p>The faculty are dedicated to encouraging student research efforts and are pleased to have students
join them in their own research. Indeed, one of the hallmarks of Manhattan College is the
frequency with which students and faculty join together in research projects.

<p>Independent study courses are available in most departments for students seeking the opportunity
to do advanced-level study with a faculty member. In addition, many departments also sponsor
supervised internships and field-study opportunities through the department or through the
Cooperative Education Program.

<p>Of special note are the Branigan Scholars Grants. These grants, established in 1967 through the
generous contributions of Edward Vincent Branigan '40 with matching gifts from major
corporations and support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, provide summer
stipends for students pursuing research projects independent of their course work.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Honors Enrichment Program">Honors Enrichment Program</a></h3>
The Honors Enrichment Program offers qualified students the opportunity to extend their
education beyond the usual boundaries of the classrooms, laboratories, and libraries through the
rich cultural offerings of New York City and through close participation in research activities with
faculty and other students.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Cooperative Education">Cooperative Education</a></h3>
Opportunities for off-campus work experiences that carry course credit toward graduation are
available to juniors and seniors in the School of Arts through the Cooperative Education Program. 

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Graduate Awards and Fellowships">Graduate Awards and Fellowships</a></h3>
Manhattan College is among a small, select group of American Colleges sending large numbers of
students on to graduate schools. To continue this tradition, Arts has developed programs to assist
students seeking information about graduate programs and particularly about fellowships and
scholarships for graduate study. Further information is available from Brother Peter Drake,
Graduate School Advisor in Career Services and Cooperative Education, and from the
departmental chairpersons.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Prelegal Advisory Committee">Prelegal Advisory Committee</a></h3>
Students interested in entering law school may receive information and guidance through the
Prelegal Advisory Committee. In addition to personal interviews, the Committee conducts group
meetings to advise students on specialized fields of law. The Committee also makes information
available on requirements for admission to law schools, the availability of scholarships, and special
opportunities in the legal profession. Further information is available from Professor June Dwyer
of the Department of English.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Health Professions Advisory Committee">Health Professions Advisory Committee</a></h3>
The Health Professions Advisory Committee is a body of faculty members from several schools
who give guidance to students interested in preparing for careers in medicine, dentistry and allied
fields. The Committee advises students on the selection of programs of study that will furnish
them with specialized pre-professional courses in the sciences and with a broad liberal education
to prepare them for effective participation in the human community. Further information is
available from the Office of the Chairperson of the Health Advisory Committee, Dr. William
Tramontano.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Preparation for Medicine and Dentistry">Preparation for Medicine and Dentistry</a></h3>

<h2><a name="Science"><a href="http://www.manhattan.edu/science/scipage.html">Science</a></a></h2>

The most recent manifestation of Manhattan College's commitment to Science education was the
establishment of the School of Science in 1993. While maintaining its traditional ties with the
School of Arts, the School of Science will serve to assure the continuation of Manhattan's
tradition of excellence in Science education -- a tradition which is reflected in the success of
Manhattan's Science graduates and has led to Manhattan's membership in the Oberlin Group, a
select number of colleges recognized as one of the nation's most important sources of
professional scientists.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Curriculum">Curriculum</a></h3>
Undergraduate studies in the Sciences are most challenging but provide an almost unique
opportunity to learn and develop problem-solving and analytical skills while gaining a deeper
understanding and appreciation of physical laws and their applications. The choice of a Science
major is based upon the individual's interests, educational and career goals, and abilities. Majors
may be chosen from several areas: biology, biochemistry, chemistry, computer science,
mathematics, physics. Elective components of the major curricula provide the opportunity to
explore other areas of interest, enhance knowledge in a specialized area of the major, or to
construct minor sequences in other disciplines. Minors may be earned in all of the departments of
the School of Science. At Manhattan, our Science curricula contain a strong core component in
the Arts to provide a foundation for our graduates to contend with the humanistic and ethical
issues they will face after graduation. Once a student is admitted to Manhattan College, all major,
minor, and Core courses must be taken at Manhattan College. Certain non-resident courses, with
the approval of the Dean and major department Chairperson, may be exceptions to this
requirement. Under unusual circumstances, and with the approval of the Dean after consultation
with the Chairperson of the student's major department, courses may be taken at another College.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Honor Societies and Research Opportunities">Honor Societies and Research Opportunities</a></h3>
A number of national honor societies have been established on campus in order to encourage and
recognize the achievements of Manhattan College students.

<p>Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, is dedicated to the idea of excellence in the liberal arts and
sciences. The Manhattan College chapter, the Upsilon of New York was established in 1971.
Election to Phi Beta Kappa is generally regarded as a mark of the highest distinction.

<p>Sigma Xi is a national honor society founded in 1896 to encourage research in the sciences.
Students are elected to membership on the basis of their accomplishments in research and their
enthusiasm for continued scientific investigation.

<p>Departments of the School of Science sponsor local charters of national honor societies in their
disciplines; Beta Beta Beta (Biology), Pi Mu Epsilon (Mathematics), Sigma Pi Sigma (Physics).

<p>The Science faculty are dedicated to encouraging student research efforts. Manhattan's small
classes and close student-faculty interactions generate an atmosphere which has produced many
important student-faculty research collaborations.

<h2><a name="Engineering"><a href="http://www.manhattan.edu/engineer/engrpage.html">Engineering</a></a></h2>

<h3>Historical Note</h3>
At its beginning, engineering education at Manhattan developed out of a science program in
coordination with liberal arts. In 1892 civil engineering and electrical engineering were among
four curricula leading to the Bachelor of Science degree. Civil engineering has continued
uninterruptedly since. Electrical engineering, suspended shortly after its introduction, was
re-established as a degree program in 1935. Curricula in mechanical engineering and in chemical
engineering were introduced in 1957 and in 1958 respectively, followed by environmental
engineering in 1993.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Mission</h3>
The mission of the Manhattan College School of Engineering is to prepare students for a
productive and rewarding career in engineering or a related profession.  The curriculum instills the
techniques and skills of engineering design through the study of basic and advanced engineering
science.  This foundation is integrated with practice-oriented engineering design experience which
addresses both technical and non-technical aspects of engineering practice.  Students earning a
Manhattan College engineering degree are prepared to enter the world of professional practice
and to continue their studies through the pursuit of post-baccalaureate education.

<p>The strong foundation coupled with thorough preparation in an engineering discipline ensures that
the student will have life-long access to rapidly developing new technologies and prepares him or
her to be a citizen, an advocate, and a leader in the complex world of the next century.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Engineering Education</h3>
The foundation of the engineering curriculum includes: (1) the study of science representing the
current state of human knowledge of the physical world and its behavior; (2) the study of
mathematics, the language and tool that engineers use to describe the physical world; (3) breadth
of study in the humanities and social sciences, the basis for making ethical and moral engineering
decisions; (4) development of the ability for independent learning and critical thinking; and (5)
development of skills in written, verbal, and graphical communication.

<p>In an age of revolutionary advances in science and technology a re-examination of trends in
engineering education becomes imperative. Accordingly Manhattan's engineering faculty, in
consultation with a distinguished group of engineers and industrial leaders assembled from
engineering-related organizations, the Manhattan College Council on Engineering Affairs, study
and evaluate the concepts of engineering education and the College's program. These studies
have re-emphasized the importance of humanities, mathematics and sciences as the foundation of
engineering education. The engineering curriculum has, therefore, been planned to provide the
sound and broad education required in all branches of engineering.
<h3>Curricula</h3>
The engineering curricula have been designed with two premises in mind: one, that sound
undergraduate engineering education must establish fundamental concepts at the expense of
specialization; and two, that first-line engineering research, development or design requires
post-collegiate specialization and advanced study through graduate work or industrial training,
together with continuing self development.

<p>The engineering curricula are four-year programs and lead to the bachelor of science degree in
one of the traditional branches of engineering: chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical
engineering and mechanical engineering, and a newer area, environmental engineering. Despite the
apparent division of engineering study into these five curricula, there is but one core engineering
curriculum designed to offer the fundamental education required for all engineering students.

<p>The curriculum for the first two years is essentially common to all branches of engineering.
However, in order to enable a student to test his or her interest in one of the major engineering
disciplines, he or she takes designated courses from this discipline in the sophomore year.

<p>The curricula of the various engineering majors in the junior and senior year are outlined at the
end of this section.

<p>Each curriculum offers four areas of study:

<p><strong>Humanities and Social Science Studies:</strong> Courses in this area comprise about one fifth of the
entire curriculum and are conducted throughout the four years. This sequence aims to develop
foundations for the fuller life of the student as a person. Courses in history, literature, philosophy,
social sciences and religious studies blend humanistic and religious knowledge with the scientific
and technological growth of the student so that he or she may progress as a more complete
person toward a satisfying professional life.

<p><strong>Mathematics and the Basic Sciences:</strong> Approximately one quarter of the entire curriculum
provides a thorough grounding in mathematics, at least through differential equations, and the
basic sciences of chemistry and physics through modern physics. These subjects are essential to all
engineering students as the foundation of the engineering sciences.

<p><strong>The Engineering Sciences.</strong> Fundamental concepts of solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, materials
science, electrical systems, and thermodynamics are needed in every engineering field. These
engineering sciences bridge the gap between the basic sciences and engineering practice. They are
as branches of physics and chemistry, taught with continual attention to the engineering method.
They deepen the engineering student's grasp of the known principles of science and develop his or
her competence to employ those principles to synthesize and design engineering systems
illustrative of them.

<p>The fourth area of study is the major field which is described in the following paragraphs.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="The Major">The Major</a></h3>
Although significant specialization is postponed until after the bachelor's degree, some
concentration in Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Environmental or Mechanical Engineering is offered
as a major, comprising about one half of each curriculum. Each student is able to concentrate on
one portion of the engineering sciences in greater depth and to develop proficiency in engineering
design.

<p>The programs in Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Mechanical
Engineering are accredited at the basic level by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the
Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology  The new program in Environmental
Engineering begun in fall 1993, will apply for basic level accreditation in 1997, the earliest
possible opportunity.
<a name="Chemical Engineering">
<p><strong>Chemical Engineering</a>.</strong> Chemical engineering is a broad discipline. A chemical engineer's work
involves the industrial application of the sciences of chemistry, physics, and mathematics, and to
an ever-increasing measure, the science of biology.

<p>A chemical engineer's training permits him or her to work on a diverse range of problems. For
example, to provide alternate energy sources, chemical engineers are working on the development
of processes for converting high sulfur coal to ecologically acceptable gas fuel; chemical engineers
in biochemical engineering work on the design and development of biological processes for the
production of pharmaceuticals; chemical engineers in biomedical engineering work with doctors
on the development of lifesaving artificial organs; others are engaged in the design of new
processes meeting stringent anti-pollution regulations for the manufacture of a host of products
including: chemicals, gasoline, petroleum derivatives, plastics, and fibers.

<p>In order to participate in this wide range of activities, the chemical engineering student at
Manhattan College may select electives providing specialization in:

<ul>
  <li>BIOCHEMICAL ENGINEERING AND PRE-MED</li>
  <li>ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</li>
  <li>MODERN SEPARATION PROCESSES</li>
  <li>POLYMERS AND ADVANCED MATERIALS</li>
</ul>

<p>The chemical engineering program prepares students for professional employment and graduate
study.
<a name="Civil Engineering">
<p><strong>Civil Engineering</a>.</strong> Specific disciplines offered are:

<ul>
  <li>STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING</li>
  <li>ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING</li>
  <li>GEOTECHNIC ENGINEERING</li>
  <li>WATER RESOURCES ENGINEERING</li>
</ul>

<p>These disciplines allow a civil engineer, working to improve the environment, to plan, design and
construct the industrial plants of the world, the great public works, the housing, the bases for
space exploration and the transportation networks.

<p>Structural engineering includes the analysis, design and construction of buildings, bridges, ships,
aircraft and other flight structures. Environmental engineering with its emphasis on water
resources and quality allows a civil engineer to analyze and model the environment, assess the
effects of man's activities on it, and design control facilities to insure improvement and protection
of the quality of our nation's water resources.  Geotechnic engineering investigates the behavior
of various soils and designs adequate supports for all structures resting on the earth and other
planets. Several courses are also offered by the department in the planning and designing of
efficient highways, railroads, airports and other modes of travel, an area of transportation
engineering.

<p>Students obtain a background in each of the above disciplines with one or more specialties. They
are prepared for professional employment and for graduate study.
<a name="Electrical Engineering">
<p><strong>Electrical Engineering</a>.</strong> Wide in scope and variety, electrical engineering ranges from design of
solid state devices and increasingly complex microcircuits to design of communication systems or
large scale power generating equipment and plants to meet society's accelerating demand for
clean energy. The fundamental principles of information processing and control inherent in an
electrical engineer's background find applications in such diverse areas as industry and medicine.

<p>The electrical engineering program emphasizes strength in electric circuits and electromagnetic
theory as a framework for courses in electronics, energy conversion, computers, automation and
engineering systems. Laboratory courses provide design experience, stress principles, methods,
accuracy of measurements and the limitations of electrical instruments and measuring devices.
Senior research and design projects offer opportunities for creative work with personal guidance.

<p>An unusually broad spectrum of electives also enables specialization in:

<ul>
  <li>ANALOG AND DIGITAL ELECTRONICS</li>
  <li>BIOMEDICAL ELECTRONICS</li>
  <li>COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING</li>
  <li>COMPUTER ENGINEERING</li>
  <li>CONTROL SYSTEMS ENGINEERING</li>
  <li>ELECTROSCIENCE</li>
  <li>POWER ENGINEERING</li>
</ul>

<p>Students are prepared for professional employment and graduate study.
<a name="Environmental_Engineering">
<p><strong>Environmental Engineering</a>. </strong>Environmental Engineering is a broad and diverse discipline
involving all phases of the basic sciences including mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics and
computer science. This scientific background is obtained in the freshman and sophomore years
and is followed by the upper class specialty courses which apply the basic sciences to
environmental engineering problems, including: 

<ul>
  <li>ANALYSIS AND CONTROL OF WATER QUALITY    OF LAKES, RIVERS &amp;
ESTUARIES</li>
  <li>MATHEMATICAL MODELING OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES</li>
  <li>TREATMENT PLANT PRINCIPLES AND DESIGN</li>
  <li>ECOLOGY &amp; RISK ASSESSMENT</li>
  <li>ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMISTRY</li>
  <li>AIR POLLUTION &amp; AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS</li>
  <li>HAZARDOUS &amp; SOLID WASTE PRINCIPLES</li>
</ul>

<p>This environmental engineering education prepares the student for positions which focus on the
causes, control, prevention and solutions of environmental problems. The training obtained as an
environmental engineer, permits the planning and design of municipal and industrial water and
wastewater treatment plants, as well as hazardous waste and air pollution control facilities.
Knowledge is gained by analyzing and modeling the earth's water, land and air resources,
assessing the effects of human activities and providing the required engineering and scientific basis
for preserving and improving the quality of our environment.

<p>    Students receive a well-rounded education in environmental engineering and are prepared for
both professional employment and graduate study. 
<a name="Mechanical Engineering">
<p><strong>Mechanical Engineering</a>.</strong> The mechanical engineer is considered the general practitioner in the
engineering profession. Career opportunities exists in such fields as aerospace, automotive,
computer, energy, machinery, manufacturing, and consulting firms. The curriculum is designed to
provide the kind of broad education needed by "general practitioners." Juniors and seniors take
course sequences in two areas: thermal/fluids/energy; and solid mechanics/machine
design/manufacturing. Both areas rely extensively on computer applications. Seniors may
specialize by choosing electives in:

<ul>
  <li>COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN</li>
  <li>COMPUTER-AIDED MANUFACTURING</li>
  <li>THERMAL/ENERGY SYSTEMS</li>
  <li>HEATING, VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING</li>
  <li>NUCLEAR ENGINEERING</li>
</ul>

<p>Course work is complemented by comprehensive laboratories containing a wind tunnel, steam
turbine, automotive engines, refrigeration systems, computer-controlled machine tools, stress and
vibration analyzers, unique low-power nuclear reactors, and computer-based data acquisition
systems. Students also have access to PC laboratories, computer terminals, and advanced
workstations. In the senior year, qualified students are encouraged to use this equipment in
elective project courses. The curriculum prepares the student for professional employment and
graduate study.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>English Requirements</h3>
All students must complete ENGL 110. International students may be required to successfully
complete ENGL 095, ENGL 106 before enrolling in ENGL 110. ENGL 095, ENGL 106 will not
count towards any free elective credit in the program. Students graduating from an American high
school may be required to complete ENGL 106 before enrolling in ENGL 110. The course,
ENGL 106, will not count towards any free elective credit in the program.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Areas of Concentration</h3>
<a name="Computer Engineering."><strong>Computer Engineering.</strong></a> Courses in Computer Engineering, offered under the direction of the
Department of Electrical Engineering, may be taken by students who meet course prerequisites.
The following courses are available: ELEC 229, 230, 435, 436, 441, 464, 508, 520; and in the
Department of Mathematics and Computer Science several courses are also available.

<p>Courses in Computer Applications are also offered by several departments and are open to
undergraduates meeting course prerequisites.

<p>Interested students should consult the Dean of their school for further information regarding
registration.
<a name="Bioengineering">
<p><strong>Bioengineering</a>.</strong> Engineering is applied in many unique ways in medicine and biology, and in the
production of pharmaceuticals, foods, and chemicals by living organisms. The Department of
Chemical Engineering offers a biochemical engineering concentration, and the Department of
Electrical Engineering offers a biomedical electronics concentration. Interested students may
select bioengineering courses for their technical electives and a biology course for their free
elective. Biochemical and biomedical engineering courses include: CHML-425, 427; ELEC 461;
MECH-427, 520.

<p>The Department of Chemical Engineering maintains two fully-equipped laboratories for
experimental research projects in the areas of biochemical engineering and modern separation
processes. The Computer Center includes IBM-RT workstations and networked IBM personal
computers for theoretical research projects in biomedical electronics, e.g., design and analysis of
nuclear magnetic resonance imaging systems. Students have the opportunity to do a senior
research project in bioengineering as an elective course or in lieu of a senior laboratory course.
Registration for senior project requires the approval of a faculty advisor and the departmental
chairperson. Project courses include: CHML 430, 431; ELEC 419, 420, 493, 494; MECH 408,
410.

<p><strong>Interdisciplinary Energy-Environmental Program.</strong> The expenditure of energy in any form
must reflect a careful assessment of the total environmental impact. The apparent conflict between
energy needs and environmental goals poses a problem that can only be solved by understanding
the factors which influence energy demands with minimal damage to the environment.

<p>The objective of this program of study is to provide sufficient information for interested students
to perform assessment and evaluation of those spheres of interaction existing between energy
systems and environmental concerns. To meet such needs, engineering students are encouraged to
select energy and environmental related courses from various departments. These include CHML
435, 436, 437; ENVL 201, 403, 405, 408; ELEC 466; and MECH 426, 433, 434.

<p><strong>Nuclear Engineering.</strong> Power generation using nuclear reactors is an important choice in the face
of the dwindling supply of petroleum and its constantly increasing cost. An understanding of at
least the basics of nuclear power systems, safety, environmental issues, and radioactive waste
management is quite important if an engineer is to be knowledgeable in the field of energy
alternatives. Manhattan College answers this need by offering undergraduate and graduate
courses in Nuclear Engineering. The Nuclear Engineering Laboratory under the Department of
Mechanical Engineering includes a low power critical reactor of the open pool type, a subcritical
water moderated reactor and a subcritical graphite pile reactor. The Laboratory is equipped with
advanced nuclear instruments for monitoring, detecting and analyzing radiation. Undergraduate
courses are: MECH 433, 434.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Engineering Cooperative Education Programs">Engineering Cooperative Education Programs</a></h3>
Civil, electrical and mechanical engineering students may elect the Cooperative Education
Program. The Co-op Program provides work experience in an engineering environment. Students
gain a greater understanding of the engineering profession with this early opportunity to directly
relate their education to practical applications. Following the sophomore year, Co-op students
work full-time for a one-year period before graduation.  Students interested in pursuing the Co-op
Program should consult with the Engineering Cooperative Education Coordinator as early as
possible prior to the Spring term of the sophomore year. A GPA of at least 2.50 is normally
required for participation in the Co-op Program.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Minor Studies">Minor Studies</a></h3>
To provide the engineering student with the opportunity to develop some depth in an area other
than the major, it is possible to minor in a number of programs.

<p>Students may minor in Biology, Business Administration, Computer Science, Chemistry, English,
Government, History, Mathematics, Modern Foreign Languages, Peace Studies, Philosophy,
Physics, Psychology, Religious Studies, and Urban Affairs.

<p>Engineering students may pick up an Application for Minor form in the Office of the Dean of
Engineering. After the form is completed by the department chairperson offering the minor, the
form should be returned to the Office of the Dean of Engineering by the student. When all courses
have been completed, the Dean will notify the Office of the Registrar.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Cooperative 3-2 Program">Cooperative 3-2 Program</a></h3>
Engineering at Manhattan College has cooperative arrangements with several liberal arts Colleges
which enables a student to earn a B.S. degree in liberal arts and a B.S. in engineering degree in
one of the engineering programs after five years of study. The B.S. degree with a major in
chemistry, physics, or mathematics is awarded by the liberal arts college and the B.S. in
engineering degree by Manhattan College. The student spends the first three years of the five year
sequence at the liberal arts college and the final two years in Engineering at Manhattan College.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Transferring from a Community College</h3>
Students who complete a pre-engineering program will generally be permitted to transfer up to 67
credits towards a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree. In accordance with accreditation
principles of the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for
Engineering and Technology, transfer credit will only be permitted for courses in which a grade of
C or higher has been earned.

<p>Students who graduate with an Associate Degree in a technology program will generally only be
permitted to transfer 9 credits towards a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree.

<p>Engineering maintains articulation agreements with many of the community colleges in the
Tri-State area. For further information, please contact the Office of the Dean of Engineering at
(718) 862-7281.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>500-Level Courses</h3>
Students in the Departments of Chemical, Civil, Electrical, Environmental and Mechanical
Engineering who have a grade point average of at least 3.00 or the permission of the department
chairperson can elect to take 500-level courses towards satisfaction of the requirements for the
baccalaureate degree. These courses have been introduced so that students in their senior year will
have the opportunity to study advanced topics which are generally only available to graduate
students. Graduate students will also be enrolled in the 500-level courses. Undergraduate students
who enroll for undergraduate credit will be graded according to the standard undergraduate
grading system, i.e., A, B+, B, C+, C, D, F and the grade will be counted in the undergraduate
grade point average. Tuition for the undergraduates in the 500-level courses will be charged at the
undergraduate rates.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3><a name="Early Admission to Graduate Programs">Early Admission to Graduate Programs</a></h3>
Undergraduate students with minimum grade point averages of 3.00 may apply for permission to
study graduate courses which count towards a Master's degree. Students who have entered
Manhattan College with advanced placement, and/or who took undergraduate courses during
summer sessions will generally be in a position to take graduate courses during their senior year
while completing the requirements for the Bachelor's degree. It may then be possible to obtain a
Master's degree with an additional year of study.

<p>Qualified students can apply for early admission into a graduate program during the Spring
semester of their junior year. Students who are admitted into the graduate program while still
studying for an undergraduate degree may take 500-level courses or 700-level courses. These
courses may count for either undergraduate credit or graduate credit but not for both degree
programs. Students may enroll in 700-level graduate courses providing that the department
chairperson or designee verifies that necessary prerequisite courses have been taken. Courses
taken for graduate credit will not be counted in the undergraduate grade point average. Courses
taken for graduate credit will be charged at the graduate rates.  In addition, if the total number of
credits a student is enrolled for in his senior year does not exceed the number ordinarily required
in the senior year, the cost will be included in the regular full time undergraduate tuition charge.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Academic Standing</h3>
Students are considered to be in good academic standing in Engineering when their Manhattan
College cumulative grade point average for graduation is at least 2.00, their engineering grade
point average is at least 2.00 and their term grade point average is at least 2.00 A student failing
to meet these requirements is placed on <em>warning </em>status. Unsatisfactory performance while on
warning status leads to <em>probation </em>status. Unsatisfactory performance while on probation leads to
an <em>academic performance contract </em>and possible subsequent <em>dismissal.</em> Generally, a student not in
good standing  may not enroll in more than four courses or for more than 14 credits, whichever is
less. Exceptions to this provision require the written permission of an Engineering Academic
Advisor.

<p>A student cannot graduate with more than three D grades in engineering courses. If he/she earns
D grades in more than three engineering courses, he/she must repeat one or more of them, and
earn a grade of C or better. The course(s) to be repeated will be determined in consultation with,
and the approval of an Engineering Academic Advisor.

<p>The following courses are included in the above requirements for students majoring in Chemical
Engineering: CHEM 309, 310, 318, 319, 320 and 328.

<p>Students must earn a grade of C or higher in the basic science and mathematics courses prior to
enrolling in junior or senior engineering courses. If a D grade is received in these courses, the
course must be repeated in the next semester. Grades of C or better are required in CHEM 101,
102. MATH 103, 104, 201, PHYS 101, 102, and 201 prior to taking any 300 level engineering
courses. A grade of C is required in MATH 203 prior to taking any 400 level engineering courses.

<p><strong>Free Elective:</strong> Students majoring in electrical engineering may elect courses from the offerings in
Engineering, Arts, Science, and Business subject to the following exclusion. A course covering a
subject that has already been taken on a more advanced level is not acceptable as a free-elective:
e.g. junior or senior engineering students would not be permitted to elect  MATH 106, Calculus
for Business Decisions.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h3>Humanities and Social Science Requirements</h3>
Studies in humanities and social sciences serve not only to meet the objectives of a broad
education but also to meet the objectives of the engineering profession. Therefore, studies in the
humanities and social sciences must be planned to reflect a rationale or fulfill an objective
appropriate to the engineering profession and to Manhattan College. This rationale and objective
are achieved through the clusters offered by the School of Arts which group courses from various
departments that focus on a common theme.

<p><strong>Students matriculating September 1995 and thereafter </strong>must complete their humanities and
social science requirements by satisfying the requirements of a cluster:

<p>Students must choose five courses (15 credit hours) from<u> <strong>one</strong></u> of the clusters of courses that focus
on a common theme offered by the School of Arts. The five courses chosen shall include no more
than two from any one department and shall otherwise comply with all guidelines to fulfill the
requirements of a cluster. The following clusters are presently defined: Law, American Studies,
Pan-African Studies, Latin-American and Caribbean Area Studies, Women's Studies, and Roman
Catholic Studies. Additional clusters to be added in the future may also be used to satisfy this
requirement subject to approval of the Dean of Engineering.

<p><strong>Students matriculated prior to September 1995 </strong>must complete their humanities and social
sciences requirements in accordance with the following:

<p><strong>One literature </strong>course offered by the Department of English must be completed. <strong>Two courses
